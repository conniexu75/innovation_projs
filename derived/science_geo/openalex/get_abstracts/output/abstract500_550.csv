https://openalex.org/W1541049769,"Human erythropoietin, derived from urine of patients with aplastic anemia, has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The seven-step procedure, which included ion exchange chromatography, ethanol precipitation, gel filtration, and adsorption chromatography, yielded a preparation with a potency of 70,400 units/mg of protein in 21% yield. This represents a purification factor of 930. The purified hormone has a single electrophoretic component in polyacrylamide gels at pH 9, in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate at pH 7, and in the presence of Triton X-100 at pH 6. Two fractions of the same potency and molecular size, by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, but differing slightly in mobility at pH 9, were obtained at the last step of fractionation. The nature of the difference between these two components is not yet understood."

The innermost four strands and two bridging helices are geometrically similar to but are connected in a different way from those in the dinucleotide binding domains found in nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-linked dehydrogenases. Methotrexate is bound in a 15-angstrom-deep cavity with the pteridine ring buried in a primarily hydrophobic pocket, although a strong interaction occurs between the side chain of aspartic acid 27 and N(1), N(8), and the 2-amino group of methotrexate."
https://openalex.org/W2056131194,"The short- and long-term effects of neuroleptic drugs differ both clinically and biochemically. Short-term treatment with such a drug causes a kinetic activation of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase. Long-term treatment causes a prompt activation of the enzyme which is followed by a delayed, compensatory deactivation below control levels. Tolerance also develops to the stimulating effect of haloperidol on striatal dopamine turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1578067645,"We describe here the isolation, purification, and structural characterization of a lipid A precursor synthesized under nonpermissive conditions by a mutant of Salmonella typhimurium conditionally defective in the synthesis of the 3-deoxy-D-mannoctulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate, KDO) region of the lipopolysaccharide. The precursor was isolated free from lipopolysaccharide, murein, and phospholipids by extraction of delipidated cells with 90% phenol/CHCL3/petroleum ether. The molecule was recovered from the phenol phase after precipitation of lipopolysaccharide with H2O and subsequently purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Structural analyses showed that the lipid A precursor is a phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide containing one ester and two amide-linked residues of beta-hydroxymyristate. In contrast to lipid A, the precursor disaccharide lacks ester-linked 12:0 and 14:0 fatty acids as well as KDO. The molecule contains 2 phosphate residues both of which were identified as phosphomonoesters by 31P NMR spectroscopy. One of the phosphomonoesters is located in position 1 of the reducing terminal glucosamine residue; the location of the other phosphomonoester was not determined. The structure of the precursor provides strong support for the conclusion that KDO incorporation occurs at an early stage in lipid A biosynthesis prior to the incorporation of ester-linked saturated fatty acids."

The waveform of action potentials recorded concurrently with swimming events shows evidence of electrotonic coupling between these neurons, which are also directly photosensitive and receive excitatory synaptic input from other conduction systems."
https://openalex.org/W1482951538,"Human kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase has been purified by a procedure involving Lubrol extraction, acetone precipitation, treatment with bromelain, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-150. The final preparation is a glycoprotein (molecular weight of approximately 84,000) composed of two nonidentical glycopeptides (molecular weights of 62,000 and 22,000). The isozymic forms, separable by isoelectric focusing, have different contents of sialic acid. The utilization of L-glutamine (which is both a gamma-glutamyl donor and acceptor) is stimulated about 3-fold by maleate in contrast to 10-fold stimulation of glutamine utilization by the rat kidney enzyme. The gamma-glutamyl analogs, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) and L-azaserine inactivate the human kidney enzyme with respect to its transpeptidase and hydrolase activities. Inactivation is prevented by gamma-glutamyl substrates (but not by acceptor substrates) and is accelerated by maleate. [14C]DON reacts covalently and stoichiometrically at the gamma-glutamyl site, which was localized to the light subunit of the enzyme. The light subunit of human transpeptidase closely resembles that of rat kidney enzyme in having the gamma-glutamyl binding site, and similar molecular weight and amino acid composition. The heavy subunits of the two enzymes are markedly different in both molecular weight and amino acid content; this may account for differences observed in acceptor amino acid specificity and in the magnitude of the maleate effect."

https://openalex.org/W1498049218,"Hepatic microsomal heme oxygenase was solubilized, partially purified, and characterized from Co2+-treated rats. The enzyme on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis exhibited a minimum molecular weight of greater than or equal to 68,000. The solubilized enzyme was totally devoid of contamination with cytochrome P-450 or b5. The requirement for reduced pyridine nucleotides was absolute, and ascorbate could not support heme oxidative activity. However, both TPNH and DPNH could serve as electron donors, with TPNH being more effective. The presence of an appropriate flavoprotein reductase was essential for heme oxidation. The enzyme had an apparent Km of 40 micrometer, a pH optimum of 7.5, and lost substantial activity upon freezing and thawing. Methemoglobin was 30% as effective a substrate for the enzyme as was heme. Free porphyrins could not serve as substrates for the enzyme. The activity of the enzyme was inhibited by HgCl2, p-chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetamide, mercaptoethanol, and dithiothrietol indicating that free -SH group(s) is necessary for enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1499845352,"CDP-diglyceride:inositol transferase, which catalyzes the final step of the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, was solubilized by sodium cholate from microsomes prepared from rat liver and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Addition of phospholipid during the purification and the assay procedures prevented irreversible loss of the enzyme activity to some extent. The resulting preparation was nearly homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recovery of the purified enzyme from the microsomal fraction was 3 to 3.3% with respect to activity and 0.12% with respect to amount of protein. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 60,000. The purified enzyme required exogenous phospholipds for its activity. Various phospholipid classes activated the enzyme rather nonspecifically. The Km for myo-inositol was 2.5 X 10(-3) M and that for CDP-diglyceride was 1.7 X 10(-4) M. The pH optimum was 8.6. The enzyme required Mm2+ or Mg2+ for activity. The optimal concentration of Mn2+ for activation was 0.5 mM, while the activity in the presence of Mg2+ increased up to 20 mM. The enzyme was inhibited by thiol-reactive reagents. There was a competition for inositol by inosose-2 but not by scyllitol."

https://openalex.org/W2074769517,"Neuron cell bodies of Helix pomatia were voltage-clamped with a 300-millisecond depolarizing test pulse (pulse II) delivered 1 second after a depolarizing conditioning pulse (pulse I). The outward current, measured 200 milliseconds after the onset of pulse II, exhibited a strong depression that was dependent on the presence of pulse I. The maximum depression of the pulse II outward current occurred when pulse I voltages lay in the range over which calcium influx is inferred to be greatest; depression of the pulse II current subsided as pulse I potentials approached the putative calcium equilibrium potential. In the presence of extracellular [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or D600, the intensity of the pulse II current became largely independent of pulse I, approaching the values of maximal depression seen in normal Ringer solution. On the other hand, lowering the intracellular pH with extracellular carbon dioxide-carbonate buffer had no measurable effect on the outward currents. Other experiments showed that it is primarily the calcium-dependent, outward-current hump of the N-shaped late current-voltage curve that is depressed by presentation of the conditioning pulse. It was concluded that distinct from an early potassium-activating role, calcium entering during a depolarization leads, during a subsequent depolarization, to a depression of the calcium-activated potassium system that persists for many seconds."

This small phos- pholipase, with 1 histidine and 1 tryptophan residue per molecule, has an absolute requirement for Ca’+, although many divalent metal ions can bind to it. Inhibitory metals include Zn2+, Ba’+, and Sr’+, whereas MnZ+, Mg2+, and Cd’-+ bind without altering enzyme activity. The pH rate profile of the reaction with phosphatidylcholine as substrate shows that Caz+ lowers the apparent p& controlling the reaction (for 10 m,n Ca’+, p& = 5.6; for 0.9 rnx Ca2+, p& = 6.3). The binding of Ca2+ to the enzyme is pa-dependent with pK, = 5.9 and"
https://openalex.org/W1566807090,"Abstract Alkylation of guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) synthetase with the glutamine analogs L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketon) and 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON) inactivated glutamine- and NH3-dependent GMP synthetase. Inactivation exhibited second order kinetics. Complete inactivation was accompanied by covalent attachment of 0.4 to 0.5 equivalent of chloroketon/subunit. Alkylation of GMP synthetase with iodacetamide selectively inactivated glutamine-dependent activity. The NH3-dependent activity was relatively unaffected. Approximately 1 equivalent of carboxamidomethyl group was incorporated per subunit. Carboxymethylcysteine was the only modified amino acid hydrolysis. Prior treatment with chloroketone decreased the capacity for alkylation by iodacetamide, suggesting that both reagents alkylate the same residue. GMP synthetase exhibits glutaminase activity when ATP is replaced by adenosine plus PPi. Iodoacetamide inactivates glutaminase concomitant with glutamine-dependent GMP synthetase. Analysis of pH versus velocity and Km data indicates that the amide of glutamine remains enzyme bound and does not mix with exogenous NH3 in the synthesis of GMP."

The molecular weight of the enzyme, D-erythrodihydroneopterin triphosphate synthetase (GTP cyclohydrolase), has been estimated to be 125,000 by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA-34. The enzyme functions optimally between pH 8.0 and 9.2 and is considerably heat-stable. No cofactors or metal ions have been demonstrated to be required for activity; however, the reaction is strongly inhibited by Cu2+ and Hg2+. GTP is the most efficient substrate, with GDP being 1/17 as active and guanosine, GMP, and ATP being inactive. The Km for GTP has been found to be 14 micrometer. Although the overall reaction catalyzed by D-erythrodihydroneopterin triphosphate synthetase from chicken liver is identical with that from Escherichia coli GTP cyclohydrolase, immunological studies show no apparent homology between the two enzymes."

The molecular weight was estimated by glycerol gradient centrifugation to be 50,000. This enzyme had an optimal activity at pH 7.1 and required a divalent cation in order to catalyze the reaction. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were found to be the preferential divalent cations. The activation energy was estimated to be 19.1 kcal/mol at pH 7.2. Initial velocity study suggested that the reaction followed a sequential mechanism. Mg2+ ATP had a Km of 0.25 mM and dTMP had a Km of 40 micrometer. The enzyme was unstable even at 4 degrees. In the presence of ATP or dTMP the enzyme maintained its activity. Purine triphosphate nucleosides were found to be better phosphate donors than the pyrimidine triphosphate nucleosides. ATP and dATP had a lower Km and a higher Vmax than GTP and dGTP. dTMP was the only preferred phosphate receptor among all the monophosphate nucleotides tested dTTP and IdUTP competed with both substrates and inhibited the reaction with a Ki of 0.75 mM and 1.1 mM, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1620739441,"The role of coenzyme in determining intracellular contnet of pyridoxal enzymes was assessed by analyzing effects of pyridoxine deficiency on the rapidly degraded, readily dissociable tyrosine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5) and the slowly degraded, nondissociable alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2) of rat liver. Synthesis of the tyrosine enzyme was reduced, leading to a decreased amount of this enzyme, much of which was present as active apoenzyme. Synthesis of alanine aminotransferase was unchanged but much of this enzyme was present as an inactive apoenzyme which retained immunological reactivity. Degradation rates of both enzymes (t1/2 about 1.5 h, tyrosine aminotransferase; about 3 days, alanine aminotransferase) were not changed in pyridoxine deficiency. Hence, interaction with coenzyme is not a significant determinant in intracellular degradation of these aminotransferases. Coenzymes dissociation and intracellular stability probably reflect structural features of the proteins which determine both properties."

https://openalex.org/W934991181,"Tyrosine hydroxylase is synthesized de novo in rat superior cervical ganglia in organ culture. The differential rate of synthesis is not increased significantly by the addition of nerve growth factor to the culture. Prior administration of nerve growth factor in vivo, however, leads to an augmented synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase in ganglia subsequently cultured in vitro. The differential rate of tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis was increased by a factor of between 3 and 4. Increases in the differential rate of synthesis were detected within 6 h; the rate reached a maximum 24 to 36 h after a single injection of nerve growth factor. Administration of actinomycin D or of nerve growth factor antibody in vivo prevented the nerve growth factor-induced increase in the differential rate of tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis in vitro. However, the increase in the synthetic rate of tyrosine hydroxylase was not prevented by the addition of actinomycin D to the culture."
https://openalex.org/W1594345646,Abstract Reconstitution of purified demolybdosulfite oxidase from rat liver has been achieved using inorganic molybdate as the source of molybdenum. The activation process has a pH optimum of 7.4 and is dependent on concentrations of molybdate and demolybdoenzyme. The reaction is inhibited by high concentrations of anions and by reduction of the demolybdoenzyme and requires incubation temperatures higher than 30 degrees. A reconstitution mechanism involving loss of tungsten and concomitant replacement with molybdenum in those demolybdo molecules which contain tungsten is supported by the following observations: (a) the extent of activation achieved by molybdate corresponds to the proportion of molecules in the preparation which contain tungsten. (b) Incubation of the demolybdoenzyme preparation at 37 degrees in the absence of molybdate results in progressive and concentration-dependent loss of ability to be reconstituted by molybdate and a corresponding but more rapid loss of tungsten from the enzyme. The reconstituted enzyme displays the molybdenum EPR signal characteristic of native enzyme and is inactivated by incubation at 42 degrees in a manner identical to native sulfite oxidase.

The presence of a nicotinic acidcontaining component was confirmed by incorporation of [‘%Jnicotinic acid into urocanase during growth of a nicotinic acid auxotroph of Pseudomonas putida. Treatment of this purified [ ‘Wurocanase with perchloric acid released a nicotinic acid-containing cofactor which was subsequently determined to be NAD+ by electrophoresis and enzymatic analysis. Incorporation of tritium upon NaB”H, reduction of urocanase, microbiological analysis for nicotinic acid, and the specific radioactivity of [“Clurocanase all supported a stoichiometry of 1 mol of NAD+ boundlmol of native enzyme. The necessity of using denaturing conditions to remove enzyme-bound NAD+ indicated that the NAD+ is very tightly bound. The principal criteria employed earlier for the identification of cu-ketobutyrate as a prosthetic group in urocanase (George, D. J., and Phillips, A. T. (1970)5. Biol. Chem. 245, 52%537), namely similar chromatographic and electrophoretic properties for cy-hydroxybutyrate and “H material isolated from urocanase after NaB:‘H, reduction and acid hydrolysis, were shown to be unable to distinguish between these compounds and nicotinic acid, thereby accounting for the incorrect conclusion that cu-ketobutyrate was an essential cofactor. Present results indicate that NAD+ is a functional coenzyme in urocanase and thus raise the possibility that catalysis proceeds through an internal oxidation-reduction mechanism."

The enzyme was further purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration. With chromosomal-bound histones as substrates, the enzyme methylated only the lysyl residues in histones H3 and H4. The ratio of N epsilon-mono-: N epsilon-di-: N epsilon-trimethyllysine in histone H3 was 1.8:1.0:0.45 and the ratio of N epsilon-mono-: N epsilon-dimethyllysine in histone H4 was 0.7:1.0. The enzyme loses specificity with soluble histones as substrates; however, histones H3 and H4 were still the best methyl acceptors. The pH optima for the enzyme with soluble histones H3 and H4 as substrates were 8.2 to 8.7 and 7.2 to 8.0, respectively. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine, one of the products of the reaction, was a competitive inhibitor with respect to S-adenosyl-L-methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1528268137,"The Mg2+ATPase activity of liver plasma membranes decreases markedly with increasing temperature above 30 degrees. This negative temperature dependency is counteracted by the binding of wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A, or Ricinus communis agglutinin (at concentrations greater than or equal 0.5 mg/ml) to membranes prior to assay of the enzyme. With one of these lectins bound, the enzyme has a single energy of activation between 20 degrees and 45 degrees. The binding of dimeric succinyl concanavalin A, soybean agglutinin, fucose-binding lectin from Lotus tetragonolobus, or the leucoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris does not alter the temperature dependency of the enzyme. The latter two lectins, however, do prevent the concanavalin A-induced activation of the enzyme at 37 degrees. At saturating substrate concentrations, the enzyme is not inhibited by any of the lectins tested over a wide range of concentrations. Cytochalasin B and colchicine separately or in combination have little influence on the lectin-induced enhancement of enzyme activity. Chlorpromazine and vinblastine sulfate each partially prevent the activation and in combination do so completely. Treatment of the membranes with the detergent Lubrol-PX or phospholipase A prevents activation of the enzyme by concanavalin A. The results are consistent with a restriction by the lectin of an environment which is normally too disordered for maximal enzyme activity above 30 degrees."

https://openalex.org/W1525336079,"The pH-dependent dissociation of porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (L-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) has been further characterized using the technique of sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation. The increased rate and specificity of the inactivation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide has been correlated with the pH-dependent dissociation of the enzyme. Data obtained using NAD+ and its component parts to reassociate the enzyme and also to protect the enzyme from inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide suggest that the sulfhydryl residues being modified by N-ethylmaleimide are inaccessible when the enzyme is in its dimeric form. A dissociation curve for the pH-dependent dissociation suggests that a limited number of residues are being protonated concomitant with dissociation of the enzyme. An apparent pKa of 5.3 has been determined for this phenomenon. Studies using enzyme modified by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide indicate that selective modification of essential sulfhydryl residues alters the proper binding of NADH."

https://openalex.org/W1560530645,"A kinetic analysis of the incorporation of AMP into tRNA lacking the 3'-terminal residue by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (EC 2.2.7.25) from Escherichia coli is presented. Initial velocity studies demonstrate that the mechanism is sequential and that high concentrations of tRNA give rise to substrate inhibition which is noncompetitive with respect to ATP. In addition, the substrate inhibition is more pronounced in the presence of pyrophosphate, which suggests the formation of an inhibitory enzyme-pyrophosphate-tRNA complex. Noncompetitive product inhibition is observed between all possible pairs of substrates and products. ADP and alpha,beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate are competitive dead end inhibitors of ATP, while the latter is a noncompetitive dead end inhibitor of the tRNA substrate. A nonrapid equilibrium random mechanism is proposed which is consistent with these data and offers an explanation for the noncompetitive substrate inhibition by tRNA."
