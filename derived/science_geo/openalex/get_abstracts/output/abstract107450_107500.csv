https://openalex.org/W2048139403,"Deletion of the promoter and the first exon of the DNA polymerase β gene (pol β) in the mouse germ line results in a lethal phenotype. With the use of the bacteriophage-derived, site-specific recombinase Cre in a transgenic approach, the same mutation can be selectively introduced into a particular cellular compartment-in this case, T cells. The impact of the mutation on those cells can then be analyzed because the mutant animals are viable."
https://openalex.org/W2030336958,"Helicobacter pylori is associated with development of gastritis, gastric ulcers, and adenocarcinomas in humans. The Lewis(b) (Le(b)) blood group antigen mediates H. pylori attachment to human gastric mucosa. Soluble glycoproteins presenting the Leb antigen or antibodies to the Leb antigen inhibited bacterial binding. Gastric tissue lacking Leb expression did not bind H. pylori. Bacteria did not bind to Leb antigen substituted with a terminal GalNAc alpha 1-3 residue (blood group A determinant), suggesting that the availability of H. pylori receptors might be reduced in individuals of blood group A and B phenotypes, as compared with blood group O individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1502820594,"Amyloid beta-protein (A beta), the 40-43-amino acid polypeptide that is the principal constituent of senile plaques found in Alzheimer's disease, is constitutively produced and released into medium of cultured cells by an unclear mechanism. In this study, we report that one route of A beta generation involves the internalization of cell surface amyloid precursor protein (beta PP) via the coated pit-mediated endocytic pathway. Radiolabeled A beta can be recovered in medium following selective cell surface radioiodination, indicating that cell surface beta PP is a direct precursor to A beta. In addition, deletion of the cytoplasmic domains of beta PP or depletion of potassium in medium, both of which resulted in reduced beta PP internalization, significantly diminished A beta release. Moreover, pulse-chase experiments after surface radioiodination showed that the kinetics of beta PP secretion and A beta release was different, with the latter occurring at a significantly slower rate. We therefore hypothesize that the internalization of cell surface beta PP via coated pit-mediated endocytosis is one pathway leading to A beta generation and release into medium."
https://openalex.org/W2057894015,"The SWI/SNF protein complex is required for the enhancement of transcription by many transcriptional activators in yeast. Here it is shown that the purified SWI/SNF complex is composed of 10 subunits and includes the SWI1, SWI2/SNF2, SWI3, SNF5, and SNF6 gene products. The complex exhibited DNA-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, but lacked helicase activity. The SWI/SNF complex caused a 10- to 30-fold stimulation in the binding of GAL4 derivatives to nucleosomal DNA in a reaction that required adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis but was activation domain-independent. Stimulation of GAL4 binding by the complex was abolished by a mutant SWI2 subunit, and was increased by the presence of a histone-binding protein, nucleoplasmin. A direct ATP-dependent interaction between the SWI/SNF complex and nucleosomal DNA was detected. These observations suggest that a primary role of the SWI/SNF complex is to promote activator binding to nucleosomal DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2060320549,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are expressed constitutively in only a few cell types, but they can be induced in the majority of them, in particular by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The MHC class II transactivator gene CIITA is defective in a form of primary MHC class II deficiency. Here it is shown that CIITA expression is controlled and induced by IFN-gamma. A functional CIITA gene is necessary for class II induction, and transfection of CIITA is sufficient to activate expression of MHC class II genes in class II-negative cells in the absence of IFN-gamma. CIITA is therefore a general regulator of both inducible and constitutive MHC class II expression."

https://openalex.org/W2084403120,"Closely linked repeats of a Drosophila P transposon carrying a white transgene were found to cause white variegation. Arrays of three or more transgenes produced phenotypes similar to classical heterochromatin-induced position-effect variegation (PEV), and these phenotypes were modified by known modifiers of PEV. This effect on the repeated transgenes was much stronger for a site near centric heterochromatin than it was for a medial site, and it strengthened with increasing copy number. Differences between variegated phenotypes could be accounted for if different topological structures were generated by pairing between closely linked repeat sequences. We propose that pairing of repeats underlies heterochromatin formation and is responsible for diverse gene silencing phenomena in animals and plants."
https://openalex.org/W2063856790,"It is thought that DNA replication and mitosis in yeast are triggered by oscillations in the level of G1-specific (CLN1 and CLN2) and G2-specific (CLB1-CLB4) cyclins, which determine the substrate specificity of the CDC28 protein kinase. It is not understood how the time and order of appearance of different cyclin types are determined. We show here that CLB2 proteolysis, which is important for transition from mitosis to G1, is not confined to a narrow window at the end of mitosis as previously thought but continues until reactivation of CDC28 by CLN cyclins toward the end of the subsequent G1 period. Thus, cell cycle-regulated proteolysis prevents accumulation of G2-specific CLB cyclins during G1 and thereby ensures that the CLN-associated forms of the CDC28 kinase are activated without interference from CLB cyclins. Accumulation of CLN cyclins leads to inactivation of CLB cyclin proteolysis, which is a precondition for subsequent activation of G2-specific B-type cyclins."
https://openalex.org/W2085220509,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transactivator protein, termed Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), plays a critical role in the regulation of latent viral transcription and in the immortalization of EBV-infected B cells. Unlike most transcription factors, EBNA2 does not bind directly to its cis-responsive DNA element but requires a cellular factor, termed C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1). Here, CBF1 was purified and was found to directly interact with EBNA2. CBF1 is identical to a protein thought to be involved in immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, RBPJ kappa. Contrary to previous reports, CBF1-RBPJ kappa did not bind to the recombination signal sequences but instead bound to sites in the EBV C-promoter and in the CD23 promoter."

https://openalex.org/W2073313097,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis reveals that homologous chromosomes are paired in yeast cells about to enter meiosis. Pairing involves multiple interstitial interactions, one per approximately 65 kb. These observations exclude several classes of models for somatic/premeiotic pairing. The number of t = 0 pairing interactions is about the same as the number of subsequent meiotic recombination events. As cells enter meiosis, pairing disappears concomitant with DNA replication and then reappears, independent of synaptonemal complex. Mutant phenotypes suggest that formation of an individual meiotic pairing connection does not require a meiosis-specific double-stranded break (DSB). Mutants defective in recombination before or after DSBs exhibit pairing defects. These and other observations can be united by a model in which premeiotic pairing and early meiotic pairing occur by closely related paranemic DNA-DNA interactions between intact duplexes, with early meiotic interactions subsequently converted directly to plectonemic recombination intermediates via DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W1507203601,"The Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger is an important regulator of cellular Ca2+ levels, and one isoform of this transporter, NCX1, has been cloned previously (Nicoll, D.A., Longoni, S., and Philipson, K.D. (1990) Science 250, 562-565). We now report the cloning of a second isoform (NCX2) of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger which was present in a rat brain cDNA library. NCX2 is predicted to code for a protein of 921 amino acids. NCX1 and NCX2 are 61 and 65% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, and are the products of different genes. The genes for NCX1 and NCX2 are located on human chromosomes 2 and 14, respectively. Hydropathy profiles of the two exchangers are very similar. Transcripts of NCX2 are detected in brain and skeletal muscle. NCX2 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity was analyzed electrophysiologically by the giant inside-out, excised patch technique. Outward currents were evoked by the application of Na+ with the exchanger operating in the reversed mode (extracellular Ca2+ exchanging for intracellular Na+). The affinity for Na+ (30 mM) and the current-voltage relationship of NCX2 are similar to those for NCX1. Like NCX1, NCX2 is secondarily regulated by intracellular Ca2+, but the affinity of NCX2 for regulatory Ca2+ (1.5 microM) upon initial application of Na+ is lower than that of NCX1 (0.3 microM). The existence of multiple Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger isoforms may provide flexibility for regulation and expression."

https://openalex.org/W2171233622,"The gene of subtilisin S41, an alkaline protease secreted by the psychrophile Bacillus TA41, encodes for a preproenzyme of 419 amino acids residues. The nucleotide sequence and NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified enzyme indicate that the mature subtilisin S41 is composed of 309 residues with a predicted M(r) = 31,224. Subtilisin S41 shares most of its properties with mesophilic subtilisins (structure of the precursor, 52% amino acid sequence identity, alkaline pH optimum, broad specificity, Ca2+ binding) but is characterized by a higher specific activity on macromolecular substrate, by a shift of the optimum of activity toward low temperatures, and by a low thermal stability. The enzyme also differs by an acidic pI (5.3) and the presence of one disulfide bond. It is proposed that the psychrophilic enzyme possesses a more flexible molecular structure when compared to mesophilic and thermophilic subtilases in order to compensate for the reduction of reaction rates at low temperatures. The model of subtilisin S41 indeed reveals several features able to induce a more flexible, heat-labile conformation: the occurrence of four extended surface loops, a very hydrophilic surface through 11 extra Asp residues, and the lack of several salt bridges and aromatic-aromatic interactions. The low affinity of the Ca1 calcium binding site (Kd(app) = 10(-6) M), resulting possibly from one chelating side chain substitution and the stacking of Gly residues, also reflect a less compact conformation. The difference of free energy of stabilization between subtilisin S41 and a mesophilic subtilisin suggests that the balance of exo- and endothermically formed weak bonds is critical for the enzyme flexibility."

https://openalex.org/W2041372335,"The onset of pattern formation in the developing Drosophila eye is marked by the simultaneous synchronization of all cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These cells will then either commit to another round of cell division or differentiate into neurons. Although cell cycle synchronization occurs in roughex (rux) mutants, cells circumvent G1 and all cells enter S phase, including cells that would normally differentiate. This leads to defects in early steps of pattern formation and cell fate determination. rux is suppressed by mutations in genes that promote cell cycle progression (i.e., cyclin A and string) and enhanced by mutations in genes that promote differentiation (i.e., Ras1 and Star). rux encodes a novel protein of 335 amino acids. We propose that rux functions as a negative regulator of G1 progression in the developing eye."

https://openalex.org/W1567666856,"The degradation of the microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is highly regulated and is dependent on both a sterol and non-sterol derivative of mevalonic acid (MVA). We recently proposed that the non-sterol component is derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), presqualene pyrophosphate, or squalene (Correll, C. C. and Edwards, P. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 633-638). In the current study, we have used digitonin-permeabilized cells to further define this MVA-derived non-sterol component required for the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. The addition of either FPP or farnesol to digitonin-permeabilized cells resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. The effect of FPP, but not farnesol, was blocked by the phosphatase inhibitor sodium fluoride. The enhanced degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in permeabilized cells specifically required farnesol, since the addition of any of the structurally related isoprenoids geraniol, geranyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, nerolidol, or all-cis-farnesol, or of the non-sterol squalene to the permeabilized cells did not stimulate enzyme degradation. The present studies demonstrate for the first time that the accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase can be initiated in vitro. Further, since farnesol is shown to be specifically required for the enhanced degradation of the enzyme in vitro, we propose that this isoprenoid alcohol is important in this process in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557883209,"AtT-20 mouse corticotrope tumor cell lines overexpressing the prohormone convertases PC1 or PC2 were established and used to examine prohormone and prohormone convertase biosynthetic processing. On a molar basis, wild-type AtT-20 cells synthesize about 20% as much PC1 as the endogenous prohormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Kinetic, oligosaccharide, and temperature blockade analyses established that proPC1 is converted to PC1 in the endoplasmic reticulum at a rate independent of the level of PC1 or PC2 expression. In contrast, proPC2 is converted to PC2 primarily in a post-trans-Golgi compartment. PC1 is further shortened from its COOH-terminal end in a post-trans-Golgi compartment in a step that is accelerated at higher levels of PC1 expression, but unaltered by PC2 overexpression. The initial steps in POMC processing are speeded up by overexpression of PC1, and overexpression of PC1 leads to more extensive cleavage of POMC to smaller products. However, even when the rate of PC1 synthesis exceeds that for POMC by 2-fold, PC1 does not cleave the Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys bonds cleaved upon overexpression of PC2."
https://openalex.org/W2026348560,"Here it is shown, with the use of protein-protein photocrosslinking, that the carboxyl-terminal region of the α subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) is in direct physical proximity to the activating region of the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) in the ternary complex of the lac promoter, RNAP, and CAP. These results strongly support the proposal that transcription activation by CAP involves protein-protein contact between the carboxyl-terminal region of the α subunit and the activating region of CAP."
https://openalex.org/W1538490497,"Vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPases are complex heterooligomers that are characterized by a specific inhibition by bafilomycin A1. These enzymes have a peripheral ATP hydrolytic domain as well as a transmembranous sector. The transmembranous sector has been isolated by glycerol gradient centrifugation, and this subcomplex is composed of polypeptides of 116, 39, and 17 kDa. Both this sector and native holoenzyme were reconstituted into potassium-loaded (150 mM KCl) liposomes prepared from pure lipids. When diluted into potassium-free buffer, a valinomycin-induced membrane potential did not drive proton uptake, as assessed by acridine orange quenching. In contrast, pretreatment of both the reconstituted proton pump and isolated transmembranous sector at pH 4.2 activated a latent proton conductance. Bafilomycin A1 (1 nM) inhibited ATP-energized proton pumping catalyzed by the proton pump, as well as membrane potential-driven proton flow through both the acid-activated proton pump and the isolated proton pore. Thus bafilomycin A1 inhibits vacuolar proton pumps by blocking proton conduction through the proton pore, which we term VB."
https://openalex.org/W1576283072,"Iron regulatory factor (IRF) is a cytoplasmic mRNA-binding protein with specificity for iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem-loops. IRF post-transcriptionally regulates intracellular iron levels via binding to IREs in the untranslated regions of ferritin, transferrin receptor, and erythroid 5-aminolevulinic-acid synthase mRNAs. Specific IRE nucleotides are phylogenetically conserved: those of the 6-base loop (5'-CAGUGN-3') and an unpaired cytosine. We prepared a pool of 16,384 IRE molecules randomized at these seven nucleotide positions and employed in vitro selection to identify RNAs that bind human IRF. Two major classes of high affinity RNA ligands were selected; the optimal loop sequences of each are 5'-CAGUGN-3' (wild type) and 5'-UAGUAN-3'. This novel finding predicts base pairing within the IRE loop between positions 1 and 5, thus facilitating the formation of a specific loop structure in which nucleotides at positions 2-4 are made accessible for protein interaction. Nucleotide substitution at these loop positions, or at the position of the bulge cytosine, decreased binding by 36-99%. In addition, we demonstrate a preferred IRE bulge structure and report a striking difference in the RNA binding specificity of rat IRF compared with that of the related IRE-binding protein, IRFB."
https://openalex.org/W1486536093,"Nucleotide sequences of a 7997-base pair SacI fragment spanning 3643 base pairs of the upstream promoter region to exon 4 of the rat cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7) have been determined. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay of the proximal promoter from nucleotides -346 to +36 revealed two protected regions which specifically shifted proteins in rat liver nuclear extracts. Footprint A (nucleotides -81 to -35) contained a cluster of overlapping sequence motifs of TGT3, steroid/thyroid hormone response elements (7 alpha TRE), hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 and 4, and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and has been shown to confer bile acid repression of the CYP7 gene promoter activity. Footprint B (nucleotides -148 to -129) contained a sequence motif HNF4. When footprint A (-101 to -49) or 7 alpha TRE (-73 to -55) sequence was linked upstream to a heterologous SV40 promoter/luciferase plasmid and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, taurodeoxycholate suppressed the SV40 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that one or two bands shifted by the 7 alpha TRE or by a direct repeat sequence in 7 alpha TRE were absent when liver nuclear extracts of deoxycholic acid-treated rats were used. Similar gel shift patterns were also observed when human 7 alpha TRE or human liver nuclear extracts were used. The rat direct repeat sequence interacted with two polypeptides (M(r) = 57,000 and 116,000) in both rat and human liver nuclear extracts. These results suggest that hydrophobic bile acids may suppress the CYP7 gene expression by binding to a bile acid receptor which interacts with and prevents the binding of liver nuclear protein(s) to a bile acid-responsive element and that the core of bile acid-responsive element is a direct repeat."

Here it is shown, in receptor cells from the newt, that odorants can also suppress this current, by a mechanism that is distinct from inhibition and adaptation. Suppression provides a simple explanation for two seemingly unrelated phenomena: the anomalously long latency of olfactory transduction and the existence of an ""off response"" at the end of a prolonged stimulus. Suppression may influence the perception of odorants by masking odorant responses and by sharpening the odorant specificities of single cells."

In the presence of the protein, substrates resembling precursor tRNAs, which were readily cleaved by the catalytic RNA, were selected in addition to others, with different sequences and structures (one of which resembled the precursor to 4.5S RNA) that were not readily cleaved by the catalytic RNA alone. The ribonucleoprotein enzyme is more versatile than the RNA enzyme, and our results suggest that it and 4.5S RNA may have evolved after ancestral tRNAs."

The mutant, expressed in Escherichia coli, eventually aggregated into catalytically active dimers.

https://openalex.org/W1680293007,"Earlier reports showed that at least 3 herpes simplex virus 1 proteins were adenylylated and guanylylated in addition to the infected cell proteins (ICPs) 0, 4, 22, and 27. ICP22 and 27 share the amino acid sequence R/PRAP/SR which is also predicted to be in ICPs 4 and 0 and in the products of the HSV-1 genes UL21, UL31, UL47, and UL49. ICPs 0, 4, 22, and 27 are regulatory proteins, UL21 is dispensable for growth in cultured cells, UL31 co-fractionates with the nuclear matrix, and UL47 may interact stoichiometrically with the alpha trans-inducing factor (VP16, the product of the UL48 gene). To avoid bias, the genes encoding the additional nucleotidylylated proteins were mapped, initially by analyses of intertypic recombinant viruses, and subsequently by analyses of the products encoded by the mapped genome domains. We conclude that (i) the products of UL21, UL31, UL47, and UL49 are nucleotidylylated by [alpha-32P]GTP or [alpha-32P]ATP in isolated nuclei, (ii) this modification does not involve the viral protein kinases encoded by the UL13 and US3 gene products and, (iii) UL49 is a virion protein which is labeled in cells with [32P]orthophosphate and also is ADP-ribosylated."
https://openalex.org/W1571034043,"Rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells express at least three protein kinase C species, conventional PKC alpha (cPKC alpha), novel PKC delta (nPKC delta), and novel PKC epsilon (nPKC epsilon). The stimulation of quiescent 3Y1 cells by serum (or epidermal growth factor (EGF) but not 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) results in the induction of DNA synthesis. Upon stimulation by serum or EGF, endogenous PKC species showed no indication of activation such as translocation or down-regulation, whereas TPA or synthetic diacylglycerol caused activation of all these PKC species when judged by these criteria. The only indication of activation observed upon serum or EGF stimulation was an upward shift in the electrophoretic mobility of nPKC delta. The phosphorylation levels of endogenous PKC members determined by in vivo metabolic labeling experiments revealed increased phosphorylation of both nPKC delta and nPKC epsilon, but only a slight increase for cPKC alpha in response to serum or EGF. On the other hand, TPA caused increased phosphorylation of all three PKC species. Overexpression of these PKC members by introduction of the corresponding cDNA expression plasmids resulted in the enhancement of the cell response to TPA when monitored in terms of transcriptional activation through TPA- or serum-responsive elements. Such enhancement in transcriptional activation by overexpression of cPKC alpha, nPKC delta, or nPKC epsilon was also observed in response to diacylglycerol, indicating that all these PKC species are activated by diacylglycerol in cells. In contrast to these nonphysiological stimuli, serum (or EGF) stimulation of 3Y1 cells that overexpress the respective PKC members revealed a clear difference between cPKC and nPKC, in that overexpression of nPKC delta or nPKC epsilon resulted in a large increase in TPA- or serum-responsive element activation, whereas the overexpression of cPKC alpha increased activation only very slightly. These results indicate that the mitogenic stimulation of quiescent 3Y1 cells results in selective activation of endogenous nPKC members and that the modes of activation of cPKC and nPKC differ from each other."
https://openalex.org/W1594762831,"The first step in the utilization of the xenobiotic chlorinated hydrocarbon 1,2-dichloroethane by Xanthobacter autotrophicus is catalyzed by haloalkane dehalogenase (Dh1A). The enzyme hydrolyses 1-haloalkanes to the corresponding alcohols. This allows the organism to grow also on short-chain (C2-C4) 1-chloro-n-alkanes. We have expressed Dh1A in a strain of Pseudomonas that grows on long-chain alcohols and have selected 12 independent mutants that utilize 1-chlorohexane. Six different mutant enzymes with improved Km or Vmax values with 1-chlorohexane were obtained. The sequences of the mutated dh1A genes showed that several mutants had the same 11-amino acid deletion, two mutants carried a different point mutation, and three mutants had different tandem repeats. All mutations occurred in a region encoding the N-terminal part of the cap domain of Dh1A, and it is concluded that this part of the protein is involved in the evolution of activity toward xenobiotic substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1583532819,"Abstract Human platelet glycoprotein Ib beta (GPIb beta) (M(r) 22,000) is part of the GPIb-V-IX system that constitutes the receptor for von Willebrand factor and mediates platelet adhesion in the arterial circulation. The four members of the receptor (GPs Ib alpha, Ib beta, V, and IX) share structural and functional features. Individually, GPIb beta contributes to surface expression of the receptor and participates in transmembrane signaling through phosphorylation of its intracellular domain. To define the structure of the GPIb beta gene, a cosmid clone from a human genomic library was analyzed. The transcriptional start site was located by both primer extension and the anchored polymerase chain reaction. Similar to the genes for Ib alpha, V, and IX, the Ib beta gene is compact with a single 274-base intron inserted into the 5' end of the open reading frame. The 5'-flanking region of the gene contains both GATA and ets sites that are also found in the 5' promoter regions of other described megakaryocyte/platelet genes. The GPIb beta gene was localized to chromosome 22q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

https://openalex.org/W1545109971,"Abstract AG-->A transition at -78 base pairs from the transcription start site of the apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) gene has been associated with increased apoA-I serum levels in humans. We report here that this mutation (G-->A) increases significantly (5-7-fold) the expression of a reporter gene fused to the apoA-I promoter in human liver and intestine cells. In addition, the presence of A at -78 base pairs from the transcription start site of the gene significantly decreases the binding affinity of a nuclear factor present in liver and intestine cells. We suggest that the reduced affinity of this factor increases the transcription efficiency of the promoter and explains why individuals carrying the A allele have high serum apoA-I levels."

https://openalex.org/W1584161043,"We previously reported the immunopurification of a somatostatin receptor from the human tumoral gastric cell HGT1 using the monoclonal antibody 30F3 (Reyl-Desmars, F., Le Roux, S., Linard, C., Benkouka, F., and Lewin, M. J. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18789-18795). Screening of a lambda gt11 HGT1-cDNA library with 30F3 led us to isolate a cDNA encoding an 86-kDa polypeptide displaying 100% structural identity with the 86-kDa subunit (p86-Ku) of the Ku autoantigen. Recombinant p86 expressed in Escherichia coli cross-reacted with 30F3 and specifically bound [125I-Tyr11]somatstatin-14. Binding was totally displaced by somatostatin-14, somatostatin-28, and SMS 201-995, with IC50 values of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 nM, respectively. In a search for a biological effect associated with binding, we purified a 36-kDa, okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase (protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A)) from rat gastric cytosol. PP2A catalyzed 32P release from p34cdc2-phosphorylated histone H1. However, PP2A-induced 32P release was concentration dependently inhibited by recombinant p86-Ku, with a decrease in maximal velocity without a change in Km. Steric exclusion high pressure chromatography indicated that the inhibition resulted from direct interaction of the enzyme with p86-Ku. Furthermore, it was antagonized by increased concentrations of somatostatin-14 and prevented by preincubating p86-Ku with 30F3. Given the key role played by PP2A in cell cycle regulation, the current findings suggest that p86-Ku could be a physiological target of somatostatin antiproliferative action."
https://openalex.org/W1554375432,"Previously we reported that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is degraded ATP-dependently by the 26 S proteasome in the presence of antizyme (AZ), an ODC inhibitor (Murakami, Y., Matsufuji, S., Kameji, T., Hayashi, S., Igarashi, K., Tamura, T., Tanaka, K., and Ichihara, A. (1992) Nature 360, 597-599). Here we examined the cleavage of ODC by the 26 S proteasome. When ODC purified from ODC-overproducing cells was incubated with the 26 S proteasome and with AZ fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the presence of ATP, ODC was degraded specifically without appreciable breakdown of MBP-AZ. The major degradation products of ODC, which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase column, were identified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The 26 S proteasome generated a variety of short peptides of 5-11 amino acid residues derived from regions throughout the ODC sequence. No detectable amounts of free amino acid residues were produced, indicating endoproteolytic degradation of ODC by the 26 S proteasome. Their major sites for cleavage of ODC by the 26 S proteasome were on the carboxyl sides of neutral/hydrophobic amino acid residues, but a few were on those of acidic or basic amino acid residues. These results demonstrate that the 26 S proteasome causes exhaustive endoproteolysis of the naturally occurring short-lived protein ODC in a multicatalytic and ATP-dependent manner."

We show that the gene roughex (rux) is a dose-dependent regulator of meiosis II during Drosophila spermatogenesis. rux mutant germ cells execute the two meiotic divisions, but then undergo an additional M phase resembling an extra meiosis II. Conversely, germ cells with excess rux function fail to undergo meiosis II. rux does not appear to act directly at meiosis II. Rather, rux appears to act through cyclin A during premeiotic G2 to regulate meiosis II. We propose that cyclin A-cdc2 kinase at the G2 to M transition of meiosis I activates a target necessary for meiosis II, thereby coupling the two meiotic divisions."
https://openalex.org/W1606048505,"The subunits (p28 and p86) of the isoenzyme form of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF-(iso)4F) from wheat were expressed separately in Escherichia coli. The subunits were purified by affinity chromatography (p28) and ion-exchange chromatography (p86). The purified subunits alone did not support polypeptide synthesis in an eIF-(iso)4F and eIF-4F-deficient translation system from wheat germ. However, when the two subunits were mixed together, activity equal to that of the native form of eIF-(iso)4F was obtained. These results show that subunits expressed separately are able to associate and form an enzymatically active complex."
https://openalex.org/W1595246305,"In the ciliated protozoa, the germ line micronucleus carries DNA sequences that are eliminated during the developmental program that produces the somatic macronucleus. We have identified such a micronuclear element in an intron of a gene in the holotrichous ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila. The macronuclear version of this gene, numbered from the transcription initiation site to the polyadenylation site, is 1569 nucleotides long and contains two introns: intron 1 from nucleotides 206 to 382 and intron 2 from nucleotides 665 to 898. The gene is transcribed into a stable polyadenylated mRNA which is predicted to encode a polypeptide with a highly repetitive structure and an unknown function. The micronuclear version of the gene contains a 2.9-kb sequence element, mse2.9, in intron 2. This element was characterized by sequencing two micronuclear genomic clones that contain 909 and 764 base pairs of micronucleus-specific sequence from its left and right ends, respectively. This sequence has an (A+T) content of 81% and is present as a single copy. The termini of mse2.9 are located within a 4-nucleotide direct repeat, TTAT, one copy of which is retained in the macronuclear gene, between positions 755 and 759. Other features near the termini of mse2.9 include a GC-rich sequence motif, CCAACCCGTTG, 31 nucleotides outside the left terminus and a 20-nucleotide palindrome 6 nucleotides outside the right terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1518592420,"Expression of the GTPase-deficient G alpha 16 polypeptide G alpha 16Q212L, a member of the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, constitutively activated phospholipase C beta activity in Swiss 3T3 cells. Expression of G alpha 16Q212L appears to persistently stimulte a low level of protein kinase C activity which also increases protein kinase A activity in Swiss 3T3 cells. Growth of G alpha 16Q212L expressing cells was significantly inhibited relative to wild-type Swiss 3T3 cells. Bombesin-stimulated DNA synthesis was completely inhibited in G alpha 16Q212L expressing clones, whereas the growth responses to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and serum were inhibited 50-80% relative to wild-type cells. In addition to the inhibition of cell growth, G alpha 16Q212L expression significantly inhibited the stimulation of protein kinase C, Raf-1, MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phospholipase A2 activity, and Ca2+ mobilization in response to PDGF. In contrast, PDGF receptor activation of phospholipase C gamma, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Ras GTP loading was similar in wild-type and G alpha 16Q212L expressing clones. PDGF regulation of membrane ruffling and actin fiber assembly, responses mediated in part by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, were unaffected in G alpha 16Q212L expressing clones. The growth inhibitory action of G alpha 16Q212L expression in Swiss 3T3 cells is downstream of the initial SH2 domain-encoded signal transduction proteins regulated in response to PDGF receptor autophosphorylation. The findings demonstrate that constitutively activated G alpha 16Q212L persistently activates phospholipase C activity and effectively inhibits a subset of cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways involved in growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor stimulation of cell growth. G16/Gq-regulated signal transduction can acutely stimulate specific response pathways involved in mitogenesis; but persistent activation of G16/Gq-regulated effectors, including phospholipase C beta, inhibit tyrosine kinase-initiated mitogenesis. One role for G16/Gq response systems may be to modulate growth factor receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1557873457,"Although aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from higher eukaryotic cells are routinely isolated as components of a multienzyme complex, it has remained unclear how closely the isolated complex reflects a structure that exists within the cell. To answer this question, we have used chemical cross-linking and immunological detection to identify the nearest neighbor(s) of arginyl-tRNA synthetase both in the isolated, purified complex and in saponin-permeabilized cells, which retain much of the structural organization of intact cells. Our results show that arginyl-tRNA synthetase is cross-linked primarily both in vitro and in vivo to a single protein, an as yet uncharacterized 38-kDa polypeptide known to be present in synthetase complexes from many sources. These data demonstrate that the isolated, multienzyme amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase complex reflects a defined structure that also pre-exists in the cell and that the 38-kDa polypeptide is an integral component of this complex."
https://openalex.org/W1539810220,"The thylakoid-targeting domain of the Rieske FeS protein has been located in the N-terminal 55 amino acids of the mature protein by importing chimeric and truncated precursor proteins into isolated pea chloroplasts. A chimeric protein consisting of the presequence of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit fused to the mature Rieske protein sequence was imported by chloroplasts, processed in the stroma, and translocated into the thylakoids, indicating that the thylakoid-targeting information was located within the mature Rieske protein. A truncated Rieske protein precursor consisting of the presequence and the N-terminal 55 amino acids of the mature protein was imported by chloroplasts and routed to the thylakoids, indicating that the thylakoid-targeting domain of the Rieske protein is located within the predominantly hydrophobic N-terminal region of the mature protein. Chimeric proteins consisting of this truncated Rieske protein precursor fused to the mature Rubisco small subunit and to plastocyanin were efficiently imported by chloroplasts and translocated across the thylakoid membrane. A proton-motive force was necessary for thylakoid translocation of the mature Rieske protein, the truncated Rieske protein, and the fusion protein consisting of the truncated Rieske protein and the mature Rubisco small subunit. In contrast, plastocyanin and the fusion of the truncated Rieske protein with plastocyanin were translocated across the thylakoid membrane in the presence of nigericin and valinomycin, indicating that the energy requirement for thylakoid translocation was conferred by the passenger protein and not by the thylakoid-targeting sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1635172308,"X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that the hydrophobic acceptor pocket made by E and F helices involving Leu-beta 88 and Phe-beta 85 is critical for the formation of stable hydrophobic interactions with Val-beta 6 on an adjacent deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) S tetramer. Ala and Phe substitutions at the beta 88 position in Hb S were made using a yeast expression system in an effort to clarify the role of Leu-beta 88 in creating a suitable acceptor site for Val-beta 6 during polymerization of Hb S. Both Ala- and Phe-beta 88 substitutions in Hb S inhibited polymerization compared with Hb S. Critical concentrations for polymerization of alpha 2 beta 2 Val-6,Ala-88 and alpha 2 beta 2Val-6,Phe-88 were 6- and 10-fold higher, respectively, than that of Hb S (alpha 2 beta 2Val-6,Leu-88). Deoxy-Hb S containing Phe-beta 88 polymerized without a delay time like Trp-beta 6- and Phe-beta 6-substituted hemoglobins (Adachi, K., Konitzer, P., Kim, J., Welch, N., and Surrey, S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21650-21656). In contrast, oversaturated deoxy-Hb S containing Ala-beta 88 also polymerized without a delay time; however, with decreasing hemoglobin concentrations, the kinetics of polymerization were biphasic. At lower hemoglobin concentrations, closer to the critical concentration for polymerization, deoxy-Hb S containing Ala-beta 88 polymerized after a distinct delay time. These results suggest that bulky beta 88 hydrophobic replacements like Phe may sterically inhibit insertion of Val-beta 6 into the acceptor pocket. In contrast, smaller sized, less hydrophobic amino acids like Ala compared with Leu-beta 88 may allow insertion of Val-beta 6 into the acceptor pocket but may not promote stable protein-protein interactions with an adjacent Hb molecule. Stereospecificity and hydrophobicity of the Val-beta 6 hydrophobic acceptor pocket as well as the beta 6 amino acid are, therefore, critical for polymerization of deoxy-Hb S."
https://openalex.org/W1481213408,"We have analyzed the effects of SV40 large-T oncogene on proteoglycan (PG) synthesis in a temperature-sensitive SV40-transformed renal cell line. Cells shifted from permissive (33 degrees C) to restrictive (39.5 degrees C) temperature, acquired within 48 h the phenotype of principal cells of the renal collecting tubule. They then synthesized hyaluronan, a large-sized PG, small amounts of free GAG chains, and a major approximately 130-kDa heparan sulfate-PG. Sulfated PGs were localized in a basement membrane-like layer and possessed the same core protein (61-70 kDa) derived from perlecan. Expression of large-T oncogene at the permissive temperature induced dramatic alterations of the extracellular matrix, and a 4- and 12-fold reduction in cell-associated and medium-released sulfated PGs, due to a approximately 50% decrease in perlecan mRNA content and gene transcription. This contrasted with a 2-fold increase in actin gene transcription and a 10- and 2-fold rise in the hyaluronan content in cells and medium, respectively. These alterations did not occur in a control cell line (RC.SV3) derived from the same tubule segment but infected with wild-type SV40 strain. They are thus most likely related to the functional state of large-T oncogene and may take part in the early steps of transformation."
