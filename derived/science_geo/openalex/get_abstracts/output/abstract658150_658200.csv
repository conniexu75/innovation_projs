https://openalex.org/W3081183762,"Drawing on a recent online survey combined with city-level data, this paper examines the impact of the COVID-19 on consumers’ online food purchase behavior in the short term. To address the potential endogeneity issues, we adopt an instrumental variable (IV) strategy, using the distance from the surveyed city to Wuhan as the instrumental variable. We show that our IV method is effective in minimizing potential bias. It is found that the share of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases the possibility of consumers purchasing food online. This is more likely to be the case for young people having a lower perceived risk of online purchases and living in large cities. Despite some limitations, this paper has policy implications for China and other countries that have been influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Specifically, government support and regulation should focus on (i) ensuring the safety of food sold on the internet, (ii) protecting the carrier from becoming infected, and (iii) providing financial support to the poor since they may have difficulties in obtaining access to food living in small cities. Moreover, how to help those who are unable to purchase food online because of their technical skills (e.g., the elderly who are not familiar with smart phones or the internet) also deserves more attention for the government and the public."
https://openalex.org/W3080137356,"Current geographic spread of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections shows heterogeneity. This study explores the role of age in potentially driving differentials in infection spread, epidemic potential, and rates of disease severity and mortality across countries. An age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population ≥1 million. Assuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R0 was 1.05 versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons) for the final cumulative infection incidence was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3 (versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9). Age could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere."
https://openalex.org/W3081427214,"Sex differences in human locomotion are of interest in a broad variety of interdisciplinary applications. Although kinematic sex differences have been studied for many years, the underlying reasons behind several noted differences, such as pelvis and torso range of motion, are still not well understood. Walking speed and body size in particular represent confounding influences that hinder our ability to determine causal factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate sex differences in whole body gait kinematics across a range of controlled, non-dimensional walking and running speeds. We hypothesized that as task demand (i.e. gait speed) increased, the influences of modifiable factors would decrease, leading to a kinematic motion pattern convergence between sexes. Motion capture data from forty-eight healthy young adults (24 M, 24 F) wearing controlled footwear was captured at three walking and three running Froude speeds. Spatiotemporal metrics, center of mass displacement, and joint/segment ranges of motion were compared between sexes using 2x6 mixed-model ANOVAs. Three dimensional time-series waveforms were also used to describe the time-varying behavior of select joint angles. When controlling for size, sex differences in spatiotemporal metrics and center of mass displacement disappeared. However, contrary to our hypothesis, sagittal plane ankle, frontal plane pelvis, and transverse plane pelvis and torso range of motion all displayed sex differences that persisted or increased with gait speed. Overall, most spatiotemporal sex differences appear to be related to size and self-selection of gait speeds, while in contrast, sex differences in joint motion may be more inherent and ubiquitous than previously thought. Discussion on potential causal factors is presented."
https://openalex.org/W3080432235,"Among the different indicators that quantify the spread of an epidemic such as the on-going COVID-19, stands first the reproduction number which measures how many people can be contaminated by an infected person. In order to permit the monitoring of the evolution of this number, a new estimation procedure is proposed here, assuming a well-accepted model for current incidence data, based on past observations. The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold: 1) the estimation of the reproduction number is achieved by convex optimization within a proximal-based inverse problem formulation, with constraints aimed at promoting piecewise smoothness; 2) the approach is developed in a multivariate setting, allowing for the simultaneous handling of multiple time series attached to different geographical regions, together with a spatial (graph-based) regularization of their evolutions in time. The effectiveness of the approach is first supported by simulations, and two main applications to real COVID-19 data are then discussed. The first one refers to the comparative evolution of the reproduction number for a number of countries, while the second one focuses on French departments and their joint analysis, leading to dynamic maps revealing the temporal co-evolution of their reproduction numbers."
https://openalex.org/W3080661470,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with severe comorbidity and impairment. Muscle dysmorphia (MD) is a subtype of BDD which has rarely been assessed outside of undergraduate student samples. Further, there are limited data comparing MD to other psychiatric disorders, including BDD. Thus, the aim of the current study is to explore differences in symptom severity and conformity to masculine norms in men diagnosed with BDD or MD. Men from the greater Boston, Massachusetts area completed a one-time assessment, which included clinician-based structured interviews and self-report questionnaires assessing MD symptom severity, BDD symptom severity, and conformity to traditional masculine norms. The sample was N = 30 men (MD: n = 15; BDD: n = 15). Statistically significant medium to large effects emerged with the MD group experiencing greater MD and BDD symptom severity, and positive attitudes towards the use of violence to solve problems. Although not reaching statistical significance, additional medium-to-large effects also emerged with the MD group reporting greater emotional restriction/suppression, heterosexual self-presentation, and desired sexual promiscuity compared to the BDD group. Findings suggest that men diagnosed with MD may experience greater MD/BDD symptom severity and endorsement of some components of ‘traditional’ masculine norms, compared to men diagnosed with BDD. Results may suggest that addressing some forms of rigid masculine norms (e.g., use of violence) in therapy could be useful in treating MD; however, additional research comparing clinical samples of men with MD and BDD are needed to guide the nosology, assessment, and treatment of MD."
https://openalex.org/W3080223005,"HIV and violence prevention programs increasingly seek to transform gender norms among participants, yet how to do so at the community level, and subsequent pathways to behavior change, remain poorly understood. We assessed shifts in endorsement of equitable gender norms, and intimate partner violence (IPV), during the three-year community-based trial of Tsima, an HIV 'treatment as prevention' intervention in rural South Africa.Cross-sectional household surveys were conducted with men and women ages 18-49 years, in 8 intervention and 7 control communities, at 2014-baseline (n = 1,149) and 2018-endline (n = 1,189). Endorsement of equitable gender norms was measured by the GEM Scale. Intent-to-treat analyses assessed intervention effects and change over time. Qualitative research with 59 community members and 38 staff examined the change process.Nearly two-thirds of men and half of women in intervention communities had heard of the intervention/seen the logo; half of these had attended a two-day workshop. Regression analyses showed a 15% improvement in GEM Scale score over time, irrespective of the intervention, among men (p<0.001) and women (p<0.001). Younger women (ages 18-29) had a decreased odds of reporting IPV in intervention vs. control communities (aOR 0.53; p<0.05). Qualitative data suggest that gender norms shifts may be linked to increased media access (via satellite TV/smartphones) and consequent exposure to serial dramas modeling equitable relationships and negatively portraying violence. Tsima's couple communication/conflict resolution skills-building activities, eagerly received by intervention participants, appear to have further supported IPV reductions.There was a population-level shift towards greater endorsement of equitable gender norms between 2014-2018, potentially linked with rapid escalation in media access. There was also an intervention effect on reported IPV among young women, likely owing to improved couple communication. Societal-level gender norm shifts may create enabling environments for interventions to find new traction for violence and HIV-related behavior change."
https://openalex.org/W3081176215,"Background Plasma volume status (PVS), a marker of plasma volume expansion and contraction, is gaining attention in the field of cardiovascular disease because of its role in the prevention and of the management of heart failure. However, it remains undetermined whether an abnormal PVS is a risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the general population. Methods and results We used a nationwide database of 230,882 subjects (age 40–75 years) who participated in the annual “Specific Health Check and Guidance in Japan” check-up between 2008 and 2011. There were 586 cardiovascular deaths, 2,552 non-cardiovascular deaths, and 3,138 all-cause deaths during the follow-up period of four years. Abnormally high and low PVS were identified from the results of 80% of all subjects (high and low PVS ≥ 7 and < -13.3, respectively). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated that high PVS was an independent risk factor for all-cause, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths. Although low PVS was a positive risk factor for cardiovascular deaths as well, it was a negative risk factor for non-cardiovascular deaths. The addition of PVS to cardiovascular risk factors significantly improved the C-statistic, net reclassification, and integrated discrimination indexes. Conclusions This is the first prospective report to reveal the impact of PVS on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. PVS could be an additional risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3080370147,"Background Current malaria control and elimination strategies rely mainly on efficacious antimalarial drugs. However, drug resistance is a major threat facing malaria control programs. Determination of drug resistance molecular markers is useful in the monitoring and surveillance of malaria drug efficacy. This study aimed to determine the mutations and haplotypes frequencies of different genes linked with antimalarial drug resistance in certain areas in Sudan. Methods A total of 226 dried blood spots (DBS) of microscopically diagnosed P. falciparum isolates were collected from Khartoum and three other areas in Sudan during 2015–2017. Plasmodium falciparum confirmation and multiplicity of infection was assessed using the Sanger’s 101 SNPs-barcode and speciation was confirmed using regions of the parasite mitochondria. Molecular genotyping of drug resistance genes (Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, exonuclease, Pfk13, parasite genetic background (PGB) (Pfarps10, ferredoxin, Pfcrt, Pfmdr2)) was also performed. All genotypes were generated by selective regions amplicon sequencing of the parasite genome using the Illumina MiSeq platform at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK then genotypes were translated into drug resistance haplotypes and species determination. Findings In total 225 samples were confirmed to be P. falciparum. A higher proportion of multiplicity of infection was observed in Gezira (P<0.001) based on the Sanger 101 SNPs -barcode. The overall frequency of mutant haplotype Pfcrt 72–76 CVIET was 71.8%. For Pfmdr1, N86Y was detected in 53.6%, Y184F was observed in 88.1% and D1246Y was detected in 1.5% of the samples. The most frequently observed haplotype was YFD 47.4%. For Pfdhfr (codons 51, 59,108,164), the ICNI haplotype was the most frequent (80.7%) while for Pfdhps (codons 436, 437, 540, 581, 613) the (SGEAA) was most frequent haplotype (41%). The Quadruple mutation (dhfr N51I, S108N + dhps A437G, K540E) was the highest frequent combined mutation (33.9%). In Pfkelch13 gene, 18 non‐synonymous mutations were detected, 7 of them were detected in other African countries. The most frequent Pfk13 mutation was E433D detected in four samples. All of the Pfk13 mutant alleles have not been reported to belong to mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in Southeast Asia. PGB mutations were detected only in Pfcrt N326S\I (46.3%) and Pfcrt I356T (8.2%). The exonuclease mutation was not detected. There was no significant variation in mutant haplotypes between study areas. Conclusions There was high frequency of mutations in Pfcrt, Pfdhfr and Pfdhps in this study. These mutations are associated with chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance. Many SNPs in Pfk13 not linked with delayed parasite clearance were observed. The exonuclease E415G mutation which is linked with piperaquine resistance was not reported."
https://openalex.org/W3080807506,"Over the last decades, health systems worldwide have faced a decline in public trust. For marginalized minority populations, who generally suffer from poverty and political exclusion, the roots of this trend go much deeper, establishing a state of bi-directional distrust between them and health institutions. Although studied to a lesser extent compared to trust, distrust does impede health initiatives, such as infectious diseases prevention programs, mostly of so-called Neglected Zoonotic Diseases (NZDs). Where distrust prevails, even trust building actions such as defining rights and obligations, prioritizing ""the greater good"" and increasing transparency, are prone to failure. In this study, we deepen the understanding of the concept of distrust through a unique case study of Brucellosis, a prevalent bacterial zoonotic disease endemic to disadvantaged Bedouin communities in southern Israel.In the years 2015-2019, we qualitatively studied socio-political aspects in a governmental Brucellosis control campaign in southern Israel. We used in-depth interviews with 38 governmental and private health workers, agriculture and nature preservation workers, livestock owners and community leaders. Further, we conducted participant observation in 10 livestock pens and in policymaking meetings, and collected policy and media documents in order to triangulate the results.We conceptualize three different types of distrust between authorities and marginalized communities-""intention-based distrust"", ""values-based distrust"" and ""circular distrust""-to better explain how distrust originates and reinforces itself, reproducing the endemicity of NZDs. Based on that, we portray a practical framework to reduce distrust in health policies, by reframing local discourses, reshaping disease monitoring schemes from enforcement-based to participation-based, and promoting political inclusion of disadvantaged communities.The suggested analysis and framework redirect health policy objectives to not only acknowledge, contain and reduce the consequences of distrust, but also to strive for societal justice as a tool for health promotion."
https://openalex.org/W3081463453,"Among the mineral nutrients that are required for plant metabolism, iron (Fe) and sulphur (S) play a central role as both elements are needed for the activity of several proteins involved in essential cellular processes. A combination of physiological, biochemical and molecular approaches was employed to investigate how S availability influences plant response to Fe deficiency, using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We first observed that chlorosis symptom induced by Fe deficiency was less pronounced when S availability was scarce. We thus found that S deficiency inhibited the Fe deficiency induced expression of several genes associated with the maintenance of Fe homeostasis. This includes structural genes involved in Fe uptake (i.e. IRT1, FRO2, PDR9, NRAMP1) and transport (i.e. FRD3, NAS4) as well as a subset of their upstream regulators, namely BTS, PYE and the four clade Ib bHLH. Last, we found that the over accumulation of manganese (Mn) in response to Fe shortage was reduced under combined Fe and S deficiencies. These data suggest that S deficiency inhibits the Fe deficiency dependent induction of the Fe uptake machinery. This in turn limits the transport into the root and the plant body of potentially toxic divalent cations such as Mn and Zn, thus limiting the deleterious effect of Fe deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2921511136,"While it is still not possible to describe the neural-level connections of the human brain, we can map the human connectome with several hundred vertices, by the application of diffusion-MRI based techniques. In these graphs, the nodes correspond to anatomically identified gray matter areas of the brain, while the edges correspond to the axonal fibers, connecting these areas. In our previous contributions, we have described numerous graph-theoretical phenomena of the human connectomes. Here we map the frequent complete subgraphs of the human brain networks: in these subgraphs, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. We also examine sex differences in the results. The mapping of the frequent subgraphs gives robust substructures in the graph: if a subgraph is present in the 80% of the graphs, then, most probably, it could not be an artifact of the measurement or the data processing workflow. We list here the frequent complete subgraphs of the human braingraphs of 414 subjects, each with 463 nodes, with a frequency threshold of 80%, and identify 812 complete subgraphs, which are more frequent in male and 224 complete subgraphs, which are more frequent in female connectomes."
https://openalex.org/W3080595179,"Human activities are changing landscape structure and function globally, affecting wildlife space use, and ultimately increasing human-wildlife conflicts and zoonotic disease spread. Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are linked to conflicts in human-modified landscapes (e.g. crop damage, vehicle collision), as well as the spread and amplification of Brazilian spotted fever (BSF), the most human-lethal tick-borne disease in the world. Even though it is essential to understand the link between capybaras, ticks and BSF, many knowledge gaps still exist regarding the effects of human disturbance in capybara space use. Here, we analyzed diurnal and nocturnal habitat selection strategies of capybaras across natural and human-modified landscapes using resource selection functions (RSF). Selection for forested habitats was higher across human-modified landscapes, mainly during day- periods, when compared to natural landscapes. Across natural landscapes, capybaras avoided forests during both day- and night periods. Water was consistently selected across both landscapes, during day- and nighttime. Distance to water was also the most important variable in predicting capybara habitat selection across natural landscapes. Capybaras showed slightly higher preferences for areas near grasses/shrubs across natural landscapes, and distance to grasses/shrubs was the most important variable in predicting capybara habitat selection across human-modified landscapes. Our results demonstrate human-driven variation in habitat selection strategies by capybaras. This behavioral adjustment across human-modified landscapes may be related to increases in A. sculptum density, ultimately affecting BSF."
https://openalex.org/W3080566630,"Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (TPA), is a persisting global health problem. Although syphilis diagnostics relies mainly on serology, serological tests have some limitations, and it is recommended that the final diagnosis be supported by additional tests. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between serology and PCR in syphilis diagnostics. From the year 2004 to May 2019, a total of 941 samples were taken from 833 patients suspected of having syphilis, in Czech Republic. In all these samples, both nested PCR detection of TPA and serology testing were performed. Of the 941 samples, 126 were seronegative, 651 were seropositive, and 164 were serodiscrepant. Among seronegative samples (n = 126), 11 were PCR-positive (8.7%). Among seropositive samples (n = 651; i.e., samples positive for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology tests), 368 samples were PCR-positive (56.5%). The remaining 164 serodiscrepant samples included RPR negative and treponemal serological test-positive samples (n = 154) and a set of 10 RPR-positive samples negative in treponemal serological tests. While the first group revealed 73 PCR-positive samples (47.4%), the second revealed 5 PCR positive samples (50.0%). PCR detection rates were highest in primary syphilis, with lower rates in the secondary and undetermined syphilis stages. As shown here, the nested PCR can improve diagnostics of syphilis, especially in seronegative patients and in patients with discrepant serology."
https://openalex.org/W3081446481,"Little consensus exists for growth performance of different feeding patterns in infancy. The objective of this study is to assess the growth performance of exclusively breastfed, partially breastfed and formula fed infants in China.Data from a total of 109,052 infants aged 1-<12 months were collected from the 4th and 5th China National Surveys in 2005 and 2015. Feeding patterns were classified into three types for infants under 6 months of age: exclusive breastfeeding, partial breastfeeding and formula feeding. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding exclusively from the mother's own milk (bottle-feeding included).34.0% and 43.9% of infants were exclusively breastfed and 41.5% and 36.3% were partially breastfed at 4-<6 months in 2005 and 2015 respectively. Exclusively breastfed infants were generally a little heavier than partially breastfed and formula fed infants aged 1-<6 months; however, there was not a significant statistical difference between continued breastfeeding and formula feeding infants aged 6-<12 months. No significant statistical difference for length was observed among the three groups for ages 1-<6 months; however, infants who were continued to be breastfed were a little shorter compared to those who were formula fed (ages 6-<12 months). For infants aged 1-<2 months there was not a substantial difference from the 2006 WHO growth standards; however, for infants aged 2-<12 months the average weight and length of different feeding infants in China were a little heavier and longer than the 2006 WHO growth standards.Partial breastfed and formula fed infants were a little lighter than exclusively breastfed infants in the first half of the first year. Formula fed infants were a little longer than continued breastfed infants in the second half."
https://openalex.org/W3081499938,"Objectives In this paper, we aim to detail the setup of a high spatio-temporal resolution, electrical recording system utilising planar microelectrode arrays with simultaneous optical imaging suitable for evaluating microelectrode performance with a proposed ′performance factor′ metric. Methods Techniques that would facilitate low noise electrical recordings were coupled with voltage sensitive dyes and neuronal activity was recorded both electrically via a customised amplification system and optically via a high speed CMOS camera. This technique was applied to characterise microelectrode recording performance of gold and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT/PSS) coated electrodes through traditional signal to noise (SNR) calculations as well as the proposed performance factor. Results Neuronal activity was simultaneously recorded using both electrical and optical techniques and this activity was confirmed via tetrodotoxin application to inhibit action potential firing. PEDOT/PSS outperformed gold using both measurements, however, the performance factor metric estimated a 3 fold improvement in signal transduction when compared to gold, whereas SNR estimated an 8 fold improvement when compared to gold. Conclusion The design and functionality of a system to record from neurons both electrically, through microelectrode arrays, and optically via voltage sensitive dyes was successfully achieved. Significance The high spatiotemporal resolution of both electrical and optical methods will allow for an array of applications such as improved detection of subthreshold synaptic events, validation of spike sorting algorithms and a provides a robust evaluation of extracellular microelectrode performance."
https://openalex.org/W3080395040,"We recently reported a family-based genome wide association study (GWAS) for pediatric stroke pointing our attention to two significantly associated genes of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) gene family ADAMTS2 (rs469568, p = 8x10-6) and ADAMTS12 (rs1364044, p = 2.9x10-6). To further investigate these candidate genes, we applied a targeted resequencing approach on 48 discordant sib-pairs for pediatric stroke followed by genotyping of the detected non-synonymous variants in the full cohort of 270 offspring trios and subsequent fine mapping analysis. We identified eight non-synonymous SNPs in ADAMTS2 and six in ADAMTS12 potentially influencing the respective protein function. These variants were genotyped within a cohort of 270 affected offspring trios, association analysis revealed the ADAMTS12 variant rs77581578 to be significantly under-transmitted (p = 6.26x10-3) to pediatric stroke patients. The finding was validated in a pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) cohort of 189 affected trios. Subsequent haplotype analysis of ADAMTS12 detected a significantly associated haplotype comprising the originally identified GWAS variant. Several ADAMTS genes such as ADAMTS13 are involved in thromboembolic disease process. Here, we provide further evidence for ADAMTS12 to likely play a role in pediatric stroke. Further functional studies are warranted to assess the functional role of ADAMTS12 in the pathogenesis of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W3080458289,"This study evaluated the effects of the chronic consumption of different concentrations of alcohol on the experimental periodontitis (EP). 160 rats were divided into 4 groups: (EP-NT) rats with EP and no alcohol exposure; (EP-A14) rats with EP exposed to 14% alcohol; (EP-A25) rats with EP exposed to 25% alcohol; (EP-A36) rats with EP exposed to 36% alcohol. The animals from the EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups were subjected to different concentrations of alcohol 30 days before EP induction. The histological characteristics, percentage of bone in the furcation (PBF) and bone metabolism in the furcation region were evaluated. The PBF and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) data were subjected to statistical analysis. The EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups had lower PBFs compared with the EP-NT group. A more severe inflammatory process and a greater number of TRAP+ cells were also observed. In the EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups, the inflammatory process became more severe as the ingested alcoholic concentration increased. An increase in RANKL immunolabeling and a significantly higher number of TRAP+ cells were also observed. We conclude that chronic alcohol consumption increases the severity of experimental periodontitis in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the magnitude of local inflammatory responses and stimulating alveolar bone resorption."

A confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) was conducted to test the model fit of the 9-item PAC proposed by the scale developer and multiple linear regression was used to investigate the significant socio-demographic correlates.CFA showed that the 2-factor structure including 'Self-Affirmation' and 'Outlook on Life' had an acceptable model fit. After controlling for confounding variables, Malay caregivers were associated with higher scores on PAC and 'Self-Affirmation' compared to caregivers of other ethnicities. Caregivers with Secondary or below education level had higher PAC and 'Outlook on Life' scores. Caregivers who had received formal training scored higher in PAC, 'Self-Affirmation' and 'Outlook on Life'.The present study confirmed that the 2-factor structure of the 9-item PAC was suitable for informal caregivers of PWD in Singapore.

https://openalex.org/W3080229720,"The timing of antenatal care (ANC) visits directly affect health intervention coverage and impact, especially for those interventions requiring strict gestational age windows for administration, such as maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Existing nationally representative population-based surveys do not record the timing of ANC visits beyond the first, limiting the availability of reliable data around timing of subsequent ANC visits in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here, we describe a model that estimates the timing of ANC visits by gestational age using publicly available multi-country survey data.We used the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from 69 LMICs. We used several factors to estimate the timing of subsequent ANC visits by gestation age: the timing of the first ANC visit (ANC1) in a given pregnancy, derived from the DHS; the country's reported average ANC coverage at each ANC visit (ANC1 through the fourth ANC visit [ANC4]); and the World Health Organization's guidance on recommended ANC visit. We then used the timing of ANC visit by gestation age to predict the coverage of a potential maternal RSV vaccine administered at 24-36 weeks of gestation. We calculated the maternal immunization coverage by summing the number of eligible women vaccinated at any ANC visit divided by the total number of pregnant women. We find, in general, countries with higher ANC1 coverage were predicted to have higher vaccination coverage. In 82% of countries, the modeled vaccine coverage is less than ANC4 coverage.The methods illustrated in this paper have implications on the precision of estimating impact and programmatic feasibility of time-critical interventions, especially for pregnant women. The methods can be easily adapted to vaccine demand forecasts models, vaccine impact assessments, and cost-effectiveness analyses and can be adapted to other maternal interventions that have administration timing restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W3080356847,"Mutations in the genes encoding for voltage-gated sodium channels cause profound sensory disturbances and other symptoms dependent on the distribution of a particular channel subtype in different organs. Humans with the gain-of-function mutation p.Leu811Pro in SCN11A (encoding for the voltage-gated Nav1.9 channel) exhibit congenital insensitivity to pain, pruritus, self-inflicted injuries, slow healing wounds, muscle weakness, Charcot-like arthropathies, and intestinal dysmotility. As already shown, knock-in mice (Scn11a+/L799P) carrying the orthologous mutation p.Leu799Pro replicate reduced pain sensitivity and show frequent tissue lesions. In the present study we explored whether Scn11a+/L799P mice develop also pruritus, muscle weakness, and changes in gastrointestinal transit time. Furthermore, we analyzed morphological and functional differences in nerves, skeletal muscle, joints and small intestine from Scn11a+/L799P and Scn11a+/+ wild type mice. Compared to Scn11a+/+ mice, Scn11a+/L799P mice showed enhanced scratching bouts before skin lesions developed, indicating pruritus. Scn11a+/L799P mice exhibited reduced grip strength, but no disturbances in motor coordination. Skeletal muscle fiber types and joint architecture were unaltered in Scn11a+/L799P mice. Their gastrointestinal transit time was unaltered. The small intestine from Scn11a+/L799P showed a small shift towards less frequent peristaltic movements. Similar proportions of lumbar dorsal root ganglion neurons from Scn11a+/L799P and Scn11a+/+ mice were calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP-) positive, but isolated sciatic nerves from Scn11a+/L799P mice exhibited a significant reduction of the capsaicin-evoked release of CGRP indicating reduced neurogenic inflammation. These data indicate important Nav1.9 channel functions in several organs in both humans and mice. They support the pathophysiological relevance of increased basal activity of Nav1.9 channels for sensory abnormalities (pain and itch) and suggest resulting malfunctions of the motor system and of the gastrointestinal tract. Scn11a+/L799P mice are suitable to investigate the role of Nav1.9, and to explore the pathophysiological changes and mechanisms which develop as a consequence of Nav1.9 hyperactivity."
https://openalex.org/W3080676761,"Licensure and registration are the traditional approaches to ensure minimally acceptable standards of care for practice. However, due to advances in medical technology and changes in clinical practice, the knowledge and skills obtained from basic education and training may rapidly become out of date. There is no mandated, structured and ongoing mechanism to assess all doctors' competence in Hong Kong. This paper assessed doctors' perceived needs for continuous professional development, and to identify facilitators and barriers that are likely to influence the implementation of compulsory continuous professional development for maintaining professional competence and ensuring patient safety.An explanatory sequential mixed method design with two distinct interactive phases was adopted comprising a postal self-administered questionnaire survey among a random sample of 2,459 of doctors (Phase 1), followed by individual interviews of a stratified sample of 30 questionnaire respondents for the subsequent qualitative analysis (Phase 2).The majority of doctors (over 90%) agreed the importance of continuous professional development to update knowledge and skills. However, just 30.7% of non-specialists compared with 65.4% of specialists agreed it would be desirable for continuous professional development to be a requirement for renewal of licenses. A relatively higher percentage of non-specialists compared with specialists reported barriers to participation such as accessibility, availability and relevance of the content of the programmes. Facilitators for uptake included more convenient schedule and location, relevant content, and incentives for participation such as making this a pre-condition for enrolling in government-funded services.To address the needs of individual doctors, the spheres of practice, personal preferences and learning styles should be considered in deciding the content and processes of continuous professional development. Flexibility is also an important principle. A learning model, incentives for participation and a compliance strategy (instead of deterrence) could be effective strategy for continuous professional development."
https://openalex.org/W3080719919,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti vectors the arboviral diseases yellow fever, dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Larvae are usually found developing in freshwater; however, more recently they have been increasingly found in brackish water, potential habitats which are traditionally ignored by mosquito control programs. Aedes aegypti larvae are osmo-regulators maintaining their hemolymph osmolarity in a range of ~ 250 to 300 mOsmol l-1. In freshwater, the larvae must excrete excess water while conserving ions while in brackish water, they must alleviate an accumulation of salts. The compensatory physiological mechanisms must involve the transport of ions and water but little is known about the water transport mechanisms in the osmoregulatory organs of these larvae. Water traverses cellular membranes predominantly through transmembrane proteins named aquaporins (AQPs) and Aedes aegypti possesses 6 AQP homologues (AaAQP1 to 6). The objective of this study was to determine if larvae that develop in freshwater or brackish water have differential aquaporin expression in osmoregulatory organs, which could inform us about the relative importance and function of aquaporins to mosquito survival under these different osmotic conditions. We found that AaAQP transcript abundance was similar in organs of freshwater and brackish water mosquito larvae. Furthermore, in the Malpighian tubules and hindgut AaAQP protein abundance was unaffected by the rearing conditions, but in the gastric caeca the protein level of one aquaporin, AaAQP1 was elevated in brackish water. We found that AaAQP1 was expressed apically while AaAQP4 and AaAQP5 were found to be apical and/or basal in the epithelia of osmoregulatory organs. Overall, the results suggest that aquaporin expression in the osmoregulatory organs is mostly consistent between larvae that are developing in freshwater and brackish water. This suggests that aquaporins may not have major roles in adapting to longterm survival in brackish water or that aquaporin function may be regulated by other mechanisms like post-translational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W3081027383,"We are living nowadays in a social paradigm characterized by a high degree of fluidity. From professional career to leisure, from family patterns to neighborhood relationships, from cultural consumption to domestic technology, almost all the components of social reality have changed during recent decades. A given couple’s experience is not insulated from these dynamics, or at least from the pressure that new trends constantly put on it. How can functional relationships be preserved in a continuously changing world? What possibilities are there for couples to sustain viable relationships in the face of all the waves of change, involving as they do new content, new rules, and, in many cases, new values? This paper sets out to analyze how the main factors related to marital life interact and what their impact is on individual satisfaction in the dyadic experience. To this end we planned and applied a sociological survey to a national sample (N = 455 participants, error limit 4.7) using a questionnaire focusing on an evaluation of dyadic life experience that included the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS). The major finding is that more liberal sexual attitudes and people’s high view of the importance of money are the strongest predictors of a low-quality dyadic experience. The patterns observed also raise the possibility that positive perception of the parental model may serve to compensate for a couple’s relatively shorter period of marital experience."

Structural glaucomatous changes were examined with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Heidelberg retinal tomography-III (HRT-III), and functional disease progression with automated perimetry (Humphrey visual fields). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the relationship between baseline structural measurements and functional disease progression.From baseline over a 5-year period, statistically significant increases were found in OCT disc (D) area (p<0.001), cup (C) area (p<0.001), C/D area ratio (p<0.001), C/D horizontal ratio (p<0.001), C/D vertical ratio (p = 0.018), and a decrease in superior RNFL thickness (p = 0.008). Statistically significant increases were found in HRT-III C volume (p = 0.021), C/D area ratio (p = 0.046), mean C depth (p = 0.036), C shape (p = 0.008), and height variation contour (p = 0.020). Functional disease progression was detected in 37 of the 112 patients (26 of European descent and 11 of African descent; 33%). A statistically significant shorter time to functional progression was seen in patients with larger baseline OCT D area (p = 0.008), C area (p = 0.003), thicker temporal RNFL (p = 0.003), and in patients with a larger HRT-III C area (p = 0.004), C/D area ratio (p = 0.004), linear C/D ratio (p = 0.007), C shape (p = 0.032), or smaller rim area (p = 0.039), rim volume (p = 0.005), height variation contour (p = 0.041), mean RNFL thickness (p<0.001), or RNFL cross-sectional area (p = 0.002).Baseline ONH and RNFL structural characteristics were associated with a significantly shorter time to functional glaucomatous progression and visual field loss through the five-year period in OAG patients."
https://openalex.org/W3050669327,"Being afraid of others' positive appraisal of oneself is called fear of positive evaluation. Fear of positive evaluation has been studied intensively in the context of social anxiety disorder (SAD). It is not known if individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) fear positive evaluation and which factors are associated with fear of positive evaluation in BPD.We applied the fear of positive evaluation scale and further self-report measures (e.g., social phobia inventory, rejection sensitivity questionnaire) to 36 patients with BPD, 29 patients with SAD and 35 healthy controls (HC).A one-way ANOVA revealed that patients with BPD and patients with SAD reported significantly higher fear of positive evaluation than HC. Patients with BPD and SAD did not differ in their fear of positive evaluation. A hierarchical regression analysis revealed an association between rejection sensitivity and fear of positive evaluation in the BPD sample. However, this association disappeared when controlling for social anxiety.Our results indicate that individuals with BPD fear positive evaluation as much as individuals with SAD do, which has implications for clinical practice. Our results further imply that social anxiety is decisive for high fear of positive evaluation in patients with SAD and patients with BPD."
https://openalex.org/W3080091419,"Skipjack tuna (SJT) pelagic hotspots in the western North Pacific (WNP) were modelled using fishery and satellite remotely sensed data with Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) models. Our objectives were to model and predict habitat hotspots for SJT and assess the monthly changes in sub-surface temperatures and mixed layer depths at fishing locations. SJT presence-only monthly resolved data, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, diffuse attenuation coefficient, sea surface heights and surface wind speed were used to construct ENFA models and generate habitat suitability indices using a short-term dataset from March-November 2004. The suitability indices were then predicted for July-October (2007 and 2008). Monthly aggregated polygons of areas fished by skipjack tuna pole and line vessels were also overlaid on the predicted habitat suitability maps. Distributions of sub-surface temperatures and mixed layer depths (MLD) at fishing locations were also examined. Our results showed good fit for ENFA models, as indicated by the absolute validation index, the contrast validation index and the continuous Boyce index. The predicted hotspots showed varying concurrences when compared with 25-degree polygons derived from fished areas. Northward shifts in SJT hotspots corresponded with declining MLDs from March to September. The MLDs were shallower in summer and deeper in autumn and winter months. The habitat hotspots modeled using ENFA were consistent with the known ecology and seasonal migration pattern of SJT. The findings of this work, derived from a short-term dataset, enable identification of SJT hotspots in the WNP, thus contributing valuable information for future research on SJT habitat prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W3080225804,"The effects of High-Intensity Functional Training (HIFT) on body composition and the relationship of the latter with performance are not well defined. In this work we investigated, by means of Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry, the relative proportions of fat-, lean soft tissue-, and mineral mass in CrossFit® (CF, a popular mode of HIFT) participants (n = 24; age, 28.2 ± 3.39 y; BMI, 25.3 ± 2.04 kg/m2) with at least 1 year of CF training experience and weekly amount of training > 10 h/w (n = 13; Higher Training, HT) or < 10 h/w (n = 11; Lower Training, LT) as well as age- matched and BMI-matched physically active controls (CHT, CLT). Performance was assessed in the “Fran” workout. Data were analyzed by one-way or repeated measures ANOVA where needed. Association between variables was assessed with the Pearson’s correlation coefficient r. Partial correlation was used where needed. Results showed that HT performed better than LT in the “Fran” (P < 0.001) and they had higher whole-body bone mineral density (P = 0.026) and higher lean soft mass (P = 0.002), and borderline lower percent fat mass (P = 0.050). The main difference between CF participants (HT, LT) and their respective controls (CHT, CLT) was a lower adiposity in the former. In CF participants, performance positively correlated with appendicular lean soft tissue mass (P = 0.030). It can be concluded that, in CF participants, a higher amount of weekly training improves most notably lean body mass and increases performance in association with increased skeletal muscle mass. CF participation is especially effective in reducing fat mass vs. age- and BMI-matched physically active controls."

Akin to hamsters, the white-footed deermouse has been unevenly characterized in comparison to the murid Mus musculus. To further understanding of P. leucopus' total genomic content, we investigated gut microbiomes of an outbred colony of P. leucopus, inbred M. musculus, and a natural population of P. leucopus. Metagenome and whole genome sequencing were combined with microbiology and microscopy approaches. A focus was the genus Lactobacillus, four diverse species of which were isolated from forestomach and feces of colony P. leucopus. Three of the species-L. animalis, L. reuteri, and provisionally-named species ""L. peromysci""-were identified in fecal metagenomes of wild P. leucopus but not discernibly in samples from M. musculus. L. johnsonii, the fourth species, was common in M. musculus but absent or sparse in wild P. leucopus. Also identified in both colony and natural populations were a Helicobacter sp. in feces but not stomach, and a Tritrichomonas sp. protozoan in cecum or feces. The gut metagenomes of colony P. leucopus were similar to those of colony M. musculus at the family or higher level and for major subsystems. But there were multiple differences between species and sexes within each species in their gut metagenomes at orthologous gene level. These findings provide a foundation for hypothesis-testing of functions of individual microbial species and for interventions, such as bait vaccines based on an autochthonous bacterium and targeting P. leucopus for transmission-blocking."
https://openalex.org/W3080364054,"At present, the identification of honeysuckle aroma depends on experienced tasters, which results in inconsistencies due to human error. The key odorants have the potential to distinguish the different species and evaluate the quality of honeysuckle. Hence, in this study, a more scientific approach was applied to distinguish various honeysuckles. The volatile compounds of different species and parts of honeysuckle were separately extracted by headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE). Compounds with greater volatility such as aldehydes, limonene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene were preferentially extracted by HS-SPME. As a complementary extraction method to HS-SPME, SAFE was found to recover comparatively more polar compounds such as eugenol, decanoic acid, and vanillin. Subsequently, key odorants with the highest flavour dilution (FD) factors were detected by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). These were benzaldehyde, 4-ethylphenol, decanoic acid, vanillin, 3-methyl-2-butenal, and β-ionone in honeysuckle flowers and γ-octalactone, 4-ethyl phenol, and vanillin in honeysuckle stem. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to analyze not only the key odorants of species and parts of honeysuckle but also their different origins. The results of PCA suggested that the species of honeysuckle contributed much more to variations in aroma rather than their origins. In conclusion, the application of the key odorants combined with PCA was demonstrated as a valid approach to differentiate species, origins, and parts of honeysuckle."
https://openalex.org/W3080719033,"Aim The addition of maternal age to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at 24–28 gestational weeks improves the performance of GDM screening as maternal age increases. However, this method delays the diagnosis of GDM. Since FPG at the first prenatal visit (FPV) is a screening option for pre-existing diabetes, we evaluated the performance of age plus FPG at the FPV to reduce the need for the OGTT. Methods Pregnant women were recruited consecutively in 2013–2018 (the training cohort) and 2019 (the validation cohort). We excluded women with twin pregnancies, unavailable FPG at the FPV or OGTT data, pre-pregnancy diabetes, or a history of GDM. All participants underwent FPG and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at the FPV and received 75-g OGTT at 24–28 gestational weeks if FPG at the FPV was <92 mg/dL. GDM was diagnosed by the IADPSG criteria. Two algorithms were developed with the cutoffs determined when the percentage requiring OGTT (OGTT%) was the lowest and the sensitivity was ≥90%. Results The incidence of GDM increased with age. The “FPG at the FPV” algorithm reduced OGTT% to 68.8% with the FPG cutoff at 79 mg/dl. The ""age plus FPG at the FPV"" algorithm, with the cutoff of 114, further reduced OGTT% to 58.3%, with the sensitivity of 90.7% (9.3% GDM missed) and the specificity of 100%. These findings were replicated in the validation cohort. Conclusions Screening GDM by maternal age plus FPG at the FPV can reduce OGTT%, especially in populations with a significant proportion of pregnant women with advanced ages."
https://openalex.org/W3080436779,"Coronary revascularization using imaging guidance is rapidly becoming the standard of care. Intravascular optical coherence tomography uses near-infrared light to obtain high resolution intravascular images. Standard optical coherence tomography imaging technique employs iodinated contrast dye to achieve the required blood clearance during acquisition. We sought to systematically evaluate the technical performance of saline as an alternative to iodinated contrast for intravascular optical coherence tomography assessment.We performed bench top optical coherence tomography analysis on nylon tubing with sequential contrast/saline dilutions to empirically derive adjustment coefficients. We then applied these coefficients in vivo in an established rabbit abdominal stenting model with both saline and contrast optical coherence tomography imaging. In this model, we assessed the impact of saline on both quantitative and qualitative vessel assessment. Nylon tubing assessment demonstrated a linear relationship between saline and contrast for both area and diameter. We then derived adjustment coefficients, allowing for accurate calculation of area and diameter when converting saline into both contrast and reference dimensions. In vivo studies confirmed reduced area with saline versus contrast [7.43 (5.67-8.36) mm2 versus 8.2 (6.34-9.39) mm2, p = 0.001] and diameter [3.08 mm versus 3.23 mm, p = 0.001]. Following correction, a strong relationship was achieved in vivo between saline and contrast in both area and diameter without compromising image quality, artefact, or strut assessment.Saline generates reduced dimensions compared to contrast during intravascular optical coherence tomography imaging. The relationship across physiologic coronary diameters is linear and can be corrected with high fidelity. Saline does not adversely impact image quality, artefact, or strut assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3081024732,"Peer review is a volunteer process for improving the quality of publications by providing objective feedback to authors, but also presents an opportunity for reviewers to seek personal reward by requesting self-citations. Open peer review may reduce the prevalence of self-citation requests and encourage author rebuttal over accession. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of self-citation requests and their inclusion in manuscripts in a journal with open peer review.Requests for additional references to be included during peer review for articles published between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018 in BMC Medicine were evaluated. Data extracted included total number of self-citations requested, self-citations that were included in the final published manuscript and manuscripts that included at least one self-citation, and compared with corresponding data on independent citations.In total, 932 peer review reports from 373 manuscripts were analysed. At least one additional citation was requested in 25.9% (n = 241) of reports. Self-citation requests were included in 44.4% of reports requesting additional citations (11.5% of all reports). Requests for self-citation were significantly more likely than independent citations to be incorporated in the published manuscript (65.1% vs 52.1%; chi-square p = 0.003). At the manuscript level, when requested, self-citations were incorporated in 76.6% of manuscripts (n = 72; 19.3% of all manuscripts) compared with 68.5% of manuscripts with independent citation requests (n = 102; 27.3% of manuscripts). A significant interaction was observed between the presence of self-citation requests and the likelihood of any citation request being incorporated (100% incorporation in manuscripts with self-citation requests alone versus 62.7-72.2% with any independent citation request; Fisher's exact test p<0.0005).Requests for self-citations during the peer review process are common. The transparency of open peer review may have the unexpected effect of encouraging authors to incorporate self-citation requests by disclosing peer reviewer identity."

A number of tools have been developed in the literature for achieving high expression levels from the nuclear genome despite messy genomic integration and widespread silencing of transgenes. Here, recent advances in the field are combined and two systems of bicistronic expression, based on ribosome reinitiation or ribosomal skip induced by a viral 2A sequence, are compared side-by-side. Further, the small subunit of Rubisco (RBCS) was developed as a functional nuclear reporter for successful chloroplast import and restoration of photosynthesis: To be able to combine RBCS with a Venus fluorescent reporter without compromising photosynthetic activity, a leaky stop codon is introduced as a novel molecular tool that allows the simultaneous expression of functional and fluorescently tagged versions of the protein from a single construct."
https://openalex.org/W3081148558,"To explain the asymmetrical abundance of native Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and invasive Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) in the fields, we examined differential susceptibility to pesticides and environmental conditions, i.e., nine combinations of temperatures and relative humidities (RHs). We found adult female F. intonsa to be more susceptible to most of the tested insecticides as compared to F. occidentalis. Chlorfenapyr was most toxic to both thrips' species. In the evaluation of environment conditions in the adult stage, F. intonsa survived 2.5 and 2.4-fold longer as RH increased at 20 and 25 °C, respectively, whereas F. occidentalis survived 1.8 and 1.6-fold longer, respectively. In both pupal and larval stage, no significant effect of interaction of temperatures and RHs was found between the two species. In conclusion, the insecticides tested differed considerably in their species-specific toxicity, and F. intonsa was generally more susceptible to the insecticides, while at the same time survivorship was better at higher RH conditions than F. occidentalis. Thus, differences in the relative susceptibility to changing environmental conditions, especially humidity, may be an underlying mechanism for the recent dominance of F. intonsa over F. occidentalis in the strawberry plastic greenhouse in Korea."

HRV is also believed to predict the occurrence and severity of post-operative complications. We aimed to determine the role of pre-operative HRV as a prognostic factor in overall and cancer free survival in patients with colorectal cancer.Retrospective analysis was performed in a detailed dataset of patients diagnosed with primary colorectal cancer between January 2010 and December 2016, who underwent curative surgical treatment. HRV was measured as time-domain parameters (SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN-intervals) and RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)) based on pre-operative 10 second ECGs. Groups were created by baseline HRV: Low HRV (SDNN <20ms or RMSSD <19ms) and normal HRV (SDNN ≥20ms or RMSSD ≥19ms). Primary endpoints were overall and cancer free survival.A total of 428 patients were included in this study. HRV was not significantly associated with overall survival (SDNN <20ms vs SDNN ≥20ms:24.4% vs 22.8%, adjusted HR = 0.952 (0.607-1.493), p = 0.829; RMSSD <19ms vs RMSSD ≥19ms:27.0% vs 19.5%, adjusted HR = 1.321 (0.802-2.178), p = 0.274) or cancer recurrence (SDNN <20ms vs ≥20ms:20.1% vs 18.7%, adjusted HR = 0.976 (0.599-1.592), p = 0.924; RMSSD <19ms vs ≥19ms, 21.5% vs 16.9%, adjusted HR = 1.192 (0.706-2.011), p = 0.511). There was no significant association between HRV and CEA-level at one year follow-up, or between HRV and occurrence of a post-operative complication or the severity of post-operative complications.Heart rate variability was not associated with overall or cancer free survival in patients with primary colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgical treatment. These results do not align with results found in studies including only patients with advanced cancer, which suggests that there is only an association in the other direction, cancer causing low HRV."

The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of age and sex on specific hematologic and serum biochemical parameters in the endurance trained sled dog. Longitudinal and cross-sectional data were analyzed from 9,746 blood and serum samples from 4,804 dogs collected over 7 years as part of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race pre-race examination program. Mixed models analysis was used for statistical analysis and P < 0.01 was considered significant. Dogs ranged from 1-12 years of age and 39% were female. Serum total calcium and phosphorus concentrations and white blood cell count decreased nonlinearly to asymptotic values by 6.6, 3.1, and 6.9 years of age, respectively, equivalent to estimated physiologic ages in human years of 44, 27, and 46 years. Serum glucose concentrations reached their lowest value at 7.8 years of age, equivalent to an estimated human physiologic age of 50 years, after which time the concentration increased. Serum globulin concentrations increased with age, but nonlinearly for females and linearly for males. Most sex-related differences were <5%; however, females had lower serum urea nitrogen (14.7%) and creatinine (7.3%) concentrations, lower serum alanine aminotransferase activity (16.6%), and higher serum total bilirubin concentration (12.8%) and platelet count (6.0%).

https://openalex.org/W3080366631,"Background In the developed world, cardiovascular diseases still contribute to mortality and morbidity, leading to significantly increased deaths in recent years. Thus, it is necessary for a layperson to provide the best possible basic life support (BLS) until professional help is available. Since information on current BLS knowledge in Germany is not available, but necessary to be able to make targeted improvements in BLS education, we conducted this study. Methods A cohort survey using convenience sampling (non-probability) method was conducted with questions found in emergency medicine education. People coming to the emergency room of two big university hospitals located in the South (Munich) and western part (Cologne) of Germany were asked to participate in the survey between 2016 and 2017. Primary outcome measures were the proportion of correct answers for each emergency scenario in relationship to age, region, profession and first-aid training. Results Altogether 1003 people (504 from Cologne; 499 from Munich) took part in the questionnaire. 54.7% were female and 45.3% were male aging from 19 to 52 with a mean of 37.2 years. Although over 90% had taken part in first aid training, many people were lacking first aid knowledge, with less than 10% choosing the correct frequency for chest compression. Hereby demographic factors had a significant influence (p<0.05) in the given answers (Friedmann-and-Wilcoxon Test). Conclusion Overall, results of our survey indicate a clear lack of BLS knowledge. With this information, targeted measures for improving BLS knowledge should be conducted. Additionally, further studies on the feasibility and efficiency of teaching methods are needed"
https://openalex.org/W3080707724,"In mosquitoes of medical importance, wing shape and size can vary with altitude, an aspect that can influence dispersion and, consequently, their vector capacity. Using geometric morphometry analysis, Aedes aegypti wing size and shape variation of males and females was studied in four altitudes in the second-smallest department in Colombia: 1,200 m (Tebaida), 1,400 m (Armenia), 1,500 m (Calarcá), and 1,700 m (Filandia). Wing shape in males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) was significantly different through the altitudinal gradient; in turn, wing size in males followed the altitudinal gradient males (R2 = 0.04946, P = 0.0002), females (R2 = 0.0011, P = 0.46). Wing allometry for males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) was significant. Likewise, the shape and size of the wings of males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) had significant fluctuating asymmetry. It is concluded that, in a small scale with an altitudinal variation of 500 meters, it is detected that the size and shape of the wings varied in A. aegypti, main vector the agents that cause dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The fluctuating asymmetry is present in the individuals studied and could be associated with environmental effects caused by vector control campaigns present in some sampling locations."
https://openalex.org/W3080921275,"The paper relates the results of an ethnolinguistic vitality (ELV) survey among the Kashubs in Poland. The results reveal two interrelated layers of ELV: (1) an individual ELV reflected in language use and shaped by personal experience, emotions, and language proficiency; (2) a more collective ELV associated with the perception of the group’s language strength, its status and utility. The most surprising predictor of linguistic praxis in our study, in addition to language skills, was the positive impact of experienced discouragement on language use. This remained significant when controlling for proficiency. We argue that the correlation between experiencing discouragement and increased language use is best explained by the self-empowerment of speakers who, earlier in their lives, met with negative attitudes toward their heritage language. Rather than succumbing to this discouragement and assimilating to the dominant language, their response was to develop an emotional link to Kashubian and increase their use of this minority language as a conscious act of self-determination and engagement."
https://openalex.org/W3080995653,"Traits of chemically-defended animals can change as an individual grows and matures, and both theoretical and empirical evidence favour a direction of change from crypsis to aposematism. This study examines the suite of traits involved in an unusual opposite shift from aposematism to crypsis in a neotropical toxic-plant-feeding Romaleid grasshopper, Chromacris psittacus (Gerstaecker, 1873). Field surveys, behavioural observations and a rearing experiment compare host plant choice, aggregation, locomotion and thermoregulation between life history stages. Results showed that both nymphs and adults fed exclusively on a narrow range of Solanaceae plants, suggesting that the shift in defensive syndrome is not due to a change in chemical defense. Instead, nymphal aposematism appears linked to aggregation in response to plant-based selection pressures. Slow nymphal development suggests a cost to feeding on toxic plant compounds, and grouping could mitigate this cost. Grouping also increases conspicuousness, and hence can favour warning colourating in chemically-defended insects. The role of diet breadth in aposematism is poorly understood, and these results suggest how constraints imposed by feeding on toxic plants can generate bottom-up selection pressures shaping the adaptive suites of traits of chemically-defended animals."
https://openalex.org/W3081410666,"The majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci are not annotated to known genes in the human genome, which renders biological interpretations difficult. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) associate complex traits with genotype-based prediction of gene expression deriving from expression quantitative loci(eQTL) studies, thus improving the interpretability of GWAS findings. However, these results can sometimes suffer from a high false positive rate, because predicted expression of different genes may be highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium between eQTL. We propose a novel statistical method, Gene Score Regression (GSR), to detect causal gene sets for complex traits while accounting for gene-to-gene correlations. We consider non-causal genes that are highly correlated with the causal genes will also exhibit a high marginal association with the complex trait. Consequently, by regressing on the marginal associations of complex traits with the sum of the gene-to-gene correlations in each gene set, we can assess the amount of variance of the complex traits explained by the predicted expression of the genes in each gene set and identify plausible causal gene sets. GSR can operate either on GWAS summary statistics or observed gene expression. Therefore, it may be widely applied to annotate GWAS results and identify the underlying biological pathways.

https://openalex.org/W3080756293,"This study assessed within-trial cost-effectiveness of a shared care program (SC, n = 339) for pregnancy outcomes compared to usual care (UC, n = 361), as implemented in a randomized trial of Chinese women with gestational diabetes (GDM). SC consisted of an individualized dietary advice and physical activity counseling program. The UC was a one-time group education program. The effectiveness was measured by number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one macrosomia/large for gestational age (LGA) infant. The cost-effectiveness was measured by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of cost (2012 Chinese Yuan/US dollar) per case of macrosomia and LGA prevented. The study took both a health care system and a societal perspective. This study found that the NNT was 16/14 for macrosomia/LGA. The incremental cost for treating a pregnant woman was ¥1,877 ($298) from a health care system perspective and ¥2,056 ($327) from a societal perspective. The cost of preventing a case of macrosomia/LGA from the two corresponding perspectives were ¥30,032/¥26,278 ($4,775/$4,178) and ¥32,896/¥28,784 ($5,230/$4,577), respectively. Considering the potential severe adverse health and economic consequences of a macrosomia/LGA infant, our findings suggest that implementing this lifestyle intervention for women with GDM is an efficient use of health care resources."

Therefore, the hypothesis was tested that parental HFD exaggerates obesity and hypertension during pregnancy of the offspring. Wistar Hannover rat dams (the parental, P generation) were maintained on normal-fat diet (NFD) or HFD from weaning and were kept on respective diets through pregnancy and lactation. Their offspring (the first filial, F1 generation) were weaned onto the same diet as the P generation, or they were changed to the other diet to determine if combined HFD in the P and F1 generations exaggerates body weight and blood pressure levels during pregnancy in these offspring. This diet paradigm resulted in the following groups of pregnant F1 offspring: P-NFD/F1-NFD, P-HFD/F1-NFD, P-NFD/F1-HFD, and P-HFD/F1-HFD. Maternal body and adipose tissue weights were greatest in the P-HFD/F1-HFD group compared to the other 3 groups by the end of pregnancy. Plasma leptin and conscious mean arterial blood pressure were not significantly different between any group, although there was a main effect for increased blood pressure in the F1-HFD groups. Circulating levels of the antihypertensive pregnancy factor, placental growth factor (PlGF), were assessed. Although average PlGF levels were similar among all groups, correlative studies revealed that lower levels of PlGF were associated with higher blood pressure only in the P-HFD/F1-HFD group. In summary, HFD feeding from the P generation exaggerated HFD-induced body and adipose tissue weights in the pregnant offspring."

Objective This research explores the qualitative views of university staff and students about smoking on campus during the implementation of a smoke-free policy. Methods In 2016, an electronic survey was distributed to all current staff and students of a large university in Queensland, Australia during the implementation of a smoke-free policy. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions about demographics, tobacco use, attitudes towards smoking, awareness of and attitudes towards the policy, and intentions to quit smoking. The final question asked for a short, open-ended response: “Would you like to comment on the issue of smoking on QUT* campuses?” This question was extracted from the survey and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. This paper reports the findings from this question. *Queensland University of Technology. Results The survey was completed by 641 staff and students. There were 351 responses to the final question. Five inductive themes emerged about smoking on campus during the implementation of a smoke-free policy: 1) the watering down of the policy, if it is not enforced, 2) the creation of hot spots on campus boundaries affecting those who pass by, 3) concern, especially by those who don’t smoke, about the impact on smokers emotional health and welfare, 4) disagreement about the value of designated smoking areas and 5) suggestions about how to better implement the policy. Conclusion Overall, participants views about smoking on campus during the implementation of a smoke free policy suggest broad agreement but reflect concerns about enforcement, boundaries, non-smokers and designated areas. Consistent and systematic processes for implementation, maintenance and enforcement of policy goals, and cessation support, is needed to create a non-smoking culture on university campuses."
https://openalex.org/W3080206296,"Some organisms, like Trichomonas vaginalis, contain mitochondria-related hydrogen-producing organelles, called hydrogenosomes. The protein targeting into these organelles is proposed to be similar to the well-studied mitochondria import. Indeed, S. cerevisiae mitochondria and T. vaginalis hydrogenosomes share some components of protein import complexes. However, it is still unknown whether targeting signals directing substrate proteins to hydrogenosomes can support in other eukaryotes specific mitochondrial localization. To address this issue, we investigated the intracellular localization of three hydrogenosomal tail-anchored proteins expressed in yeast cells. We observed that these proteins were targeted to both mitochondria and ER with a variable dependency on the mitochondrial MIM complex. Our results suggest that the targeting signal of TA proteins are only partially conserved between hydrogenosomes and yeast mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W3080440813,"Taiep rat is a myelin mutant with a progressive motor syndrome characterized by tremor, ataxia, immobility episodes, epilepsy and paralysis of the hindlimbs. Taiep had an initial hypomyelination followed by a progressive demyelination associated with an increased expression of some interleukins and their receptors. The pathology correlated with an increase in nitric oxide activity and lipoperoxidation. In base of the above evidences taiep rat is an appropriate model to study neuroimmune interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the immune responses in male taiep rats after acute infection with Trichinella spiralis. Our results show that there is an important decrease in the number of intestinal larvae in the taiep rat with respect to Sprague-Dawley control rats. We also found differences in the percentage of innate and adaptive immune cell profile in the mesenteric lymphatic nodes and the spleen that correlated with the demyelination process that took place on taiep subjects. Finally, a clear pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern was seen on infected taiep rats, that could be responsible of the decrement in the number of larvae number. These results sustain the theory that neuroimmune interaction is a fundamental process capable of modulating the immune response, particularly against the parasite Trichinella spiralis in an animal model of progressive demyelination due to tubulinopathy, that could be an important mechanism for the clinical course of autoimmune diseases associated with parasite infection."
https://openalex.org/W3081363769,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) poses a significant but heterogeneous burden to individuals and healthcare systems. Policymakers develop targeted policies to minimize this burden but need personalized tools to evaluate novel interventions and target them to subpopulations most likely to benefit. We developed a platform to identify subgroups that are at increased risk of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and mortality and to provide stratified patient input in economic evaluations of COPD interventions. We relied on administrative and survey data from Ontario, Canada and applied a combination of microsimulation and multi-state modeling methods. We illustrated the functionality of the platform by quantifying outcomes across smoking status (current, former, never smokers) and by estimating the effect of smoking cessation on resource use and survival, by comparing outcomes of hypothetical cohorts of smokers who quit at diagnosis and smokers that continued to smoke post diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 37.9% (95% CI: 34.9, 41.4) for never smokers, 34.7% (95% CI: 32.1, 36.9) for current smokers, and 46.4% (95% CI: 43.6, 49.0) for former smokers, at 14 years. Over 14 years, smokers who did not quit at diagnosis had 16.3% (95% CI: 9.6, 38.4%) more COPD-related emergency department visits than smokers who quit at diagnosis. In summary, we combined methods from clinical and economic modeling to create a novel tool that policymakers and health economists can use to inform future COPD policy decisions and quantify the effect of modifying COPD risk factors on resource utilization and morality."
