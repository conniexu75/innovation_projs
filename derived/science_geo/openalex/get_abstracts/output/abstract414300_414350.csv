https://openalex.org/W2159327312,"Biodiversity data derive from myriad sources stored in various formats on many distinct hardware and software platforms. An essential step towards understanding global patterns of biodiversity is to provide a standardized view of these heterogeneous data sources to improve interoperability. Fundamental to this advance are definitions of common terms. This paper describes the evolution and development of Darwin Core, a data standard for publishing and integrating biodiversity information. We focus on the categories of terms that define the standard, differences between simple and relational Darwin Core, how the standard has been implemented, and the community processes that are essential for maintenance and growth of the standard. We present case-study extensions of the Darwin Core into new research communities, including metagenomics and genetic resources. We close by showing how Darwin Core records are integrated to create new knowledge products documenting species distributions and changes due to environmental perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2088820074,"Full-length human protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli was initially found to generate only ω-N(G)-monomethylated arginine residues in small peptides, suggesting that it is a type III enzyme. A later study, however, characterized fusion proteins of PRMT7 expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as a type II/type I enzyme, capable of producing symmetrically dimethylated arginine (type II activity) as well as small amounts of asymmetric dimethylarginine (type I activity). We have sought to clarify the enzymatic activity of human PRMT7. We analyzed the in vitro methylation products of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PRMT7 fusion protein with robust activity using a variety of arginine-containing synthetic peptides and protein substrates, including a GST fusion with the N-terminal domain of fibrillarin (GST-GAR), myelin basic protein, and recombinant human histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Regardless of the methylation reaction conditions (incubation time, reaction volume, and substrate concentration), we found that PRMT7 only produces ω-N(G)-monomethylarginine with these substrates. In control experiments, we showed that mammalian GST-PRMT1 and Myc-PRMT5 were, unlike PRMT7, able to dimethylate both peptide P-SmD3 and SmB/D3 to give the expected asymmetric and symmetric products, respectively. These experiments show that PRMT7 is indeed a type III human methyltransferase capable of forming only ω-N(G)-monomethylarginine, not asymmetric ω-N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine or symmetric ω-N(G),N(G')-dimethylarginine, under the conditions tested."
https://openalex.org/W2119511951,"Rust fungi are obligate biotrophic pathogens that cause considerable damage on crop plants. Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat stem rust, and Melampsora larici-populina, the poplar leaf rust pathogen, have strong deleterious impacts on wheat and poplar wood production, respectively. Filamentous pathogens such as rust fungi secrete molecules called disease effectors that act as modulators of host cell physiology and can suppress or trigger host immunity. Current knowledge on effectors from other filamentous plant pathogens can be exploited for the characterisation of effectors in the genome of recently sequenced rust fungi. We designed a comprehensive in silico analysis pipeline to identify the putative effector repertoire from the genome of two plant pathogenic rust fungi. The pipeline is based on the observation that known effector proteins from filamentous pathogens have at least one of the following properties: (i) contain a secretion signal, (ii) are encoded by in planta induced genes, (iii) have similarity to haustorial proteins, (iv) are small and cysteine rich, (v) contain a known effector motif or a nuclear localization signal, (vi) are encoded by genes with long intergenic regions, (vii) contain internal repeats, and (viii) do not contain PFAM domains, except those associated with pathogenicity. We used Markov clustering and hierarchical clustering to classify protein families of rust pathogens and rank them according to their likelihood of being effectors. Using this approach, we identified eight families of candidate effectors that we consider of high value for functional characterization. This study revealed a diverse set of candidate effectors, including families of haustorial expressed secreted proteins and small cysteine-rich proteins. This comprehensive classification of candidate effectors from these devastating rust pathogens is an initial step towards probing plant germplasm for novel resistance components."
https://openalex.org/W2016456139,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) regulates genes involved in lipid and bile acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, and blood coagulation. In addition to its metabolic role, HNF4α is critical for hepatocyte differentiation, and loss of HNF4α is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The hepatocyte-specific Hnf4a knock-out mouse develops severe hepatomegaly and steatosis resulting in premature death, thereby limiting studies of the role of this transcription factor in the adult animal. In addition, gene compensation may complicate analysis of the phenotype of these mice. To overcome these issues, an acute Hnf4a knock-out mouse model was generated through use of the tamoxifen-inducible ErT2cre coupled to the serum albumin gene promoter. Microarray expression analysis revealed up-regulation of genes associated with proliferation and cell cycle control only in the acute liver-specific Hnf4α-null mouse. BrdU and ki67 staining confirmed extensive hepatocyte proliferation in this model. Proliferation was associated with induction of the hepatomitogen Bmp7 as well as reduced basal apoptotic activity. The p53/p63 apoptosis effector gene Perp was further identified as a direct HNF4α target gene. These data suggest that HNF4α maintains hepatocyte differentiation in the adult healthy liver, and its loss may directly contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma development, thus indicating this factor as a possible liver tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1983820999,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in humans are classified into the five main families named Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled and Secretin according to the GRAFS classification. Previous results show that these mammalian GRAFS families are well represented in the Metazoan lineages, but they have not been shown to be present in Fungi. Here, we systematically mined 79 fungal genomes and provide the first evidence that four of the five main mammalian families of GPCRs, namely Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Glutamate and Frizzled, are present in Fungi and found 142 novel sequences between them. Significantly, we provide strong evidence that the Rhodopsin family emerged from the cAMP receptor family in an event close to the split of Opisthokonts and not in Placozoa, as earlier assumed. The Rhodopsin family then expanded greatly in Metazoans while the cAMP receptor family is found in 3 invertebrate species and lost in the vertebrates. We estimate that the Adhesion and Frizzled families evolved before the split of Unikonts from a common ancestor of all major eukaryotic lineages. Also, the study highlights that the fungal Adhesion receptors do not have N-terminal domains whereas the fungal Glutamate receptors have a broad repertoire of mammalian-like N-terminal domains. Further, mining of the close unicellular relatives of the Metazoan lineage, Salpingoeca rosetta and Capsaspora owczarzaki, obtained a rich group of both the Adhesion and Glutamate families, which in particular provided insight to the early emergence of the N-terminal domains of the Adhesion family. We identified 619 Fungi specific GPCRs across 79 genomes and revealed that Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota phylum have Metazoan-like GPCRs rather than the GPCRs specific for Fungi. Overall, this study provides the first evidence of the presence of four of the five main GRAFS families in Fungi and clarifies the early evolutionary history of the GPCR superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1977328931,"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses targeting specific HIV proteins, in particular Gag, have been associated with relative control of viral replication in vivo. However, Gag-specific CTL can also be detected in individuals who do not control the virus and it remains thus unclear how Gag-specific CTL may mediate the beneficial effects in some individuals but not in others. Here, we used a 10mer peptide set spanning HIV Gag-p24 to determine immunogen-specific T-cell responses and to assess functional properties including functional avidity and cross-reactivity in 25 HIV-1 controllers and 25 non-controllers without protective HLA class I alleles. Our data challenge the common belief that Gag-specific T cell responses dominate the virus-specific immunity exclusively in HIV-1 controllers as both groups mounted responses of comparable breadths and magnitudes against the p24 sequence. However, responses in controllers reacted to lower antigen concentrations and recognized more epitope variants than responses in non-controllers. These cross-sectional data, largely independent of particular HLA genetics and generated using direct ex-vivo samples thus identify T cell responses of high functional avidity and with broad variant reactivity as potential functional immune correlates of relative HIV control."
https://openalex.org/W2028324018,"Deciphering molecular mechanisms that control epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to our understanding of how tumor cells become invasive and competent for intravasation. We have established that transforming growth factor β activates Smad proteins, which induce expression of the embryonic factor high mobility group A2 (HMGA2), which causes mesenchymal transition. HMGA2 associates with Smad complexes and induces expression of an established regulator of EMT, the zinc finger transcription factor Snail. We now show that HMGA2 can also induce expression of a second regulator of EMT, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist. Silencing of endogenous Twist demonstrated that this protein acts in a partially redundant manner together with Snail. Double silencing of Snail and Twist reverts mesenchymal HMGA2-expressing cells to a more epithelial phenotype when compared with single silencing of Snail or Twist. Furthermore, HMGA2 can directly associate with A:T-rich sequences and promote transcription from the Twist promoter. The new evidence proposes a model whereby HMGA2 directly induces multiple transcriptional regulators of the EMT program and, thus, is a potential biomarker for carcinomas displaying EMT during progression to more advanced stages of malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2073415403,"Infectious diseases have contributed to the decline and local extinction of several wildlife species, including African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). Mitigating such disease threats is challenging, partly because uncertainty about disease dynamics makes it difficult to identify the best management approaches. Serious impacts on susceptible populations most frequently occur when generalist pathogens are maintained within populations of abundant (often domestic) ""reservoir"" hosts, and spill over into less abundant host species. If this is the case, disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate. However, pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important, and may not be controllable by managing another host species.We investigated interspecific and intraspecific transmission routes, by comparing African wild dogs' exposure to six canine pathogens with behavioural measures of their opportunities for contact with domestic dogs and with other wild dogs. Domestic dog contact was associated with exposure to canine parvovirus, Ehrlichia canis, Neospora caninum and perhaps rabies virus, but not with exposure to canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus. Contact with other wild dogs appeared not to increase the risk of exposure to any of the pathogens.These findings, combined with other data, suggest that management directed at domestic dogs might help to protect wild dog populations from rabies virus, but not from canine distemper virus. However, further analyses are needed to determine the management approaches--including no intervention--which are most appropriate for each pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2040253373,"Measurement of blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration is a routine procedure. Using a non-invasive point-of-care device reduces pain and discomfort for the patient and allows time saving in patient care. The aims of the present study were to assess the concordance of Hb levels obtained non-invasively with the Pronto-7 monitor (version 2.1.9, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, USA) or with the NBM-200MP monitor (Orsense, Nes Ziona, Israel) and the values obtained from the usual colorimetric method using blood samples and to determine the source of discordance.We conducted two consecutive prospective open trials enrolling patients presenting in the emergency department of a university hospital. The first was designed to assess Pronto-7™ and the second NBM-200MP™. In each study, the main outcome measure was the agreement between both methods. Independent factors associated with the bias were determined using multiple linear regression. Three hundred patients were prospectively enrolled in each study. For Pronto-7™, the absolute mean difference was 0.56 g.L(-1) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 0.69) with an upper agreement limit at 2.94 g.L(-1) (95% CI [2.70;3.19]), a lower agreement limit at -1.84 g.L(-1) (95% CI [-2.08;-1.58]) and an intra-class correlation coefficient at 0.80 (95% CI [0.74;0.84]). The corresponding values for the NBM-200MP™ were 0.21 [0.02;0.39], 3.42 [3.10;3.74], -3.01 [-3.32;-2.69] and 0.69 [0.62;0.75]. Multivariate analysis showed that age and laboratory values of hemoglobin were independently associated with the bias when using Pronto-7™, while perfusion index and laboratory value of hemoglobin were independently associated with the bias when using NBM-200MP™.Despite a relatively limited bias in both cases, the large limits of agreement found in both cases render the clinical usefulness of such devices debatable. For both devices, the bias is independently and inversely associated with the true value of hemoglobin.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01321580 and NCT01321593."
https://openalex.org/W2041993659,"Dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are best known as endosymbionts of corals and other invertebrate as well as protist hosts, but also exist free-living in coastal environments. Despite their importance in marine ecosystems, less than 10 loci have been used to explore phylogenetic relationships in this group, and only the multi-copy nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2 have been used to characterize fine-scale genetic diversity within the nine clades (A-I) that comprise the genus. Here, we describe a three-step molecular approach focused on 1) identifying new candidate genes for phylogenetic analysis of Symbiodinium spp., 2) characterizing the phylogenetic relationship of these candidate genes from DNA samples spanning eight Symbiodinium clades (A-H), and 3) conducting in-depth phylogenetic analyses of candidate genes displaying genetic divergences equal or higher than those within the ITS-2 of Symbiodinium clade C. To this end, we used bioinformatics tools and reciprocal comparisons to identify homologous genes from 55,551 cDNA sequences representing two Symbiodinium and six additional dinoflagellate EST libraries. Of the 84 candidate genes identified, 7 Symbiodinium genes (elf2, coI, coIII, cob, calmodulin, rad24, and actin) were characterized by sequencing 23 DNA samples spanning eight Symbiodinium clades (A-H). Four genes displaying higher rates of genetic divergences than ITS-2 within clade C were selected for in-depth phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that calmodulin has limited taxonomic utility but that coI, rad24, and actin behave predictably with respect to Symbiodinium lineage C and are potential candidates as new markers for this group. The approach for targeting candidate genes described here can serve as a model for future studies aimed at identifying and testing new phylogenetically informative genes for taxa where transcriptomic and genomics data are available."
https://openalex.org/W1982412636,"Triglyceride accumulation in nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) results from unbalanced lipid metabolism which, in the liver, is controlled by several transcription factors. The Foxa subfamily of winged helix/forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors comprises three members which play important roles in controlling both metabolism and homeostasis through the regulation of multiple target genes in the liver, pancreas and adipose tissue. In the mouse liver, Foxa2 is repressed by insulin and mediates fasting responses. Unlike Foxa2 however, the role of Foxa1 in the liver has not yet been investigated in detail. In this study, we evaluate the role of Foxa1 in two human liver cell models, primary cultured hepatocytes and HepG2 cells, by adenoviral infection. Moreover, human and rat livers were analyzed to determine Foxa1 regulation in NAFL. Results demonstrate that Foxa1 is a potent inhibitor of hepatic triglyceride synthesis, accumulation and secretion by repressing the expression of multiple target genes of these pathways (e.g., GPAM, DGAT2, MTP, APOB). Moreover, Foxa1 represses the fatty acid transporter protein FATP2 and lowers fatty acid uptake. Foxa1 also increases the breakdown of fatty acids by inducing peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation and ketone body synthesis. Finally, Foxa1 is able to largely up-regulate UCP1, thereby dissipating energy and consistently decreasing the mitochondria membrane potential. We also report that human and rat NAFL have a reduced Foxa1 expression, possibly through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. We conclude that Foxa1 is an antisteatotic factor that coordinately tunes several lipid metabolic pathways to block triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes. However, Foxa1 is down-regulated in human and rat NAFL and, therefore, increasing Foxa1 levels could protect from steatosis. Altogether, we suggest that Foxa1 could be a novel therapeutic target for NAFL disease and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2088100200,"Background Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki is a small ornithopod dinosaur known from thousands of bones and several ontogenetic stages. It was found in a single locality within the Tendaguru Formation of southeastern Tanzania, possibly representing a single herd. Dysalotosaurus provides an excellent case study for examining variation in bone microstructure and life history and helps to unravel the still mysterious growth pattern of small ornithopods. Methodology/Principal Findings Five different skeletal elements were sampled, revealing microstructural variation between individuals, skeletal elements, cross sectional units, and ontogenetic stages. The bone wall consists of fibrolamellar bone with strong variability in vascularization and development of growth cycles. Larger bones with a high degree of utilization have high relative growth rates and seldom annuli/LAGs, whereas small and less intensively used bones have lower growth rates and a higher number of these resting lines. Due to the scarcity of annuli/LAGs, the reconstruction of the life history of Dysalotosaurus was carried out using regularly developed and alternating slow and fast growing zones. Dysalotosaurus was a precocial dinosaur, which experienced sexual maturity at ten years, had an indeterminate growth pattern, and maximum growth rates comparable to a large kangaroo. Conclusions/Significance The variation in the bone histology of Dysalotosaurus demonstrates the influence of size, utilization, and shape of bones on relative growth rates. Annuli/LAGs are not the only type of annual growth cycles that can be used to reconstruct the life history of fossil vertebrates, but the degree of development of these lines may be of importance for the reconstruction of paleobehavior. The regular development of annuli/LAGs in subadults and adults of large ornithopods therefore reflects higher seasonal stress due to higher food demands, migration, and altricial breeding behavior. Small ornithopods often lack regularly developed annuli/LAGs due to lower food demands, no need for migration, and precocial behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1977960609,"Human morning and evening chronotypes differ in their preferred timing for sleep and wakefulness, as well as in optimal daytime periods to cope with cognitive challenges. Recent evidence suggests that these preferences are not a simple by-product of socio-professional timing constraints, but can be driven by inter-individual differences in the expression of circadian and homeostatic sleep-wake promoting signals. Chronotypes thus constitute a unique tool to access the interplay between those processes under normally entrained day-night conditions, and to investigate how they impinge onto higher cognitive control processes. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed the influence of chronotype and time-of-day on conflict processing-related cerebral activity throughout a normal waking day. Sixteen morning and 15 evening types were recorded at two individually adapted time points (1.5 versus 10.5 hours spent awake) while performing the Stroop paradigm. Results show that interference-related hemodynamic responses are maintained or even increased in evening types from the subjective morning to the subjective evening in a set of brain areas playing a pivotal role in successful inhibitory functioning, whereas they decreased in morning types under the same conditions. Furthermore, during the evening hours, activity in a posterior hypothalamic region putatively involved in sleep-wake regulation correlated in a chronotype-specific manner with slow wave activity at the beginning of the night, an index of accumulated homeostatic sleep pressure. These results shed light into the cerebral mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences of higher-order cognitive state maintenance under normally entrained day-night conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2093760409,"Oxidative stress and atherosclerosis-related vascular disorders are risk factors for cognitive decline with aging. In a small clinical study in men, testosterone improved cognitive function; however, it is unknown how testosterone ameliorates the pathogenesis of cognitive decline with aging. Here, we investigated whether the cognitive decline in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), which exhibits cognitive impairment and hypogonadism, could be reversed by testosterone, and the mechanism by which testosterone inhibits cognitive decline. We found that treatment with testosterone ameliorated cognitive function and inhibited senescence of hippocampal vascular endothelial cells of SAMP8. Notably, SAMP8 showed enhancement of oxidative stress in the hippocampus. We observed that an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, SIRT1, played an important role in the protective effect of testosterone against oxidative stress-induced endothelial senescence. Testosterone increased eNOS activity and subsequently induced SIRT1 expression. SIRT1 inhibited endothelial senescence via up-regulation of eNOS. Finally, we showed, using co-culture system, that senescent endothelial cells promoted neuronal senescence through humoral factors. Our results suggest a critical role of testosterone and SIRT1 in the prevention of vascular and neuronal aging."
https://openalex.org/W2013349646,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a widely distributed tick-borne member of the Nairovirus genus (Bunyaviridae) with a high mortality rate in humans. CCHFV induces a severe disease in infected patients that includes, among other symptoms, massive liver necrosis and failure. The interaction between liver cells and CCHFV is therefore important for understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. Here, we described the in vitro CCHFV-infection and -replication in the hepatocyte cell line, Huh7, and the induced cellular and molecular response modulation. We found that CCHFV was able to infect and replicate to high titres and to induce a cytopathic effect (CPE). We also observed by flow cytometry and real time quantitative RT-PCR evidence of apoptosis, with the participation of the mitochondrial pathway. On the other hand, we showed that the replication of CCHFV in hepatocytes was able to interfere with the death receptor pathway of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found in CCHFV-infected cells the over-expression of PUMA, Noxa and CHOP suggesting the crosstalk between the ER-stress and mitochondrial apoptosis. By ELISA, we observed an increase of IL-8 in response to viral replication; however apoptosis was shown to be independent from IL-8 secretion. When we compared the induced cellular response between CCHFV and DUGV, a mild or non-pathogenic Nairovirus for humans, we found that the most striking difference was the absence of CPE and apoptosis. Despite the XBP1 splicing and PERK gene expression induced by DUGV, no ER-stress and apoptosis crosstalk was observed. Overall, these results suggest that CCHFV is able to induce ER-stress, activate inflammatory mediators and modulate both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways of apoptosis in hepatocyte cells, which may, in part, explain the role of the liver in the pathogenesis of CCHFV."
https://openalex.org/W2038558872,"Background The St. Lucia Estuary, Africa's largest estuarine lake, is currently experiencing unprecedented freshwater deprivation which has resulted in a northward gradient of drought effects, with hypersaline conditions in its northern lakes. Methodology/Principal Findings This study documents the changes that occurred in the biotic communities at False Bay from May 2010 to June 2011, in order to better understand ecosystem functioning in hypersaline habitats. Few zooplankton taxa were able to withstand the harsh environmental conditions during 2010. These were the flatworm Macrostomum sp., the harpacticoid copepod Cletocamptus confluens, the cyclopoid copepod Apocyclops cf. dengizicus and the ciliate Fabrea cf. salina. In addition to their exceptional salinity tolerance, they were involved in a remarkably simple food web. In June 2009, a bloom of an orange-pigmented cyanobacterium (Cyanothece sp.) was recorded in False Bay and persisted uninterruptedly for 18 months. Stable isotope analysis suggests that this cyanobacterium was the main prey item of F. cf. salina. This ciliate was then consumed by A. cf. dengizicus, which in turn was presumably consumed by flamingos as they flocked in the area when the copepods attained swarming densities. On the shore, cyanobacteria mats contributed to a population explosion of the staphylinid beetle Bledius pilicollis. Although zooplankton disappeared once salinities exceeded 130, many taxa are capable of producing spores or resting cysts to bridge harsh periods. The hypersaline community was disrupted by heavy summer rains in 2011, which alleviated drought conditions and resulted in a sharp increase in zooplankton stock and diversity. Conclusions/Significance Despite the current freshwater deprivation crisis, the False Bay region has shown to be resilient, harboring a unique biodiversity with species that are capable of enduring harsh environmental conditions. However, further freshwater deprivation may extend beyond the physiological thresholds of this community, as well as other unique biodiversity components which this system sustains."
https://openalex.org/W2069950833,"Hsp27 belongs to the heat shock protein family and displays chaperone properties in stress conditions by holding unfolded polypeptides, hence avoiding their inclination to aggregate. Hsp27 is often referenced as an anti-cancer therapeutic target, but apart from its well-described ability to interfere with different stresses and apoptotic processes, its role in non-stressed conditions is still not well defined. In the present study we report that three polypeptides (histone deacetylase HDAC6, transcription factor STAT2 and procaspase-3) were degraded in human cancerous cells displaying genetically decreased levels of Hsp27. In addition, these proteins interacted with Hsp27 complexes of different native size. Altogether, these findings suggest that HDAC6, STAT2 and procaspase-3 are client proteins of Hsp27. Hence, in non stressed cancerous cells, the structural organization of Hsp27 appears to be a key parameter in the regulation by this chaperone of the level of specific polypeptides through client-chaperone type of interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2075200248,"Our understanding of how value-related information is encoded in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is based mainly on the responses of individual putative dopamine neurons. In contrast to cortical areas, the nature of coordinated interactions between groups of VTA neurons during motivated behavior is largely unknown. These interactions can strongly affect information processing, highlighting the importance of investigating network level activity. We recorded the activity of multiple single units and local field potentials (LFP) in the VTA during a task in which rats learned to associate novel stimuli with different outcomes. We found that coordinated activity of VTA units with either putative dopamine or GABA waveforms was influenced differently by rewarding versus aversive outcomes. Specifically, after learning, stimuli paired with a rewarding outcome increased the correlation in activity levels between unit pairs whereas stimuli paired with an aversive outcome decreased the correlation. Paired single unit responses also became more redundant after learning. These response patterns flexibly tracked the reversal of contingencies, suggesting that learning is associated with changing correlations and enhanced functional connectivity between VTA neurons. Analysis of LFP recorded simultaneously with unit activity showed an increase in the power of theta oscillations when stimuli predicted reward but not an aversive outcome. With learning, a higher proportion of putative GABA units were phase locked to the theta oscillations than putative dopamine units. These patterns also adapted when task contingencies were changed. Taken together, these data demonstrate that VTA neurons organize flexibly as functional networks to support appetitive and aversive learning."
https://openalex.org/W2039610940,"GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Mutations in GPR56 cause a devastating human brain malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). Using the N-terminal fragment of GPR56 (GPR56(N)) as a probe, we have recently demonstrated that collagen III is the ligand of GPR56 in the developing brain. In this report, we discover a new functional domain in GPR56(N), the ligand binding domain. This domain contains four disease-associated mutations and two N-glycosylation sites. Our study reveals that although glycosylation is not required for ligand binding, each of the four disease-associated mutations completely abolish the ligand binding ability of GPR56. Our data indicates that these four single missense mutations cause BFPP mostly by abolishing the ability of GPR56 to bind to its ligand, collagen III, in addition to affecting GPR56 protein surface expression as previously shown."
https://openalex.org/W1970565358,"Post-mortem studies suggest that GABAergic neurotransmission is impaired in schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear if these changes occur early during development and how they impact overall network activity. To investigate this, we used a mouse model of prenatal infection with the viral mimic, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly I:C), a model based on epidemiological evidence that an immune challenge during pregnancy increases the prevalence of schizophrenia in the offspring. We found that prenatal infection reduced the density of parvalbumin- but not somatostatin-positive interneurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and strongly reduced the strength of inhibition early during postnatal development. Furthermore, using an intact hippocampal preparation in vitro, we found reduced theta oscillation generated in the CA1 area. Taken together, these results suggest that redistribution in excitatory and inhibitory transmission locally in the CA1 is associated with a significant alteration in network function. Furthermore, given the role of theta rhythm in memory, our results demonstrate how a risk factor for schizophrenia can affect network function early in development that could contribute to cognitive deficits observed later in the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1982885689,"Background Urban environments generate constant loud noise, which creates a formidable challenge for many animals relying on acoustic communication. Some birds make vocal adjustments that reduce auditory masking by altering, for example, the frequency (kHz) or timing of vocalizations. Another adjustment, well documented for birds under laboratory and natural field conditions, is a noise level-dependent change in sound signal amplitude (the ‘Lombard effect’). To date, however, field research on amplitude adjustments in urban environments has focused exclusively on bird song. Methods We investigated amplitude regulation of alarm calls using, as our model, a successful urban ‘adapter’ species, the Noisy miner, Manorina melanocephala. We compared several different alarm calls under contrasting noise conditions. Results Individuals at noisier locations (arterial roads) alarm called significantly more loudly than those at quieter locations (residential streets). Other mechanisms known to improve sound signal transmission in ‘noise’, namely use of higher perches and in-flight calling, did not differ between site types. Intriguingly, the observed preferential use of different alarm calls by Noisy miners inhabiting arterial roads and residential streets was unlikely to have constituted a vocal modification made in response to sound-masking in the urban environment because the calls involved fell within the main frequency range of background anthropogenic noise. Conclusions The results of our study suggest that a species, which has the ability to adjust the amplitude of its signals, might have a ‘natural’ advantage in noisy urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W2016064204,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is endemic in many hospital settings, including nursing homes. It is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes mortality and an economic burden to patients, hospitals, and the community. The epidemiology of the bacteria in nursing homes is both hospital- and community-like. Transmission occurs via hands of health care workers (HCWs) and direct contacts among residents during social activities. In this work, mathematical modeling in both deterministic and stochastic frameworks is used to study dissemination of MRSA among residents and HCWs, persistence and prevalence of MRSA in a population, and possible means of controlling the spread of this pathogen in nursing homes. The model predicts that: (i) without strict screening and decolonization of colonized individuals at admission, MRSA may persist; (ii) decolonization of colonized residents, improving hand hygiene in both residents and HCWs, reducing the duration of contamination of HCWs, and decreasing the resident∶staff ratio are possible control strategies; (iii) the mean time that a resident remains susceptible since admission may be prolonged by screening and decolonization treatment in colonized individuals; (iv) in the stochastic framework, the total number of colonized residents varies and may increase when the admission of colonized residents, the duration of colonization, the average number of contacts among residents, or the average number of contacts that each resident requires from HCWs increases; (v) an introduction of a colonized individual into an MRSA-free nursing home has a much higher probability of leading to a major outbreak taking off than an introduction of a contaminated HCW."
https://openalex.org/W2016617900,"Background Disease transmission patterns are needed to inform public health interventions, but remain largely unknown for avian influenza H5N1 virus infections. A recent study on the 139 outbreaks detected in Indonesia between 2005 and 2009 found that the type of exposure to sources of H5N1 virus for both the index case and their household members impacted the risk of additional cases in the household. This study describes the disease transmission patterns in those outbreak households. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared cases (n = 177) and contacts (n = 496) in the 113 sporadic and 26 cluster outbreaks detected between July 2005 and July 2009 to estimate attack rates and disease intervals. We used final size household models to fit transmission parameters to data on household size, cases and blood-related household contacts to assess the relative contribution of zoonotic and human-to-human transmission of the virus, as well as the reproduction number for human virus transmission. The overall household attack rate was 18.3% and secondary attack rate was 5.5%. Secondary attack rate remained stable as household size increased. The mean interval between onset of subsequent cases in outbreaks was 5.6 days. The transmission model found that human transmission was very rare, with a reproduction number between 0.1 and 0.25, and the upper confidence bounds below 0.4. Transmission model fit was best when the denominator population was restricted to blood-related household contacts of index cases. Conclusions/Significance The study only found strong support for human transmission of the virus when a single large cluster was included in the transmission model. The reproduction number was well below the threshold for sustained transmission. This study provides baseline information on the transmission dynamics for the current zoonotic virus and can be used to detect and define signatures of a virus with increasing capacity for human-to-human transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1987146709,"The directed forgetting paradigm is frequently used to determine the ability to voluntarily suppress information. However, little is known about brain areas associated with information to forget. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine brain activity during the encoding and retrieval phases of an item-method directed forgetting recognition task with neutral verbal material in order to apprehend all processing stages that information to forget and to remember undergoes. We hypothesized that regions supporting few selective processes, namely recollection and familiarity memory processes, working memory, inhibitory and selection processes should be differentially activated during the processing of to-be-remembered and to-be-forgotten items. Successful encoding and retrieval of items to remember engaged the entorhinal cortex, the hippocampus, the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, the left inferior parietal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus; this set of regions is well known to support deep and associative encoding and retrieval processes in episodic memory. For items to forget, encoding was associated with higher activation in the right middle frontal and posterior parietal cortex, regions known to intervene in attentional control. Items to forget but nevertheless correctly recognized at retrieval yielded activation in the dorsomedial thalamus, associated with familiarity-based memory processes and in the posterior intraparietal sulcus and the anterior cingulate cortex, involved in attentional processes."

Although lipids have been implicated in several aspects of invadopodia formation, the contributions of de novo fatty acid synthesis and lipogenesis have not been defined. Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), the committed step of fatty acid synthesis, reduced invadopodia formation in Src-transformed 3T3 (3T3-Src) cells, and also decreased the ability to degrade gelatin. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis through AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation and ACC phosphorylation also decreased invadopodia incidence. The addition of exogenous 16∶0 and 18∶1 fatty acid, products of de novo fatty acid synthesis, restored invadopodia and gelatin degradation to cells with decreased ACC1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of ACC also altered the phospholipid profile of 3T3-Src cells, with the majority of changes occurring in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) species. Exogenous supplementation with the most abundant PC species, 34∶1 PC, restored invadopodia incidence, the ability to degrade gelatin and the ability to invade through matrigel to cells deficient in ACC1 activity. On the other hand, 30∶0 PC did not restore invadopodia and 36∶2 PC only restored invadopodia incidence and gelatin degradation, but not cellular invasion through matrigel. Pharmacological inhibition of ACC also reduced the ability of MDA-MB-231 breast, Snb19 glioblastoma, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells to invade through matrigel. Invasion of PC-3 cells through matrigel was also restored by 34∶1 PC supplementation. Collectively, the data elucidate the novel metabolic regulation of invadopodia and the invasive process by de novo fatty acid synthesis and lipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2099331248,"The intramembrane-cleaving protease γ-secretase catalyzes the last step in the generation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and is a principal therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of γ-secretase is associated with prohibitive side effects due to suppression of Notch processing and signaling. Potentially safer are γ-secretase modulators (GSMs), which are small molecules that selectively lower generation of the highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptides but spare Notch processing. GSMs with nanomolar potency and favorable pharmacological properties have been described, but the molecular mechanism of GSMs remains uncertain and both the substrate amyloid precursor protein (APP) and subunits of the γ-secretase complex have been proposed as the molecular target of GSMs. We have generated a potent photo-probe based on an acidic GSM that lowers Aβ42 generation with an IC50 of 290 nM in cellular assays. By combining in vivo photo-crosslinking with affinity purification, we demonstrated that this probe binds the N-terminal fragment of presenilin (PSEN), the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex, in living cells. Labeling was not observed for APP or any of the other γ-secretase subunits. Binding was readily competed by structurally divergent acidic and non-acidic GSMs suggesting a shared mode of action. These findings indicate that potent acidic GSMs target presenilin to modulate the enzymatic activity of the γ-secretase complex."

The demonstration that channelrhodopsins act as light-gated ion channels was followed by major advances in neuroscience, where ChRs are used for neuronal depolarization and firing of action potentials simply via delivery of short light flashes (5.Boyden E.S.

Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons.Nature. 2007; 450: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). ChRs also suggest hope for certain clinical conditions. For example, ChRs might be employed clinically for recovery of photosensitivity in blind mice with degenerated photoreceptor cells, for deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson disease, for peripheral nerve stimulation and treatment of heart pacing failure, and for modulating synaptic depression and associated fear (9.Fenno L. Yizhar O. Deisseroth K. The development and application of optogenetics.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 389-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although most experiments have been conducted with ChR2 because of superior expression and 2-fold higher cation selectivity, ChR1 is in fact the dominant photoreceptor of the alga. It shows a strongly pH-dependent absorption, reduced inactivation, and a faster photocycle. Because of these specific differences, the analysis of both ChRs is of high interest. channelrhodopsin Volvox ChR D. salina ChR Anabaena sensory rhodopsin bacteriorhodopsin molecular dynamics quantum mechanics molecular mechanics spectroscopy-oriented configuration interaction self-consistent charge density functional tight binding. ChRs are thought to belong to the protein family of microbial rhodopsins, which include rhodopsins of eubacteria, archaea, cyanobacteria, algae, and fungi. Although much knowledge has been gained by recent experimental studies, a deeper understanding of ChR function, including light gating, ion conduction, and color-tuning mechanisms, clearly requires the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure. The only experimental structure available so far has been resolved by electron crystallography at 6 Å resolution (10.Müller M. Bamann C. Bamberg E. Kühlbrandt W. Projection structure of channelrhodopsin-2 at 6 Å resolution by electron crystallography.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 414: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and revealed that ChR2 consists of seven transmembrane helices similar to other microbial rhodopsins. However, because of the low resolution, precise understanding of the position and orientation of each residue is still not available. In fact, the amino acid residues constituting the rhodopsin helices C–G have been identified in the sequences of ChRs. However, the amino acid sequence that constitutes the first two helices has been much less tractable to structural prediction, because sequence alignment of ChRs with other microbial rhodopsins could not be determined uniquely (2.Nagel G. Szellas T. Huhn W. Kateriya S. Adeishvili N. Berthold P. Ollig D. Hegemann P. Bamberg E. Channelrhodopsin-2, a directly light-gated cation-selective membrane channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Commun. 2003; 301: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The disagreement about the arrangement of helices A and B is not only caused by the lower homology with other microbial rhodopsins but also by the charged residues intruding into the transmembrane region. The sequence around the location of the first two helices contains a very high amount of charged amino acids, which are usually thought to be unlikely to be found in a transmembrane helix region. Although such charged residues seem to characterize the channel, they make it difficult to apply a generalized method for structure prediction. In fact, structure prediction programs as SOSUI (11.Mitaku S. Hirokawa T. Tsuji T. Amphiphilicity index of polar amino acids as an aid in the characterization of amino acid preference at membrane-water interfaces.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which is one of the most accurate algorithms for the secondary structure prediction of membrane proteins with accuracy of 80–90%, predict ChRs as proteins with only four or five transmembrane helices. To account for the channel function, however, the situation may be quite different. It is interesting to note that there is a sequence pattern, a 7-residue periodicity, which allows the building of helices with the charged/polar side chains aligned along a quasi one-dimensional chain inside the protein, creating a hydrophilic environment that seems very likely to establish the channel. This sequence pattern could determine the structure of the first two helices, and further help for the alignment comes from the recently discovered sequence of a novel channelrhodopsin (DChR) of the halophilic alga Dunaliella salina, which constitutes an evolutionary link between bacterial rhodopsins as Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) and bacteriorhodopsin (BR), and the ChRs. With the help of these two findings, we are able to propose a three-dimensional structural model of ChR1 and ChR2 based on new experimental data and computational analysis. In the first step, we build a homology model using the DChR sequence and the characteristic sequence pattern of helices A and B. Homology modeling has been successfully applied for structure prediction when the template sequence has high homology with that of the target protein, as recently shown for G protein-coupled receptors (12.Wolf S. Böckmann M. Höweler U. Schlitter J. Gerwert K. Simulations of a G protein-coupled receptor homology model predict dynamic features and a ligand binding site.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3335-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13.Watanabe H.C.

Molecular mechanism of long-range synergetic color tuning between multiple amino acid residues in conger rhodopsin.Biophysics. 2010; 6: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which have seven transmembrane helices similar to the microbial rhodopsins. Based on the ASR structural template, we construct a three-dimensional structural model, which is subjected to extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine its stability and dynamical features. This model allows interpretation of recent experimental findings and has stimulated further site-directed mutational studies in our group, to examine the role of important amino acids in the active site in more detail. The characteristic three-dimensional structure of ChRs (especially in the region of helices A and B) also allows study of the distribution of internal water molecules, which traverse the ChR itself and may be responsible for channel function. Finally, we are able to localize ion binding sites and propose a model for the active site based on combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allow computational reproduction of the excitation energy for ChR1 and ChR2 when applying high level post Hartree-Fock methods (multi-reference configuration interaction) for the QM region. In a first step, we constructed a homology model of ChR2 using the SWISS-MODEL web interface (14.Kiefer F. Arnold K. Künzli M. Bordoli L. Schwede T. The SWISS-MODEL Repository and associated resources.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D387-D392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar) based on the three-dimensional structural template of the ASR x-ray structure (Protein Data Bank code 1xio) (15.Vogeley L. Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Anabaena sensory rhodopsin. A photochromic color sensor at 2.0 A.Science. 2004; 306: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The residue correspondence between ChR2 and ASR was based on the sequence alignment shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Although the cRNA of ChR2 encodes in total 737 amino acids, we made use only of the amino acid residues 49–273 of ChR2, i.e. only those who have a counterpart in the ASR sequence. After the replacement of internal water molecules, the protein and water complex was embedded in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer. The modeling details are described in the supplemental Methods. Because the pKa calculations do not necessarily lead to unambiguous results, we used two different models, the multi-conformer continuum electrostatics (16.Zhu Z. Gunner M.R. Energetics of quinone-dependent electron and proton transfers in Rhodobacter sphaeroides photosynthetic reaction centers.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) model using two different values of the dielectric constant (ϵ = 4.0 and ϵ = 8.0) and the empirical predictions from the PROPKA server (17.Olsson M.H.M. Sondergaard C.R. Rostkowski M. Jensen J.H. PROPKA3: Consistent treatment of internal and surface residues in empirical pK(a) predictions.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011; 7: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The determination of the protonation state of the titratable residues is detailed in the supplemental Methods and supplemental Table S1. The resulting structural model was subjected to extended MD simulations for structural sampling. To avoid an accidental sampling bias, we performed three 50-ns MD simulations with different initial velocities. As a result, we effectively obtained a 150-ns trajectory for the structural analysis and the subsequent QM/MM simulation. All of the MM calculations were performed using GROMACS 4.5 (18.Van Der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. GROMACS. Fast, flexible, and free.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1701-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (11665) Google Scholar), which adopted CHARMM27 potential energy function (19.Feller S.E. Gawrisch K. MacKerell A.D. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipid bilayers. Intrinsic and environmental contributions to their unique physical properties.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The protocol and the setup of the MD simulations are detailed in the supplemental Methods and supplemental Fig. S10. In the QM/MM simulations, all lipid and bulk solvent molecules were removed, and harmonic constraints were imposed on the backbone Cα atoms to suppress global structural disorder. We employ the CHARMM27 force field as implemented in the CHARMM 36a2 (20.Brooks B.R. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Nilsson L. Petrella R.J. Roux B. Won Y. Archontis G. Bartels C. Boresch S.

Jungnickel G. Elsner J. Haugk M. Frauenheim T. Suhai S. Seifert G. Self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding method for simulations of complex materials properties.Phys. Rev. B. 1998; 58: 7260-7268Crossref Scopus (3322) Google Scholar) for the QM region. Self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) has been carefully benchmarked and widely applied in our previous studies to retinal proteins (see the supplemental Methods). To mimic the screening effect of bulk solvent and membrane, the Poisson-Boltzmann charge scaling scheme proposed by Dinner et al. (22.Dinner A.R. Lopez X. Karplus M. A charge-scaling method to treat solvent in QM/MM simulations.Theor. Chem. Acc. 2003; 109: 118-124Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was adopted, where the partial charges of the atoms exposed to bulk phase were scaled. The QM region consists of the retinal, the side chains of Lys-257, Glu-123, Asp-253, and Lys-103 and the closest three water molecules to the Schiff base. As a starting point for the QM/MM geometry optimization and MD simulations, we chose the average structure from the classical MD simulations (see the supplemental Methods). For the vertical excitation energy calculations, we applied multi-reference configuration interaction method called spectroscopy-oriented configuration interaction (SORCI) method (23.Neese F. A spectroscopy oriented configuration interaction procedure.J. Chem. Phys. 2003; 119: 9428-9443Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar) implemented in ORCA 2.8 program. In the calculation, the first order interaction space is divided automatically into weakly and strongly interaction spaces. The former is subjected to a variational treatment, whereas the latter is taken into account using perturbation theory. In the SORCI calculations, Ahlrich's SV(P) basis set was employed, and the threshold parameters Tpre = 10−3, Tsel = 10−6, and Tnat = 10−6 were used. DNA mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II; Agilent Technologies) on an hChR2 (amino acids 1–309)-T159C-mCherry vector and confirmed by sequencing. HEK293 cell culturing and whole cell patch clamp measurements were done as earlier described by Yizhar et al. (24.Yizhar O. Fenno L.E. Prigge M. Schneider F. Davidson T.J. O'Shea D.J. Sohal V.S.

Neocortical excitation/inhibition balance in information processing and social dysfunction.Nature. 2011; 477: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed with FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) 20–28 h prior to the electrical recordings. The external measurement solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The internal solution was composed of 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH was adjusted to 7.2 either using CsOH or HCl). HEK cell whole cell patch clamping was performed with an EPC 7 (HEKA, Elektronik GmbH, Lambrecht, Germany) amplifier, whereas a Polychrome V unit (TILL Photonics, Planegg, Germany) was used as activation light source, resulting in a final photon density of ∼1 × 1022 photons m−2 s−1 at 460 nm on the coverslip. For recording the action spectra, only 50% of the light intensity was used. Excitation wavelength for amplitude determination was 460 nm for all constructs. For experiments in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we used the plasmid DNA of pGEM-ChR11–346 (25.Berthold P. Tsunoda S.P. Ernst O.P. Mages W. Gradmann D. Hegemann P. Channelrhodopsin-1 initiates phototaxis and photophobic responses in Chlamydomonas by immediate light-induced depolarization.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1665-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). cRNA of ChR11–346 (amino acids 1–346) and mutants were synthesized in vitro from NheI-linearized pGEM-ChR1 plasmid by using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine; Ambion) (1.Nagel G.

Oocytes from female X. laevis were injected with 50 nl of cRNA (0.5–1 μg/μl) and incubated in the dark at 18 °C in ORI solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5) in the presence of 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1 μm all-trans-retinal (Sigma). Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements on X. laevis oocytes were performed under conditions described before (26.Ernst O.P. SánchezMurcia P.A. Daldrop P. Tsunoda S.P. Kateriya S. Hegemann P.

Data acquisition and light triggering were controlled with pCLAMP software via DigiData 1322A interfaces (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The microelectrodes were fabricated by pulling borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5-mm outer diameter and 1.17-mm inner diameter) using a micropipette puller (model P-97; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and filled with 3 m KCl. The resistances of microelectrodes were 0.5–1.5 MΩ. A polychrome2 (TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) was used as tunable light source. The light was applied to the oocytes by using a light guide (diameter of 2 mm). The light intensity was 1.5 × 1022 photons s−1 m−2 at the surface of the oocyte. The data obtained were averages of more than three experiments. The solution contained 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm citrate (pH 5.0). Throughout this study the residue numbering of ChRs follows that of ChR2. Correspondences among ChRs based on homology and alignment are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. In the last years, several proposals for sequence alignments of ChRs with BR have been put forward (1.Nagel G. Ollig D. Fuhrmann M. Kateriya S. Musti A.M. Bamberg E. Hegemann P. Channelrhodopsin-1.

Although the position of the helices C–G can be determined quite well because of reasonable sequence homology, the position of the first two helices has remained unresolved because the alignment is highly underdetermined when based on the BR sequence. To include more information for a reasonable modeling, we included the sequences of sensory rhodopsin of the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120 (ASR) and the only recently identified channelrhodopsin sequences of Mesostigma (28.Govorunova E.G.

Moreover, the intracellular part of ASR is more hydrophilic and contains more water than other microbial rhodopsins (15.Vogeley L. Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Luecke H.

DChR in turn might serve as an evolutionary link between algae and halophilic archaea, which lives in symbiosis with Dunaliella supplemental Table S4. Finally, Mesostigma ChR is of interest because Mesostigma is evolutionary distant from Chlamydomonas, Volvox, and Dunaliella and therefore could highlight residues that are essential for channel function. The most interesting feature of the ChR sequences is the large number of charged residues in the potential region of the first two helices, which are Glu-82, Glu-83, Glu-90, Lys-93, Glu-97, His-100, Glu-101, Asp-103, and Glu-104 in ChR1 and ChR2. Glu-82, Glu-90, and Glu-101 are completely conserved in all six known ChRs (Fig. 1). These residues posed a large problem for many of the earlier alignments, because they were either placed in a loop or inside the helices, being partially oriented toward the membrane. However, their spacing shows a very interesting periodicity: charged residues appear at every seventh amino acid site in the series Glu-83, Glu-90, Glu-97, and Glu-104 (and for Lys-93 and His-100 as well). In an α-helix this periodicity locates the residues on top of each other, forming a chain of charged residues; because the α-helix contains 3.6 residues per turn, each amino acid residue rotates 100° in the helix, and the side chains of every seventh residue in an α-helix roughly point in the same direction. This remarkable feature strongly suggests a functional significance. First, it allows all charged side chains to have an inward orientation that is clearly favored from an energetic perspective. Charges pointing toward the hydrophobic lipid environment can be assumed to be highly unfavorable. This is highlighted in supplemental Fig. S2, where a helical wheel representation is given. Second, the inward oriented chain of charged groups creates a hydrophilic environment, which is likely to be solvated with water molecules. In fact, as will be shown below, such a structure is readily flooded by waters in a MD simulation, forming a water channel that connects the extracellular with the intracellular bulk phase and is only interrupted in the dark state by the retinal moiety. Note, that such a periodicity can also be observed for the aromatic residues, Tyr-43, Tyr-57, Tyr-64, and Phe-71 in BR, and these first three residues belong to helix B. These residues in BR can then be thought of preventing such a water file in BR, which can be seen as a major difference between the pump BR and the channels ChR1 and ChR2. To build a structural model for the ChRs based on this finding, we identified several amino acids in helix B of the BR and ASR template structures that point toward the protein interior and are separated by six residues. These are Glu-36, Tyr-37, Ala-40, Ile-43, Pro-44, Ser-47, Ala-50, Tyr-51, and Met-54 in the ASR structure and Phe-42, Tyr-43, Thr-46, Val-49, Pro-50, Ala-53, Met-56, and Tyr-57 in the BR structure. Interestingly, only two alignments satisfy the condition that the charged sites in ChRs coincide with the inside-orientated sites in ASR (Fig. 1, models A and B). However, it is difficult to decide which of the two alignments, which differ by a sequence shift of seven residues, is a better candidate for helix B. Therefore, we have constructed two model structures using both alignments for further investigation. In a second step, we considered a model for helix A that shows a reduced homology between DChR and ASR compared with helix B. Although it contains no prominent charged residues, one still can identify a seven-residue periodicity for polar amino acid residues between residues 52 and 73 of ChR2, which we propose to constitute helix A. There are two groups exhibiting such a periodicity: the first one consisting of Ser-52, Ala-59 (threonine in ChR1), Leu-66 (glutamine in DChR2), and Gln-73 and the second one consisting of Gln-56, Ser-63, and Tyr-70 (see supplemental Fig. S1). The residues should prefer an inward orientation similar to the charged ones in helix B. The side chains of helix A in BR with inward orientation are numbered as: 9, 13, 16, 20, 23, 24, 27, and 30 (4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 19, 22, and 25 in ASR). With this information, the alignment of helix A can be determined uniquely because the two groups of residues in ChRs can be nicely matched with the corresponding ones from BR and ASR. Based on the ASR crystal structure as template, we have built two three-dimensional structural models of ChR2 based on the two different alignments for helix B (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S3). Model A at first sight seems favorable compared to model B because the gap region between helix B and helix C is smaller, which is generally preferred by conventional alignment techniques and all glutamic acid residues from Glu-82 to Glu-104 reside in the helical region, which is not the case for alignment B (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S3). Further, Glu-82, Ile-89, and Asp-103 would be conserved for all ChRs (except VChR2 with Val-89) and ASR when using model A. Considering an evolutionary relationship between ASR and DChR, the latter may be considered as a link between the ChRs and ASR. This relation would support model B: DChR then would have a high homology with the ChRs but also substantial homology with ASR identified in three doublets Leu-91/Val-92, Ile-98/Trp-99, and Ala-106/Met-107 in DChR and Leu-38/Val-39, Ile-45/Trp-46, and Ala-53/Met-54 in ASR (Fig. 1). From the homology model, we generated a th"

However, expression pattern of spliced non-coding transcripts of HERV-H is not clear.In this study, expression of HERV-H spliced transcripts in colon cancer was investigated by a RT-PCR strategy using primers targeting the tRNA(His) primer-binding site and the R region in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), followed by cloning and sequencing of the amplicons. Sequences were then assigned to individual HERV-H loci by employing private nucleotide differences between loci. Different expression patterns of HERV-H spliced transcripts from distinct active elements were found in colon cancer cell lines HT29, LS 174T, RKO, SW480 and SW620. Furthermore, the expression patterns in SW480 and RKO were significantly changed by demethylation treatment. Interestingly, more HERV-H elements were found to be transcriptionally active in colon tumor tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (14 vs. 7).This is the first research to study the character of expression of non-coding spliced transcripts of HERV-H elements in colon cancer. Expression patterns of HERV-H spliced transcripts differed among colon cancer cell lines and could be affected by genomic DNA methylation levels. More importantly, besides the commonly accepted view of up-regulation of HERV-H expression in colon tumor tissues, we found more active HERV-H loci in colon tumor as compared with adjacent normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2029935428,"The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Trio encodes two DH-PH domains that catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rac1, RhoG and RhoA. The N-terminal DH-PH domain is known to activate Rac1 and RhoG, whereas the C-terminal DH-PH domain can activate RhoA. The current study shows that the N-terminal DH-PH domain, upon expression in HeLa cells, activates Rac1 and RhoG independently from each other. In addition, we show that the flanking SH3 domain binds to the proline-rich region of the C-terminus of Rac1, but not of RhoG. However, this SH3 domain is not required for Rac1 or RhoG GDP-GTP exchange. Rescue experiments in Trio-shRNA-expressing cells showed that the N-terminal DH-PH domain of Trio, but not the C-terminal DH-PH domain, restored fibronectin-mediated cell spreading and migration defects that are observed in Trio-silenced cells. Kymograph analysis revealed that the N-terminal DH-PH domain, independent of its SH3 domain, controls the dynamics of lamellipodia. Using siRNA against Rac1 or RhoG, we found that Trio-D1-induced lamellipodia formation required Rac1 but not RhoG expression. Together, we conclude that the GEF Trio is responsible for lamellipodia formation through its N-terminal DH-PH domain in a Rac1-dependent manner during fibronectin-mediated spreading and migration."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation (DCEAS) could enhance the antidepressant efficacy in the early phase of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods In this single-blind, randomized, controlled study, patients with MDD were randomly assigned to 9-session DCEAS or noninvasive electroacupuncture (n-EA) control procedure in combination with fluoxetine (FLX) for 3 weeks. Clinical outcomes were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) as well as the response and remission rates. Results Seventy-three patients were randomly assigned to n-EA (n = 35) and DCEAS (n = 38), of whom 34 in n-EA and 36 in DCEAS group were analyzed. DCEAS-treated patients displayed a significantly greater reduction from baseline in HAMD-17 scores at Day 3 through Day 21 and in SDS scores at Day 3 and Day 21 compared to patients receiving n-EA. DCEAS intervention also produced a higher rate of clinically significant response compared to n-EA procedure (19.4% (7/36) vs. 8.8% (3/34)). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. Conclusions DCEAS is a safe and effective intervention that augments the antidepressant efficacy. It can be considered as an additional therapy in the early phase of SSRI treatment of depressed patients. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN88008690"
https://openalex.org/W2033356822,"Mice with targeted deletion of STAT3 in CD4(+) T-cells do not develop experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) or experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in part, because they cannot generate pathogenic Th17 cells. In this study, we have used ORLL-NIH001, a small synthetic compound that inhibits transcriptional activity of STAT3, to ameliorate EAU, an animal model of human posterior uveitis. We show that by attenuating inflammatory properties of uveitogenic lymphocytes, ORLL-NIH001 inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the retina during EAU and prevented the massive destruction of the neuroretina caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the autoreactive lymphocytes. Decrease in disease severity observed in ORLL-NIH001-treated mice, correlated with the down-regulation of α4β1 and α4β7 integrin activation and marked reduction of CCR6 and CXCR3 expression, providing a mechanism by which ORLL-NIH001 mitigated EAU. Furthermore, we show that ORLL-NIH001 inhibited the expansion of human Th17 cells, underscoring its potential as a drug for the treatment of human uveitis. Two synthetic molecules that target the Th17 lineage transcription factors, RORγt and RORα, have recently been suggested as potential drugs for inhibiting Th17 development and treating CNS inflammatory diseases. However, inhibiting STAT3 pathways completely blocks Th17 development, as well as, prevents trafficking of inflammatory cells into CNS tissues, making STAT3 a more attractive therapeutic target. Thus, use of ORLL-NIH001 to target the STAT3 transcription factor, thereby antagonizing Th17 expansion and expression of proteins that mediate T cell chemotaxis, provides an attractive new therapeutic approach for treatment of posterior uveitis and other CNS autoimmune diseases mediated by Th17 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2060472218,"Background Breast to bone metastases frequently induce a “vicious cycle” in which osteoclast mediated bone resorption and proteolysis results in the release of bone matrix sequestered factors that drive tumor growth. While osteoclasts express numerous proteinases, analysis of human breast to bone metastases unexpectedly revealed that bone forming osteoblasts were consistently positive for the proteinase, MMP-2. Given the role of MMP-2 in extracellular matrix degradation and growth factor/cytokine processing, we tested whether osteoblast derived MMP-2 contributed to the vicious cycle of tumor progression in the bone microenvironment. Methodology/Principal Findings To test our hypothesis, we utilized murine models of the osteolytic tumor-bone microenvironment in immunocompetent wild type and MMP-2 null mice. In longitudinal studies, we found that host MMP-2 significantly contributed to tumor progression in bone by protecting against apoptosis and promoting cancer cell survival (caspase-3; immunohistochemistry). Our data also indicate that host MMP-2 contributes to tumor induced osteolysis (μCT, histomorphometry). Further ex vivo/in vitro experiments with wild type and MMP-2 null osteoclast and osteoblast cultures identified that 1) the absence of MMP-2 did not have a deleterious effect on osteoclast function (cd11B isolation, osteoclast differentiation, transwell migration and dentin resorption assay); and 2) that osteoblast derived MMP-2 promoted tumor survival by regulating the bioavailability of TGFβ, a factor critical for cell-cell communication in the bone (ELISA, immunoblot assay, clonal and soft agar assays). Conclusion/Significance Collectively, these studies identify a novel “mini-vicious cycle” between the osteoblast and metastatic cancer cells that is key for initial tumor survival in the bone microenvironment. In conclusion, the findings of our study suggest that the targeted inhibition of MMP-2 and/or TGFβ would be beneficial for the treatment of bone metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2092318838,"Activation of β(2)-adrenegic receptor (β(2)-AR) leads to an increase in intracellular cAMP and activation of ERK. These two signals are activated by the interaction of the receptor with different transducer partners. We showed that the intrinsic activities of β(2)-AR ligands for stimulating cAMP production and ERK phosphorylation responses in HEK-293 cells were not correlated. The lack of correlation resulted mainly from the discrepancy between the intrinsic activities of two groups of ligands for these two responses: The first group consisted of clenbuterol, cimaterol, procaterol, and terbutaline which acted as full agonists for cAMP production but displayed very weak effect on ERK phosphorylation. The second group comprised adrenaline and noradrenaline which displayed higher intrinsic activity for the ERK phosphorylation than for the cAMP response. Thus, both groups behaved as functionally selective ligands. The functional selectivity of the first group was observable only in adherent cells when confluence was approximately 100%. When cell-cell contact was minimized either by decreasing the density of the adherent cells or by bringing the cells into suspension, the first group of ligands gained the ability to stimulate ERK phosphorylation without a change in their effect on cAMP production. In contrast, selectivity of the second group was independent of the adherence state of the cells. Our results show that the inherent ""bias"" of ligands in coupling a G protein-coupled receptor to different transducers may not always be revealed as functional selectivity when there is a ""cross-talk"" between the signaling pathways activated by the same receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1964879350,"Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are extracellular proteins found in insect chemosensilla, where they participate in the sensing of odors, tastes, and pheromones. Although a large number of OBP genes have been identified in insect genomes, their molecular functions and biological roles have been clarified in limited cases. Two OBP genes, Obp57d and Obp57e, were involved in the evolution of host-plant preference in Drosophila sechellia. Comparative analyses of the Obp57d/e genomic sequences from 27 closely related species suggested that the two genes arose by tandem gene duplication and functionally diverged from each other. In this study, the functional evolution of Obp57d and Obp57e was examined by in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins synthesized in a bacterial system. Compared to the ancestral Dpse\OBP57de, Dmel\OBP57d was more specialized to tridecanoic acid while Dmel\OBP57e was generalized regarding their binding affinity, suggesting that the two OBP genes underwent subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. A behavioral analysis using knockout flies supported that the biological role is different between OBP57d and OBP57e in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis of the evolutionarily conserved amino acids revealed that these residues play an important role in protein folding. These findings provide a clue to understanding how the repertoire of OBP genes is maintained in a genome under natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W2066685073,"Background Zoonotic diseases account for over 60% of all communicable diseases causing illness in humans and 75% of recently emerging infectious diseases. As limited resources are available for the control and prevention of zoonotic diseases, it is necessary to prioritize diseases in order to direct resources into those with the greatest needs. The selection of criteria for prioritization has traditionally been on the basis of expert opinion; however, details of the methods used to identify criteria from expert opinion often are not published and a full range of criteria may not be captured by expert opinion. Methodology/Principal Findings This study used six focus groups to identify criteria for the prioritization of zoonotic diseases in Canada. Focus groups included people from the public, animal health professionals and human health professionals. A total of 59 criteria were identified for prioritizing zoonotic diseases. Human-related criteria accounted for the highest proportion of criteria identified (55%), followed by animal-related criteria (26%) then pathogen/disease-related criteria (19%). Similarities and differences were observed in the identification and scoring of criteria for disease prioritization between groups; the public groups were strongly influenced by the individual-level of disease burden, the responsibility of the scientific community in disease prioritization and the experiences of recent events while the professional groups were influenced by the societal- and population-level of disease burden and political and public pressure. Conclusions/Significance This was the first study to describe a mixed semi-quantitative and qualitative approach to deriving criteria for disease prioritization. This was also the first study to involve the opinion of the general public regarding disease prioritization. The number of criteria identified highlights the difficulty in prioritizing zoonotic diseases. The method presented in this paper has formulated a comprehensive list of criteria that can be used to inform future disease prioritization studies."
https://openalex.org/W2091230629,"Poke weed mitogen (PWM), a lectin purified from Phytolacca americana is frequently used as a B cell-specific stimulus to trigger proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. In the present study we investigated the mechanisms underlying the B cell stimulatory capacity of PWM. Strikingly, we observed that highly purified PWM preparations failed to induce B cell proliferation. By contrast, commercially available PWM preparations with B cell activity contained Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as TLR2-active lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharide and DNA of bacterial origin. We show that these microbial substances contribute to the stimulatory activity of PWM. Additional experimental data highlight the capacity of PWM to enable B cell activation by immunostimulatory DNA. Based on these findings we propose that the lectin sensitizes B cells for TLR stimulation as described for B cell receptor ligation and that B cell mitogenicity of PWM preparations results from synergistic activity of the poke weed lectin and microbial TLR ligands present in the PWM preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2159690126,"In S. pombe, about 5% of genes are meiosis-specific and accumulate little or no mRNA during vegetative growth. Here we use Affymetrix tiling arrays to characterize transcripts in vegetative and meiotic cells. In vegetative cells, many meiotic genes, especially those induced in mid-meiosis, have abundant antisense transcripts. Disruption of the antisense transcription of three of these mid-meiotic genes allowed vegetative sense transcription. These results suggest that antisense transcription represses sense transcription of meiotic genes in vegetative cells. Although the mechanism(s) of antisense mediated transcription repression need to be further explored, our data indicates that RNAi machinery is not required for repression. Previously, we and others used non-strand specific methods to study splicing regulation of meiotic genes and concluded that 28 mid-meiotic genes are spliced only in meiosis. We now demonstrate that the “unspliced” signal in vegetative cells comes from the antisense RNA, not from unspliced sense RNA, and we argue against the idea that splicing regulates these mid-meiotic genes. Most of these mid-meiotic genes are induced in mid-meiosis by the forkhead transcription factor Mei4. Interestingly, deletion of a different forkhead transcription factor, Fkh2, allows low levels of sense expression of some mid-meiotic genes in vegetative cells. We propose that vegetative expression of mid-meiotic genes is repressed at least two independent ways: antisense transcription and Fkh2 repression."

This deficit improves after dopamine (DA) treatment and it has been associated with decreased internal timekeeper speed, disruption of executive function and memory retrieval dysfunction.The aim of the present study was to explore the neurophysiologic correlates of this deficit. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging on twelve PD patients while they were performing a time reproduction task (TRT). The TRT consisted of an encoding phase (during which visual stimuli of durations from 5 s to 16.6 s, varied at 8 levels were presented) and a reproduction phase (during which interval durations were reproduced by a button pressing). Patients were scanned twice, once while on their DA medication (ON condition) and once after medication withdrawal (OFF condition). Differences in Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal in ON and OFF conditions were evaluated. The time course of activation in the brain areas with different BOLD signal was plotted. There were no significant differences in the behavioral results, but a trend toward overestimation of intervals ≤11.9 s and underestimation of intervals ≥14.1 s in the OFF condition (p<0.088). During the reproduction phase, higher activation in the precuneus was found in the ON condition (p<0.05 corrected). Time course was plotted separately for long (≥14.1 s) and short (≤11.9 s) intervals. Results showed that there was a significant difference only in long intervals, when activity gradually decreased in the OFF, but remained stable in the ON condition. This difference in precuneus activation was not found during random button presses in a control task.Our results show that differences in precuneus activation during retrieval of a remembered duration may underlie some aspects of time perception deficit in PD patients. We suggest that DA medication may allow compensatory activation in the precuneus, which results in a more accurate retrieval of remembered interval duration."

Phosphorylation of TH1 decreases its association with A-Raf and PAK1. Further study reveals that Tyr-6 phosphorylation of TH1 reduces its inhibition on MAPK/ERK signaling, enhances c-Src mediated cell migration.

Although the functional coupling between MtCK and ANT has been demonstrated, the precise mechanism of the coupling is not clear. To study the details of the coupling, we turned to molecular dynamics simulations. We introduce a new coarse-grained molecular dynamics model of a patch of the mitochondrial inner membrane containing a transmembrane ANT and an MtCK above the membrane. The membrane model consists of three major types of lipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin) in a roughly 2:1:1 molar ratio. A thermodynamics-based coarse-grained force field, termed MARTINI, has been used together with the GROMACS molecular dynamics package for all simulated systems in this work. Several physical properties of the system are reproduced by the model and are in agreement with known data. This includes membrane thickness, dimension of the proteins, and diffusion constants. We have studied the binding of MtCK to the membrane and demonstrated the effect of cardiolipin on the stabilization of the binding. In addition, our simulations predict which part of the MtCK protein sequence interacts with the membrane. Taken together, the model has been verified by dynamical and structural data and can be used as the basis for further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2081664753,"Extraction of linguistically relevant auditory features is critical for speech comprehension in complex auditory environments, in which the relationships between acoustic stimuli are often abstract and constant while the stimuli per se are varying. These relationships are referred to as the abstract auditory rule in speech and have been investigated for their underlying neural mechanisms at an attentive stage. However, the issue of whether or not there is a sensory intelligence that enables one to automatically encode abstract auditory rules in speech at a preattentive stage has not yet been thoroughly addressed.We chose Chinese lexical tones for the current study because they help to define word meaning and hence facilitate the fabrication of an abstract auditory rule in a speech sound stream. We continuously presented native Chinese speakers with Chinese vowels differing in formant, intensity, and level of pitch to construct a complex and varying auditory stream. In this stream, most of the sounds shared flat lexical tones to form an embedded abstract auditory rule. Occasionally the rule was randomly violated by those with a rising or falling lexical tone. The results showed that the violation of the abstract auditory rule of lexical tones evoked a robust preattentive auditory response, as revealed by whole-head electrical recordings of the mismatch negativity (MMN), though none of the subjects acquired explicit knowledge of the rule or became aware of the violation.Our results demonstrate that there is an auditory sensory intelligence in the perception of Chinese lexical tones. The existence of this intelligence suggests that the humans can automatically extract abstract auditory rules in speech at a preattentive stage to ensure speech communication in complex and noisy auditory environments without drawing on conscious resources."

In this study, we report the effects of NK-4 on the toxicity of Aβ and on cognitive function and Aβ concentration in a transgenic mouse model of AD (Tg2576). In vitro, NK-4 effectively protected neuronal cells from toxicity induced by Aβ. In addition, it displayed profound inhibitory activities on Aβ fibril formation. In vivo, Tg2576 mice received an intraperitoneal injection at 100 or 500 µg/kg of NK-4 once a day, five times a week for 9 months. Administration of NK-4 to the mice attenuated impairment of recognition memory, associative memory, and learning ability, as assessed by a novel object recognition test, a passive avoidance test, and a water maze test, respectively. NK-4 decreased the brain Aβ concentration while increasing the plasma amyloid level in a dose-dependent manner. NK-4 also improved memory impairments of ICR mice induced by direct intracerebroventricular administration of Aβ. These lines of evidence suggest that NK-4 may affect multiple pathways of amyloid pathogenesis and could be useful for treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2058771504,"Background Pin1 has previously been described to regulate cells that participate in both innate and adaptive immunity. Thus far, however, no role for Pin1 has been described in modulating conventional dendritic cells, innate antigen presenting cells that potently activate naïve T cells, thereby bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. Methodology/Principal Findings When challenged with LPS, Pin1-null mice failed to accumulate spleen conventional dendritic cells (cDC). Analysis of steady-state spleen DC populations revealed that Pin1-null mice had fewer CD8+ cDC. This defect was recapitulated by culturing Pin1-null bone marrow with the DC-instructive cytokine Flt3 Ligand. Additionally, injection of Flt3 Ligand for 9 days failed to induce robust expansion of CD8+ cDC in Pin1-null mice. Upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes, Pin1-null mice were defective in stimulating proliferation of adoptively transferred WT CD8+ T cells, suggesting that decreases in Pin1 null CD8+ cDC may affect T cell responses to infection in vivo. Finally, upon analyzing expression of proteins involved in DC development, elevated expression of PU.1 was detected in Pin1-null cells, which resulted from an increase in PU.1 protein half-life. Conclusions/Significance We have identified a novel role for Pin1 as a modulator of CD8+ cDC development. Consistent with reduced numbers of CD8+ cDC in Pin1-null mice, we find that the absence of Pin1 impairs CD8+ T cell proliferation in response to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that, via regulation of CD8+ cDC production, Pin1 may serve as an important modulator of adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2090195308,"Background The dystrophin gene, which is mutated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), encodes a large cytoskeletal protein present in muscle fibers. While dystrophin in skeletal muscle has been extensively studied, the function of dystrophin in vascular smooth muscle is less clear. Here, we have analyzed the role of dystrophin in injury-induced arterial neointima formation. Methodology/Principal Findings We detected a down-regulation of dystrophin, dystroglycan and β-sarcoglycan mRNA expression when vascular smooth muscle cells de-differentiate in vitro. To further mimic development of intimal lesions, we performed a collar-induced injury of the carotid artery in the mdx mouse, a model for DMD. As compared with control mice, mdx mice develop larger lesions with increased numbers of proliferating cells. In vitro experiments demonstrate increased migration of vascular smooth muscle cells from mdx mice whereas the rate of proliferation was similar in cells isolated from wild-type and mdx mice. Conclusions/Significance These results show that dystrophin deficiency stimulates neointima formation and suggest that expression of dystrophin in vascular smooth muscle cells may protect the artery wall against injury-induced intimal thickening."

By continuously monitoring the actual light output of the LED with a photodiode and feeding the result back to the LED's driver by way of a proportional-integral controller, drift was reduced to as little as 0.007% per hour over a 12-h period, and short-term fluctuations to 0.005% root-mean-square over 10 seconds. The LED can be switched on and off completely within 100 s, a feature that is crucial when visual stimuli and light for optical recording need to be interleaved to obtain artifact-free recordings. The utility of the system is demonstrated by recording visual responses in the central nervous system of the medicinal leech Hirudo verbana using voltage-sensitive dyes."

Principal Findings Genome-wide significant evidence for linkage was identified on chromosome 2p14 with a heterogeneity logarithm of odds (HLOD) score of 3.51 (rs1106577) under a recessive model of inheritance, while suggestive evidence was identified on chr.4q22 (HLOD 2.92, rs1349350, dominant model), chr. 8q24 (HLOD 2.74, rs1618523, recessive model) and chr.16q24 (HLOD 1.93, rs276990 dominant model). Our study also provided moderate evidence for a linkage locus on chromosome 6q24–26 by non-parametric linkage analysis (rs6570858, LOD 1.54, p = 0.004), overlapping a previously reported linkage region on chromosome 6q25–26. Conclusion A genome-wide linkage analysis has identified a new linkage locus on chromosome 2p14 for leprosy in Pedigrees from China."
https://openalex.org/W2031281901,"A new method to develop low-energy folding routes for proteins is presented. The novel aspect of the proposed approach is the synergistic use of optimal control theory with Molecular Dynamics (MD). In the first step of the method, optimal control theory is employed to compute the force field and the optimal folding trajectory for the atoms of a Coarse-Grained (CG) protein model. The solution of this CG optimization provides an harmonic approximation of the true potential energy surface around the native state. In the next step CG optimization guides the MD simulation by specifying the optimal target positions for the atoms. In turn, MD simulation provides an all-atom conformation whose positions match closely the reference target positions determined by CG optimization. This is accomplished by Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD) which uses a bias potential or harmonic restraint in addition to the usual MD potential. Folding is a dynamical process and as such residues make different contacts during the course of folding. Therefore CG optimization has to be reinitialized and repeated over time to accomodate these important changes. At each sampled folding time, the active contacts among the residues are recalculated based on the all-atom conformation obtained from MD. Using the new set of contacts, the CG potential is updated and the CG optimal trajectory for the atoms is recomputed. This is followed by MD. Implementation of this repetitive CG optimization - MD simulation cycle generates the folding trajectory. Simulations on a model protein Villin demonstrate the utility of the method. Since the method is founded on the general tools of optimal control theory and MD without any restrictions, it is widely applicable to other systems. It can be easily implemented with available MD software packages."
https://openalex.org/W2045454864,"Emitted biosonar clicks and auditory evoked potential (AEP) responses triggered by the clicks were synchronously recorded during echolocation in an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) trained to wear suction-cup EEG electrodes and to detect targets by echolocation. Three targets with target strengths of −34, −28, and −22 dB were used at distances of 2 to 6.5 m for each target. The AEP responses were sorted according to the corresponding emitted click source levels in 5-dB bins and averaged within each bin to extract biosonar click-related AEPs from noise. The AEP amplitudes were measured peak-to-peak and plotted as a function of click source levels for each target type, distance, and target-present or target-absent condition. Hearing sensation levels of the biosonar clicks were evaluated by comparing the functions of the biosonar click-related AEP amplitude-versus-click source level to a function of external (in free field) click-related AEP amplitude-versus-click sound pressure level. The results indicated that the dolphin's hearing sensation levels to her own biosonar clicks were equal to that of external clicks with sound pressure levels 16 to 36 dB lower than the biosonar click source levels, varying with target type, distance, and condition. These data may be assumed to indicate that the bottlenose dolphin possesses effective protection mechanisms to isolate the self-produced intense biosonar beam from the animal's ears during echolocation."
https://openalex.org/W2137505958,"During the last decades experimental studies have revealed that single cells of a growing bacterial population are significantly exposed to molecular noise. Important sources for noise are low levels of metabolites and enzymes that cause significant statistical variations in the outcome of biochemical reactions. In this way molecular noise affects biological processes such as nutrient uptake, chemotactic tumbling behavior, or gene expression of genetically identical cells. These processes give rise to significant cell-to-cell variations of many directly observable quantities such as protein levels, cell sizes or individual doubling times. In this study we theoretically explore if there are evolutionary benefits of noise for a growing population of bacteria. We analyze different situations where noise is either suppressed or where it affects single cell behavior. We consider two specific examples that have been experimentally observed in wild-type Escherichia coli cells: (i) the precision of division site placement (at which molecular noise is highly suppressed) and (ii) the occurrence of noise-induced phenotypic variations in fluctuating environments. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that in these specific situations both regulatory schemes [i.e. suppression of noise in example (i) and allowance of noise in example (ii)] do not lead to an increased growth rate of the population. Assuming that the observed regulatory schemes are indeed caused by the presence of noise our findings indicate that the evolutionary benefits of noise are more subtle than a simple growth advantage for a bacterial population in nutrient rich conditions."
