https://openalex.org/W2158701974,"In mammals, the transcription factor SRY, encoded by the Y chromosome, is normally responsible for triggering the indifferent gonads to develop as testes rather than ovaries. However, testis differentiation can occur in its absence. Here we demonstrate in the mouse that a single factor, the forkhead transcriptional regulator FOXL2, is required to prevent transdifferentiation of an adult ovary to a testis. Inducible deletion of Foxl2 in adult ovarian follicles leads to immediate upregulation of testis-specific genes including the critical SRY target gene Sox9. Concordantly, reprogramming of granulosa and theca cell lineages into Sertoli-like and Leydig-like cell lineages occurs with testosterone levels comparable to those of normal XY male littermates. Our results show that maintenance of the ovarian phenotype is an active process throughout life. They might also have important medical implications for the understanding and treatment of some disorders of sexual development in children and premature menopause in women.For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file with the Supplemental Data available online.

Sex determination in vertebrate species exhibits a broad variety of mechanisms based either on genotype or environmental factors (Barske and Capel, 2008Barske L.A. Capel B.

In almost all mammals the heterogametic sex is male, propagated by the inheritance of a Y chromosome. The discovery of a single gene, Sry, on the Y chromosome and its subsequent functional analysis has demonstrated that SRY is necessary and sufficient to initiate testicular development (Koopman et al., 1991Koopman P.

SRY stands at the top of a genetic cascade that directs the differentiation of the bipotential gonad toward a testis fate through activation of its direct target gene Sox9 (Dinapoli and Capel, 2008Dinapoli L.

When misexpressed in XX mice or humans, SOX9, which belongs to the same family of HMG-box transcription factors as SRY but is encoded by an autosomal gene, is also able to induce testis formation (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop C.E.

Bagheri-Fam S. Klattig J. Kist R. Taketo M.M. Englert C. Scherer G. Homozygous inactivation of Sox9 causes complete XY sex reversal in mice.Biol.

Subsequent to gonadal differentiation, the different types and levels of hormones produced by the testes and ovaries dictate the differentiation of most secondary sexual characteristics (Wilhelm and Koopman, 2006Wilhelm D. Koopman P. The makings of maleness: towards an integrated view of male sexual development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), others being dependent on the direct action of Y- and X-linked genes (Arnold, 2009Arnold A.P.

Behav. 2009; 55 (discussion 567–579): 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). XX male sex reversal could result from gain of function mutations (GOF) in genes that promote testis development or loss of function mutations (LOF) in genes that oppose them or actively promote ovary development. In humans, most XX males have a functional SRY gene due to abnormal X-Y interchange during male meiosis, however some rare cases lack SRY (Pannetier et al., 2004Pannetier M. Mandon-Pepin B. Copelli S. Fellous M. Molecular aspects of female and male gonadal development in mammals.Pediatr. Endocrinol. Rev. 2004; 1: 274-287PubMed Google Scholar). Duplications affecting SOX9 can be responsible (Huang et al., 1999Huang B. Wang S. Ning Y. Lamb A.N. Bartley J. Autosomal XX sex reversal caused by duplication of SOX9.Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 87: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), a situation that reflects experimental manipulation of mice where complete XX sex reversal can be achieved by ectopic expression in the developing XX gonad of SRY or SOX9, or of other SOX proteins that mimic these (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop C.E. Whitworth D.J. Qin Y. Agoulnik A.I. Agoulnik I.U. Harrison W.R. Behringer R.R. Overbeek P.A. A transgenic insertion upstream of sox9 is associated with dominant XX sex reversal in the mouse.Nat.

Schedl A. Sox9 induces testis development in XX transgenic mice.Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). XX gonads can also show testicular development in culture when treated with FGF9 or prostaglandin D2, both of which are involved in positive autoregulatory loops required to maintain high levels of SOX9 expression or activity (Kim et al., 2006Kim Y.

Hiramatsu R. Mizusaki H. Widjaja L. Combes A.N. Kanai Y. Koopman P. SOX9 regulates prostaglandin D synthase gene transcription in vivo to ensure testis development.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10553-10560Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The common denominator in all these cases of primary XX male sex reversal is the activation of SOX9 in the indifferent gonad. In the mouse, SRY has to function within a narrow time window to upregulate Sox9 otherwise the gene is repressed and ovaries develop (Hiramatsu et al., 2009Hiramatsu R. Matoba S. Kanai-Azuma M. Tsunekawa N. Katoh-Fukui Y. Kurohmaru M. Morohashi K. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. Kanai Y. A critical time window of Sry action in gonadal sex determination in mice.Development. 2009; 136: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Candidates for genes that oppose the male pathway include Nr0b1 (also called Dax1), Wnt4, Rspo1, and Foxl2. DAX1 is thought to recruit corepressors when it is complexed with steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1 or Nr5a1). The latter is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily required for gonadal development in both sexes, but with an especially important role in testis development as it contributes to the activation of male pathway genes, including Sry and Sox9 (Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2008Sekido R. Lovell-Badge R. Sex determination involves synergistic action of SRY and SF1 on a specific Sox9 enhancer.Nature. 2008; 453: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Over-expression of DAX1 can lead to XY female development, however, LOF mutations have not revealed a role in ovaries (Bouma et al., 2005Bouma G.J. Albrecht K.H. Washburn L.L. Recknagel A.K. Churchill G.A. Eicher E.M.

Narvaez V. Burgoyne P. Camerino G. Lovell-Badge R. Dax1 antagonizes Sry action in mammalian sex determination.Nature. 1998; 391: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). WNT4 and RSPO1 both serve to stabilize β-catenin, and ectopic expression of a stable form of β-catenin in XY gonads can lead to ovary development (Maatouk et al., 2008Maatouk D.M. DiNapoli L. Alvers A. Parker K.L. Taketo M.M. Capel B. Stabilization of beta-catenin in XY gonads causes male-to-female sex-reversal.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2949-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, LOF mutations of Wnt4 and Rspo1 in the mouse lead to only partial XX male sex reversal, suggesting that additional factors still ensure that SOX9 activity is repressed (Chassot et al., 2008aChassot A.A.

Heikkila M. Kispert A. Chin N. McMahon A.P. Female development in mammals is regulated by Wnt-4 signalling.Nature. 1999; 397: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Cases of human XX male development have been attributed to homozygous null mutations in RSPO1 (Parma et al., 2006Parma P. Radi O. Vidal V. Chaboissier M.C. Dellambra E. Valentini S. Guerra L. Schedl A. Camerino G. R-spondin1 is essential in sex determination, skin differentiation and malignancy.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), or with LOF mutations in WNT4 associated with SERKAL syndrome (Mandel et al., 2008Mandel H. Shemer R. Borochowitz Z.U. Okopnik M. Knopf C. Indelman M. Drugan A. Tiosano D. Gershoni-Baruch R. Choder M. et al.SERKAL syndrome: an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutation in WNT4.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 39-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which might suggest that human sex determination is more sensitive than mouse to levels of β-catenin. However, care has to be taken in interpreting gonadal phenotypes after birth by which time ovotestes may have resolved into testes, or other secondary changes may have occurred. In Wnt4 mutant XX gonads, Sertoli-like cells begin to appear at late fetal stages and Leydig-like cells increase in number (Vainio et al., 1999Vainio S. Heikkila M. Kispert A. Chin N. McMahon A.P. Female development in mammals is regulated by Wnt-4 signalling.Nature. 1999; 397: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). This was associated with dysgenesis and loss of oocytes, and was thought to reflect other circumstances where Sertoli and Leydig-like cells appear in an XX gonad; for example in Freemartins, or when fetal ovaries are grafted to the kidney capsule, in adult XX mice carrying mutations in both estrogen receptors or in the aromatase gene (Cyp19a1), or in Sertoli/Leydig tumors in postmenopausal women (Couse et al., 1999Couse J.F.

However, in none of these cases has it been shown whether the appearance of Sertoli- and Leydig-like cells in an ovary could be due to transdifferentiation from granulosa and theca cells as suggested by Burgoyne et al., 1988Burgoyne P.S. Buehr M. McLaren A. XY follicle cells in ovaries of XX—-XY female mouse chimaeras.Development. 1988; 104: 683-688PubMed Google Scholar, or differentiation from populations of immature precursor cells. FOXL2 mutations in the human germline lead to the autosomal dominant blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) associated with premature ovarian failure in females (Crisponi et al., 2001Crisponi L. Deiana M. Loi A. Chiappe F. Uda M. Amati P. Bisceglia L. Zelante L. Nagaraja R. Porcu S. et al.The putative forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 is mutated in blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deregulated FoxL2 expression has been described in the goat polled intersex syndrome (PIS) where XX male sex reversal occurs (Pailhoux et al., 2001Pailhoux E. Vigier B. Chaffaux S. Servel N. Taourit S. Furet J.P. Fellous M. Grosclaude F. Cribiu E.P. Cotinot C. et al.A 11.7-kb deletion triggers intersexuality and polledness in goats.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Similarly, global deletion of Foxl2 (Foxl2−/−) during development in mice leads to ovary dysgenesis and infertility (Schmidt et al., 2004Schmidt D. Ovitt C.E. Anlag K. Fehsenfeld S. Gredsted L. Treier A.C. Treier M. The murine winged-helix transcription factor Foxl2 is required for granulosa cell differentiation and ovary maintenance.Development. 2004; 131: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, Uda et al., 2004Uda M. Ottolenghi C. Crisponi L. Garcia J.E. Deiana M. Kimber W. Forabosco A. Cao A. Schlessinger D. Pilia G. Foxl2 disruption causes mouse ovarian failure by pervasive blockage of follicle development.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Although the Foxl2−/− mutant phenotype becomes apparent only late in fetal development with derepression of some testis specific genes, it could reflect the much earlier loss of Foxl2 expression, which is ovary-specific from E12.5 (Ottolenghi et al., 2005Ottolenghi C. Omari S. Garcia-Ortiz J.E. Uda M. Crisponi L. Forabosco A. Pilia G. Schlessinger D. Foxl2 is required for commitment to ovary differentiation.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Schmidt et al., 2004Schmidt D. Ovitt C.E. Anlag K. Fehsenfeld S. Gredsted L. Treier A.C. Treier M. The murine winged-helix transcription factor Foxl2 is required for granulosa cell differentiation and ovary maintenance.Development. 2004; 131: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Understanding the plasticity of an adult ovary at the cellular level and the extent to which “terminally” differentiated gonadal cell types can switch to a new fate would provide molecular insight into not just the maintenance of the differentiated state in the mammalian gonad, but perhaps also well known postnatal sex conversion phenomena in lower vertebrates. Here, we show that upon conditional loss of Foxl2 in the adult ovary the two major female-specific somatic cell lineages switch their cell fate revealing a rare example of true adult lineage reprogramming in vivo. While granulosa cells, which support oocytes, are reprogrammed into testis-specific Sertoli-like cells, the steroidogenic theca cell lineage upregulates 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (Hsd17b3), the rate-limiting enzyme in testosterone biosynthesis resulting in male-like levels of testosterone in the blood. Using a combination of genetically based oocyte-ablation experiments we demonstrate that this reprogramming is cell autonomous and oocyte-independent. We show that FOXL2 represses the testis differentiation program mainly through repression of Sox9-regulatory sequences that are required for its testis-specific expression. We extend our analysis by demonstrating that FOXL2 and estrogen receptor (ESR1) cooperate in Sox9 repression in vivo, consequently providing a mechanism by which loss of estrogen signaling can lead to gonadal sex reversal. To determine FOXL2 function during folliculogenesis in sexually mature female mice we created a conditional allele, flanking the single Foxl2 coding exon with loxP sites. Animals homozygous for this are referred to as Foxl2f/f (Figure S1). We also took advantage of a R26CreERT2 line that allows ubiquitous induction of Cre recombinase activity upon tamoxifen (TM) administration. This gave recombination efficiencies greater than 95% in adult ovaries when crossed to an R26lacZ reporter strain (data not shown). For conditional deletion of Foxl2, 8-week old Foxl2f/f or R26CreERT2;Foxl2f/f female mice were treated for 5 days with TM. Histological examination 3 weeks later unexpectedly revealed gonadal sex reversal in XX R26CreERT2;Foxl2f/f (“conditional mutant”) mice (Figure 1A). Structural changes affected nearly the whole gonad, where the typical follicular structure of the ovary now resembled in appearance the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Some degenerating oocytes were still present whereas in most tubule-like structures germ cells appeared to be lost. Instead of granulosa cells, cells with all the morphological characteristics of testicular Sertoli cells were present. These displayed a prominent basal lamina, tripartite nucleoli and numerous veil-like cytoplasmatic extensions pointing toward the lumen (Figure 1A). To obtain a global view of the extent of lineage reprogramming, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis of wild-type ovaries, reprogrammed sex-reversed ovaries and testes. This revealed a large gene set upregulated and expressed in common between reprogrammed sex-reversed gonads and testes, including well-characterized Sertoli and Leydig cell markers. This substantiated the morphologically observed cell type switch at the molecular level (Figures 1B–1D and Table S1 available online). Foxl2 mRNA was no longer detectable in conditional mutant XX gonads (Figure S2). Consistent with the mRNA profiling, in situ hybridization studies demonstrated robust expression of Sertoli cell markers and genes involved in testis determination including Gata1, Tif2, Dax1, Dhh, Dmrt1, and notably Sox9 (Figure S2). Although Foxl2f/f control ovaries were normal after TM administration, the phenotype seen in the conditional Foxl2 deletion experiment could result from a cooperative effect between Foxl2 loss and a context-dependent antagonistic estrogen activity of TM. To rule out this possibility we used a noninducible Cre-line, in which regulatory sequences from the α-glycoprotein subunit (aGSU) gene drive the expression of Cre in the ovary only after sexual maturation. αGsuCre;Foxl2f/f mice have the same gonadal phenotype (Figure S3), directly demonstrating that deletion of Foxl2 alone is sufficient to cause postnatal sex reversal in the XX gonad. The short time frame of 3 weeks between TM administration and appearance of the somatic sex-reversed phenotype suggested transdifferentiation of granulosa into Sertoli-like cells, but to rule out any developmental and/or hormonal phenomena we examined when the molecular changes first occurred. Whereas 2 days after the start of TM administration FOXL2 was still detected by immunohistochemistry, a day later FOXL2 was absent from XX R26CreERT2;Foxl2f/f but not control gonads (Figure 2A and data not shown). In contrast SOX9 immunostaining first appeared 4 days after the start of TM administration in the former. Thus for a period of about 1 day neither FOXL2 nor SOX9 was detectable by immunohistochemistry suggesting that high expression levels of both factors are mutually exclusive. SOX9 expression started randomly within follicles where it was often first detected in mural but not in cumulus granulosa cells and thus spatially divided from the oocyte (Figure 2A). One week after the start of TM administration SOX9 was expressed in all cells in a typical granulosa cell location, but many had already started to transdifferentiate into Sertoli-like cells despite the presence of an oocyte (Figure 2B). These results strongly suggest that granulosa cells undergo cell autonomous reprogramming into Sertoli-like cells upon loss of Foxl2. In contrast to granulosa cells which undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) at the end of a follicle life cycle, major apoptosis is normally not seen in Sertoli cells. Consistent with this, the Sertoli-like cells in XX conditional mutant gonads do not undergo apoptosis and were still present after 6 months (Figures 2B and 2C). Together these findings further support the notion that true lineage reprogramming has occurred, resulting in a stable cell type conversion. It has been proposed on the basis of indirect evidence that oocytes are required to maintain granulosa cell fate, and that in their absence the latter can transdifferentiate into Sertoli-like cells (Burgoyne et al., 1988Burgoyne P.S. Buehr M. McLaren A. XY follicle cells in ovaries of XX—-XY female mouse chimaeras.Development. 1988; 104: 683-688PubMed Google Scholar, Guigon and Magre, 2006Guigon C.J. Magre S.

Development of the mammalian gonad: the fate of the supporting cell lineage.Bioessays. 1991; 13: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We addressed this possibility by taking advantage of a mouse strain that expresses Cre under the control of Gdf9 regulatory sequences exclusively in oocytes of postnatal ovaries. First, we generated Gdf9Cre;Foxl2f/f mice which were fully fertile demonstrating that FOXL2 does not play a role in oogenesis (data not shown). Next we crossed Gdf9Cre mice with a R26DTA mouse line in which Diphtheria toxin expression is activated upon Cre expression resulting in cell ablation. Gdf9Cre;R26DTA mice were viable and analysis of ovaries from 8-week old females demonstrated a complete absence of oocytes (Figure 3A), yet FOXL2 was still expressed and not SOX9 (Figure 3B). To substantiate this finding further, we compared a set of informative genes by quantitative RT-PCR in 8-week-old wild-type, Gdf9Cre;R26DTA (oocyte-depleted) and conditional mutant ovaries. Unlike the latter, the oocyte-depleted ovaries showed no significant deregulation of Sox9, Foxl2, Dmrt1, HSD17b3, testatin (Cst9) or 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (Hsd17b1), which converts estrone into estradiol (Figure 3C and data not shown). Finally, we ablated oocytes in 8-week old sexually mature female mice in case this had different consequences from deleting oocytes during sexual maturation. In mice, only cells that express the human Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) are susceptible to cell ablation upon Diphtheria toxin (DT) administration. We therefore generated Gdf9Cre;R26iDTR animals and compared their ovaries with those of control R26iDTR mice 9 days after DT administration. This is when follicles activated at the time of DT administration should have reached an antral stage (Hoage and Cameron, 1976Hoage T.R. Cameron I.L. Folliculogenesis in the ovary of the mature mouse: a radioautographic study.Anat. Rec. 1976; 184: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and by when ‘granulosa’ cells in XX R26CreERT2;Foxl2f/f gonads express SOX9 after TM administration. As expected, in control R26iDTR ovaries, TUNEL assays revealed apoptosis in atretic but not preantral follicles. In contrast, both oocytes and surrounding granulosa cells underwent apoptosis in preantral follicles of Gdf9Cre;R26iDTR ovaries with no SOX9 expression detectable (Figure 3D and data not shown). Taken together these experiments demonstrate that granulosa cells become reprogrammed into Sertoli-like cells in XX R26CreERT2;Foxl2f/f gonads upon TM administration in a cell-autonomous way. Moreover, although consistent with oocyte health being essential for follicle growth (Eppig, 2001Eppig J.J. Oocyte control of ovarian follicular development and function in mammals.Reproduction. 2001; 122: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), our findings challenge a long-standing hypothesis in the field that oocytes are directly required to maintain somatic cell identity during ovarian development (Guigon and Magre, 2006Guigon C.J.

Development of the mammalian gonad: the fate of the supporting cell lineage.Bioessays. 1991; 13: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the supporting cell lineages of the testis and ovary arise from a common precursor during development (Albrecht and Eicher, 2001Albrecht K.H. Eicher E.M. Evidence that Sry is expressed in pre-Sertoli cells and Sertoli and granulosa cells have a common precursor.Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In contrast, the origin of the steroidogenic lineages is less clear. Adult Leydig and theca cells are both thought to be recruited from surrounding progenitor populations after birth (Haider, 2004Haider S.G. Cell biology of Leydig cells in the testis.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2004; 233: 181-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, Skinner, 2005Skinner M.K. Regulation of primordial follicle assembly and development.Hum. Reprod.

To ask whether FOXL2-positive gonadal precursor cells give rise to theca cells we generated a Cre replacement allele of the Foxl2 locus termed Foxl2Cre (Figure S1). Using this allele in combination with the R26lacZ reporter we could demonstrate that Foxl2 expressing cells indeed give rise to the theca cell lineage (Figure S4). To further facilitate the analysis of FOXL2 function, we generated a mouse line (Foxl2HAFoxl2) in which the endogenous Foxl2 locus is modified so that FOXL2 is N-terminally tagged with a HA-epitope. These retain full FOXL2 activity as homozygous Foxl2HAFoxl2/HAFoxl2 female mice are fertile (Figure S1 and data not shown). Immunohistochemical detection of HA-tagged FOXL2 protein demonstrated maintenance of FOXL2 expression in theca cells of the adult ovary (Figure S4).

We show that activated platelets release inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a polymer of 60-100 phosphate residues that directly bound to and activated the plasma protease factor XII. PolyP-driven factor XII activation triggered release of the inflammatory mediator bradykinin by plasma kallikrein-mediated kininogen processing. PolyP increased vascular permeability and induced fluid extravasation in skin microvessels of mice. Mice deficient in factor XII or bradykinin receptors were resistant to polyP-induced leakage. PolyP initiated clotting of plasma via the contact pathway. Ablation of intrinsic coagulation pathway proteases factor XII and factor XI protected mice from polyP-triggered lethal pulmonary embolism. Targeting polyP with phosphatases interfered with procoagulant activity of activated platelets and blocked platelet-induced thrombosis in mice. Addition of polyP restored defective plasma clotting of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome patients, who lack platelet polyP. The data identify polyP as a new class of mediator having fundamental roles in platelet-driven proinflammatory and procoagulant disorders."

Itch induced by chloroquine (CQ) is a common side effect of this widely used antimalarial drug. Here, we show that Mrgprs, a family of G protein-coupled receptors expressed exclusively in peripheral sensory neurons, function as itch receptors. Mice lacking a cluster of Mrgpr genes display significant deficits in itch induced by CQ but not histamine. CQ directly excites sensory neurons in an Mrgpr-dependent manner. CQ specifically activates mouse MrgprA3 and human MrgprX1. Loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that MrgprA3 is required for CQ responsiveness in mice. Furthermore, MrgprA3-expressing neurons respond to histamine and coexpress gastrin-releasing peptide, a peptide involved in itch sensation, and MrgprC11. Activation of these neurons with the MrgprC11-specific agonist BAM8-22 induces itch in wild-type but not mutant mice. Therefore, Mrgprs may provide molecular access to itch-selective neurons and constitute novel targets for itch therapeutics.

Therefore, Mrgprs may provide molecular access to itch-selective neurons and constitute novel targets for itch therapeutics. Itch, formally known as pruritus, has been defined as an “unpleasant skin sensation that elicits the desire or reflex to scratch” (Ikoma et al., 2006Ikoma A. Steinhoff M. Stander S. Yosipovitch G. Schmelz M. The neurobiology of itch.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) play an essential role in generating itch by detecting pruritogenic stimuli through their peripheral axons in the skin and mucosal surfaces and sending the signals to the spinal cord via their central axons (Paus et al., 2006Paus R. Schmelz M. Biro T. Steinhoff M. Frontiers in pruritus research: scratching the brain for more effective itch therapy.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1174-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The best-characterized itch mediator is histamine, which is mainly secreted by skin mast cells and excites nearby sensory fibers by acting on histamine receptors (Alving et al., 1991Alving K. Sundstrom C. Matran R. Panula P. Hokfelt T. Lundberg J.M. Association between histamine-containing mast cells and sensory nerves in the skin and airways of control and capsaicin-treated pigs.Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 264: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Histamine-induced itch in humans can be almost completely blocked by histamine receptor H1 antagonists. However, the blockers are ineffective in many other itch conditions, such as those arising from atopic dermatitis, renal and liver diseases, the side effects of drugs, plant toxins, and mechanical stimuli (Paus et al., 2006Paus R. Schmelz M. Biro T. Steinhoff M. Frontiers in pruritus research: scratching the brain for more effective itch therapy.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1174-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These observations, together with other electrophysiological and molecular studies, strongly imply the existence of histamine-independent types of itch (Davidson et al., 2007Davidson S. Zhang X. Yoon C.H. Khasabov S.G. Simone D.A. Giesler Jr., G.J. The itch-producing agents histamine and cowhage activate separate populations of primate spinothalamic tract neurons.J.

A major hurdle to investigating histamine-independent itch is the lack of information about the receptors directly activated by nonhistaminergic pruritogens, as well as molecular markers for itch-sensing neurons in the DRG. Chloroquine (CQ) is a drug that has long been used in the treatment and prevention of malaria. One major side effect of this drug is itch, which is very common among black Africans (up to 70%) but less common in other races. Pruritus is a major cause of noncompliance in the treatment of malaria as ∼30% of African patients refused further CQ treatment because of unbearable itch (Mnyika and Kihamia, 1991Mnyika K.S.

Trop. Med. Parasitol. 2000; 94: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This noncompliance may lead to the development and spread of CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. CQ-induced itch is not considered an allergic reaction since pruritus is seen after first exposure (Ademowo et al., 1998Ademowo O.G. Walker O. Sodeinde O.

The practical and therapeutic implications of chloroquine-induced itching in tropical Africa.Afr. J. Med. Med. Sci. 1977; 6: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, it cannot be treated effectively by antihistamine drugs, suggesting that a histamine-independent pathway is involved (Abila et al., 1994Abila B. Ezeamuzie I.C. Igbigbi P.S. Ambakederemo A.W. Asomugha L. Effects of two antihistamines on chloroquine and histamine induced weal and flare in healthy African volunteers.Afr. J. Med. Med.

Urine methylhistamine concentrations before and after chloroquine in healthy black subjects.J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1990; 93: 423-425PubMed Google Scholar). CQ-induced itch is also well documented in mice. Subcutaneous CQ injection in wild-type (WT) mice acutely evokes a pronounced scratching behavior (Green et al., 2006Green A.D. Young K.K. Lehto S.G. Smith S.B. Mogil J.S. Influence of genotype, dose and sex on pruritogen-induced scratching behavior in the mouse.Pain. 2006; 124: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice lacking gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), which is specifically expressed in dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord, exhibit severely reductions in itch responses evoked by various pruritogens, including CQ (Sun and Chen, 2007Sun Y.G. Chen Z.F. A gastrin-releasing peptide receptor mediates the itch sensation in the spinal cord.Nature. 2007; 448: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with GRPR-expressing dorsal horn neurons selectively ablated showed profound scratching deficits, whereas pain behaviors were unaffected in these animals (Sun et al., 2009Sun Y.G. Zhao Z.Q. Meng X.L. Yin J. Liu X.Y. Chen Z.F. Cellular basis of itch sensation.Science. 2009; 325: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that both GRPR and the second-order neurons in the spinal cord marked by GRPR are important for transmitting itch signals from primary sensory afferents. However, it is unknown whether CQ directly activates primary sensory fibers in the skin and whether cell surface receptors are involved in the process. Several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to be essential in generating itch, including histamine receptors and protease-activated receptors (PARs) (Shim and Oh, 2008Shim W.S. Oh U. Histamine-induced itch and its relationship with pain.Mol. Pain. 2008; 4: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Steinhoff et al., 2003Steinhoff M. Neisius U. Ikoma A. Fartasch M. Heyer G.

Mrgprs (also named Mrg/SNSR) are a family of orphan GPCRs consisting of more than 50 members in the mouse genome that can be grouped into several subfamilies: MrgprA1–A22, MrgprB1–B13, MrgprC1–C14, and MrgprD–G (Dong et al., 2001Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I. Anderson D.J.

USA. 2003; 100: 10043-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the expression of Mrgprs, including MrgprAs, MrgprB4, MrgprB5, MrgprC11, and MrgprD, is restricted to subsets of small-diameter sensory neurons in DRG and trigeminal ganglia and has not been detected in the central nervous system or in the rest of the body (Dong et al., 2001Dong X.

USA. 2003; 100: 10043-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similarly, human MrgprXs are also selectively expressed in DRG neurons (Lembo et al., 2002Lembo P.M. Grazzini E. Groblewski T. O'Donnell D. Roy M.O. Zhang J. Hoffert C. Cao J. Schmidt R. Pelletier M. et al.Proenkephalin A gene products activate a new family of sensory neuron–specific GPCRs.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Mrgprs can be activated by peptides terminating in RF/Y-G or RF/Y-amide, such as molluscan FMRFamide and mammalian neuropeptide FF (NPFF), neuropeptide AF (NPAF), γ2-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ2-MSH), and bovine adrenal medulla peptide (BAM). These peptides can activate heterologously expressed mouse MrgprA1, MrgprA4, and MrgprC11 and human MrgprX1 with different sensitivities (Dong et al., 2001Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I.

The highly restricted expression of these receptors suggests that Mrgprs are likely to be involved in somatosensation, including pain or itch, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that certain Mrgprs function as receptors for CQ and mediate its direct activation of a small subset of DRG neurons and CQ-induced itch. More importantly, CQ-sensitive neurons, comprising only 4%–5% of total DRG neurons, may define a subpopulation of DRG neurons that mediate itch. Many Mrgpr genes are clustered together on mouse chromosome 7 (Dong et al., 2001Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I. Anderson D.J. A diverse family of GPCRs expressed in specific subsets of nociceptive sensory neurons.Cell. 2001; 106: 619-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, Zylka et al., 2003Zylka M.J.

USA. 2003; 100: 10043-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine the function of Mrgprs in vivo while overcoming the potential problem of gene redundancy, we generated a mouse line in which a cluster of Mrgpr genes was deleted (Figures 1A and 1B). The deleted 845 kilobase region comprises ∼30 Mrgpr genes, 12 of which (MrgprA1–A4, A10, A12, A14, A16, A19, B4, B5, and C11) have intact open reading frames (ORFs; Figure 1A). No other ORF is present in this region, according to the Mouse Genome Project. Although the mouse Mrgpr superfamily consists of over 50 members, more than half are pseudogenes, and only ∼24 genes have intact ORFs (Dong et al., 2001Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I.

Therefore, the deleted cluster represents ∼50% of the potentially functional Mrgpr repertoire and contains most MrgprA and MrgprC genes, as well as some members of the MrgprB subfamily. The deleted Mrgpr genes are specifically expressed in DRG (Dong et al., 2001Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I. Anderson D.J.

Atypical expansion in mice of the sensory neuron-specific Mrg G protein-coupled receptor family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 10043-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). MrgprA6, A9, A11, B1, B2, B6, B8, B10, and D–G are not included in this deletion based on the Mouse Genome Project and RT-PCR experiments (data not shown). Notably, MrgprB1 and MrgprB2, which were not deleted, are expressed in the skin but not in DRG (Zylka et al., 2003Zylka M.J. Dong X. Southwell A.L. Anderson D.J. Atypical expansion in mice of the sensory neuron-specific Mrg G protein-coupled receptor family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 10043-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Mating between mice heterozygous for the cluster deletion (Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/+) produced offspring with the expected Mendelian distribution of gender and genotype. Homozygous Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice are viable, fertile, and generally indistinguishable from WT littermates in appearance, body weight, overt behavior, and gross anatomy. The motor function of Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice is also normal as determined by the rotarod test (data not shown). Furthermore, Mrgprs are not required for neuronal survival, fate determination or differentiation of small-diameter sensory neurons (Figure 1C; Supplemental Data available online). Activation of small-diameter sensory neurons in DRG can generate different types of somatosensation, including pain and itch with specific and distinct behavioral responses. For instance, pain and itch cause withdrawal and scratching responses, respectively (Ikoma et al., 2006Ikoma A. Steinhoff M. Stander S. Yosipovitch G. Schmelz M. The neurobiology of itch.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether the deletion of Mrgpr genes affects behavioral responses to pain- and itch-inducing stimuli. Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice responded normally to acute noxious heat, cold, mechanical, and chemical stimulation as compared with WT littermates (Figures 2A–2F). Thus, acute pain sensation appears to be unaffected in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice. In addition, Mrgpr mutant mice exhibited modest but statistically significant increases only at certain testing time points in inflammatory hyperalgesia induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or carrageenen injection. No significant difference was found in neuropathic pain caused by L5 spinal nerve ligation between mutant and wild-type mice (Figure S1). In addition to pain, we evaluated chemically induced itch responses in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice. No significant difference was found between Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− and WT mice in the total number of scratching bouts induced by histamine over a period of 30 min (Figure 2G). Consistent with this result, WT and mutant mice also showed similar responses to compound 48/80, a drug that elicits mast cell degranulation and induces histamine-dependent itch (Kuraishi et al., 1995Kuraishi Y. Nagasawa T. Hayashi K. Satoh M. Scratching behavior induced by pruritogenic but not algesiogenic agents in mice.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 275: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, Nakayama et al., 2002Nakayama Y. Mio M. Sugimoto Y. Fujii Y. Kamei C. Changes in membrane potential induced by compound 48/80 in the peritoneal mast cells of rats.Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 2002; 24: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Figure 2H). These results suggest that Mrgprs are not involved in histamine-dependent itch. Strikingly, itch induced by CQ was strongly reduced in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice. Figure 2I shows the time course of scratching bouts at 5 min intervals after CQ injection. Typically, the first bout was observed within 1 to 2 min after injection, and scratching peaked within 15 min in WT mice. In contrast, Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice showed a delayed occurrence of the first scratching behavior (WT 57.8 ± 25.4 s versus KO 280.5 ± 35.0 s; p = 0.0004). The total number of scratching bouts induced by CQ was 278 ± 21 in WT mice and 104 ± 13 in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice (Figure 2I). Interestingly, injection of a CQ precursor, quinoline, did not evoke any scratching behavior (see below for quinoline's structure and inability of activating Mrgprs) in both WT and mutant mice (Figure 2J). However, immediately after quinoline treatment, CQ injection at the same location induced robust scratching behavior in WT mice, and the number of scratches induced by this treatment was again severely reduced in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice (Figure 2J). These results suggest that CQ-induced itch, but not histaminergic itch, is affected in the cluster deletion mice. Similarly, intradermal injection of CQ in rats evoked profound scratching responses, whereas quinoline did not (Figure S2A). These data provide further evidence that CQ-evoked itch is well conserved. Previous studies have indicated that CQ can cause mast cell degranulation (Green and Lim, 1989Green K.B. Lim H.W. Effects of chloroquine on release of mediators from mast cells.Skin Pharmacol. 1989; 2: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Nosal et al., 1991Nosal R. Drabikova K. Pecivova J. Effect of chloroquine on isolated mast cells.Agents Actions. 1991; 33: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether this effect on mast cells contributes to CQ-evoked scratching behavior, we repeated the experiment on SASH mice, which lack mast cells due to a chromosomal inversion in the regulatory element of the Kit gene (Yamazaki et al., 1994Yamazaki M. Tsujimura T. Morii E. Isozaki K. Onoue H. Nomura S. Kitamura Y. C-kit gene is expressed by skin mast cells in embryos but not in puppies of Wsh/Wsh mice: age-dependent abolishment of c-kit gene expression.Blood. 1994; 83: 3509-3516PubMed Google Scholar). As compared to WT controls, SASH mice exhibited a modest but significant reduction in CQ-induced scratching behavior (Figure 2K). The mast cell deficiency in these mice was confirmed by a dramatic decrease in the level of histamine released upon skin mast cell degranulation (Figure 2L). These results confirm that degranulation of mast cells induced by CQ contributes to scratching behavior, which may account for the residual response to CQ in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice. Since CQ-induced itch is not considered an allergic reaction, we hypothesized, given our results, that this type of itch results from a direct activation of DRG neurons by the drug. If so, then the behavioral deficit seen in mutant mice would be attributed to a loss of CQ responsiveness in primary sensory neurons. Indeed, 1 mM CQ treatment of cultured DRG neurons evoked a robust intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) increase in ∼4%–5% of the cells from WT mice. In contrast, none of the neurons in cultures derived from Mrgpr-deficient mice exhibited any significant response to CQ (Figure 3B). These data indicate that the CQ-evoked [Ca2+]i increases seen in WT DRG cultures reflect specific activation of a subset of cells and that this activation is Mrgpr dependent. In contrast, the percentage of DRG neurons responding to histamine was identical between WT and mutant cultures, consistent with the behavioral data and providing further evidence that histamine-induced itch is unaffected in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice (Figure 3A). We performed additional experiments to further characterize [Ca2+]i increases in WT neurons. Sequential application of CQ caused an ∼20% reduction of calcium responses. In addition, extracellular Ca2+ was necessary for the CQ-induced increase in [Ca2+]i since the CQ effect was almost completely blocked in Ca2+-free bath solution. Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of several TRP channels (Fujita et al., 2007Fujita F. Moriyama T. Higashi T. Shima A. Tominaga M. Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate causes pain sensation through activation of TRPA1 channels.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 151: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), also severely attenuated the effect, indicating that TRPs are likely to be involved in the CQ signaling pathway (Figures 3C and 3D). Signaling via TRP channels has been observed for many GPCRs in DRG neurons, including the histamine and bradykinin receptors (Chuang et al., 2001Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Bradykinin and nerve growth factor release the capsaicin receptor from PtdIns(4,5)P2-mediated inhibition.Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, Shim et al., 2007Shim W.S. Tak M.H. Lee M.H. Kim M. Kim M. Koo J.Y. Lee C.H. Kim M. Oh U. TRPV1 mediates histamine-induced itching via the activation of phospholipase A2 and 12-lipoxygenase.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We also examined whether CQ can directly induce action potentials (APs) in dissociated DRG neurons, using whole-cell patch clamp recording. In WT DRG, all CQ-sensitive neurons (identified by calcium imaging) displayed a train of APs upon subsequent CQ treatment (Figure 3E). In contrast, all neurons that fail to show a calcium response to CQ also failed to generate APs with a similar treatment (n = 14). As in the calcium-imaging experiments, none of 11 size-matched neurons (diameter of ∼20 μm) tested from Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice showed any response to the drug. These studies provide strong evidence that CQ can directly excite a small subpopulation of sensory neurons in DRG and that Mrgprs are required for this effect. Similar to the mouse results, CQ induces robust activation in a subset of rat DRG neurons as determined by both an increase in [Ca2+]i and generation of APs (Figure S2). The Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− behavioral and cellular loss-of-function phenotypes strongly suggest that Mrgprs function as cell-surface receptors for CQ. To test this possibility directly, we examined whether Mrgprs have the ability to confer sensitivity to CQ on heterologous cells. We cloned each of the 12 Mrgprs that were deleted in Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/− mice (Figure 1A) into a mammalian expression vector and transfected them individually into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. By fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C termini of the Mrgpr coding sequences, we were able to visualize both transfected cells and the proper membrane localization of the receptors. Our previous studies demonstrated that GFP does not disturb the normal function of Mrgprs (Dong et al., 2001Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I. Anderson D.J.

Among the 12 mouse Mrgprs, only MrgprA3 conferred a strong response to CQ on HEK cells, whereas the other receptors conferred either weak or no responses to the drug (Figures 4A–4D and 5B, and data not shown). MrgprA1, MrgprA4, and MrgprC11 were activated by their peptide agonists FMRF, NPFF, and BAM8-22, respectively, confirming that they are functional receptors but insensitive to CQ (Figures 4A, 4C, and 4D). Furthermore, MrgprA3-expressing HEK cells did not respond to BAM8-22 or histamine, indicating that MrgprA3 is a specific receptor for CQ (Figure 4B). Conversely, histamine receptor H1-expressing HEK293 cells failed to show any response to CQ (Figure 4F).Figure 5Mrgprs Are Selectively Activated by CQShow full caption(A) Molecules with structures related to CQ.(B–D) Dose-response curves for MrgprA3 (B), MrgprA1 (C), and MrgprX1 (D) expressed in HEK293 cells to the molecules in (A).

Each data point represents the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments, and at least 50 GFP+ cells were analyzed each time. Calcium responses at each ligand concentration were normalized to the maximal response subsequently elicited. The human Mrgpr family (i.e., MrgprXs) is much smaller than the murine family. Although the human and mouse genes share strong sequence homology, they do not form clear orthologous pairs. We found that MrgprX1-expressing HEK293 cells responded to CQ, whereas MrgprX2- and X3-expressing cells were completely insensitive to the drug (Figure 4E and data not shown). Together, these data suggest that CQ directly activates mouse MrgprA3 and human MrgprX1 in heterologous cells with high specificity. In order to determine the lowest concentrations of CQ capable of activating MrgprA3 and X1, we performed dose-response experiments in HEK293 cells. These experiments indicated that the receptors could be activated by the drug at micromolar concentrations with the mouse receptor showing 10-fold higher sensitivity than the human receptor (Figure 5B and 5D). EC50s for MrgprA3 and MrgprX1 are 27.55 ± 2.03 and 297.68 ± 2.10 μM, respectively (see the Discussion regarding the low potency of CQ on MrgprX1). Besides CQ, we also determined the sensitivities of these receptors to other structurally related compounds (i.e., quinoline, quinine, and serotonin) (Figure 5A). Quinoline is used as an intermediate in the production of various compounds including CQ. Despite the presence of a bicyclic structure, quinoline completely failed to activate MrgprA3 and MrgprX1, suggesting that the side chain in CQ is also necessary for"

Delayed aging by IIS reduction protects the nematode C. elegans from toxicity associated with the aggregation of the Alzheimer's disease-linked human peptide, Aβ. We reduced IGF signaling in Alzheimer's model mice and discovered that these animals are protected from Alzheimer's-like disease symptoms, including reduced behavioral impairment, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. This protection is correlated with the hyperaggregation of Aβ leading to tightly packed, ordered plaques, suggesting that one aspect of the protection conferred by reduced IGF signaling is the sequestration of soluble Aβ oligomers into dense aggregates of lower toxicity. These findings indicate that the IGF signaling-regulated mechanism that protects from Aβ toxicity is conserved from worms to mammals and point to the modulation of this signaling pathway as a promising strategy for the development of Alzheimer's disease therapy.

Most cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit sporadic onset during the seventh decade of life or later, whereas the fewer mutation-linked, familial cases typically manifest during the fifth decade. These temporal features, common to numerous neurodegenerative diseases, define aging as the major risk factor for the development of these maladies (Amaducci and Tesco, 1994Amaducci L. Tesco G. Aging as a major risk for degenerative diseases of the central nervous system.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1994; 7: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) pathway regulates stress resistance, aging and is a life span determinant. IIS reduction results in stress-resistant, long-lived worms (Kenyon et al., 1993Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudner A. Tabtiang R.

Delayed aging, by IIS reduction, protects worms from proteotoxicity associated with the aggregation of the Huntington's disease-associated polyQ peptide (Morley et al., 2002Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. The threshold for polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation and cellular toxicity is dynamic and influenced by aging in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Opposing activities protect against age-onset proteotoxicity.Science. 2006; 313: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, little is known about whether this protection from proteotoxicity is conserved from worms to mammals, and what protective mechanisms may be operating. Aβ originates from the endoproteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Glenner and Wong, 1984Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Alzheimer's disease: initial report of the purification and characterization of a novel cerebrovascular amyloid protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Med. 2004; 140: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The serine protease BACE (beta amyloid cleaving enzyme) cleaves APP (Farzan et al., 2000Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Choe H. BACE2, a beta -secretase homolog, cleaves at the beta site and within the amyloid-beta region of the amyloid-beta precursor protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9712-9717Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), followed by an intramembrane cleavage of the resulting fragment by presenilin1 (PS1), an active component of the γ-secretase proteolytic complex (Wolfe et al., 1999Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Two transmembrane aspartates in presenilin-1 required for presenilin endoproteolysis and gamma-secretase activity.Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). These events release the Aβ family of aggregation-prone peptides, including Aβ1-40 and the highly amyloidogenic Aβ1-42. Although compelling data indicate that Aβ aggregation triggers AD, the mechanism leading to the development of the disease is unclear (Selkoe, 2004Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer disease: mechanistic understanding predicts novel therapies.Ann. Intern. Med. 2004; 140: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that it is not fibrils, but small Aβ oligomers lead to toxicity in AD model organisms (Cohen et al., 2006Cohen E. Bieschke J. Perciavalle R.M. Kelly J.W. Dillin A. Opposing activities protect against age-onset proteotoxicity.Science. 2006; 313: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, Lesne et al., 2006Lesne S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R.

In the C. elegans Aβ model (Aβ worms [Link, 1995Link C.D. Expression of human beta-amyloid peptide in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9368-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar]), the protection from human Aβ1-42 proteotoxicity conferred by IIS reduction is dependent upon two transcription factors, heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), which regulates Aβ disaggregation, and DAF-16 (ortholog to FOXO in mammals), which facilitates the formation of larger, less toxic Aβ aggregates. Accordingly, Aβ worms protected from Aβ toxicity by reduced IIS accumulate more large Aβ aggregates and have fewer oligomers than did their unprotected counterparts with normal IIS (Cohen et al., 2006Cohen E. Bieschke J. Perciavalle R.M. Kelly J.W. Dillin A. Opposing activities protect against age-onset proteotoxicity.Science. 2006; 313: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Although reduced IGF signaling extends the life span of mice (Holzenberger et al., 2003Holzenberger M. Dupont J. Ducos B. Leneuve P. Geloen A. Even P.C. Cervera P. Le Bouc Y. IGF-1 receptor regulates lifespan and resistance to oxidative stress in mice.Nature. 2003; 421: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar), IGF-1 infusion protects from Aβ toxicity (Carro et al., 2002Carro E.

Aging. 2006; 27: 1618-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), raising the query of whether IGF signaling reduction or activation protects from Aβ toxicity. To address this question, we created an AD mouse model with reduced IGF signaling by crossing a well-established AD transgenic mouse model (Jankowsky et al., 2001Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Co-expression of multiple transgenes in mouse CNS: a comparison of strategies.Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) with long-lived mice harboring only one Igf1r gene copy (Igf1r+/− mice) (Holzenberger et al., 2003Holzenberger M. Dupont J. Ducos B. Leneuve P. Geloen A. Even P.C. Cervera P. Le Bouc Y. IGF-1 receptor regulates lifespan and resistance to oxidative stress in mice.Nature. 2003; 421: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Igf1r is the mammalian ortholog of the sole worm insulin/IGF receptor daf-2 (Kimura et al., 1997Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. daf-2, an insulin receptor-like gene that regulates longevity and diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Igf1r+/− mice exhibit reduced IGF-1 signaling, are long-lived, oxidative stress resistant, and have reduced body size (Holzenberger et al., 2003Holzenberger M. Dupont J. Ducos B. Leneuve P. Geloen A. Even P.C. Cervera P. Le Bouc Y. IGF-1 receptor regulates lifespan and resistance to oxidative stress in mice.Nature. 2003; 421: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). The AD mouse model expresses two AD-linked mutated transgenes, APPswe (a humanized mouse APP that contains the human Aβ peptide sequence) and human presenilin-1 ΔE9, both driven by the mouse prion protein promoter (hereafter referred to as AD mice) (Jankowsky et al., 2001Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Co-expression of multiple transgenes in mouse CNS: a comparison of strategies.Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The expression of these transgenes results in the production of human Aβ amyloid, plaque formation in the brain, and slow, progressive AD-like symptoms (Jankowsky et al., 2004Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lee M.K. Younkin L.H. Wagner S.L. et al.Mutant presenilins specifically elevate the levels of the 42 residue beta-amyloid peptide in vivo: evidence for augmentation of a 42-specific gamma secretase.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The AD-like mice also exhibit age-onset behavioral impairments, analogous to other AD murine models (Reiserer et al., 2007Reiserer R.S. Harrison F.E. Syverud D.C. McDonald M.P. Impaired spatial learning in the APPSwe + PSEN1DeltaE9 bigenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Genes Brain Behav. 2007; 6: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The AD model is less aggressive than other AD models, exhibiting appearance of Aβ plaques in the brain at 6-7 months of age (Jankowsky et al., 2004Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lee M.K. Younkin L.H. Wagner S.L. et al.Mutant presenilins specifically elevate the levels of the 42 residue beta-amyloid peptide in vivo: evidence for augmentation of a 42-specific gamma secretase.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The slow onset of AD-like symptoms allows for the perturbation of IIS to examine its role in the age onset requirements of the AD-like syndrome. To equalize the genetic background of our mice, we first backcrossed both the AD and Igf1r+/− mouse strains with wild-type 129 females for three generations, followed by four intercrosses between the AD and Igf1r+/− mice. Crossing Igf1r+/− with the AD mice generated offspring of four genotypes (Figure 1A): The original parental genotypes, (1) heterozygous Igf1r+/− (Igfr+/−) and (2) AD mice, which served as internal controls (AD). (3) Congenic siblings that age naturally due to two Igf1r gene copies but carrying neither of the AD transgenes. These animals served as negative internal controls for asymptomatic AD-like disease and natural IGF-1 signaling (WT). Finally, (4) mice harboring both AD transgenes and only one Igf1r gene copy served as the experimental group of focus (AD;Igf1r+/−). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed that the expression levels of the APPswe transgene were nearly identical in brains of AD and AD;Igf1r+/− mice (Figures S1A–S1E available online), indicating that IGF signaling reduction does not effect the expression of the prion protein promoter-driven transgenes. The levels of monomeric Aβ and of the C-terminal APP fragment (APP CTF) were also very similar in AD and AD;Igf1r+/− mice (Figures S1F and S1G). Similarly, reduced IGF signaling did not affect the endogenous α and β secretases (ADAM17 and BACE, respectively) in mouse brains of all genotypes (Figure S1H). Together these results indicate that IGF signaling reduction affected neither the transgene expression nor the levels of the endogenous APP processing enzymes or their activity. As expected, both Igf1r+/− and AD;Igf1r+/−mice were smaller compared with their littermates carrying two Igf1r copies, indicating reduced IGF-1R signaling (Figure S2A) (Holzenberger et al., 2003Holzenberger M. Dupont J. Ducos B. Leneuve P. Geloen A. Even P.C. Cervera P. Le Bouc Y. IGF-1 receptor regulates lifespan and resistance to oxidative stress in mice.Nature. 2003; 421: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Age-onset memory deficiency and impairment of orientation and locomotion are associated with Aβ production in numerous AD murine models (Jensen et al., 2005Jensen M.T. Mottin M.D. Cracchiolo J.R. Leighty R.E. Arendash G.W.

We evaluated whether reduced IGF-1 signaling protects mice from Aβ-associated behavioral impairments using several behavioral assays. As an initial analysis, we used eight animals per genotype and followed their performance in the Morris water maze test at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age, and found the greatest differences among AD, AD;Igf1r+/− animals and their littermate controls at the 9 and 12 month time points (Figures S2B and S2C). At 16 months we observed mortality in the AD group that was not present in the AD;Igf1R+/− mice (data not shown). Thus, we refined our behavioral analysis to the 11-15 month of age using a larger cohort of animals. We measured the learning ability of mice using a Morris water maze with a cued (visible) platform for four consecutive days. As previously reported for other AD model mice (Blanchard et al., 2008Blanchard J. Martel G. Guillou J.L. Nogues X. Micheau J.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the AD mice did not exhibit a learning deficiency compared to their age-matched WT, Igf1r+/−, and AD;Igf1r+/− counterparts (Figure 1B, p > 0.05). In order to test orientation aptitude, we removed the cue from the platform and recorded the latency time required for mice to locate the submerged platform for four consecutive days. At days 2, 3, and 4 of the experiment, AD mice required a significantly (p < 0.05) longer time to find the hidden platform compared to their WT, Igf1r+/−, and AD;Igf1r+/− counterparts (Figure 1C). This indicates that, like other mouse AD models (Jensen et al., 2005Jensen M.T. Mottin M.D. Cracchiolo J.R. Leighty R.E. Arendash G.W.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), orientation capabilities of AD animals are impaired (swim velocities were nearly identical for all genotypes; Figure S2D). Lastly, we tested memory skills by removing the platform from the water maze and recording the number of the crosses of the previous platform location (probe trial). AD mice crossed the platform's previous location significantly (p < 0.05) fewer times than their WT, Igf1r+/−, and most importantly AD;Igf1r+/− counterparts, indicating impaired memory. The observation that AD;Igf1r+/− animals crossed the previous platform location at similar frequencies compared to WT and Igf1r+/− animals suggests partial memory restoration (Figure 1D). Next, we tested the effect of reduced IGF-1 signaling on the motor skills of AD model mice using a Rota-Rod assay. Much like the orientation and memory tests, AD mice performed significantly less well than their age-matched WT, Igf1r+/−, and AD;Igf1r+/− counterparts in this assay (Figure 1E, p < 0.05). Collectively, the behavioral data revealed that AD mice have impaired orientation and memory performance as well as locomotion impairment that can be delayed by reduced IGF-1 signaling. We asked whether the appearance of biological markers associated with AD-like disease in mice was also delayed by reduced IGF signaling. First we tested whether reactive astrocytosis, indicative of neuroinflammation, associated with AD in humans (Mancardi et al., 1983Mancardi G.L. Liwnicz B.H. Mandybur T.I. Fibrous astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of Alzheimer's type.Acta Neuropathol. 1983; 61: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and with Aβ aggregation in brains of AD model mice (Wirths et al., 2008Wirths O.

Utilizing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies, which recognize activated astrocytes (Mancardi et al., 1983Mancardi G.L. Liwnicz B.H. Mandybur T.I. Fibrous astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of Alzheimer's type.Acta Neuropathol. 1983; 61: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we found notably less activated astrocytes in the brains of AD;Igf1r+/− mice compared with age-matched AD mice (Figure 2). This reduction was apparent both in the cortex and hippocampus (Figure 2I), indicating that neuroinflammation is reduced in AD;Igf1r+/− mice compared with age-matched AD mice. Interestingly, whereas the GFAP signal observed in cortices of AD mice was largely diffuse, cortical GFAP staining of AD;Igf1r+/− mice appeared to be focal (compare Figures 2C and 2D), suggesting that neuroinflammation within AD;Igf1r+/− brains is confined to smaller areas than in the brains of AD animals. Neuronal loss is another hallmark of AD in humans (Scheff et al., 1990Scheff S.W. DeKosky S.T. Price D.A. Quantitative assessment of cortical synaptic density in Alzheimer's disease.Neurobiol. Aging. 1990; 11: 29-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and AD model mice (Masliah and Rockenstein, 2000Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Genetically altered transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease.J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2000; 59: 175-183PubMed Google Scholar). We used direct stereological visualization and NeuN immunoreactivity, a marker of neuronal density that declines in AD mice, and found higher NeuN immunoreactivity in the cortices of 12- to 13-month-old AD;Igf1r+/− mice compared to their age-matched AD counterparts (Figure 3). This indicates that reduced IGF signaling protects from neuronal loss. Similar neuronal losses were observed in young (4–5 months of age) and in old (16–17 months) AD but not in AD;Igf1r+/− mice when compared to age-matched control genotypes (Figure S3). Reduced synaptic density is an additional hallmark and probably causative of AD (Hamos et al., 1989Hamos J.E. DeGennaro L.J. Drachman D.A. Synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.Neurology. 1989; 39: 355-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we used the synaptic marker synaptophysin to compare synaptic densities in frontal and hippocampal brain regions of 12- to 13-month-old mice of all genotypes (Hamos et al., 1989Hamos J.E. DeGennaro L.J. Drachman D.A. Synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.Neurology. 1989; 39: 355-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found significantly lower synaptic densities in both brain regions (Figures 3J and 3K, respectively) of AD animals compared with their AD;Igf1r+/− counterparts. These observations confirm that IGF signaling reduction protects mice form Aβ-associated neuronal loss. To explore the mechanism underlying the protection toward behavioral deficiencies conferred by reduced IGF signaling, as well as the protection from inflammation and neuronal loss in mice ectopically expressing mutated AD-linked transgenes, we investigated the nature of Aβ assemblies in brains of AD and AD;Igf1r+/− mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Aβ antibodies (clone 6E10) were used to visualize Aβ plaques in brain sections of AD and AD;Igf1r+/− mice (Figure S4). Consistent with previous results (Jankowsky et al., 2004Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lee M.K. Younkin L.H. Wagner S.L. et al.Mutant presenilins specifically elevate the levels of the 42 residue beta-amyloid peptide in vivo: evidence for augmentation of a 42-specific gamma secretase.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), Aβ plaques could not be detected in brains of young mice (4-5 months old). A few plaques were observed in the brains of 8- to 9-month-old animals, whereas the number of plaques increased in the brains of 12- to 13-month-old AD and AD;Igf1r+/− mice. No background staining was observed in brains of WT or Igf1r+/− mice at any age examined (Figure S4). Thus, reduced IGF signaling has no apparent effect on the onset of plaque formation. Next we used the fluorescent dye Thioflavin-S to visualize amyloid within AD and of AD;Igf1r+/− brains and found nearly identical amyloid load in cortex and hippocampus regions of both genotypes (Figure 4A, panel IX). (Colocalization of Thioflavin-S labeling with the signal of specific Aβ antibody [clone 82E1] confirmed the plaque specificity of Thioflavin-S; Figure S5A). Therefore, the kinetics of Aβ plaque appearance as well as the amyloid load did not appear to differ between AD and AD;Igf1r+/− animals. Closer inspection of the Aβ plaques analyzed by IHC revealed that plaques observed in the cortices of AD;Igf1r+/− animals are smaller and more condensed than those detected in the cortices of their age-matched AD counterparts (Figure S4, 12–13 months, insets). To compare the plaque compaction in the mouse brains, we used the highly specific Aβ antibody (clone 82E1 that recognizes processed Aβ) and measured the Aβ immunoreactive optical density (signal per area) in the different brains. Significantly higher Aβ immunoreactive optical densities were detected in brains of AD;Igf1r+/− mice than in AD brains (Figure 4B, panel IX), suggesting higher compaction of the Aβ amyloid plaques in AD;Igf1r+/− animals. We also compared the protease sensitivity of plaques of AD and AD;Igf1r+/− animals by treating brain sections of 12- to 13-month-old mice with 10 μg/ml proteinase K prior to their labeling with Aβ antibody. A diffuse staining of Aβ plaques seen in AD brain slices compared to the AD;Igf1r+/− brain slices (Figure S5B) suggested that plaques of AD;Igf1r+/− animals are more protease resistant than those of AD mice. To further analyze the amyloid plaque density, we used postembedding immunoelectron microscopy, Aβ antibodies, and gold-labeled protein A. Aβ fibrils in the cortex of AD;Igf1r+/− mice appeared to be more densely compacted than those of their AD counterparts (Figures 5A and S6A). (The lack of immunoreactivity in the brain sections of WT and Igf1r+/− mice confirmed the specificity of the antibody; Figure S6B). To quantify and compare the density of the amyloid plaques of AD and AD;Igf1r+/− mouse brains, we developed an electron microscopy (EM) image-processing algorithm that identifies the gold particles conjugated to the Aβ antibodies (Figures S6C–S6F), sets a region of interest (ROI) around each particle, and determines the median signal density within the ROI after excluding the gold particle (Figures S6G–S6I). ROIs that contain dense structures will have a lower score value due to less bright pixels and more dark pixels (i.e., lower gray-scale value). Cortices of six 12- to 13-month-old AD mice and five AD;Igf1r+/− mice were visualized by EM and 135 images (34,087 ROIs) of AD and 101 images (26,066 ROIs) of AD;Igf1r+/− were automatically segmented and analyzed in an unbiased manner. The distributions of ROI median signal intensities indicate that plaques of AD;Igf1r+/− mice were significantly (p < 0.038) denser than those of age-matched AD counterparts (Figure 5B). The possibility that antibody accessibility to plaques of AD and AD;Igf1r+/− brains differs was assessed by a second algorithm designed to measure the distance between each gold particle and its closest neighboring particle. This algorithm is based on the assumption that lower accessibility would result in sparse distribution and longer distances among the gold particles. Automatic processing of all plaque images of AD and AD;Igf1r+/− showed no difference in distances (Figure S6J, p > 0.54), indicating similar antibody accessibilities. The results obtained using light and electron microscopy suggest that reduced IGF signaling mediates the assembly of Aβ into more condensed amyloid plaques of lower toxicity. We used an in vitro kinetic aggregation assay (Cohen et al., 2006Cohen E. Bieschke J. Perciavalle R.M. Kelly J.W. Dillin A. Opposing activities protect against age-onset proteotoxicity.Science. 2006; 313: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) to assess the relative total amounts of Aβ"

These induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell type, making them a potential source from which to produce cells as a therapeutic platform for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. In many forms of human retinal disease, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the underlying pathogenesis resides within the support cells of the retina, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). As a monolayer of cells critical to photoreceptor function and survival, the RPE is an ideally accessible target for cellular therapy. Here we report the differentiation of human iPS cells into RPE. We found that differentiated iPS-RPE cells were morphologically similar to, and expressed numerous markers of developing and mature RPE cells. iPS-RPE are capable of phagocytosing photoreceptor material, in vitro and in vivo following transplantation into the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) dystrophic rat. Our results demonstrate that iPS cells can be differentiated into functional iPS-RPE and that transplantation of these cells can facilitate the short-term maintenance of photoreceptors through phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Long-term visual function is maintained in this model of retinal disease even though the xenografted cells are eventually lost, suggesting a secondary protective host cellular response. These findings have identified an alternative source of replacement tissue for use in human retinal cellular therapies, and provide a new in vitro cellular model system in which to study RPE diseases affecting human patients."

We performed a comprehensive analysis of inflammatory immune mediators in the vitreous fluids from total of 345 patients with diabetic macular edema (DME, n = 92), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, n = 147), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO, n = 30), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO, n = 13) and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD, n = 63). As a control, we selected a total of 83 patients with either idiopathic macular hole (MH) or idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM) that were free of major pathogenic intraocular changes, such as ischemic retina and proliferative membranes. The concentrations of 20 soluble factors (nine cytokines, six chemokines, and five growth factors) were measured simultaneously by multiplex bead analysis system. Out of 20 soluble factors, three factors: interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were significantly elevated in all groups of vitreoretinal diseases (DME, PDR, BRVO, CRVO, and RRD) compared with control group. According to the correlation analysis in the individual patient's level, these three factors that were simultaneously increased, did not show any independent upregulation in all the examined diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was significantly elevated in patients with PDR and CRVO. In PDR patients, the elevation of VEGF was significantly correlated with the three factors: IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, while no significant correlation was observed in CRVO patients. In conclusion, multiplex bead system enabled a comprehensive soluble factor analysis in vitreous fluid derived from variety of patients. Major three factors: IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were strongly correlated with each other indicating a common pathway involved in inflammation process in vitreoretinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2141884202,"How body size is determined is a long-standing question in biology, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we find that a conserved microRNA miR-8 and its target, USH, regulate body size in Drosophila. miR-8 null flies are smaller in size and defective in insulin signaling in fat body that is the fly counterpart of liver and adipose tissue. Fat body-specific expression and clonal analyses reveal that miR-8 activates PI3K, thereby promoting fat cell growth cell-autonomously and enhancing organismal growth non-cell-autonomously. Comparative analyses identify USH and its human homolog, FOG2, as the targets of fly miR-8 and human miR-200, respectively. USH/FOG2 inhibits PI3K activity, suppressing cell growth in both flies and humans. FOG2 directly binds to p85alpha, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and interferes with the formation of a PI3K complex. Our study identifies two novel regulators of insulin signaling, miR-8/miR-200 and USH/FOG2, and suggests their roles in adolescent growth, aging, and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2022115313,"Translational control is widely used to adjust gene expression levels. During the stringent response in bacteria, mRNA is degraded on the ribosome by the ribosome-dependent endonuclease, RelE. The molecular basis for recognition of the ribosome and mRNA by RelE and the mechanism of cleavage are unknown. Here, we present crystal structures of E. coli RelE in isolation (2.5 A) and bound to programmed Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosomes before (3.3 A) and after (3.6 A) cleavage. RelE occupies the A site and causes cleavage of mRNA after the second nucleotide of the codon by reorienting and activating the mRNA for 2'-OH-induced hydrolysis. Stacking of A site codon bases with conserved residues in RelE and 16S rRNA explains the requirement for the ribosome in catalysis and the subtle sequence specificity of the reaction. These structures provide detailed insight into the translational regulation on the bacterial ribosome by mRNA cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2013705635,"Vesicle trafficking requires membrane fusion, mediated by SNARE proteins, and upstream events that probably include ""tethering,"" an initial long-range attachment between a vesicle and its target organelle. Among the factors proposed to mediate tethering are a set of multisubunit tethering complexes (MTCs). The Dsl1 complex, with only three subunits, is the simplest known MTC and is essential for the retrograde traffic of COPI-coated vesicles from the Golgi to the ER. To elucidate structural principles underlying MTC function, we have determined the structure of the Dsl1 complex, revealing a tower containing at its base the binding sites for two ER SNAREs and at its tip a flexible lasso for capturing vesicles. The Dsl1 complex binds to individual SNAREs via their N-terminal regulatory domains and also to assembled SNARE complexes; moreover, it is capable of accelerating SNARE complex assembly. Our results suggest that even the simplest MTC may be capable of orchestrating vesicle capture, uncoating, and fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2142702062,"Sperm chemotaxis is a chemical guiding mechanism that may orient spermatozoa to the egg surface. A picomolar concentration gradient of Progesterone (P), the main steroidal component secreted by the cumulus cells that surround the egg, attracts human spermatozoa. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of sperm chemotaxis mediated by P, we combine the application of different strategies: pharmacological inhibition of signaling molecules, measurements of the concentrations of second messengers and activation of the chemotactic signaling. Our data implicate a number of classic signal transduction pathways in the response and provide a model for the sequence of events, where the tmAC-cAMP-PKA pathway is activated first, followed by protein tyrosine phosphorylation (equatorial band and flagellum) and calcium mobilization (through IP(3)R and SOC channels), whereas the sGC-cGMP-PKG cascade, is activated later. These events lead to sperm orientation towards the source of the chemoattractant. The finding proposes a molecular mechanism which contributes to the understanding of the signal transduction pathway that takes place in a physiological process as chemotaxis."

Totally 13,003 of neonates were recorded, with 6638 and 6365 for pre- and post- earthquake, respectively. Significant low birthweight, high ratio of low birthweight, and low Apgar scores of post-earthquake group were observed. In contrast, the sex ratio at birth, birth length and length of gestation did not show statistical differences. The overall ratio of birth-defect in the post-earthquake (1.18%) is statistically high than that of pre-earthquake (0.99%), especially for those in the first trimester on earthquake day (1.47%). The birth-defect spectrum was dramatically altered after earthquake, with the markedly increased occurrences of ear malformations. The ratio of preterm birth post-earthquake (7.41%) is significant increased than that of pre-earthquake (5.63%). For the birth outcomes of twins, significant differences of the ratio of twins, birth weight, ratio of low birthweight and birth-defect rate were observed after earthquake.A hospital-based study of birth outcomes impacted by the Wenchuan earthquake shows that the earthquake was associated with significant effects on birth outcomes, indicating it is a major monitor for long-term pregnant outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2011789087,"The repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) is a master regulator of neuronal gene expression. REST functions as a modular scaffold for dynamic recruitment of epigenetic regulatory factors including its primary cofactor, the corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST), to genomic loci that contain the repressor element-1 (RE1) binding motif. While REST was initially believed to silence RE1 containing neuronal genes in neural stem cells (NSCs) and non-neuronal cells, emerging evidence shows an increasingly complex cell type- and developmental stage-specific repertoire of REST target genes and functions that include regulation of neuronal lineage maturation and plasticity.In this study, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip (ChIP-chip) analysis to examine REST and CoREST functions during NSC-mediated specification of cholinergic neurons (CHOLNs), GABAergic neurons (GABANs), glutamatergic neurons (GLUTNs), and medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). We identified largely distinct but overlapping profiles of REST and CoREST target genes during neuronal subtype specification including a disproportionately high percentage that are exclusive to each neuronal subtype.Our findings demonstrate that the differential deployment of REST and CoREST is an important regulatory mechanism that mediates neuronal subtype specification by modulating specific gene networks responsible for inducing and maintaining neuronal subtype identity. Our observations also implicate a broad array of factors in the generation of neuronal diversity including but not limited to those that mediate homeostasis, cell cycle dynamics, cell viability, stress responses and epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1998735142,"Intrauterine infection may play a role in preterm delivery due to spontaneous preterm labor (PTL) and preterm prolonged rupture of membranes (PPROM). Because bacteria previously associated with preterm delivery are often difficult to culture, a molecular biology approach was used to identify bacterial DNA in placenta and fetal membranes.We used broad-range 16S rDNA PCR and species-specific, real-time assays to amplify bacterial DNA from fetal membranes and placenta. 74 women were recruited to the following groups: PPROM <32 weeks (n = 26; 11 caesarean); PTL with intact membranes <32 weeks (n = 19; all vaginal birth); indicated preterm delivery <32 weeks (n = 8; all caesarean); term (n = 21; 11 caesarean). 50% (5/10) of term vaginal deliveries were positive for bacterial DNA. However, little spread was observed through tissues and species diversity was restricted. Minimal bacteria were detected in term elective section or indicated preterm deliveries. Bacterial prevalence was significantly increased in samples from PTL with intact membranes [89% (17/19) versus 50% (5/10) in term vaginal delivery p = 0.03] and PPROM (CS) [55% (6/11) versus 0% (0/11) in term elective CS, p = 0.01]. In addition, bacterial spread and diversity was greater in the preterm groups with 68% (13/19) PTL group having 3 or more positive samples and over 60% (12/19) showing two or more bacterial species (versus 20% (2/10) in term vaginal deliveries). Blood monocytes from women with PTL with intact membranes and PPROM who were 16S bacterial positive showed greater level of immune paresis (p = 0.03). A positive PCR result was associated with histological chorioamnionitis in preterm deliveries.Bacteria are found in both preterm and term fetal membranes. A greater spread and diversity of bacterial species were found in tissues of women who had very preterm births. It is unclear to what extent the greater bacterial prevalence observed in all vaginal delivery groups reflects bacterial contamination or colonization of membranes during labor. Bacteria positive preterm tissues are associated with histological chorioamnionitis and a pronounced maternal immune paresis."
https://openalex.org/W1982946971,"Background With the development of new specific inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) enzymes and functions that may yield different antiviral responses and resistance profiles according to the HCV subtype, correct HCV genotype 1 subtype identification is mandatory in clinical trials for stratification and interpretation purposes and will likely become necessary in future clinical practice. The goal of this study was to identify the appropriate molecular tool(s) for accurate HCV genotype 1 subtype determination. Methodology/Principal Findings A large cohort of 500 treatment-naïve patients eligible for HCV drug trials and infected with either subtype 1a or 1b was studied. Methods based on the sole analysis of the 5′ non-coding region (5′NCR) by sequence analysis or reverse hybridization failed to correctly identify HCV subtype 1a in 22.8%–29.5% of cases, and HCV subtype 1b in 9.5%–8.7% of cases. Natural polymorphisms at positions 107, 204 and/or 243 were responsible for mis-subtyping with these methods. A real-time PCR method using genotype- and subtype-specific primers and probes located in both the 5′NCR and the NS5B-coding region failed to correctly identify HCV genotype 1 subtype in approximately 10% of cases. The second-generation line probe assay, a reverse hybridization assay that uses probes targeting both the 5′NCR and core-coding region, correctly identified HCV subtypes 1a and 1b in more than 99% of cases. Conclusions/Significance In the context of new HCV drug development, HCV genotyping methods based on the exclusive analysis of the 5′NCR should be avoided. The second-generation line probe assay is currently the best commercial assay for determination of HCV genotype 1 subtypes 1a and 1b in clinical trials and practice."

The prevalent hypothesis is that day length perception is mediated through coupling of an endogenous rhythm with an external light signal. Sufficient molecular data are available to test this quantitatively in plants, though not yet in mammals. In Arabidopsis, the clock-regulated genes CONSTANS (CO) and FLAVIN, KELCH, F-BOX (FKF1) and their light-sensitive proteins are thought to form an external coincidence sensor. Here, we model the integration of light and timing information by CO, its target gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), and the circadian clock. Among other predictions, our models show that FKF1 activates FT. We demonstrate experimentally that this effect is independent of the known activation of CO by FKF1, thus we locate a major, novel controller of photoperiodism. External coincidence is part of a complex photoperiod sensor: modeling makes this complexity explicit and may thus contribute to crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2158150946,"Background The medial temporal lobe (MTL) contains subregions that are subject to severe distortion and signal loss in functional MRI. Air/tissue and bone/tissue interfaces in the vicinity of the MTL distort the local magnetic field due to differences in magnetic susceptibility. Fast image acquisition and thin slices can reduce the amount of distortion and signal loss, but at the cost of image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we quantify the severity of distortion and signal loss in MTL subregions for three different echo planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions at 3 Tesla: a conventional moderate-resolution EPI (3×3×3 mm), a conventional high-resolution EPI (1.5×1.5×2 mm), and a zoomed high-resolution EPI. We also demonstrate the advantage of reversing the phase encode direction to control the direction of distortion and to maximize efficacy of distortion compensation during data post-processing. With the high-resolution zoomed acquisition, distortion is not significant and signal loss is present only in the most anterior regions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Furthermore, we find that the severity of signal loss is variable across subjects, with some subjects showing negligible loss and others showing more dramatic loss. Conclusions/Significance Although both distortion and signal loss are minimized in a zoomed field of view acquisition with thin slices, this improvement in accuracy comes at the cost of reduced SNR. We quantify this trade-off between distortion and SNR in order to provide a decision tree for design of high-resolution experiments investigating the function of subregions in MTL."

Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrated a similar level of sensitivity in gene detection between matched fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples, with the number and overlap of probes detected in the FFPE samples being approximately 88% and 95% of that in the corresponding FF samples, respectively; 74% of the differentially expressed probes overlapped between the FF and FFPE pairs. The WG-DASL assay is also able to detect 1.3–1.5 and 1.5–2 -fold changes in intact and FFPE samples, respectively. The dynamic range for the assay is ∼3 logs. Comparing the WG-DASL assay with an in vitro transcription-based labeling method yielded fold-change correlations of R2 ∼0.83, while fold-change comparisons with quantitative RT-PCR assays yielded R2∼0.86 and R2∼0.55 for intact and FFPE samples, respectively. Additionally, the WG-DASL assay yielded high self-correlations (R2>0.98) with low intact RNA inputs ranging from 1 ng to 100 ng; reproducible expression profiles were also obtained with 250 pg total RNA (R2∼0.92), with ∼71% of the probes detected in 100 ng total RNA also detected at the 250 pg level. When FFPE samples were assayed, 1 ng total RNA yielded self-correlations of R2∼0.80, while still maintaining a correlation of R2∼0.75 with standard FFPE inputs (200 ng). Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results show that WG-DASL assay provides a reliable platform for genome-wide expression profiling in archived materials. It also possesses utility within clinical settings where only limited quantities of samples may be available (e.g. microdissected material) or when minimally invasive procedures are performed (e.g. biopsied specimens)."

Yet, the molecular transitions between the inactive and active conformational states are poorly understood. Here we quantitatively characterize the free-energy landscape of activation of a signaling protein, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC), by connecting functional protein dynamics of phosphorylation-dependent activation to protein folding and show that only a rarely populated, pre-existing active conformation is energetically stabilized by phosphorylation. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) dynamics, we test an atomic scale pathway for the complex conformational transition, inferred from molecular dynamics simulations (Lei et al., 2009). The data show that the loss of native stabilizing contacts during activation is compensated by non-native transient atomic interactions during the transition. The results unravel atomistic details of native-state protein energy landscapes by expanding the knowledge about ground states to transition landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W1969564302,"The human epidermis is comprised of several layers of specialized epithelial cells called keratinocytes. Normal homoeostasis of the epidermis requires that the balance between keratinocyte proliferation and terminal differentiation be tightly regulated.

We have previously demonstrated that the RhoA/ROCK signalling pathway plays an important role in regulation of human keratinocyte proliferation and terminal differentiation. In this paper we addressed the question of which ROCK isoform was involved in regulation of keratinocyte differentiation.We used RNAi to specifically knockdown ROCK1 or ROCK2 expression in cultured human keratinocytes. ROCK1 depletion results in decreased keratinocyte adhesion to fibronectin and an increase in terminal differentiation. Conversely, ROCK2 depletion results in increased keratinocyte adhesion to fibronectin and inhibits terminal differentiation.These data suggest that ROCK1 and ROCK2 play distinct roles in regulating keratinocyte adhesion and terminal differentiation."

Genome-wide identification of miRNAs in a given organism is a critical step to facilitating our understanding of genome organization, genome biology, evolution, and posttranscriptional regulation.We sequenced two small RNA libraries prepared from different stages of the life cycle of S. japonicum, immature schistosomula and mature pairing adults, through a deep DNA sequencing approach, which yielded approximately 12 million high-quality short sequence reads containing a total of approximately 2 million non-redundant tags. Based on a bioinformatics pipeline, we identified 176 new S. japonicum miRNAs, of which some exhibited a differential pattern of expression between the two stages. Although 21 S. japonicum miRNAs are orthologs of known miRNAs within the metazoans, some nucleotides at many positions of Schistosoma miRNAs, such as miR-8, let-7, miR-10, miR-31, miR-92, miR-124, and miR-125, are indeed significantly distinct from other bilaterian orthologs. In addition, both miR-71 and some miR-2 family members in tandem are found to be clustered in a reversal direction model on two genomic loci, and two pairs of novel S. japonicum miRNAs were derived from sense and antisense DNA strands at the same genomic loci.The collection of S. japonicum miRNAs could be used as a new platform to study the genomic structure, gene regulation and networks, evolutionary processes, development, and host-parasite interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1965114744,"Background Male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) are territorial year-round; however, neuroendocrine responses to simulated territorial intrusion (STI) differ between breeding (spring) and non-breeding seasons (autumn). In spring, exposure to STI leads to increases in luteinizing hormone and testosterone, but not in autumn. These observations suggest that there are fundamental differences in the mechanisms driving neuroendocrine responses to STI between seasons. Microarrays, spotted with EST cDNA clones of zebra finch, were used to explore gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus after territorial aggression in two different seasons. Methodology/Principal Findings Free-living territorial male song sparrows were exposed to either conspecific or heterospecific (control) males in an STI in spring and autumn. Behavioral data were recorded, whole hypothalami were collected, and microarray hybridizations were performed. Quantitative PCR was performed for validation. Our results show 262 cDNAs were differentially expressed between spring and autumn in the control birds. There were 173 cDNAs significantly affected by STI in autumn; however, only 67 were significantly affected by STI in spring. There were 88 cDNAs that showed significant interactions in both season and STI. Conclusions/Significance Results suggest that STI drives differential genomic responses in the hypothalamus in the spring vs. autumn. The number of cDNAs differentially expressed in relation to season was greater than in relation to social interactions, suggesting major underlying seasonal effects in the hypothalamus which may determine the differential response upon social interaction. Functional pathway analyses implicated genes that regulate thyroid hormone action and neuroplasticity as targets of this neuroendocrine regulation."

Through 13 rounds of selection, the CS-SELEX generated high-affinity ssDNA aptamers, and the selected ssDNA aptamer ZE2 demonstrated the highest specificity and affinity to E2-positive cells. HCV particles could be specifically captured and diagnosed using the aptamer ZE2. A good correlation was observed in HCV patients between HCV E2 antigen-aptamer assay and assays for HCV RNA quantities or HCV antibody detection. Moreover, the selected aptamers, especially ZE2, could competitively inhibit E2 protein binding to CD81, an important HCV receptor, and significantly block HCV cell culture (HCVcc) infection of human hepatocytes (Huh7.5.1) in vitro.

ES muscle expressed a metachronal descending pattern of activity during walking and gait initiation. In the frontal and horizontal planes, lateroflexion and rotation occur before in the upper trunk and after in the lower trunk. Comparison of ES muscle EMGs and trunk kinematics showed that trunk muscle activity precedes corresponding kinematics activity, indicating that the ES drive trunk movement during locomotion and thereby allowing a better pelvis mobilization. EMG data showed that ES activity anticipates propulsive phases in walking with a repetitive pattern, suggesting a programmed control by a central pattern generator. Our findings also suggest that the programs for gait initiation and walking overlap with the latter beginning before the first has ended."

A possible viral etiology for breast cancer has been proposed and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a widely researched candidate virus. The aim of the present study, first one of its kind from India, was to determine if there is a greater association of EBV infection with breast cancer patients as compared to patients with benign breast diseases.We looked for expression of Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1) in breast cancer tissue specimens by employing immunohistochemistry (IHC). We also measured levels of anti-EBNA-1 Immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies in stored sera of these patients using commercial Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit. Patients with benign breast diseases were used as a comparison group for both immunohistochemical and serological analysis.58 cases of malignant breast disease and 63 of benign breast disease (controls) were included in the study. Using manufacturer determined cut-off of 3 IU/ml, 50/55 tested (90.9%) cases and 27/33 tested (81.8%) controls were seropositive for anti-EBNA-1 IgG. Mean antibody levels were significantly higher for cases (54.22 IU/ml) as compared to controls (18.68 IU/ml). IHC for EBNA-1 was positive in 28/51 cases (54.9%). No IHC positivity was noted in the tested 30 controls. Our results show that EBNA-1 expression is seen in a significant proportion of breast cancer tissue specimens from rural India and as compared to patients with benign breast diseases these patients also have a higher immunological response against EBNA-1."
https://openalex.org/W2077011598,"A Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) vaccine, formulated with AS02A adjuvant, slowed parasite growth in a recent Phase 1/2a trial, however sterile protection was not observed. We tested this AS02A, and a Montanide ISA720 (ISA) formulation of 3D7 AMA1 in Aotus monkeys. The 3D7 parasite does not invade Aotus erythrocytes, hence two heterologous strains, FCH/4 and FVO, were used for challenge, FCH/4 AMA1 being more homologous to 3D7 than FVO AMA1. Following three vaccinations, the monkeys were challenged with 50,000 FCH/4 or 10,000 FVO parasites. Three of the six animals in the AMA+ISA group were protected against FCH/4 challenge. One monkey did not become parasitemic, another showed only a short period of low level parasitemia that self-cured, and a third animal showed a delay before exhibiting its parasitemic phase. This is the first protection shown in primates with a recombinant P. falciparum AMA1 without formulation in Freund's complete adjuvant. No animals in the AMA+AS02A group were protected, but this group exhibited a trend towards reduced growth rate. A second group of monkeys vaccinated with AMA+ISA vaccine was not protected against FVO challenge, suggesting strain-specificity of AMA1-based protection. Protection against FCH/4 strain correlated with the quantity of induced antibodies, as the protected animals were the only ones to have in vitro parasite growth inhibitory activity of >70% at 1∶10 serum dilution; immuno-fluorescence titers >8,000; ELISA titers against full-length AMA1 >300,000 and ELISA titer against AMA1 domains1+2 >100,000. A negative correlation between log ELISA titer and day 11 cumulative parasitemia (Spearman rank r = −0.780, p value = 0.0001), further confirmed the relationship between antibody titer and protection. High titers of cross-strain inhibitory antibodies against AMA1 are therefore critical to confer solid protection, and the Aotus model can be used to down-select future AMA1 formulations, prior to advanced human trials."
https://openalex.org/W2061559989,"The light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a powerful tool for the optical induction of action potentials in neurons. Mutations of the cysteine 128 (C128) residue have been shown to greatly extend the lifetime of the conducting state of ChR2. However, until now, only subthreshold depolarizations have been reported from C128 mutants.Here we report the induction of long high-frequency spike trains by brief light pulses in ChR2(C128A)-transfected pyramidal cells in hippocampal slice culture. ChR2(C128A)-mediated spike bursts triggered expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in pyramidal neurons. Robust and cell-specific expression of c-Fos protein was detected after a single blue light pulse and depended on action potential firing, but not on synaptic activity. However, photocurrents diminished upon repeated stimulation and limited the number of action potential bursts that could be elicited.We conclude that the C128A mutant is not suitable for chronic stimulation of neurons, but very useful for light-controlled induction of immediate early genes. This property of ChR2(C128A) could be harnessed to control the expression of proteins under control of the c-fos promoter with precise timing and single cell specificity."

While Aβ has been implicated in the causation of AD, the exact role played by Aβ and its APP precursor are still unclear. Principal Findings In our study, Drosophila melanogaster transgenics were established as a model to analyze AD-like pathology caused by APP overexpression. We demonstrated that age related changes in the levels and pattern of synaptic proteins accompanied progressive neurodegeneration and impairment of cognitive functions in APP transgenic flies, but that these changes may be independent from the generation of Aβ. Using novel peptide mimetics of Apolipoprotein-E, COG112 or COG133 proved to be neuroprotective and significantly improved the learning and memory of APP transgenic flies. Conclusions The development of neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits was corrected by injections of COG112 or COG133, novel mimetics of apolipoprotein-E (apoE) with neuroprotective activities."
https://openalex.org/W2042861402,"Baited traps are potential tools for removal or surveillance of disease vectors. To optimize the use of counter-flow traps baited with human odor (nylon socks that had been worn for a single day) to capture wild mosquitoes in the Gambia, investigations were conducted at a field experimental site.Experiments employing Latin square design were conducted with a set of six huts to investigate the effects of the following on overnight mosquito trap catches: (1) placement of traps indoors or immediately outdoors, CO(2) supply, and presence of a human subject in the hut; (2) trap height for collecting mosquitoes immediately outdoors; (3) height and distance from hut; (4) interaction between multiple traps around a single hut and entry of mosquitoes into huts. A total of 106,600 adult mosquitoes (9.1% Anopheles gambiae s.l., 4.0% other Anopheles species) were collected over 42 nights. The high numbers of An. gambiae s.l. and other mosquitoes collected by odor-baited traps required CO(2) but were largely independent of the presence of a person sleeping in the hut or of trap placement indoors or outdoors. For outdoor collection that is considered less intrusive, traps opening 15 cm above the floor of the hut veranda were more highly effective than traps at other heights or further from the hut. There was no significant evidence of saturation or competition by the traps, with multiple traps around a hut each collecting almost as many mosquitoes as single traps and no effect on the numbers of mosquitoes entering the huts.The outdoor trapping protocol is convenient to compare attractiveness of different odors or synthetic chemicals to malaria vectors and other wild mosquitoes. The finding that such traps are reliably attractive in the presence or absence of a human volunteer encourages their potential development as standardised surveillance tools."
https://openalex.org/W2149608750,"There is a desperate need for effective therapies to fight chronic viral infections. The immune response is normally fastidious at controlling the majority of viral infections and a therapeutic strategy aimed at reestablishing immune control represents a potentially powerful approach towards treating persistent viral infections. We examined the potential of genetically programming human hematopoietic stem cells to generate mature CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes that express a molecularly cloned, ""transgenic"" human anti-HIV T cell receptor (TCR). Anti-HIV TCR transduction of human hematopoietic stem cells directed the maturation of a large population of polyfunctional, HIV-specific CD8+ cells capable of recognizing and killing viral antigen-presenting cells. Thus, through this proof-of-concept we propose that genetic engineering of human hematopoietic stem cells will allow the tailoring of effector T cell responses to fight HIV infection or other diseases that are characterized by the loss of immune control."

Guided by previous theoretical results that make the dynamics of a biological network depend on its topological properties, through the use of simulation and continuation techniques, we found that the network can be easily turned into a robust and tunable synthetic oscillator or a bistable switch.

https://openalex.org/W2069595567,"Audition provides important cues with regard to stimulus motion although vision may provide the most salient information. It has been reported that a sound of fixed intensity tends to be judged as decreasing in intensity after adaptation to looming visual stimuli or as increasing in intensity after adaptation to receding visual stimuli. This audiovisual interaction in motion aftereffects indicates that there are multimodal contributions to motion perception at early levels of sensory processing. However, there has been no report that sounds can induce the perception of visual motion.A visual stimulus blinking at a fixed location was perceived to be moving laterally when the flash onset was synchronized to an alternating left-right sound source. This illusory visual motion was strengthened with an increasing retinal eccentricity (2.5 deg to 20 deg) and occurred more frequently when the onsets of the audio and visual stimuli were synchronized.We clearly demonstrated that the alternation of sound location induces illusory visual motion when vision cannot provide accurate spatial information. The present findings strongly suggest that the neural representations of auditory and visual motion processing can bias each other, which yields the best estimates of external events in a complementary manner."
https://openalex.org/W1963759173,"Background After spinal cord injury (SCI), the formation of glial scar contributes to the failure of injured adult axons to regenerate past the lesion. Increasing evidence indicates that olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) implanted into spinal cord are found to migrate into the lesion site and induce axons regeneration beyond glial scar and resumption of functions. However, little is known about the mechanisms of OECs migrating from injection site to glial scar/lesion site. Methods and Findings In the present study, we identified a link between OECs migration and reactive astrocytes in glial scar that was mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Initially, the Boyden chamber migration assay showed that both glial scar tissue and reactive astrocyte-conditioned medium promoted OECs migration in vitro. Reactive astrocyte-derived TNF-α and its type 1 receptor TNFR1 expressed on OECs were identified to be responsible for the promoting effect on OECs migration. TNF-α-induced OECs migration was demonstrated depending on activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascades. Furthermore, TNF-α secreted by reactive astrocytes in glial scar was also showed to attract OECs migration in a spinal cord hemisection injury model of rat. Conclusions These findings showed that TNF-α was released by reactive astrocytes in glial scar and attracted OECs migration by interacting with TNFR1 expressed on OECs via regulation of ERK signaling. This migration-attracting effect of reactive astrocytes on OECs may suggest a mechanism for guiding OECs migration into glial scar, which is crucial for OECs-mediated axons regrowth beyond the spinal cord lesion site."
https://openalex.org/W2070853933,"Introduction JC Virus (JCV), a human polyomavirus, is frequently present in colorectal cancers (CRCs). JCV large T-Ag (T-Ag) expressed in approximately half of all CRC's, however, its functional role in CRC is poorly understood. We hypothesized that JCV T-Ag may mediate metastasis in CRC cells through increased migration and invasion. Material and Methods CRC cell lines (HCT116 and SW837) were stably transfected with JCV early transcript sequences cloned into pCR3 or empty vectors. Migration and invasion assays were performed using Boyden chambers. Global gene expression analysis was performed to identify genetic targets and pathways altered by T-Ag expression. Microarray results were validated by qRT-PCR, protein expression analyses and immunohistochemistry. Matching primary CRCs and liver metastases from 33 patients were analyzed for T-Ag expression by immunohistochemistry. Results T-Ag expressing cell lines showed 2 to 3-fold increase in migration and invasion compared to controls. JCV T-Ag expression resulted in differential expression of several genetic targets, including genes that mediate cell migration and invasion. Pathway analysis suggested a significant involvement of these genes with AKT and MAPK signaling. Treatment with selective PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway inhibitors resulted in reduced migration and invasion. In support of our in-vitro results, immunohistochemical staining of the advanced stage tumors revealed frequent JCV T-Ag expression in metastatic primary tumors (92%) as well as in their matching liver metastasis (73%). Conclusion These data suggest that JCV T-Ag expression in CRC associates with a metastatic phenotype, which may partly be mediated through the AKT/MAPK signaling pathway. Frequent expression of JCV T-Ag in CRC liver metastasis provides further clues supporting a mechanistic role for JCV as a possible mediator of cellular motility and invasion in CRC."

https://openalex.org/W2089050104,"Background Selecting an appropriate substitution model and deriving a tree topology for a given sequence set are essential in phylogenetic analysis. However, such time consuming, computationally intensive tasks rely on knowledge of substitution model theories and related expertise to run through all possible combinations of several separate programs. To ensure a thorough and efficient analysis and avert tedious manipulations of various programs, this work presents an intuitive framework, the phylogenetic reconstruction with automatic likelihood model selectors (PALM), with convincing, updated algorithms and a best-fit model selection mechanism for seamless phylogenetic analysis. Methodology As an integrated framework of ClustalW, PhyML, MODELTEST, ProtTest, and several in-house programs, PALM evaluates the fitness of 56 substitution models for nucleotide sequences and 112 substitution models for protein sequences with scores in various criteria. The input for PALM can be either sequences in FASTA format or a sequence alignment file in PHYLIP format. To accelerate the computing of maximum likelihood and bootstrapping, this work integrates MPICH2/PhyML, PalmMonitor and Palm job controller across several machines with multiple processors and adopts the task parallelism approach. Moreover, an intuitive and interactive web component, PalmTree, is developed for displaying and operating the output tree with options of tree rooting, branches swapping, viewing the branch length values, and viewing bootstrapping score, as well as removing nodes to restart analysis iteratively. Significance The workflow of PALM is straightforward and coherent. Via a succinct, user-friendly interface, researchers unfamiliar with phylogenetic analysis can easily use this server to submit sequences, retrieve the output, and re-submit a job based on a previous result if some sequences are to be deleted or added for phylogenetic reconstruction. PALM results in an inference of phylogenetic relationship not only by vanquishing the computation difficulty of ML methods but also providing statistic methods for model selection and bootstrapping. The proposed approach can reduce calculation time, which is particularly relevant when querying a large data set. PALM can be accessed online at http://palm.iis.sinica.edu.tw."

https://openalex.org/W1966185020,"Background Despite Natural Killer (NK) cells were originally defined as effectors of spontaneous cytotoxicity against tumors, extremely limited information is so far available in humans on their capability of killing cancer cells in an autologous setting. Methodology/Principal Findings We have established a series of primary melanoma cell lines from surgically resected specimens and here showed that human melanoma cells were highly susceptible to lysis by activated autologous NK cells. A variety of NK cell activating receptors were involved in killing: particularly, DNAM-1 and NKp46 were the most frequently involved. Since self HLA class I molecules normally play a protective role from NK cell-mediated attack, we analyzed HLA class I expression on melanomas in comparison to autologous lymphocytes. We found that melanoma cells presented specific allelic losses in 50% of the patients analyzed. In addition, CD107a degranulation assays applied to NK cells expressing a single inhibitory receptor, revealed that, even when expressed, specific HLA class I molecules are present on melanoma cell surface in amount often insufficient to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity. Remarkably, upon activation, also the so called “unlicensed” NK cells, i.e. NK cells not expressing inhibitory receptor specific for self HLA class I molecules, acquired the capability of efficiently killing autologous melanoma cells, thus additionally contributing to the lysis by a mechanism independent of HLA class I expression on melanoma cells. Conclusions/Significance We have investigated in details the mechanisms controlling the recognition and lysis of melanoma cells by autologous NK cells. In these autologous settings, we demonstrated an efficient in vitro killing upon NK cell activation by mechanisms that may be related or not to abnormalities of HLA class I expression on melanoma cells. These findings should be taken into account in the design of novel immunotherapy approaches against melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2068811326,"Using fungiform (FG) and circumvallate (CV) taste buds isolated by laser capture microdissection and analyzed using gene arrays, we previously constructed a comprehensive database of gene expression in primates, which revealed over 2,300 taste bud-associated genes. Bioinformatics analyses identified hundreds of genes predicted to encode multi-transmembrane domain proteins with no previous association with taste function. A first step in elucidating the roles these gene products play in gustation is to identify the specific taste cell types in which they are expressed.Using double label in situ hybridization analyses, we identified seven new genes expressed in specific taste cell types, including sweet, bitter, and umami cells (TRPM5-positive), sour cells (PKD2L1-positive), as well as other taste cell populations. Transmembrane protein 44 (TMEM44), a protein with seven predicted transmembrane domains with no homology to GPCRs, is expressed in a TRPM5-negative and PKD2L1-negative population that is enriched in the bottom portion of taste buds and may represent developmentally immature taste cells. Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a component of a novel calcium channel, along with family members CALHM2 and CALHM3; multiple C2 domains; transmembrane 1 (MCTP1), a calcium-binding transmembrane protein; and anoctamin 7 (ANO7), a member of the recently identified calcium-gated chloride channel family, are all expressed in TRPM5 cells. These proteins may modulate and effect calcium signalling stemming from sweet, bitter, and umami receptor activation. Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B (SV2B), a regulator of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, is expressed in PKD2L1 cells, suggesting that this taste cell population transmits tastant information to gustatory afferent nerve fibers via exocytic neurotransmitter release.Identification of genes encoding multi-transmembrane domain proteins expressed in primate taste buds provides new insights into the processes of taste cell development, signal transduction, and information coding. Discrete taste cell populations exhibit highly specific gene expression patterns, supporting a model whereby each mature taste receptor cell is responsible for sensing, transmitting, and coding a specific taste quality."
https://openalex.org/W2120739979,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen of which several species of animal were reported as reservoirs. Swine stands out as the major reservoir for HEV infection in humans, as suggested by the close genetic relationship of swine and human virus. Since 2000, Genotype 4 HEV has become the dominant cause of hepatitis E disease in China. Recent reports showed that genotype 4 HEV is freely transmitted between humans and swine in eastern and southern China. However, the infection status of HEV in human and swine populations in central China is still unclear. This study was conducted in a rural area of central China, where there are many commercial swine farms. A total of 1476 serum and 554 fecal specimens were collected from the general human and swine populations in this area, respectively. The seroepidemiological study was conducted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conserved genomic sequences of open reading frame 2 were detected using reverse transcription-PCR. The results indicated that the overall viral burden of the general human subjects was 0.95% (14/1476), while 7.0% (39/554) of the swine excreted HEV in stool. The positive rate of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in the serum samples was 7.9% (117/1476) and 1.6% (24/1476), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 150 nt partial sequence of the capsid protein gene showed that the 53 swine and human HEV isolates in the current study all belonged to genotype 4, clustering into three major groups. However, the HEV isolates prevalent in the human and swine populations were classified into known distinct subgenotypes, which suggested that no cross-species transmission between swine and humans had taken place in this area. This result was confirmed by cloning and phylogenetic analysis of the complete capsid protein gene sequence of three representative HEV strains in the three major groups. The cross reactivity between anti-HEV IgG from human sera and the two representative strains from swine in central China was confirmed by Dot-blot assay. In conclusion, although all the HEV strains prevalent in central China belonged to genotype 4, there is no evidence of cross-species transmission between human and swine in this area."
https://openalex.org/W1968718191,"Background Inbreeding depression is an important evolutionary factor, particularly when new habitats are colonized by few individuals. Then, inbreeding depression by drift could favour the establishment of later immigrants because their hybrid offspring would enjoy higher fitness. Rotifers are the only major zooplanktonic group where information on inbreeding depression is still critically scarce, despite the fact that in cyclical parthenogenetic rotifers males are haploid and could purge deleterious recessive alleles, thereby decreasing inbreeding depression. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the effects of inbreeding in two populations of the cyclical parthenogenetic rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. For each population, we compared both the parental fertilization proportion and F1 fitness components from intraclonal (selfed) and interclonal (outcrossed) crosses. The parental fertilization proportion was similar for both types of crosses, suggesting that there is no mechanism to avoid selfing. In the F1 generation of both populations, we found evidence of inbreeding depression for the fitness components associated with asexual reproduction; whereas inbreeding depression was only found for one of the two sexual reproduction fitness components measured. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that rotifers, like other major zooplanktonic groups, can be affected by inbreeding depression in different stages of their life cycle. These results suggest that haplodiploidy does not purge efficiently deleterious recessive alleles. The inbreeding depression detected here has important implications when a rotifer population is founded and intraclonal crossing is likely to occur. Thus, during the foundation of new populations inbreeding depression may provide opportunities for new immigrants, increasing gene flow between populations, and affecting genetic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1999731065,"Background The advent of various high-throughput experimental techniques for measuring molecular interactions has enabled the systematic study of biological interactions on a global scale. Since biological processes are carried out by elaborate collaborations of numerous molecules that give rise to a complex network of molecular interactions, comparative analysis of these biological networks can bring important insights into the functional organization and regulatory mechanisms of biological systems. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we present an effective framework for identifying common interaction patterns in the biological networks of different organisms based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Given two or more networks, our method efficiently finds the top matching paths in the respective networks, where the matching paths may contain a flexible number of consecutive insertions and deletions. Conclusions/Significance Based on several protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks obtained from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) and other public databases, we demonstrate that our method is able to detect biologically significant pathways that are conserved across different organisms. Our algorithm has a polynomial complexity that grows linearly with the size of the aligned paths. This enables the search for very long paths with more than 10 nodes within a few minutes on a desktop computer. The software program that implements this algorithm is available upon request from the authors."

The cause of this accelerated atherosclerosis is a matter of controversy. As clinical studies are complicated by a multiplicity of risk-factors and a low incidence of hard endpoints, studies in animal models could be attractive alternatives.We evaluated gene expression of lectin-like oxidized-low-density-lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rats; these genes are all thought to play important roles in early atherogenesis. Furthermore, the plasma level of sICAM-1 was measured. We found that gene expressions of LOX-1 and VCAM-1 were higher in the aortic arch of HIV-1Tg rats compared to controls. Also, the level of sICAM-1 was elevated in the HIV-1Tg rats compared to controls, but the ICAM-1 gene expression profile did not show any differences between the groups.HIV-1Tg rats have gene expression patterns indicating endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis in aorta, suggesting that HIV-infection per se may cause atherosclerosis. This transgenic rat model may be a very promising model for further studies of the pathophysiology behind HIV-associated cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1976446896,"Background Metazoan replication-dependent histone mRNAs terminate in a conserved stem-loop structure rather than a polyA tail. Formation of this unique mRNA 3′ end requires Stem-loop Binding Protein (SLBP), which directly binds histone pre-mRNA and stimulates 3′ end processing. The 3′ end stem-loop is necessary for all aspects of histone mRNA metabolism, including replication coupling, but its importance to organism fitness and genome maintenance in vivo have not been characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings In Drosophila, disruption of the Slbp gene prevents normal histone pre-mRNA processing and causes histone pre-mRNAs to utilize the canonical 3′ end processing pathway, resulting in polyadenylated histone mRNAs that are no longer properly regulated. Here we show that Slbp mutants display genomic instability, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), increased presence of chromosome breaks, tetraploidy, and changes in position effect variegation (PEV). During imaginal disc growth, Slbp mutant cells show defects in S phase and proliferate more slowly than control cells. Conclusions/Significance These data are consistent with a model in which changing the 3′ end of histone mRNA disrupts normal replication-coupled histone mRNA biosynthesis and alters chromatin assembly, resulting in genomic instability, inhibition of cell proliferation, and impaired development."
https://openalex.org/W2055232100,"Humans and a few select insect and reptile species synchronise inter-individual behaviour without any time lag by predicting the time of future events rather than reacting to them. This is evident in music performance, dance, and drill. Although repetition of equal time intervals (i.e. isochrony) is the central principle for such prediction, this simple information is used in a flexible and complex way that accommodates both multiples, subdivisions, and gradual changes of intervals. The scope of this flexibility remains largely uncharted, and the underlying mechanisms are a matter for speculation. Here I report an auditory illusion that highlights some aspects of this behaviour and that provides a powerful tool for its future study. A sound pattern is described that affords multiple alternative and concurrent rates of recurrence (temporal levels). An algorithm that systematically controls time intervals and the relative loudness among these levels creates an illusion that the perceived rate speeds up or slows down infinitely. Human participants synchronised hand movements with their perceived rate of events, and exhibited a change in their movement rate that was several times larger than the physical change in the sound pattern. The illusion demonstrates the duality between the external signal and the internal predictive process, such that people's tendency to follow their own subjective pulse overrides the overall properties of the stimulus pattern. Furthermore, accurate synchronisation with sounds separated by more than 8 s demonstrate that multiple temporal levels are employed for facilitating temporal organisation and integration by the human brain. A number of applications of the illusion and the stimulus pattern are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2048853113,"Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are well-established cloning vehicles for functional genomics and for constructing targeting vectors and infectious viral DNA clones. Red-recombination-based mutagenesis techniques have enabled the manipulation of BACs in Escherichia coli without any remaining operational sequences. Here, we describe that the F-factor-derived vector sequences can be inserted into a novel position and seamlessly removed from the present location of the BAC-cloned DNA via synchronous Red-recombination in E. coli in an en passant mutagenesis-based procedure. Using this technique, the mini-F elements of a cloned infectious varicella zoster virus (VZV) genome were specifically transposed into novel positions distributed over the viral DNA to generate six different BAC variants. In comparison to the other constructs, a BAC variant with mini-F sequences directly inserted into the junction of the genomic termini resulted in highly efficient viral DNA replication-mediated spontaneous vector excision upon virus reconstitution in transfected VZV-permissive eukaryotic cells. Moreover, the derived vector-free recombinant progeny exhibited virtually indistinguishable genome properties and replication kinetics to the wild-type virus. Thus, a sequence-independent, efficient, and easy-to-apply mini-F vector transposition procedure eliminates the last hurdle to perform virtually any kind of imaginable targeted BAC modifications in E. coli. The herpesviral terminal genomic junction was identified as an optimal mini-F vector integration site for the construction of an infectious BAC, which allows the rapid generation of mutant virus without any unwanted secondary genome alterations. The novel mini-F transposition technique can be a valuable tool to optimize, repair or restructure other established BACs as well and may facilitate the development of gene therapy or vaccine vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2051970641,"In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, conversion to the mucoid phenotype marks the onset of an irreversible state of the infection in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. The main pathway for mucoid conversion is mutagenesis of the mucA gene, frequently due to −1 bp deletions in a simple sequence repeat (SSR) of 5 Gs (G5-SSR426). We have recently observed that this mucA mutation is particularly accentuated in Mismatch Repair System (MRS)-deficient cells grown in vitro. Interestingly, previous reports have shown a high prevalence of hypermutable MRS-deficient strains occurring naturally in CF chronic lung infections. Here, we used mucA as a forward mutation model to systematically evaluate the role of G5-SSR426 in conversion to mucoidy in a MRS-deficient background, with this being the first analysis combining SSR-dependent localized hypermutability and the acquisition of a particular virulence/persistence trait in P. aeruginosa. In this study, mucA alleles were engineered with different contents of G:C SSRs, and tested for their effect on the mucoid conversion frequency and mucA mutational spectra in a mutS-deficient strain of P. aeruginosa. Importantly, deletion of G5-SSR426 severely reduced the emergence frequency of mucoid variants, with no preferential site of mutagenesis within mucA. Moreover, although mutagenesis in mucA was not totally removed, this was no longer the main pathway for mucoid conversion, suggesting that G5-SSR426 biased mutations towards mucA. Mutagenesis in mucA was restored by the addition of a new SSR (C6-SSR431), and even synergistically increased when G5-SSR426 and C6-SSR431 were present simultaneously, with the mucA mutations being restricted to −1 bp deletions within any of both G:C SSRs. These results confirm a critical role for G5-SSR426 enhancing the mutagenic process of mucA in MRS-deficient cells, and shed light on another mechanism, the SSR- localized hypermutability, contributing to mucoid conversion in P. aeruginosa."

We tested the hypothesis in patients with Parkinson's disease in whom we had measured the changes of blood flow everywhere in the brain associated with the deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. We determined the emotional reactivity of the patients as the average impact of emotive images rated by the patients off the DBS. We then searched for sites in the brain that had significant correlation of the changes of blood flow with the emotional impact rated by the patients. The results indicate a significant link between the emotional impact when patients are not stimulated and the change of blood flow associated with the DBS. In subjects with a low emotional impact, activity measured as blood flow rose when the electrode was turned on, while in subjects of high impact, the activity at this site in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex declined when the electrode was turned on. We conclude that changes of neurotransmission in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex had an effect on the tissue that depends on changes of monoamine concentration interacting with specific combinations of inhibitory and excitatory monoamine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2010503455,"Cooperative activation of striated muscle by calcium is based on the movement of tropomyosin described by the steric blocking theory of muscle contraction. Presently, the Hill model stands alone in reproducing both myosin binding data and a sigmoidal-shaped curve characteristic of calcium activation (Hill TL (1983) Two elementary models for the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction by calcium. Biophys J 44: 383-396.). However, the free myosin is assumed to be fixed by the muscle lattice and the cooperative mechanism is based on calcium-dependent interactions between nearest neighbor tropomyosin subunits, which has yet to be validated. As a result, no comprehensive model has been shown capable of fitting actual tension data from striated muscle. We show how variable free myosin is a selective advantage for activating the muscle and describe a mechanism by which a conformational change in tropomyosin propagates free myosin given constant total myosin. This mechanism requires actin, tropomyosin, and filamentous myosin but is independent of troponin. Hence, it will work equally well with striated, smooth and non-muscle contractile systems. Results of simulations with and without data are consistent with a strand of tropomyosin composed of approximately 20 subunits being moved by the concerted action of 3-5 myosin heads, which compares favorably with the predicted length of tropomyosin in the overlap region of thick and thin filaments. We demonstrate that our model fits both equilibrium myosin binding data and steady-state calcium-dependent tension data and show how both the steepness of the response and the sensitivity to calcium can be regulated by the actin-troponin interaction. The model simulates non-cooperative calcium binding both in the presence and absence of strong binding myosin as has been observed. Thus, a comprehensive model based on three well-described interactions with actin, namely, actin-troponin, actin-tropomyosin, and actin-myosin can explain the cooperative calcium activation of striated muscle."
