https://openalex.org/W1505072532,"Three complete cDNA clones encoding Id-related helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins lacking a basic region were isolated from a pcD2 cDNA expression library prepared from TIG-3 human diploid fibroblasts (HDF). Of these cDNAs (Id-1H, Id-1H', and Id-2H), two (Id-1H and Id-1H') appeared to be derived by alternative RNA splicing. Id-1H and Id-2H seem to be human homologues of mouse Id-1 and Id-2, respectively, and have potential to encode 154 and 135 amino acid proteins. The Id-1H and Id-2H mRNAs were barely detectable in quiescent early passage HDF; serum coordinately induced both mRNAs, with two peaks of expression, in early and late in G1. Antisense oligomers complementary to Id-1H and Id-2H mRNA prevented early passage HDF from entering the S phase of the cell cycle. The treatment of serum-stimulated early passage cells with the antisense Id-1H oligomer completely abolished Id-1H. In senescent cells, serum barely induced the Id-1H and Id-2H mRNAs, although the levels of c-myc expression induced were similar in early passage and senescent cells. The expression levels of these Id genes vary among immortal human cell lines. Both genes were overexpressed in VA4 SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts and EJ-1 bladder carcinoma cells, while these genes were expressed at a very low level in SVts8 cells derived from SV40 tsA-transformed TIG-3 cells. SVts8 cells may acquire some function redundant to Id proteins. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells expressed the Id-1H gene but not the Id-2H gene, suggesting these Id genes may subserve redundant functions."
https://openalex.org/W1487568705,"Abstract The major proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are thought to function in Ca2+ sequestration or as molecular in the folding and assembly of membrane or secreted proteins. Based on the ability of many chaperones to bind selectively to unfolded proteins and to dissociate from them upon ATP hydrolysis, we developed an affinity chromatography method to isolate proteins with these characteristics from pancreatic or liver ER. Seven ER proteins bound selectively to denatured protein columns and were specifically eluted by ATP (10(-6) M) but not by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. These proteins were identified with antibodies and microsequencing as the ER chaperone BiP (grp78), grp94, calreticulin, a novel 46-kDa protein that binds azido-ATP, as well as three members of the thioredoxin superfamily: protein-disulfide isomerase, ERp72, and a previously reported 50-kDa protein (p50). This set of seven proteins bound to and was eluted with ATP from a variety of denatured proteins, including histone, gelatin, alpha fetoprotein, thyroglobulin, lysozyme, casein, and IgG. The release of grp94, protein-disulfide isomerase, ERp72, calreticulin, and p50 was stimulated by Ca2+ in the presence of ATP. These proteins thus appear to function as Ca(2+)-dependent chaperones, which may account for the Ca2+ and ATP requirement for protein folding in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1606913060,"Bryostatin 1 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) are both potent activators of protein kinase C (PKC), although in many systems bryostatin 1 induces only a subset of the responses to PMA and blocks those which it does not induce. We report here that in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts PMA showed similar potencies for translocating PKC isozymes alpha, delta, and epsilon to the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions and for the down-regulation of the three isozymes. Bryostatin 1 was slightly was more potent than PMA for down-regulating it. Bryostatin 1 was markedly more potent than PMA for translocating PKC delta but showed a biphasic dose-response curve for down-regulating this isozyme. 1-10 nM bryostatin 1 down-regulated PKC delta to a similar extent as PMA; lower (10-100 pM) or, unexpectedly, higher (100 nM to 1 microM) doses of bryostatin 1 caused either no or reduced down-regulation. Moreover, these high (100 nM to 1 microM) doses of bryostatin 1 inhibited the down-regulation of PKC delta by 1 microM PMA when coapplied. Bryostatin 1 caused translocation of PKC epsilon with slightly higher potency than PKC delta, but there was no protection of this isozyme at any of the doses examined. Bryostatin 1 induced a long-term increase in c-Jun level. The dose-response curve for bryostatin 1 was biphasic, with maximal induction at 1-10 nM bryostatin 1, coincident with the maximal down-regulation of PKC delta. We conclude that bryostatin 1 showed substantially different regulation for PKC alpha, PKC delta, and PKC epsilon, whereas PMA distinguished only weakly between these isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1597915813,"Rab escort proteins (REPs) bind to newly synthesized Rab proteins and remain bound during and after the attachment of a geranylgeranyl (GG) group by the catalytic component of the Rab GG transferase. Transfer of the GG group is absolutely dependent on the participation of a REP. REP-1, the first characterized REP, is produced by a gene on the X chromosome that is defective in patients with choroideremia, a form of retinal degeneration. Cremers et al. (Cremers, F.P.M., Molloy, C. M., van de Pol, D. J. R., van den Hurk, J. A. J. M., Bach, I., Geurts van Kessel, A. H. M., and Ropers, H.-H. (1992) Hum. Mol. Genet. 1, 71-75) isolated a related gene, designated choroideremia-like, which encodes a protein that closely resembles REP-1. In the current studies, we produced REP-1 and REP-2 by recombinant DNA methods and showed that both proteins were approximately equal in facilitating the attachment of GG groups to several Rab proteins, including Rab1A, Rab5A, and Rab6. However, REP-2 was only 25% as active as REP-1 in supporting GG attachment to Rab3A and Rab3D. The low activity toward Rab3A was increased to that of Rab1A when the COOH-terminal 12 amino acids of Rab3A were replaced with the corresponding residues of Rab1A. We suggest that REP-2 substitutes for the absent function of REP-1 in nonretinal cells of patients with choroideremia, thus preventing cellular dysfunction throughout the body. In the retina, REP-2 may be only partially effective, leading eventually to retinal degeneration and blindness."
https://openalex.org/W1560711441,"The influence of chemical modifications on the catalytic activity and stability of a hammerhead ribozyme directed against the long terminal repeat RNA of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 was examined. Previous studies had shown that substitution of all pyrimidine nucleosides by their 2'-fluoro analogs led to an 8-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency in the cleavage reaction compared to the unmodified ribozyme (Heidenreich, O., and Eckstein, F. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1904-1909). It is shown here that replacement of the 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridines in the conserved region of this ribozyme, positions 4 and 7, by 2'-amino-2'-deoxyuridines fully restores catalytic activity of the ribozyme. Ribozymes containing these 2'-modifications show an increased stability against RNases present in fetal calf serum and in cell culture supernatant. The stability is increased further by the incorporation of four terminal phosphorothioates as protection against 3'-exonucleases, the degree of which depends on the secondary structure of the ribozyme. Such ribozymes are stable in undiluted fetal calf serum for at least 24 h. The results clearly demonstrate the potential to design stable ribozymes without any loss of catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1579465735,"Supercoiled plasmid DNAs with negative superhelicity several times higher than normal have been isolated from Escherichia coli topA mutants. The formation of these hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs is apparently induced by transcription. We show that hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs isolated from topA mutants contain R-loop(s). To study the mechanism of formation of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA, we have been able to reproduce hypernegatively supercoiled DNA in vitro using purified RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase. The formation of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA template in vitro is shown to require transcription elongation and is tightly linked to R-loop formation. We propose that one of the roles of topoisomerase I is to suppress R-loop formation during transcription elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1524550442,"The band 3 protein of the red blood cell membrane catalyzes anion exchange that is inhibited by the stilbenedisulfonate derivative H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid). There is one H2DIDS binding site per 95,000-Da band 3 polypeptide. The single bound H2DIDS molecule can react covalently with 2 different lysine residues. The 2 lysines that react covalently with H2DIDS have been localized directly by sequencing fragments of human band 3 from cells labeled with [3H]H2DIDS. The most rapid covalent reaction is with Lys-539, in agreement with site-directed mutagenesis studies. The slower reaction is with Lys-851, which is known to be the primary site of binding of another anion transport inhibitor, pyridoxal phosphate (Kawano et al., 1988). These results indicate that the protein is folded to bring these 2 residues into close enough proximity to react covalently with the same H2DIDS molecule. In addition to defining the residues that react with H2DIDS, these studies have also defined new in situ proteolytic cleavage sites in band 3."
https://openalex.org/W1530740282,"We have recently described a novel protein carboxyl methylation system that results in the reversible modification of a 36-kDa polypeptide component of a 178-kDa protein in the cytosol of a variety of eucaryotic cells. This reaction, catalyzed by a cytosolic 40-kDa methyl-transferase, results in the methyl esterification of the alpha-carboxyl group of the C-terminal leucine residue. We have now purified the major methylated 36-kDa polypeptide from bovine brain. N-terminal sequence analysis of a tryptic fragment of this polypeptide revealed identity to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. This enzyme exists in the cell predominantly as a trimeric 151-kDa native species containing the 36-kDa catalytic polypeptide that terminates in a leucine residue. We then fractionated bovine brain cytosolic extracts to separate the major phosphatase isoforms 2A1 and 2A2 and found that both could be methylated by a partially purified preparation of the methyltransferase. A synthetic C-terminal octapeptide based on the sequence of the 36-kDa catalytic subunit is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of this methyltransferase, suggesting that this enzyme recognizes aspects of the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of the native phosphatase. Because this modification reaction is readily reversible in extracts, it may represent a novel strategy of the cell to modulate the function of this protein phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1534731013,"oriC and pBR322 DNA replication, reconstituted with purified replication proteins, has been used to study the functional activities of Escherichia coli topoisomerase I, DNA gyrase, and topoisomerase III during the final stages of DNA replication. In the oriC system, DNA gyrase-catalyzed decatenation of daughter DNA molecules was very inefficient, whereas topoisomerase III could catalyze complete decatenation. In the pBR322 DNA replication system, almost all the daughter DNA molecules could be decatenated by DNA gyrase alone in the absence of salt. Decatenation by DNA gyrase in the pBR322 system was completely inhibited, without a concomitant inhibition of DNA synthesis, by the addition of physiological concentrations of salt. Topoisomerase III, however, could decatenate all of the daughter DNA molecules in the pBR322 system, even in the presence of high concentrations of salt. A similar effect could not be observed in the oriC system, because the addition of salt inhibited DNA synthesis. Topoisomerase I was incapable of catalyzing decatenation under any conditions examined in either the oriC or pBR322 replication system. The addition of topoisomerase I to the replication systems resulted only in an inhibition of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1481001832,"The 23-kDa recombinant amino-terminal bactericidal/permeability increasing protein fragment (rBPI23) has all of the antibacterial and antiendotoxin properties of the holoprotein. In the current studies, we have identified multiple active domains within rBPI23 with chemical and proteolytic cleavage fragments and with synthetic overlapping peptides. We also demonstrate a novel, high affinity heparin binding property for rBPI23, in addition to its established bactericidal and lipopolysaccharide binding properties. Cleavage fragments and synthetic, overlapping peptides of rBPI23 were analyzed for inhibition of the lipopolysaccharide-induced Limulus amebocyte lysate reaction, for bactericidal activity, and for heparin binding. Three separate, active domains were identified in amino acid regions 17-45, 65-99, and 142-169. A single synthetic peptide (85-99) was bactericidal. These results indicate that rBPI23 is comprised of three separate functional domains which contribute to the high affinity interaction of rBPI23 with Gram-negative bacteria. The individual activity of each domain and the cooperative interaction among domains provide the basis for developing rBPI23 analogues with increased biologic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1545579092,"The 85-kDa cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is the major hormone and growth factor-regulated enzyme that catalyzes release of arachidonic acid in mammalian cells. Activation of cPLA2 requires elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and the phosphorylation of the cPLA2 enzyme by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters or pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi proteins inhibits thrombin and ATP receptor-stimulated MAP kinase and arachidonic acid release, indicating that functional protein kinase C and Gi proteins are required for G protein regulation of arachidonic acid release. A mutant G alpha i2 subunit having Gly203 mutated to Thr (alpha i2G203T) inhibited thrombin and ATP receptor stimulation of arachidonic acid release independent of adenylyl cyclase inhibition, Ca2+ mobilization, and MAP kinase activation. Overexpression of the wild-type alpha i2 polypeptide or the inactive mutant alpha i2G204A (Gly204 mutated to Ala) polypeptide had no effect on thrombin or ATP receptor stimulation of arachidonic acid release. The phenotype observed with expression of the mutant alpha i2G203T polypeptide defines a role for Gi2 in the control of cPLA2 activity and subsequent arachidonic acid release in addition to the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels and MAP kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513897459,"Recent evidence has suggested a role for phosphorylation in the regulation of ligand-gated ion channels. We have recently shown (Ruiz-Gomez, A., Vaello, M., Valdivieso, F., and Mayor, F., Jr. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 559-566) that the inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha subunit is phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C (PKC). In this report we further show that alpha subunits of the GlyR can also be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in an in vitro assay. Moreover, incubation of intact rat spinal cord neurons with specific PKC or PKA activators leads to increased phosphorylation of the GlyR alpha subunits, strongly suggesting a physiological role in its functional modulation. The role of protein phosphorylation in modulating GlyR channels was explored in Xenopus oocytes injected with poly (A)+ mRNA isolated from nervous tissue. The treatment of oocytes with phorbol esters or dibutyryl cAMP resulted in a decrease or an enhancement, respectively, of glycine-evoked currents. Our results show that the GlyR can be phosphorylated in vivo in response to activation of either PKC or PKA with opposite functional consequences, suggesting that neurotransmitters affecting the activity of such kinases could profoundly alter glycine-mediated neuronal signaling and modulate synaptic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1575826813,"A thiol-specific antioxidant enzyme (TSA), which provides protection against the inactivation of other enzymes by the thiol/Fe(III)/oxygen system, was previously isolated and cloned. We investigated the mechanism by which TSA protects biomolecules from oxidative damage caused by the thiol-containing oxidation system using the spin trapping method with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). Thiyl radicals from dithiothreitol (.DTT) were produced by horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and by the Fe(III)/oxygen system. The formation of DMPO-.DTT radical adducts were inhibited by TSA regardless of the thiyl radical-generating conditions used. The active mutant C170S also quenched the signals of the radical adduct, whereas the inactive mutant C47S did not exert any effect. It was also found that C170S has a higher rate at the initial stage of the reaction than that of the native enzyme, although C170S failed to remove DMPO-.DTT radical adducts completely. These results indicate that only active TSA can catalyze the removal of thiyl radicals, and cysteine 47 is required for this activity. In addition, thiyl radicals react with oxygen to generate unidentified thiylperoxy species. Fe.EDTA reacts with this species to generate a reactive radical that can abstract hydrogen atom from ethanol to produce a hydroxyethyl radical. This reactive thiyl-oxygen radical is believed to be responsible for causing deleterious effects on biomolecules. Together, our data indicate that TSA protects biomolecules from oxidative damage by catalyzing the removal of thiyl radicals before they generate more reactive radicals. However, presently we cannot rule out the possibility that TSA can also use other thiol-containing species as substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1563888013,"When N-6[7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl]aminohexanoyl-phosphatidic acid (C6-NBD-PA) is inserted into the plasma membrane of fibroblasts, it is metabolized by the cells to C6-NBD-diacylglycerol (DG), -triacylglycerol, -phosphatidylcholine (PC), and -phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Pagano, R. E., Longmuir, K. J., and Martin, O. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2034-2040). In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells incubated at 10 degrees C with C6-NBD-PA, up to 70% of the newly synthesized C6-NBD-PC but no C6-NBD-PE could be depleted from the basolateral cell surface by the addition of bovine serum albumin to the medium. Preincubation of the cells with [3H]choline for 2 h at 37 degrees C prior to C6-NBD-PA addition at 10 degrees C labeled non-depletable C6-NBD-PC with a specific activity of > 10 times that of the depletable C6-NBD-PC on the basolateral cell surface, indicating that the latter had not been synthesized by the CDP-choline pathway. C6-NBD-DG could substitute for C6-NBD-PA as substrate for both intracellular and surface C6-NBD-PC synthesis. In addition, C6-NBD-PC synthesis on the cell surface was independent of the location of the C6-NBD-chain on the 1- or 2-position, indicating that the reaction occurred by transfer of phosphorylcholine. Using C6-NBD-ceramide, C6-NBD-sphingomyelin (SM) synthesis also was discovered on the basolateral but not on the apical cell surface. The conversion of PC plus ceramide to DG and SM on the basolateral MDCK cell surface suggests that the synthesis of C6-NBD-PC on this surface occurred via the reverse reaction of a SM synthase. Indeed, the surface C6-NBD-PC synthesis was reduced to 40-50% by addition of C6-NBD-ceramide or hydrolysis of cell surface SM by exogenous neutral sphingomyelinase. Since DG activates protein kinase C and ceramide indirectly inhibits this kinase but activates other kinase(s) and phosphatase(s), the phosphocholine transferase at the cell surface may have a regulatory role in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1484493440,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an ectoprotein anchored in the plasma membrane through a hydrophobic domain near its carboxyl-terminal region. Mouse epithelial cells transfected with rabbit testicular ACE cDNA, synthesize, glycosylate, and secrete ACE by cleavage processing of its membrane-anchoring carboxyl-terminal region. Because the cleavage-secretion process is slow, the enzyme accumulates on the cell surface. We show that this process can be enhanced by treatment of cells with tumor-promoting phorbol esters leading to depletion of the cell surface enzyme. The cleavage processing occurs only after the protein has reached the cell surface and is not affected by disruption of the Golgi apparatus or the lysosomal compartments. The exact peptide bond cleaved has been identified by sequencing the amino-terminal residues of the purified COOH-terminal tail left in the cells after ACE is secreted and the carboxyl-terminal residues of secreted ACE. The cleavage occurs at a monobasic site between Arg-663 and Ser-664 generating the soluble enzyme and leaving a cell-bound protein of 74 residues. These results demonstrate the existence of cellular mechanisms that regulate the conversion of cell-bound ACE to a soluble enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1543658168,"A metalloendopeptidase that selectively cleaves doublets of basic amino acids on the amino-terminal side of arginine residues was purified to homogeneity from rat testes and analyzed further. Two catalytically active forms with apparent relative molecular masses of 110,000 and 140,000 Da, respectively, were present in the purified preparation of the enzyme. Antibodies raised against the purified testis endopeptidase revealed by immunoblot both the 110- and 140-kDa forms in both rat testis and brain cortex extracts. The isolated enzyme was inhibited by metal chelators and divalent cations. Its activity, lost after preincubation with EDTA, was restored by low concentrations of Zn2+ and Mn2+, thus demonstrating the metallopeptidase nature of the enzyme. This endopeptidase also exhibited a high sensitivity to amastatin (100% inhibition at 20 microM), an aminopeptidase inhibitor. A substrate specificity study using physiologically important or synthetic peptides containing a processing dibasic site indicated that cleavage occurred selectively at the amino-terminal side of an arginine residue, independent of the nature of the basic doublet. The enzyme produced such a cleavage at the Arg-Lys doublet of somatostatin 28 (Km = 43 microM), at the Arg-Arg doublet of dynorphin A (Km = 6.45 microM) and atrial natriuretic factor (Km = 6.25 microM), and at the Lys-Arg doublet of preproneurotensin-(154-170) (Km = 17.3 microM). Moreover, cleavage efficiency was found to be higher for the larger substrates. The distinctive properties of this endopeptidase imply that this protein is a member of a novel class of proteolytic enzymes that may be involved in the endoproteolytic maturation of hormonal precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1533227483,"A protein activator of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ia (CaM kinase Ia) was purified to near homogeneity from pig brain. In the final step of purification, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, CaM kinase Ia activating activity correlated with the presence of a approximately 52-kDa protein band detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Comparison of this value with estimations of its molecular mass under nondenaturing conditions indicated that CaM kinase Ia activator is a slightly asymmetric monomer. After removal of endogenous CaM kinase Ia activator, the activity of CaM kinase Ia was 2% of its activity in the presence of a maximally stimulating concentration (15 nM) of the purified activator. In its activated state, CaM kinase Ia retained complete dependence of its activity upon Ca(2+)-CaM. The activation of CaM kinase Ia was rapid (t1/2"
https://openalex.org/W1558474974,"Microtubule assembly of different beta tubulin isotypes in the presence of 4 M glycerol and 6 mM magnesium ion demonstrates significantly different characteristics. alpha beta II and alpha beta IV assembled faster and to a greater extent than did unfractionated phosphocellulose-purified tubulin (PC-tubulin). Microtubule assembly from alpha beta III showed a distinctive delay in nucleation, proceeded at a slower rate than those of the other beta tubulin isotypes, and had the highest critical concentration. However, treatment of beta tubulin isotypes with subtilisin to remove the C-terminal domain of the tubulin dimer abolished these differences in microtubule assembly pattern and enhanced self-assembly. The kinetic analysis of microtubule elongation of different beta tubulin isotypes also showed significant differences. Elongation of alpha beta III from microtubule seeds had a lower apparent K alpha and a lower apparent Kd than did alpha beta II and alpha beta IV. The dynamic behaviors of different beta tubulin isotypes were qualitatively similar to each other and fit the dynamic instability model. However, microtubules formed from alpha beta III appeared to be less dynamic than microtubules formed from other beta tubulin isotypes. Our results suggest that the beta III isotype might have a different conformation than do the other beta tubulin isotypes. The distinctive nucleation and elongation behaviors of the alpha beta III dimers demonstrated in vitro may have a significant influence on microtubule functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1583056254,"We established the cis-acting elements which mediate cAMP responsiveness of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene in transiently transfected rat anterior pituitary tumor GC cells. Analysis of the intact hGH gene or hGH 5'-flanking DNA (5'-FR) coupled to the hGh cDNA or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase genes, indicated that cAMP primarily stimulated hGH promoter activity. Cotransfection of a protein kinase A inhibitory protein cDNA demonstrated that the cAMP response was mediated by protein kinase A. Mutational analysis of the hGH promoter identified two core cAMP response element motifs (CGTCA) located at nucleotides -187/-183 (distal cAMP response element; dCRE) and -99/-95 (proximal cAMP response element; pCRE) and a pituitary-specific transcription factor (GHF1/Pit1) binding site at nucleotides -123/-112 (dGHF1) which were required for cAMP responsiveness. GHF1 was not a limiting factor, since overexpression of GHF1 in cotransfections increased basal but not forskolin induction levels. Gel shift analyses indicated that similar, ubiquitous, thermostable protein(s) specifically bound the pCRE and dCRE motifs. The CGTCA motif-binding factors were cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1)-related, since the DNA-protein complex was competed by unlabeled CREB consensus oligonucleotide, specifically supershifted by antisera to CREB and ATF-1 but not ATF-2, and was bound by purified CREB with the same relative binding affinity (pCRE < dCRE < CREB) and mobility as the GC nuclear extract. UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot analyses revealed multiple DNA-protein interactions of which approximately 100- and approximately 45-kDa proteins were predominant; the approximately 45-kDa protein may represent CREB. These results indicate that CREB/ATF-1-related factors act coordinately with the cell-specific factor GHF1 to mediate cAMP-dependent regulation of hGH-1 gene transcription in anterior pituitary somatotrophs."
https://openalex.org/W1486612844,"The class II IL-8 receptor (IL-8R) binds both melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MGSA) and IL-8 with high affinity. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction demonstrates that the class II IL-8R mRNA, which has previously been detected only in cells of hematopoietic lineage, is also expressed in non-hematopoietic cell types shown to respond to MGSA or IL-8. To study the signaling mechanism by MGSA through the class II IL-8R in non-hematopoietic cells, this receptor was overexpressed in the 3ASubE human placental and the 293 human kidney cell lines. Membrane preparations of the class II IL-8R expressing 3ASubE transfectants exhibited a 2.3 +/- 0.2-fold increase in GTP gamma 35S binding, which was sensitive to pertussis toxin, in response to MGSA treatment (0.2 microM). This MGSA response was not observed in cells transfected with the parental expression vector. In vivo phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the class II IL-8R was basally phosphorylated in the untreated transfectants, and MGSA (5 nM) treatment markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of this receptor. The MGSA-induced receptor phosphorylation was both time and concentration dependent and could be mimicked by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the MGSA-induced receptor phosphorylation was on serine residue(s), suggesting that a serine kinase is activated in response to MGSA binding to the class II IL-8R in non-hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1669532073,"We have demonstrated in liver from male rats that both endothelin A (ETA) and ETB receptors coexist in equal proportion and that ETA receptors mediate a calcium-dependent activation of glycogenolysis. We describe here a sex difference in endothelin action in hepatocytes because, in female rats, 80% of the ET receptors are of ETB type and, accordingly, activation of glycogenolysis is an ETB-mediated process (EC50 = 0.03 pM). ET-1 stimulation of glycogenolysis in female rats was consecutive to activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis (EC50 = 0.03 pM) and to inhibition of the calcium extrusion pump (IC50 = 0.03 pM) in plasma membranes, with ET-1 approximately sarafotoxin S6C approximately ET-3. Endothelin regulation of each effector was potentiated by GTP gamma S. ET-1 did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. To identify the nature of the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G protein(s)) coupling ETB receptors to each effector, we used antibodies against the COOH terminus of different G protein alpha subunits. Antibodies reactive with Gs alpha (RM) blocked ET-1 inhibition of the calcium pump, while they did not affect ET-1 stimulation of phospholipase C. Antibodies reactive with Gq alpha (QL) dose-dependently antagonized stimulation of phospholipase C by ET-1 and vasopressin, without affecting ET-1 inhibition of the calcium pump. Antibodies reactive with Gi1 alpha/Gi2 alpha (AS) had no effect on either system. We conclude that the calcium signal provoked by endothelins in hepatocyte is not only consecutive to activation of phospholipase C but also to inhibition of the plasma membrane calcium pump, each effector being coupled to ETB receptors by different G proteins, Gq, and Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1523824312,"The Ca(2+)-pumping activity of constructs containing various portions of the putative 28-residue calmodulin-binding domain (C domain) of hPMCA4b were compared. As the length of the C domain in the pump increased, the pump's activity decreased and the ability of calmodulin to stimulate the activity increased. Study of the calmodulin dependence of activity showed that the construct containing all 28 residues of the C domain had a K1/2 for calmodulin equal to that of the complete molecule; the constructs containing less of the C domain interacted less strongly with calmodulin. On the other hand, incorporation of all 28 residues of the C domain did not decrease the activity of the pump (in the absence of calmodulin) as low as the activity of the complete molecule. This indicates that other segments of the molecule, further toward the COOH terminus, are also required for the degree of inhibition seen in the complete molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1585450904,"Abstract Contact between low density lipoproteins (LDL) and exocytosed mast cell granules, the leads to binding of LDL to the granule remnants via ionic interactions between the apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) component of LDL and the heparin proteoglycan component of the granule remnants. Upon incubation at 37 degrees C, the heparin proteoglycan-bound apoB-100 is progressively proteolyzed by remnant chymase and carboxypeptidase A, which are also bound to the heparin proteoglycans. Thereupon, the LDL particles fuse, and their binding to the granule remnants strengthens, as defined by the decreased ability of NaCl to release LDL from the remnants. We now have examined separately the effects of proteolysis and fusion on LDL binding. Proteolysis without fusion was induced by lowering the incubation temperature to 15 degrees C, and proteolysis-independent fusion was induced by treating granule remnant-bound LDL with sphingomyelinase in the presence of protease inhibitors. It was found that degradation of the heparin proteoglycan-bound apoB-100, even without accompanying particle fusion, increased the strength of LDL binding to the granule remnants, suggesting exposure of buried heparin binding regions of apoB-100. When such proteolyzed LDL particles were allowed to fuse, the strength of their binding to the granule remnants increased still further, probably because of an increase in the number of apoB-100 fragments in the enlarged particles. Proteolysis-independent fusion, induced by sphingomyelinase treatment of granule remnant-bound LDL, also increased the strength of binding. The results show that proteolytic degradation and fusion, the two modifications of granule remnant-bound LDL subsequent to action by chymase and carboxypeptidase A of the granule remnants, represent two separate mechanisms by which LDL particles become tightly bound to the heparin proteoglycans of exocytosed mast cell granules. Since the formation of an atheroma, the hallmark of atherosclerosis, is characterized by accumulation in the proteoglycan matrix of the arterial intima of extracellular lipid droplets resembling the fused LDL particles on the granule remnant surfaces, the modifications of LDL described in this study may provide a clue to the actual processes by which the lipid droplets are anchored to the arterial intima."
https://openalex.org/W1633849579,"We examined several yeast strains with different mutations in the essential SSL2 (Suppressor of Stem Loop, also called RAD25) gene for their ability to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from expressed genes, and from the genome overall. The SSL2 protein has a high degree of amino acid sequence identity to the protein encoded by the human ERCC3 gene (Gulyas, K. D., and Donahue, T. F. (1992) Cell 69, 1031-0142). The mutant allele SSL2-XP encodes a protein resembling the mutated ERCC3 protein from UV-sensitive human cells belonging to xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B and Cockayne's syndrome (CS) complementation group C (Weeda, G., van Ham, R. C. A., Vermeulen, W., Bootsma, D., van der Eb, A. J., and Hoeijmakers, J. H. J. (1990) Cell 62, 777-791; Gulyas and Donahue, 1992). The SSL2-XP allele confers UV sensitivity on yeast strain KG119. We found that the biochemical basis for the UV sensitivity of KG119 is a complete deficiency in the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from the overall genome as well as a deficiency in transcription-coupled repair. This is the first analysis of the DNA repair defect responsible for the UV sensitivity of cells carrying the SSL2-XP allele, and it documents the similarity of the defect to that associated with XP-B/CS-C, and the difference between this defect and that in cells belonging to CS complementation groups A and B."
https://openalex.org/W1548350321,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, pyroglutamic acid-histidine-proline-amide) binds to a seven-transmembrane-spanning, G protein-coupled receptor. We tested the hypothesis that Tyr106 of the third transmembrane helix of the TRH receptor (TRH-R) binds pyroglutamyl of TRH by mutating Tyr106 to Phe and replacing the ring carbonyl of the TRH pyroglutamyl moiety with a methylene group ([Pro1]TRH). Compared to the affinity of wild-type TRH-R for TRH, the affinities of [Phe106]TRH-R for TRH and of wild-type TRH-R for [Pro1]TRH were 100,000- and 110,000-fold lower, respectively. The affinity of [Phe106]TRH-R for [Pro1]TRH was only 16-fold lower than that for TRH, demonstrating a lack of additivity of the effects of these changes in the receptor and ligand. These data provide compelling evidence that the hydroxyl group of Tyr106 of the TRH-R binds the TRH pyroglutamyl carbonyl group. To our knowledge, this represents the highest affinity, non-covalent bond yet observed between single functional groups of a GPCR and ligand and is the first delineation of a direct binding interaction between a residue in the transmembrane core of a GPCR and a specific moiety of a peptide agonist."
https://openalex.org/W1572415378,"Human thymidylate synthase is a polymeric protein composed of two subunits with identical primary structures. In this study we determined the binding affinities of 5,10-methylene tetrahydropteroyltetraglutamate (folate substrate) and a group of close structural folate analog inhibitors. Thymidylate synthase bound both mono and polyglutamylated folate substrates and analogs more tightly in the presence of deoxyuridylate. These results and product inhibition studies confirmed that the orders of substrate addition and product release from thymidylate synthase were similar for mono and polyglutamylated substrates. Equilibrium dialysis studies showed that the folate substrate in a ternary complex with deoxyuridylate bound to one of the subunits (site A) with a Kd of 720 nM. The binding of the substrate to the second subunit (site B) was much weaker, and the Kd could not be determined by this method. However, dissociation constants for each subunit could be measured for the folate analog inhibitors, and, depending on the inhibitor, the relative Kd value for each subunit varied substantially. For example, formyl-5,8-dideazafolate and tetraglutamylated 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate bound to both sites with similar Kd values, whereas D1694Glu4 bound to subunit A with a higher affinity (Kd = 1.0 nM) than to subunit B (Kd = 30 nM). In contrast, 1843U89 (mono or diglutamylated form) had a much higher affinity for subunit B (Kd approximately 0.1 nM) compared with subunit A (Kd approximately 400 nM). Enzyme inhibition kinetic analyses showed that the Ki values of 1843U89 were quite low (0.1 nM) and that the inhibition was noncompetitive. In contrast, the other folate analogs inhibited the enzyme via mixed inhibition (i.e. both the Km for the folate substrate and the Vmax were altered). We conclude that the two subunits of thymidylate synthase bind folate substrates and analogs differently and that the asymmetric binding of the ligands is the major factor that determines the inhibition kinetics of each folate analog inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1658844382,"Kinetic analyses of both the Mn(2+)- and Mg(2+)-activated hydrolysis of dGTP by MutT show the requirement for two divalent cations. Whereas Mn2+ supports a 20-fold lower kcat (0.19 s-1) than Mg2+ (4.0 s-1), the Km of Mn2+.dGTP (6.3 microM) is 45-fold lower than that of Mg2+.dGTP (284 microM). Adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylenetriphosphate) (AMPCPP) is a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to dGTP with a Ki for Mg2+.AMPCPP (42 microM) which is 57-fold lower than the Ki of Mg2+.AMPCPP (2.4 mM). Such tightening suggests that a metal-bridge E.M2+.NTP.M2+ complex is the catalytically active species. The 12 dissociation constants describing the quaternary MutT.M2+.AMPCPP.M2+ complex were evaluated for both Mn2+ and Mg2+, using EPR and NMR methods. MutT binds a single Mn2+ with a Kd of 130 +/- 40 microM in reasonable agreement with the kinetically determined activator constant of Mn2+ of 230 +/- 72 microM. The MutT.AMPCPP complex binds two Mn2+ ions, the weaker of which has a Kd of 16 +/- 2 microM in agreement with the kinetically determined KmMn2+ of 26 +/- 10 microM. MutT.Mn2+ binds Mn2+.AMPCPP with Kd of 16 +/- 4 microM, whereas MutT alone binds Mn2+.AMPCPP with a Kd of 135 +/- 30 microM. The 17-fold enhanced paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on the longitudinal relaxation rate of water protons found with the binary MutT.Mn2+ complex decreases to 4.7-fold upon binding of AMPCPP and to 8.7-fold upon binding of Mn2+.AMPCPP, further supporting a metal-bridge MutT.M2+.NTP.M2+ complex. By competition with Mn2+ MutT binds Mg2+ at one site with a Kd of 7.5 mM, and MutT.AMPCPP binds Mg2+ at two sites, the weaker of which has a Kd of 0.9 mM. These values are comparable to the kinetically determined KaMg of 15 +/- 7 mM and KmMg of 1.7 +/- 0.7 mM, respectively. Studies with the racemic, substitution-inert beta, gamma-bidentate tetraamminecobalt (III)-beta,gamma-phosphate-ATP (Co3+(NH3)4ATP) complex show that MutT slowly hydrolyzes only the lambda stereoisomer but requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ to do so, confirming a dual metal ion requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1562300802,"The H(+)-ATPase from chloroplasts was isolated, purified, and reconstituted into liposomes from phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid. The rate of ATP synthesis was measured after energization of the proteoliposomes by an acid-base transition as a function pHout and pHin. At any given pHout, the rate increased sigmoidally with increasing internal H+ concentration with half-maximal rates at about pHin 5.3 for all pHout values between 9.3 and 7.2. At any given pHin, the rate decreased sigmoidally with increasing external H+ concentration with half-maximal rates at about pHout 7.8. The dependence on internal H+ concentration was attributed to the protonation of three monovalent groups with the same pKin, and the dependence on external proton concentration to the deprotonation of two groups with the same pKout. The following scheme is proposed. The first step of the reaction is the binding of three (or four) protons from the inside of the F0 part, followed by ADP and Pi binding at the F1 part. Then, the enzyme conformation is changed, and the proton binding sites are exposed to the outside, followed by proton release from F0 and ATP release from F1. The reaction cycle is closed by changing the enzyme conformation to the form where protons can bind from the inside."
https://openalex.org/W1504566123,"The rate of protein synthesis is controlled in a large number of physiological situations at the stage of 48 S initiation complex formation, a phase that involves the recruitment of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. This process is mediated by the eukaryotic initiation factor-4 (eIF-4) group of translation initiation factors consisting of eIF-4E, eIF-4A, eIF-4B, and eIF-4 gamma. In order to develop a new tool to study this process, we have produced radiolabeled eIF-4 gamma by in vitro transcription and translation. Despite the fact that eIF-4 gamma is predicted from the cDNA sequence to be 154 kDa, the major synthetic product migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 205 kDa. Although this is similar to the migration of the fastest polypeptide of authentic eIF-4 gamma (approximately 206 kDa), no products were found to co-migrate with the slowest forms of authentic eIF-4 gamma (210-220 kDa), suggesting that these forms derive from extensive modification of the initial polypeptide. The in vitro product also formed a complex with eIF-4E, as judged by its ability to bind to m7GTP-Sepharose. Sucrose gradient sedimentation studies demonstrated that eIF-4 gamma was present on both 43 and 48 S initiation complexes but not 80 S complexes. This supports a model in which free eIF-4E binds to mRNA followed by binding of the eIF-4E.mRNA complex to a 43 S initiation complex already containing eIF-4 gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1559187821,"The mechanism by which norepinephrine (NE) down-regulates alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor (alpha-AR) mRNA was studied in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. NE, phorbol esters, and bradykinin each decreased alpha-AR mRNA levels by 70-80%. The protein kinase C inhibitor (+)-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7) abolished the effects of phorbol esters and NE and decreased basal mRNA levels by 52 +/- 3%. Neither ryanodine nor EGTA inhibited down-regulation of alpha-AR mRNA by NE. Actinomycin D caused alpha-AR mRNA level to decrease with a half-life of 3.2 +/- 0.4 h and blocked the effect of H-7 to decrease basal alpha-AR mRNA level. Both NE and phorbol esters increased the rate of alpha-AR mRNA degradation. In NE-desensitized cells, phorbol esters and bradykinin each caused the expected down-regulation of alpha-AR mRNA. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid prolonged the normally transient effect of NE for at least 24 h. We conclude that protein kinase C exerts two opposing effects on alpha-AR mRNA levels, 1) a decrease in the stability of the mRNA that requires the sustained phosphorylation of a protein kinase C substrate and 2) a permissive effect on alpha-AR gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1483154623,"The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (p190MET) is a tyrosine kinase composed of two disulfide-linked chains, alpha of 50 kDa and beta of 145 kDa. We have previously described an isoform (p140MET) containing a beta chain of 85 kDa, lacking the cytoplasmic kinase domain. The two receptor variants originate by post-translational processing of a common single-chain precursor of 170 kDa (Pr170). In the endoplasmic reticulum a fraction of Pr170 is cleaved at the cytosolic side generating an intermediate product of 120 kDa (Pr120). This molecule 1) is already detectable after 15 min of pulse labeling, 2) contains high mannose-branched oligosaccharides, and 3) accumulates upon treatments inhibiting the export from the endoplasmic reticulum. A second cleavage, occurring after 30 min of chase in the trans-Golgi network, converts the single-chain precursors Pr170 and Pr120 into the mature heterodimers p190MET and p140MET. This process is inhibited by brefeldin A treatment. Conditions leading to Pr170 accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as receptor overexpression, induce kinase activation and overproduction of Pr120. Conversely, cells expressing a kinase-defective HGF receptor lack the truncated isoform. The proteolytic cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain may thus represent a safety mechanism aimed at preventing ligand-independent intracellular activation of the HGF receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1540705375,"Intragenomic differences regarding the formation and repair of carcinogen-DNA adducts influence gene-specific mutational patterns and the cellular risk of malignant conversion. Using a newly developed, monoclonal antibody-based immunoaffinity method (Hochleitner, K., Thomale, J., Nikitin, A. Y., and Rajewsky, M. F. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19, 4467-4472), it has become possible to quantitate the mutagenic DNA alkylation product O6-ethylguanine (O6-EtGua) at the level of single-copy genes. We have analyzed the formation and repair kinetics of O6-EtGua in DNA in relation to the transcriptional activity of selected genes in two isogenic rat hepatoma cell lines (Fao and H5) exposed to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. Whereas the frequency of O6-EtGua initially formed in the inactive immunoglobulin E gene was indistinguishable from the value for bulk DNA, the initial O6-EtGua/guanine molar ratio in the transcribed beta-actin gene was nearly three times higher. The overall elimination rates of O6-EtGua were the same for bulk DNA and the IgE gene sequence, i.e. rapid in Fao cells (68% removed within 20 min) and four times slower in H5 cells. Preferential repair was found in the transcribed gene: during the initial phase of elimination, the half-life of O6-EtGua in the beta-actin gene was three times shorter than in the IgE gene in Fao cells (5 versus 15 min) and 12 times shorter in H5 cells (20 min versus 4 h)."
https://openalex.org/W1571411289,"The cytochrome bc1 complex purified from beef heart mitochondria was incorporated into potassium (K+)-loaded phospholipid vesicles by a cholate dialysis method to study the reverse reaction of electron transfer in the complex. The reduction of cytochrome b in the presence of sodium ascorbate was observed on addition of valinomycin to the K(+)-loaded proteoliposomes in a medium containing no external KCl; it was followed by the gradual oxidation. Nigericin accelerated the reoxidation of reduced cytochrome b, indicating that a K+ diffusion potential (negative inside) induced the reduction of cytochrome b. The extent of the cytochrome b reduction depended on the magnitude of the diffusion potential across the liposomal membranes, and its maximal reduction was attained at more than 210 mV of the diffusion potential. It was cytochrome b562 that was reduced during the establishment of the K+ diffusion potential in the presence of ascorbate, and about 90% of cytochrome b562 was estimated to be reduced. Antimycin A and myxothiazol inhibited the diffusion potential-induced reduction of cytochrome b562, and ubiquinone was proved to be essential for the reversed electron transfer. The K+ diffusion potential also induced the partial reduction of cytochrome b566 when cytochrome b562 had previously been reduced with ascorbate plus tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. These results were interpreted well based on the Q cycle scheme which assumed the energy-dependent reduction of ubiquinone at center o. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which did not perturb the ability of proteoliposomes to generate the K+ diffusion potential, inhibited the energy-dependent reduction of cytochrome b562 without a significant loss in the catalytic activity of the complex. The half-inhibition was brought about by 200 mol of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/mol of cytochrome c1. These results strongly suggest the coupling of a proton flow with the reversed electron transfer in the bc1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1527393532,"The ryanodine receptor (RYR)/Ca2+ release channel of avian cardiac muscle was localized by immunocytochemical techniques and biochemically characterized using isolated membrane and receptor protein fractions. Monoclonal antibody C3-33 raised against the canine cardiac RYR bound to the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of pigeon and finch hearts, both at peripheral couplings and at extended junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (EJSR). Immunoblots of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from pigeon and finch hearts showed this antibody recognized a single high molecular weight protein, which co-migrated with the canine M(r) 565,000 RYR/Ca2+ release channel polypeptide. The pigeon heart RYR bound [3H]ryanodine with high affinity in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, comparable to the canine cardiac RYR. Purification of the pigeon RYR yielded a 30 S protein complex, which bound the maximum calculated amount of [3H]ryanodine ((440 +/- 60) pmol/mg protein), assuming one high affinity site/tetrameric 30 S RYR comprised of M(r) 565,000 polypeptides. Autoradiography of isolated finch cardiac myocytes indicated [3H]ryanodine binding throughout the cells. These results suggest that avian heart contains a single population of RYRs, and thereby support the hypothesis that avian EJSR contains functional calcium release channels which, because of the absence of transverse tubules, can be located micrometers away from the surface membrane in avian heart."
https://openalex.org/W1524319516,"We have measured the fidelity of leading and lagging strand DNA replication in HeLa cell extracts. Providing an excess of one dNTP in reactions induces replication errors consistent with misincorporation of that dNTP. With excess dTTP, both substitutions and single-nucleotide frameshifts are induced. Error distribution is nonrandom; reproducible hot spots for a substitution and a frameshift error are observed. Measurements with two vectors having the origin of replication on opposite sides of the mutational target demonstrate that error rates for G.dTTP and C.dTTP mispairs depend on whether the strand is replicated as the leading or lagging strand. Also, the two hot spots are only observed in one origin-target orientation. Replication reactions reconstituted from two fractions derived from extracts are 3-fold less accurate, but the error specificity with excess dTTP is similar to that with extracts. This suggests that the processes responsible for the nonrandom error rates are not lost as a result of fractionation. Furthermore, the reconstituted system is devoid of mismatch repair activity. Thus, mismatch repair is not responsible for the mispair-, site-, and strand-specific differences observed."

It consists of a single chain of 58 kDa and exhibits a restricted distribution. The interaction between TIN antigen and laminin or type IV collagen has been studied using solid-phase binding assays and found to be for both macromolecules specific, saturable, and with an affinity in the low micromolar range. In similar assays, TIN antigen did not interact with heparin. In turbidimetry assays, it was found that the presence of TIN antigen did not affect the polymerization of type IV collagen but had a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on laminin polymerization and on preformed laminin polymers. TIN antigen was able to promote adhesion of epithelial cells derived from kidney tubules and of endothelial cells derived from aorta. The data suggest that TIN antigen may be a macromolecule of importance both for basement membrane ultrastructure and cellular adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1565944624,"Interconversion of phosphoenzyme resistant to K+ and sensitive to ADP (E1P) and phosphoenzyme resistant to ADP and sensitive to K+ (E2P) was studied in bovine brain and dog and pig kidney. The kinetics of dephosphorylation were observed by chasing phosphoenzyme formed from [32P]ATP with unlabeled ATP with or without ADP or K+. Phosphorylation in 0.6-1.0 M NaCl produced mostly ADP-sensitive potassium-insensitive E1P. A potassium chase of this phosphoenzyme exposed its rate of conversion to potassium-sensitive ADP-insensitive E2P. At 20 degrees C the rate constant was approximately 1 s-1. Simultaneous dilution of [NaCl] in the chase to 100 mM increased the constant to approximately 60 s-1, which probably qualifies E1P as an intermediate in Na,K-ATPase activity. Anions inhibited conversion according to a Hofmeister series. Na+ had no specific effect. At 0 degrees C the rate constant was 1 s-1 for < 3 s followed by a return to the slow rate. The rapid rate would qualify E1P to participate in Na,K-ATPase activity if this rapid state participates in the normal reaction cycle. Phosphorylation in 0.02-0.1 M NaCl produced mostly E2P. Upward jumps in [NaCl] converted E2P to E1P equally rapidly and transiently. Oligomycin and high [salt] cooperated in stabilizing E1P. Jumps in [salt] greatly and transiently increased the rate of conversion of one form of the phosphoenzyme to the other. This extraordinary result required heterogeneous kinetics. A model is proposed based on control of enzyme conformation by changes in separate unmixed phases of the lipid of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1903821594,"Aeromonas sp. secrete a lipase/acyltransferase that shares several properties with the mammalian plasma enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. Reaction of the enzyme with tetranitromethane led to modification of 2 tyrosines and a nearly 80% decline in enzyme activity. Replacing Tyr230 with Phe altered the activity of the enzyme in the same way as did treatment with tetranitromethane. Unlike the wild type enzyme, which preferentially hydrolyzes the 2-position acyl chain of phosphatidylcholine, the Y230F mutant enzyme did not discriminate between the 1- and 2-positions of the phospholipid. Tyr230 may be necessary to correctly position phospholipid substrates at the active site. Several amino acids around the active site Ser16 of the were also changed. Replacing Ser18 with Gly, bringing the enzyme's sequence into line with the lipase consensus sequence, resulted in reduced secretion of the protein and complete loss of activity. Changing this serine to Val led to an inactive protein that was not secreted at all. Substituting Phe13 in the hydrophobic region of the consensus sequence with Ser also prevented secretion, although the mutant protein appeared to be active. The Aeromonas may represent a distinct group of lipolytic enzymes which have a novel active site structure."
https://openalex.org/W1545685160,"The same 70-kDa protein, present on the surface of mouse lymphocytes, served as the predominant binding site for heparin, heparinoids, and bacterial lipoteichoic acids, as well as peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides. This conclusion was supported by the following results: (a) all of these compounds photoaffinity cross-linked to one major 70-kDa 6.5-7.0 pI protein that co-migrated on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (b) peptide maps of the 70-kDa proteins digested with chymotrypsin, subtilisin, protease V, or papain yielded the same peptides for heparin-, lipoteichoic acid-, peptidoglycan-, and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins; (c) cross-linking of peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and heparin was competitively inhibited by the same compounds with the same order of potency, i.e. carboxyl-reduced sulfated heparin > peptidoglycan > pentosan polysulfate > heparin > chitin > dextran sulfate > trestatin sulfate > polyanetholesulfonate > fucoidan > beta-cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate > heparan sulfate > carrageenan lambda > lipoteichoic acids > Re-lipopolysaccharide > lipopolysaccharide > lipid A > polygalacturonic acid; and (d) cross-linking of each of these ligands was not inhibited by carboxyl-reduced heparin, dextran, beta-cyclodextrin, trestatin, carrageenan kappa, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, beta-D-glucan, carboxy-methylcellulose, levan, alpha-D-mannan, and glycogen. The minimum size of the molecule that bound was 7-9 glycan residues, whereas, di- and trisaccharides did not bind. There was a logarithmic linear relationship between the strength of the binding and the length of the polymer (up to > 1500 glycan residues), which indicates an avidity effect of the cooperative binding of one polymeric molecule to several receptor molecules on the cell surface. The 70-kDa receptor, therefore, has a broad, but limited specificity of binding for non-charged (peptidoglycan and chitin), highly negatively charged (heparin and heparinoids), and weakly negatively charged (lipoteichoic acids, lipopolysaccharides, and lipid A) ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1513042837,"Monoclonal antibodies that react with the capsular polysaccharide, termed glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), of Cryptococcus neoformans have potential roles in the diagnosis, monitoring of disease progress, and immunotherapy of cryptococcal GXM of all four serotypes. A molecular model of the Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody 439 was constructed from the amino acid sequence and a template antibody molecule, Fab 4-4-20. A tryptophan is present on the surface between light chain CDR3 and heavy chain CDR3 in the putative binding site. This tryptophan residue proved to be a reporter group, and a fluorescence study of Fab 439 was performed to analyze the interaction between cryptococcal GXM and Fab 439. Binding of the polysaccharide enhanced the intrinsic fluorescence and caused a blue shift in the emission maximum, indicating that the environment of a tryptophan changes from a polar to less polar environment. This is consistent with the loss of water from the binding site caused by the binding of antigen. This interpretation was confirmed by acrylamide quenching, which showed that 1 less tryptophan was exposed to solvent in the Fab-GXM complex than in free Fab. Fluorescence titration was used to determine binding and dissociation constants (KD). The apparent KD values for serotypes A-C were approximately the same; the KD for serotype D GXM was 5-11-fold greater. De-O-acetylation of serotype A GXM produced a 31-fold increase in the KD, indicating that the O-acetyl groups are important, but not essential, for binding. Carboxyl groups appear to be essential for strong binding because the KD for carboxyl-reduced GXM was so large that it could not be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1586837637,The promoter region of the staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) gene (sea) of Staphylococcus aureus was localized by primer extension analysis in conjunction with in vitro mutagenesis. The 5'-end of sea mRNA was located 86 base pairs upstream of the translational initiation codon. A DNA region with good agreement with canonical promoter sequences was observed beginning 8 base pairs upstream of the apparent transcriptional start site. Analysis of a series of progressive deletions of upstream DNA revealed that no DNA upstream of the putative -35 region was required for transcription of sea (determined by primer extension analysis) or for SEA production as detected by Western immunoblot analysis. Deletion mutants extending into the -35 region or mutants containing nucleotide substitutions in the -10 region both showed dramatic reductions in SEA production and transcription of sea. Analysis of a deletion mutant in which 59 base pairs between the transcriptional and translational start sites were deleted revealed slightly increased levels of SEA production.

From tryptic digestion, circular dichroism, and radiationless energy transfer measurements, it appears that Phk13 forms an elongated complex with calmodulin in which the peptide is in a non-helical conformation, probably bent into a hairpin-shaped structure, the connecting strand of calmodulin is extended and exposed to the action of proteolytic enzymes, and the peptide makes contact with both the N- and C-terminal half-molecules of calmodulin.

https://openalex.org/W1480671701,"The potential of reconstituted Sendai viral envelopes containing only the fusion protein (F-virosomes) was evaluated for a targeted cytosolic delivery of lysozyme to human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2) in culture. 125I-Lysozyme loaded into F-virosomes was used to monitor its fusion-mediated transfer to the HepG2 cells. Using fusion assay based on the transfer of water soluble probe, we have demonstrated the existence of aqueous connection between F-virosomes and target cells. Target specificity of the F-virosomes was ensured by the strong interaction between terminal beta-galactose moiety of F protein and the asialoglycoprotein receptor on the membrane of HepG2 cells. Incubation of the loaded F-virosomes with cells resulted in fusion-mediated injection, as inferred from the ability of cells to internalize lysozyme in the presence of azide (an inhibitor of the endocytotic process). Binding as well as fusion of the F-virosomes to HepG2 cells was solely mediated by the F protein. Introduction of 125I-lysozyme into the HepG2 cells was confirmed by selective accumulation of acid and antibody-precipitable radioactivity in the cytosolic compartment. The structural integrity of the internalized lysozyme was also assessed. The potential usefulness of F-virosomes with defined specificities as biological carrier for both in vitro and in vivo cytosolic delivery of macromolecules and drugs has been established."
https://openalex.org/W1521945879,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model system to characterize the covalent attachment of palmitoleic acid to proteins. Chemically synthesized cis-[9,10-3H]hexadecenoic acid (palmitoleic acid) was used to demonstrate the attachment of this lipid species to at least six proteins (m = 122, 58, 45, 41, 31, and 17 kDa). The majority of the labeled proteins are distinct from those labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (16:0). Based on the lability of the bond in the presence of methanolic KOH or hydroxylamine (pH 8), we propose that [3H] palmitoleic acid is attached to proteins via a thioester linkage. The identity of the palmitoleic acid was established by C-18 reverse phase high performance thin layer chromatography and argentation thin layer chromatography analysis after the fatty acid was liberated from the proteins by either transesterification or saponification. Incorporation of [3H]palmitoleic acid into proteins was only slightly inhibited (relative to [3H] myristic acid) by the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that the attachment of [3H]palmitoleic acid occurs post-translationally. This report is the first description of multiprotein acylation by a long chain unsaturated fatty acid."
https://openalex.org/W1540494806,"The enzyme N-acetylglucosamine phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase) catalyzes the second step in the formation of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting signal on lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharides by removing GlcNAc residues from GlcNAc-alpha-P-mannose moieties, which are formed in the first step by UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase). Phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase, a membrane-bound enzyme, has been purified about 3,000-fold from bovine liver to apparent homogeneity using detergent solubilization, fractionation on DEAE-cellulose, affinity chromatography on lectin-Sepharose columns, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme migrated as 129- and 121-kDa species on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since both bands had the same amino-terminal sequence, the smaller species is presumed to be derived from the larger by proteolysis. Kinetic analysis of bovine phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase with enzymatically synthesized artificial and biological substrates indicates that phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase requires GlcNAc-alpha-P R for substrate and that when R contains the Man alpha 1,2Man linkage the substrate binding is most effective. Unlike GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, bovine phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase does not require a protein recognition determinant on lysosomal enzyme substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1485321782,"N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase) has been purified 3,000-fold from bovine liver and its kinetic properties determined as described in the previous report (Mullis, K. G., Huynh, M., and Kornfeld, R. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1718-1726). This report describes the hydrodynamic and lectin binding properties of phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase as well as its intracellular localization. The molecular weight of phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase is 204,950, as determined from density gradient centrifugation in D2O and H2O glycerol gradients and gel filtration. Enzymatically active enzyme migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 129,000, consistent with native phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase being a dimer. The lectin binding properties of phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase indicate that it contains sialylated species of both complex type N-linked oligosaccharides and O-linked oligosaccharides. In immunofluorescence studies phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase shows a perinuclear, Golgi localization in Vero cells as does the mid-Golgi marker alpha-mannosidase II. After exposure of the Vero cells to brefeldin A, phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase assumes an endoplasmic reticulum staining pattern. In contrast, in cells costained with the trans-Golgi marker wheat germ agglutinin, the wheat germ agglutinin marker assumed an endosomal network appearance after exposure to brefeldin A. These findings indicate that phosphodiester alpha-GlcNAcase is normally located within the Golgi stack, separate from the trans-Golgi and trans-Golgi network stained by wheat germ agglutinin."
https://openalex.org/W1661610526,"We have examined the interaction of a series of mutant trp repressors with various operator DNA sequences using gel retardation. Binding to 40 base pairs (bp) TrpEDCBA operator yielded patterns distinct from the wild-type protein for superrepressors EK13, EK18, and EK49, with a protein-DNA complex of higher stoichiometry (three dimers/operator) than observed for wild-type repressor (two dimers/operator). This higher stoichiometry complex may contribute to the enhanced binding affinity and higher protein-operator stability observed for the superrepressors. In contrast, DN46 displayed the same complexes characteristic of the wild-type protein, although the complex of a single dimer with operator was more prominent in the DN46 binding pattern than wild-type despite higher apparent affinity of this protein for TrpEDCBA operator than wild-type protein. The binding of AV77 was indistinguishable from the wild-type protein. Similar patterns to that found for TrpEDCBA were also observed for the 40-bp aroH operator and symmetrized derivatives of TrpEDCBA for these superrepressors. Binding of EK13, EK18, and EK49 superrepressors to half-site DNAs, composed of 20 bp of TrpEDCBA sequence coupled with 20 bp of lac operator sequence, yielded 2:1 complex as the primary product with no detectable 3:1 complex; thus, two half-sites appear to be required for generation of the 3:1 complex. Mutation in the tryptophan-binding site can also generate higher order complexes with TrpEDCBA DNA as demonstrated by the binding of VA58; the presence of 3:1 complex with this protein was also dependent on the presence of two half-sites. In addition to effects of sequence changes in the protein, the ligand employed can influence the binding pattern, as demonstrated for EK49 and VA58 using 5-methyl-tryptophan; the 3:1 complex is produced more prominently and at lower protein concentration for both mutants. It is apparent from these data that binding of the trp repressor to DNA is influenced by the operator sequence, the nature of the corepressor, as well as interactions (perhaps involving the N-terminal regions) that occur within and between the dimeric structure of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1515065361,"Short-term dietary exposure of rats to a representative member of each of the three classes of peroxisome proliferators was found to elicit: (i) 71-80 and 66-75% reductions in the specific activities of the hepatic beta-galactoside alpha 2,6- and alpha 2,3-sialyltransferases, respectively; (ii) a 67-69% reduction in the level of hepatic beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase protein; and (iii) 41-46 and 6-28% reductions in the levels of the hepatic beta-galactoside alpha 2,6- and alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase mRNAs, respectively. These changes were found to correlate with a reduction in the sialylation of the N-linked glycans of a prototypical hepatocytic sialoglycoconjugate, the integral plasma membrane glycoprotein CE9, as was evident through: (i) a decrease in apparent molecular mass, (ii) a conversion to a more basic distribution of isoelectric points, and (iii) 56-72 and 33-44% decreases in the ability to bind lectins specific for sialic acid in alpha 2,3- and alpha 2,6-linkage, respectively. When assessed by labeling semithin frozen sections of liver tissue with a fluorescent lectin specific for alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid, the reduced sialylation observed for CE9 was found to extend to other hepatocytic glycoconjugates in the livers of peroxisome proliferator-treated rats."
https://openalex.org/W1535507789,"Previous work has implicated sequences within the tandem repeats of cartilage link protein in the interaction of link protein with hyaluronan. This conclusion was based on competitive inhibition experiments using synthetic peptides (Goetinck, P. F., Stirpe, N. S., Tsonis, P. A., and Carlone, D. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 2403-2407). Further investigation of this system using high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and competitive inhibition with other peptides indicates that the previously observed inhibition of link protein-hyaluronan binding was not caused by peptide-hyaluronan interactions. Instead, nonspecific aggregation of the peptides with link protein is proposed to account for all of the experimental data. Consequently, there is no direct experimental evidence to support the conclusion that these sequences in the tandem repeats of link protein are responsible for the link protein-hyaluronan interaction. If these peptides do represent the hyaluronan binding regions of link protein, these results imply a highly structure-dependent interaction between link protein and hyaluronan. Conformational analysis of the peptides using two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy indicates that the linear peptides do not adopt any stable secondary structure. However, several residues in the disulfide-looped peptides exhibit connectivities, suggesting a relatively long-lived extended chain conformation, consistent with predictions of secondary structure based on sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1666134173,"The hydrophobic core of the Escherichia coli LamB signal sequence contains two structurally distinct regions. One region forms a helix in nonpolar environments, and the other is less structured. These regions seem to be of special importance for export, as judged by the magnitude of the defect caused by their mutational inactivation. To gain insight into the mechanistic importance of these two regions, we examined the ability of precursors to pass partially through the export pathway when each region is mutated. The results demonstrate that mutations in the helical and unstructured regions of the signal sequence block different steps in the export pathway."
