On the other hand, hyperpolarization was recorded in the case of CaCl(2), quinine, and acetic acid, all of which had an inhibitory effect on the initiation of chemosensory impulses."

Protein, nucleic acid and 16 en- zyme activities were determined in the fractions, and each gave a consistent pattern of distribution in a number of preparations. Some of the enzyme activities, for example, lactic dehydro- genase, isomerase, and aldolase, were not adsorbed by the diethyl- aminoethyl cellulose at pH 8.0 and low ionic strength. Several of the enzymes gave multiple peaks of activity. With two of multiple peak enzymes, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, rechromatography of one of the peaks, under the same conditions, gave a single peak at the anticipated position.

Electrophoretic analyses of these subfractions on starch gels, at pH 8.5 and 5.7, reveal the presence of at least four ceruloplasmins, two of which appear to differ in histidine content."

https://openalex.org/W2050963430,"IT is well established that immature insects, including the larvæ of Musca vicina Macq., require a dietary source of sterols for growth and development1,2. Chauvin3 reported that sterols are necessary for reproduction in the German cockroach but did not present supporting evidence or describe the effect of sterol deficiency on the reproductive processses. The house fly, which has been found to lack the mechanism for sterol biosynthesis from 14C-sodium acetate4, utilizes a high percentage of administered 14C-cholesterol in egg production5. The following study was undertaken to determine the effect of dietary cholesterol on reproduction of the house fly."

Tears are bacteriostatic as well as moistening. The hypothesis is advanced that natural selection favored those infants who could produce tears, and that in this way the function became established in man."

https://openalex.org/W2029417716,"IN recent years there have been one or two reports of the occurrence of free glyceric acid in higher plants. Balansard1 identified the acid as the diuretic principle in the pods of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) but gave no indication of the amount present other than could be inferred from the diuretic effect. Isherwood, Chen and Mapson2 isolated D-glyceric acid from cress seedlings; they found that it was present in amounts ranging from 5 to 50 m. equiv./kgm. of fresh weight in seedlings cultured for 5 days at 20° C. in the dark on 0.04 M sodium bicarbonate solution. Palmer3 isolated D-glyceric acid from tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum var. Connecticut) grown in the shade and estimated the quantity present to be of the order of 5–15m. equiv./kgm. (fresh weight)."

https://openalex.org/W2057037394,"Resistance to bacteriostasis by 2-thiazole alanine develops rapidly; however, such resistance is lost during growth in the absence of the analog. This induced resistance is accompanied by increased formation of an enzyme sensitive to 2-thiazole alanine. Maintenance of the elevated enzyme levels in growing cells, like resistance, requires the presence of the analog."

The complex relationship previously reported was again found, but only for stimulation of the fovea. The results from the peripheral regions indicate that differential sensitivity is adecreasing function of the rate of intermittence."

https://openalex.org/W2018563702,"THE hypothesis1 that antibodies are not transmitted through placentae of the epitheliochorial and syndesmochorial types and are transmitted through haemochorial and haemoendothelial types was at one time widely accepted. More recently it has been demonstrated in the rabbit2 and guinea pig3 in which the placentae are haemochorial that the transmission of antibodies occurs exclusively via the yolk sac. In the rat transmission occurs by way of the yolk-sac endoderm and by way of the gut, and in this species some transmission across the haemochorial placenta could not be excluded4."

The results concerning the action of thyroxine are contradictory1–5. This is mainly due to two essential factors: (1) feeding; (2) activity during measurements6. The current investigation was initiated to determine the effect of thyroxine upon the rate of oxygen consumption of Protopterus, These fish do not present the above-mentioned difficulties."

This communication is concerned with the cell physiology of these mutants in a medium devoid of D-glutamic acid."

An aqueous solution of tannin gives an insoluble precipitate with solutions of salts of heavy metals, and with solutions of organic substances, such as alkaloids, gelatine and protein. Numerous investigators have studied these complexes, using various means to break them up. We have used ultrasonic vibration, with which we previously broke up the tannin-alkaloid complex in an alcoholic extract quinine bark.1 Other workers3 have studied the effect of ultrasound on the structure of organic substances, particularly molecular size. The present work was concerned with the complex of tannin with human serum protein."
