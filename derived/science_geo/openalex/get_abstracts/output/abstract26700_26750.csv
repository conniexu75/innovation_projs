https://openalex.org/W1546259505,"Ligand-mediated perturbation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) triggers a rapid increase in phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity in resting T-cells. Although the mechanism by which TCR ligation regulates PLC activity is unknown, recent studies suggest that coupling of this receptor complex to PLC activity is dependent on an intermediate protein tyrosine phosphorylation event(s). In the present study, we demonstrate that antibody-mediated TCR cross-linkage results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1. Stimulation of the TCR for 30 s induced a 4-5-fold increase in the level of PLC activity recovered in anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody immunoprecipitates from stimulated Jurkat cells. The appearance of PLC activity in the immunoprecipitates preceded the onset of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in vivo, which began 30-60 s after TCR ligation. Furthermore, the TCR-mediated increase in anti-Tyr(P) antibody-bound PLC activity was inhibited by staurosporine at drug concentrations identical with those required for in vivo inhibition of TCR-dependent phosphoinositide breakdown. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that TCR ligation dramatically increased the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma 1 present in anti-Tyr(P) antibody immunoprecipitates from stimulated Jurkat cells. These results strongly suggest that the TCR complex expressed by Jurkat cells is functionally coupled to the phosphoinositide-dependent signaling pathway through the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1."

https://openalex.org/W1561140704,"The Aspergillus nidulans gene (acvA) encoding the first catalytic steps of penicillin biosynthesis that result in the formation of delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV), has been positively identified by matching a 15-amino acid segment of sequence obtained from an internal CNBr fragment of the purified amino-terminally blocked protein with that predicted from the DNA sequence. acvA is transcribed in the opposite orientation to ipnA (encoding isopenicillin N synthetase), with an intergenic region of 872 nucleotides. The gene has been completely sequenced at the nucleotide level and found to encode a protein of 3,770 amino acids (molecular mass, 422,486 Da). Both fast protein liquid chromatography and native gel estimates of molecular mass are consistent with this predicted molecular weight. The enzyme was identified as a glycoprotein by means of affinity blotting with concanavalin A. No evidence for the presence of introns within the acvA gene has been found. The derived amino acid sequence of ACV synthetase (ACVS) contains three homologous regions of about 585 residues, each of which displays areas of similarity with (i) adenylate-forming enzymes such as parsley 4-coumarate-CoA ligase and firefly luciferase and (ii) several multienzyme peptide synthetases, including bacterial gramicidin S synthetase 1 and tyrocidine synthetase 1. Despite these similarities, conserved cysteine residues found in the latter synthetases and thought to be essential for the thiotemplate mechanism of peptide biosynthesis have not been detected in the ACVS sequence. These observations, together with the occurrence of putative 4'-phosphopantetheine-attachment sites and a putative thioesterase site, are discussed with reference to the reaction sequence leading to production of the ACV tripeptide. We speculate that each of the homologous regions corresponds to a functional domain that recognizes one of the three substrate amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1517020408,"The mechanisms underlying agonist-induced oscillations in intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) in hepatocytes were investigated by utilizing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a tool to perturb hepatocyte Ca2+ homeostasis independent of receptor activation. In permeabilized hepatocytes, TBHP inhibited Ca2+ uptake into the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive Ca2+ pool and increased the sensitivity to InsP3 for Ca2+ release. The effects of TBHP could be mimicked by addition of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reversed by pretreatment with dithiothreitol. TBHP and GSSG had no effect on the metabolic degradation of [3H]InsP3 in permeabilized cells. The effect of TBHP on [Ca2+]i in intact cells was investigated by digital imaging fluorescence microscopy of Fura-2-loaded primary cultured hepatocytes. TBHP treatment initiated a series of [Ca2+]i oscillations similar to those caused by Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones. Moreover, in common with the actions of hormones in these cells (Rooney, T.A., Sass, E., and Thomas, A,P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10792-10796), the [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by TBHP propagated through the cell as Ca2+ waves, originating from a discrete subcellular locus identical to that for phenylephrine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. The Ca2+ waves induced by TBHP had similar rates of progress (24-27 microns.s-1) to those generated by phenylephrine. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ increased the initial latency of the TBHP responses, but had no effect on the amplitude or rate of propagation of the Ca2+ waves. Addition of TBHP to cells in the presence of phenylephrine converted the oscillatory phenylephrine [Ca2+]i response into a sustained [Ca2+]i increase. The effects of TBHP in intact cells occurred in the absence of any stimulated inositol polyphosphate formation as measured in populations of [3H]inositol-labeled hepatocytes. The data indicate that spatially organized [Ca2+]i oscillations in intact hepatocytes can occur without any requirement for phospholipase C activation. Furthermore, for agents that act by mobilizing Ca2+ from the InsP3-sensitive pool, the kinetics of the Ca2+ release phase of the [Ca2+]i oscillations appears to be independent of the nature of the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1557277452,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase is responsible for the ultimate step in sphingolipid breakdown, converting phosphorylated long chain bases into ethanolamine phosphate and a fatty aldehyde. Using tritiated dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, prepared enzymatically from [4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosylphosphocholine, we have reinvestigated the subcellular distribution of this enzyme in rat liver. Upon cell fractionation by differential centrifugation, the enzyme showed a microsomal distribution. Further separation of the microsomal fraction by sucrose gradient centrifugation confirmed an association with the endoplasmic reticulum. By means of constrained nonlinear regression, no evidence for a significant association with mitochondrial membranes, as reported previously (Stoffel, W., LeKim, D., and Sticht, G. (1969) Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 350, 1233-1241), nor with other cell compartments was found. The lyase activity, which appeared to be sensitive to different detergents, but not to Triton X-100, was not latent. It could be solubilized with Triton X-100, but not by high ionic strength, indicating that it is an integral membrane protein whose catalytic site is most probably exposed to the cytosol. Treatment of intact microsomal vesicles with trypsin or thermolysin inactivated the lyase activity, confirming that its catalytic site(s) or other domains essential for activity face the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2158098945,"Transcription of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTTl gene encoding the cytosolic catalase T has been previously shown to be derepressed by nutrient stress. To investigate whether expression of this gene is also affected by other types of stress, the influence of heat shock on CTTl expression was studied. The results obtained show that expression of the gene is low at 23 C and is induced rapidly at 37 C. By deletion analysis, a promoter element necessary for high level induction by heat shock was located between base pairs -340 and -364 upstream of the translation start codon. This region was demonstrated to be sufficient for heat shock control by placing it upstream of a S. cerevisiae LEU2-lacZ fusion gene. Mutagenesis of the region showed that the response to heat shock is not mediated by a sequence similar to canonical heat shock elements, but by DNA elements also involved in nutrient control of transcription. Catalase T appears to have a function in protecting yeast cells against oxidative damage under stress conditions. Catalase Tcontaining strains are less sensitive to exposure to 50 C (lethal heat shock) than isogenic catalase Tdeficient mutants, and catalase T-containing strains pretreated by incubation at 37 C are less sensitive to HzOz than pretreated catalase-deficient mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1594893804,"Interleukin (IL) 1 alpha is synthesized as a 33-kDa precursor that is enzymatically cleaved to the 15-17-kDa forms that are found in the culture supernatants of activated macrophages. We have explored the possibility that calcium might enhance IL-1 processing and secretion via the stimulation of a calcium-dependent protease. We have found that lysates prepared from human peripheral blood monocytes, the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937, and the murine macrophage cell line P388D1 contain a calcium-dependent IL-1 alpha processing activity that cleaves the IL-1 alpha precursor to its mature form. Although NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lysates also contain IL-1 processing activity, lysates from the murine thymoma EL-4, the human epidermoid cell line HEp-2, and the human foreskin fibroblast line FS-4 lack this activity. IL-1 processing activity is inhibited by leupeptin and exhibits a molecular mass of 80-110 kDa. The processing activity is also inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against calpain type I. These results indicate that the processing of the IL-1 alpha precursor is mediated, at least in part, by a member of the calpain family of proteases. Mixing experiments revealed that lysates from EL-4 or HEp-2 cells contain an inhibitor(s) of the calpain-like protease in macrophage extracts. It is, therefore, likely that many non-macrophage cell types are unable to process the IL-1 alpha precursor because the calpain present in these cells is only weakly active due to the presence of a specific inhibitor(s) such as calpastatin."

https://openalex.org/W1557878150,"Previous observations suggested that pNcollagen III, the partially processed form of type III procollagen, coats fibrils of collagen I and thereby helps regulate the diameter of fibrils formed by collagen I. The previous observations, however, did not exclude the possibility that pNcollagen III was deposited on preformed collagen I fibrils after the fibrils were assembled. Here, mixtures of pNcollagen III and collagen I were generated simultaneously by enzymatic cleavage of precursor forms of the proteins. The results demonstrated that pNcollagen III forms true copolymers with collagen I. The presence of pNcollagen III both inhibited the rate at which collagen I assembled into fibrils and decreased the amount of collagen I incorporated into fibrils at steady-state equilibrium. In addition, the results demonstrated that copolymerization of pNcollagen III with collagen I generated fibrils that were thinner than fibrils generated under the same conditions from collagen I alone. Increasing the initial molar ratio of pNcollagen III to collagen I in the solution-phase increased the amount of pNcollagen III copolymerizing with collagen I and progressively decreased the diameter of the fibrils. Therefore, the copolymers were heterogeneous in that the stoichiometry of the two monomers in the fibrils varied. The results are consistent with a model in which pNcollagen III can regulate the diameter of collagen I fibrils by coating the surface of the fibrils and thereby allow tip growth but not lateral growth of the fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1503864937,"A 2.3-kilobase pair DNA fragment of the yeast CAL1 gene was cloned by complementation of the cal1-1 mutation, which causes a defect in nuclear division and bud formation (Ohya, Y., Ohsumi, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1984) Mol. & Gen. Genet. 193, 389-394). Nucleotide sequencing of this fragment revealed a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 376 amino acids. Comparative analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence has shown that the CAL1 product has similarity to two yeast proteins: the DPR1 (RAM) gene product that is involved in processing of ras protein at the farnesylation step, and the essential ORF2 protein whose structural gene has a head-to-head arrangement with PRP4, which is involved in mRNA processing. Functional homology between CAL1 and DPR1 has also been suggested from genetic evidence that multiple copies of the CAL1 gene suppress the growth defects of a dpr1 null mutant at high temperature. This suppression is Ca(2+)-dependent, since it was not observed in complete medium containing 200 microM CaCl2 but was apparent in medium containing 100 mM CaCl2. From sequence analysis of the cal1-1 mutation, together with the alignment of the three gene products, we have concluded that the conserved Gly328 in the C terminus is important for activity. We suggest that the CAL1 protein participates in a ras-like C-terminal modification of proteins involved in nuclear division and bud growth."
https://openalex.org/W1611606593,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a mitogen for renal proximal tubule cells, activated the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt in renal proximal tubule cells (Stanton, R. C., and Seifter, J. L. (1988) Am. J. Physiol. 254, C267-C271). We therefore evaluated the effect of EGF on the HMP shunt enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, the rate-limiting enzyme) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Rat renal cortical cells (RCC) were incubated with either EGF or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and then assayed for G6PD and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities. EGF and PDGF increased G6PD activity by 25 and 27% respectively. Although phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), ionomycin, PMA + ionomycin, and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP had no significant effect on the activity, a 5-min preincubation with PMA potentiated the activation of G6PD by PDGF. Growth factor activation of G6PD was also seen in a fibroblast and epithelial cell line. None of the agents affected 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity in the RCC or in the cell lines. Further exploration into a possible mechanism for G6PD activation revealed that growth factors caused release of G6PD from a structural element within the cell. Streptolysin O permeabilization of RCC did not cause significant release of G6PD. However, within 1 min of addition of EGF or PDGF to permeabilized cells, G6PD was released into the cell supernatant. The nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, guanosine 5‘-O-(thiotriphosphate), caused a similar release of G6PD. Preincubation with pertussis toxin or guanyl-5‘-yl thiophosphate inhibited the PDGF but not the EGF effect. Although the data do not establish a definitive proof linking G6PD release and G6PD activation, these results suggest that they are related. Thus, growth factor stimulation of the HMP shunt likely occurs by a novel mechanism associated with release of bound G6PD."
https://openalex.org/W1554148351,"By using site-directed mutagenesis techniques, the essential amino acids at the catalytic center of porcine thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) were determined. Seven oligonucleotides were designed, synthesized, and used to construct mutants, ETT-C22S, ETT-C25S, ETT-C25A, ETT-R26V, ETT-K27Q, ETT-R26V: K27Q, and ETT-C78S:C82S, by altering their codons in pig liver thioltransferase cDNA/M13mp18 clones. Each of the thioltransferases was purified to homogeneity and its dithiol-disulfide exchange, and dehydroascorbate reductase activities were compared with those of the wild-type (ETT). Evidence was obtained that Cys22 was essential for catalytic activity, and the extremely low pKa value of its sulfhydryl group was facilitated primarily by Arg26. The role of Lys27 at the active center was different from that of Arg26 and may be important in stabilizing the E.S intermediate by electrostatic forces. The second pair of cysteines, Cys78 and Cys82, nearer the C terminus, were not directly involved in the active center, but may play a role in defining the native protein structure. The replacement of the original Cys with a Ser at position 25 increased rather than decreased the enzyme activity, suggesting that the proposed intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys22 and Cys25 is not necessary for the catalytic mechanism of the Ser25 mutant, but does not rule out such a mechanism for the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2013257398,"Muscarinic synaptic activation is known to be involved in cortical arousal as well as learning. Although simple increases in the electrical responsiveness of neurons might be the basis of arousal, the linkage of muscarinic transmission to the synaptic plasticity that might underlie learning is lacking. Most models of synaptic plasticity involve postsynaptic Ca2+ changes as a trigger for subsequent processes. We imaged muscarinic effects on free Ca2+ accumulation during intracellular recordings from CA3 pyramidal neurons in the guinea pig hippocampal slice. Muscarinic activation, either by repetitive stimulation of cholinergic fibers or by bath-applied carbachol, strongly increased intradendritic Ca2+ accumulation during directly evoked repetitive firing, in part by blocking a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance. The effects of repetitive stimulation of cholinergic fibers were enhanced by the acetylcholine-esterase blocker eserine and blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. These findings demonstrate a novel muscarinic reinforcement of Ca 2+ changes during excitation, which are probably significant for synapse modification."
https://openalex.org/W1490293082,"A Drosophila phospholipase C (PLC) gene, designated as plc-21, was isolated by screening a genomic DNA library using a cDNA for a previously isolated Drosophila PLC gene, norpA, as probe under reduced stringency hybridization conditions. The gene maps to 21C on the left arm of the second chromosome. Two proteins of 1305 and 1312 amino acids, respectively, were deduced from two classes of cDNA which were isolated. The two putative plc-21 proteins are similar in sequence and overall structure to the beta-class of PLCs found in mammals and differ from each other only by 7 amino acid residues that are present near the C terminus of one of the proteins but not the other. Hybridization of plc-21 cDNA probes to blots of poly(A)+ RNA revealed that the gene encodes a 7.0-kilobase transcript that could be detected in the head but not in the body of adult flies and a 5.6-kilobase transcript that could be detected throughout development and in both heads and bodies of adults. In situ hybridization of cDNA sequences to tissue sections showed that the gene is expressed in the neuronal cell bodies of the optic lobe, central brain, and thoracic ganglia of adults and the brain of larvae. This tissue distribution of plc-21 transcripts is identical to the distribution of transcripts from a Drosophila Go alpha-subunit gene that we reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W1557709748,"A high Mr complex isolated from rabbit reticulocytes contains valyl-tRNA synthetase and the four subunits of elongation factor 1 (EF-1). Previously, valyl-tRNA synthetase and the alpha, beta, and delta subunits of EF-1 were shown to be phosphorylated in reticulocytes in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Phosphorylation of the complex was accompanied by an increase in both valyl-tRNA synthetase and EF-1 activity (Venema, R. C., Peters, H. I., and Traugh, J. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem., 266, 11993-11998). To investigate phosphorylation of the valyl-tRNA synthetase EF-1 complex in vitro by protein kinase C, the complex has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rabbit reticulocytes by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-5m, affinity chromatography on tRNA-Sepharose, and fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono Q. Valyl-tRNA synthetase and the beta and delta subunits of EF-1 in the complex are highly phosphorylated by protein kinase C (0.5-0.9 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit), while EF-1 alpha is phosphorylated to a lesser extent (0.2 mol/mol). However, the isolated EF-1 alpha subunit is highly phosphorylated (2.0 mol/mol). Phosphopeptide mapping of EF-1 alpha shows that the same sites are modified by protein kinase C in vitro and in PMA-treated cells. Phosphorylation of the valyl-tRNA synthetase.EF-1 complex results in a 3-fold increase in activity of EF-1 as measured by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis; no effect of phosphorylation is detected with valyl-tRNA synthetase and isolated EF-1 alpha. Thus, phosphorylation and activation of EF-1 by protein kinase C, which has been shown to occur in vitro as well as in reticulocytes, may have a role in PMA stimulation of translational rates."
https://openalex.org/W1490803640,"Abstract gp115 is a N- and O-glycosylated protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is also modified by addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol, which anchors the protein to the plasma membrane. The gene encoding gp115 (GGP1) has been cloned by a two-step procedure. By an immunoscreening of a yeast genomic DNA library the expression vector lambda gt11, a 3'-terminal 0.9-kilobase portion of the gene has been isolated and then used as a molecular probe to screen a yeast genomic DNA library YEp24. In this way, the whole GGP1 gene has been cloned. Its identity with the gp115 gene has been confirmed by gene disruption, which has also indicated that the function of gp115 is not essential for cell viability. The features of the sequence are also entirely consistent with it corresponding to the gp115 gene. The nucleotide sequence of GGP1 predicts a 60-kDa polypeptide, agreement with the molecular mass of the gp115 precursor detected sec53 mutant cells at restrictive temperature. Two hydrophobic sequences, one NH2- and the other COOH-terminal were found. The former has the features of the cleavable signal sequence, which allows the entry of proteins the secretory pathway. The latter could be the signal sequence that has to be removed during the addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol. The predicted amino acid sequence of gp115 shows 10 sequons for N-glycosylation and a high proportion of serine-threonine residues (22%) that could provide several sites for O-glycosylation. The unusual concentration of 27 serines the COOH-terminal portion of the protein shares homology with a similar polyserine repeat of the serine repeat antigen (SERA protein) of Plasmodium falciparum. A two-dimensional analysis of the in vitro translational product of the GGP1 mRNA has been carried out, allowing the identification of the in vivo gp115 precursor a two-dimensional gel."
https://openalex.org/W1517809570,"We have investigated the kinetics of folding and dimerization of newly synthesized thyroglobulin (Tg), the precursor protein in the manufacture of thyroid hormone. From the examination of lysates of pulse-labeled cultured thyrocytes by denaturing and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, we have found that the earliest detectable form of nascent Tg is a transient aggregate, whose dissolution in vitro requires the addition of a reducing agent. In vivo, aggregate dissolution occurs with a t1/2 approximately 10 min at 37 degrees C. By 10 min after synthesis, monomeric Tg is first detectable in a conformationally unstable form. Dimeric Tg is formed thereafter (t1/2 approximately 30 min), but well before arrival of the protein in the medial Golgi (t1/2 approximately 2 h). Certain metabolic inhibitors permit dimerization yet block transport of the dimer to the Golgi. Thus, Tg dimerization occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment, and other steps after dimerization are likely to be important in the process of exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further, aggregate dissolution, as well as dimerization, are inhibited significantly at 15 degrees C, indicating thermal sensitivity of Tg folding over and above effects on vesicular transport. Inhibitors of Tg iodination have no effect on Tg dimerization or Golgi arrival. Pretreatment of thyrocytes with thyroid-stimulating hormone substantially accelerates Tg flux through the ER, by increasing the amount, as well as the rate, of Tg transport, possibly at the expense of a small fraction of Tg that appears refractory to dimerization. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin causes a complete block in intracellular Tg transport by inducing the formation of biologically irreversible aggregates, suggesting that glycosylation of Tg serves to prevent denaturation of the secretory protein within the ER lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1555729119,"We have isolated two genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that both encode a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase). The CMK1 gene has been cloned by hybridization using an oligonucleotide probe synthesized on the basis of the peptide sequence of purified yeast CaM kinase (Londesborough, J. (1989) J. Gen. Microbiol. 135, 3373-3383). The other gene, CMK2, which is homologous to CMK1, has been isolated by screening at low stringency with a CMK1 fragment as a probe. The CMK2 product expressed in bacteria shows Ca(2+)- and CaM-dependent protein kinase activity, indicating that CMK2 also encodes a CaM kinase. The CMK1 and CMK2 products expressed in bacteria were found to have different biochemical properties in terms of autoregulatory activity and preference for yeast CaM or bovine CaM for maximal activity. Antibody raised against a peptide fragment of the CMK1 protein cross-reacts with the CMK2 product. Immunoblotting with this antibody indicated that the CMK1 and CMK2 products have apparent molecular masses of 56 and 50 kDa, respectively, in yeast cells. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two CMK products exhibit highest similarity with mammalian calmodulin-dependent multifunctional protein kinase II (CaM kinase II): the similarity within the N-terminal catalytic domain is about 40%, whereas that within the rest of the sequence is 25%. These data indicate that yeast has two kinds of genes encoding CaM kinase isozymes whose structural and functional properties are closely related to those of mammalian CaM kinase II. Another gene may be substituted for function of the CMK1 and CMK2 kinase in vivo, since elimination of both kinase genes is not lethal."
https://openalex.org/W1482788894,"Prorenin, the inactive biosynthetic precursor of renin, is proteolytically cleaved in the renal juxtaglomerular cells to renin. The activity of renin is rate-limiting for generation of angiotensin II in the circulation. We identified a renal thiol protease which activates and accurately cleaves the 43-amino acid prosegment of human recombinant prorenin. In the current studies, 6.5 mg of this protease was purified from human renal cortex using a three-step procedure dependent upon Leu-Leu-arginyl affinity chromatography. This represented an overall 766-fold purification and resulted in three protein bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of molecular weights 30,000, 25,000, and 24,000. All three bands cross-reacted with an anti-human liver cathepsin B antibody upon immunoblot analysis; electrolution of each band and amino-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the Mr 30,000 protein was mature cathepsin B and the Mr 25,000 and 24,000 bands were cathepsin B subunits. The pH optimum for the hydrolysis of pure human recombinant prorenin by pure renal cathepsin B was 6, and the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, of the reaction was 1.4 x 10(-9) M. Immunostaining of human kidney using a sheep anti-human cathepsin B antibody demonstrated the presence of cathepsin B in the juxtaglomerular areas of the kidney, as well as in the renal proximal tubules. Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry using the same antibody demonstrated cathepsin B in dense secretory granules of the juxtaglomerular cells. Renin was also shown to be present in these granules. This study provides both biochemical and morphological evidence that renal cathepsin B is a human prorenin-processing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1490693839,"Intact bovine brain clathrin triskelia, comprising three heavy and three light chains, require either 2 mM calcium or the assistance of protein co-factors for efficient assembly into regular cage structures (Keen, J. H., Willingham, M. C., and Pastan, I. (1979) Cell 16, 303-312). In contrast light chain-free heavy chains assemble readily in the absence of co-factors or calcium. Reconstitution of intact clathrin from heavy and light chains restores the calcium requirement. Our data indicate that light chains impede assembly by creating a kinetic trap rather than by perturbing the affinity of heavy chains for each other. This property suggests a function for light chains as regulatory subunits for clathrin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1575248343,"The transport of proteins across the thylakoid membrane in higher plant chloroplasts is usually mediated by an amino-terminal peptide extension which is subsequently removed by a specific thylakoidal processing peptidase. We have previously shown that the reaction specificity of this enzyme is very similar to those of signal peptidases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial plasma membrane. In the present report, the reaction mechanism of the thylakoidal peptidase has been investigated by substituting a variety of amino acids for the alanine residues at the -3 and -1 positions of a thylakoid lumen protein precursor. Small neutral side chains are known to be essential at these positions for cleavage by signal peptidases, and we find that these residues likewise play a critical role in defining the thylakoidal processing peptidase cleavage site. However, the requirements of the thylakoidal enzyme at these sites are significantly more restrictive than those of the bacterial or endoplasmic reticulum peptidases. Whereas leucine at the -3 position in the substrate is tolerated by the latter two enzymes, cleavage by the thylakoidal peptidase is almost completely inhibited. At the -1 position the presence of alanine appears to be critical; substitution of this residue by glycine, serine, threonine, leucine, lysine, or glutamate leads to either substantial or complete inhibition of cleavage at this site. Substitutions at either -3 or -1 which blocked cleavage at the correct site led to cleavage taking place at an alternative site, probably after the -21 residue."

https://openalex.org/W1493924638,"The TrfA proteins, encoded by the broad host range plasmid RK2, are required for replication of this plasmid in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Two TrfA proteins, 33 and 44 kDa in molecular mass (designated TrfA-33 and TrfA-44, respectively), are expressed from the trfA gene of RK2 through the use of two alternative in-frame start codons within the same open reading frame. The two proteins have been purified from Escherichia coli to near homogeneity as a mixture of wild-type TrfA-44/33, as TrfA-33 alone and as a functional variant form of TrfA-44, designated TrfA-44(98L), which contains a leucine in place of the TrfA-33 methionine start codon. Cross-linking experiments demonstrated that TrfA-33 can multimerize in solution. By using gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting techniques the binding properties of TrfA-33, TrfA-44(98L), and TrfA-44/33 to the origin of replication of plasmid RK2 were analyzed. All three protein preparations were able to bind very specifically to the cluster of five direct repeats (iterons) contained in the minimal origin of replication. Each protein preparation produced a ladder of TrfA/minimal oriV complexes of decreasing electrophoretic mobility. The DNase I protection pattern on the five iterons was identical for all three protein preparations and extended from the beginning of the first iteron to 5 base pairs upstream of the fifth iteron. Studies on the affinity of the proteins for DNA fragments containing one, two, or all five iterons of the origin revealed a strong preference of TrfA protein for DNA containing at least two iterons. To study the stability of TrfA.DNA complexes, association and dissociation rates of TrfA-33 and DNA fragments with one, two, or five iterons were measured. This analysis showed that unlike complexes involving two or five iterons the TrfA/one iteron complexes were highly unstable, suggesting some form of cooperativity between proteins or iterons in the formation of stable complexes and/or the requirement of specific sequences bordering the iterons at the RK2 origin of replication for the stabilization of TrfA/DNA complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1576626381,"Most strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbor a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, called W. We obtained W cDNA clones by random priming of denatured W dsRNA followed by reverse transcription. Sequence data of W shows that only one strand ((+)-strand) has coding capacity for a protein with 829 amino acids which spans almost the entire length of the molecule (2.5 kilobases). Within this protein we found a sequence pattern characteristic of RNA dependent RNA polymerases of (+)-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses. W has no homology with other dsRNAs found in S. cerevisiae, such as L-A, L-BC or M1. However, a (+)-strand-specific probe for W hybridized with 20-S RNA. Furthermore, W (+)-strands comigrated with 20 S RNA in strand separation gels. These results suggest that 20 S RNA is a (+)-single-stranded RNA form of W dsRNA itself or a closely related molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1587977582,"The action of adriamycin (an inhibitor of precursor protein import into mitochondria) upon phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) import into mitochondria was examined in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells. The decarboxylation of nascent PtdSer to phosphatidylethanolamine was used as an indicator reaction for the lipid translocation process. Adriamycin was without effect upon new PtdSer synthesis but blocked the time- and translocation-dependent decarboxylation of this lipid at the mitochondrial inner membrane of permeabilized cells. The effect of adriamycin was concentration-dependent with an IC50 of 150 microM and was not due to direct inhibition of PtdSer decarboxylase. To determine at which level of PtdSer transport adriamycin was working, the adriamycin-treated permeabilized cells were incubated with 1-acyl-2-[N-(6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazo-4-yl)] aminocaproyl)]phosphatidyl[1'-14C] serine (NBD-Ptd[1'-14C]Ser), and its decarboxylation was determined. Since the NBD-Ptd[1'-14C]Ser freely partitions into all cell membranes, it can partition into the outer mitochondrial membrane in an ATP-independent fashion. The NBD-Ptd[1'-14C]Ser was readily decarboxylated in an ATP-independent manner in permeabilized cells. Adriamycin inhibited the decarboxylation of NBD-Ptd[1'-14C]Ser, thereby indicating that it can act upon lipid transport processes between the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1859744527,"The three-dimensional structure of a mutant human lysozyme, C77/95A, in which residues Cys77 and Cys95 were replaced by alanine, was determined at 1.8-A resolution by x-ray crystallography. The properties of this mutant protein have been well characterized with respect to its thermal stability and secretion efficiency in a yeast expression system. The overall three-dimensional structure of C77/95A was found to be essentially identical to that of the wild-type human lysozyme, although the coordinates were shifted by more than 0.5 A and the thermal factors of the main-chain atoms were increased in the vicinity of residue 77. The reduction in thermal stability of this mutant has been previously explained by an increase in entropy of the unfolded state. In addition, a packing defect (cavity) produced by the removal of the disulfide bond was detected in the three-dimensional structure of C77/95A. This cavity can also be a reason why the stability of the protein is reduced because the free energy of the folded state could be expected to increase. The increased secretion efficiency cannot be due mainly to the three-dimensional structure, but may possibly be related to some event in the pathway of protein secretion. One of the possibilities might involve molecular flexibilities in the secondary or tertiary structure for lack of one of the disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1506649791,"To evaluate potential catalytic mechanism for thioltransferase thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, seven pig liver mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. All the expressed enzymes, including wild-type and mutants with the exception of the inactive mutant, ETT-C22S, were variably inhibited by iodoacetamide, and similar results were obtained when these enzymes were preincubated with GSH. However, when preincubated with S-sulfocysteine or hydroxyethyl disulfide, the activity of the enzymes was totally or partially protected against inhibition by iodoacetamide, with the exception of the mutants, ETT-C25S and ETT-C25A. When simultaneously pretreated with GSH and S-sulfocysteine, all enzymes were highly protected. Isoelectric focusing analysis of the above preincubation mixtures showed that different enzyme-substrate intermediates occurred. Using radioactively labeled substrates, [U-14C]cystine and [glycine-2-3H] GSH, enzyme-substrate intermediates were detected. These data indicate that reduced thioltransferase reacts first with disulfide substrates, then with a thiol substrate, e.g. GSH. The formation of either enzyme-substrate mixed disulfide or protein intramolecular disulfide protected the enzyme from inactivation by iodoacetamide. Based on the experimental results, alternative methods of the catalytic mechanism for thioltransferases are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1578172171,"Secretin is a 27-amino acid gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid. We isolated and analyzed the coding region of the gene for the rat secretin precursor. The entire coding region spans 692 base pairs and is divided into four regions corresponding to the signal peptide and NH2-terminal peptide, the secretin peptide and processing signal sequences, a part of the COOH-terminal peptide, and the remainder of the COOH-terminal peptide, which are interrupted by three short introns (81, 105, and 104 base pairs). The organization is similar to those of the genes for other members of the secretin family, glucagon and VIP/PHI-27 precursors, supporting the assumption that the genes for the secretin family peptide precursors originated from a common ancestral gene. We also demonstrated that the secretin precursor gene is widely expressed in the brain and in the hypophysis. The regional expression pattern of the secretin precursor gene in the brain is quite different from those of the glucagon and VIP/PHI-27 precursor genes. The secretin precursor gene is highly expressed in the medulla oblongata and pons of the brain and the hypophysis, the expression levels of which are comparable to those in the duodenum. The secretin precursor mRNA in the brain and the hypophysis has the same coding sequence as that in the duodenum, indicating that secretin in the brain and the hypophysis is produced from the same secretin precursor protein as that in the duodenum. This is the first evidence to be reported that the secretin precursor gene is definitely expressed in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1515117299,"Abstract Dual wavelength microfluorometry was used to characterize the changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) in individual cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Angiotensin II (ANG II) at 10(-8) M induced a transient rise in [Ca2+]i from 43 +/- 2 to 245 +/- 23 nM, lasting for approximately 60 s (n = 42). In half of the population, discrete oscillations in [Ca2+]i of smaller amplitude occurred after the initial [Ca2+]i peak, with a period of 58 +/- 8 s and a maximum height of 132 +/- 24 nM. A similar oscillatory pattern was observed with arginine vasopressin (AVP). The oscillations depended upon the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Cytosolic free Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) in VSMC was also measured using the fluorescent Na+ probe sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate. ANG II induced a gradual and sustained elevation of [Na+]i, from 24.0 +/- 6.2 to 36 +/- 9.7 mM. In response to AVP, [Na+]i rose to 41.0 +/- 11.6 mM. Video imaging of individual VSMC, with on-line ratio calibration of [Ca2+]i, revealed an inhomogeneous distribution of Ca2+ within the cell. [Ca2+] in the nucleus was invariably lower than in the cytoplasm in resting cells. In the cytoplasm, there were small regions in which [Ca2+] was elevated, or In Ca(2+)-containing medium, the initial rise in [Ca2+]i triggered by ANG II and AVP appeared to emanate from the hot spots and to spread evenly throughout the cytoplasm. Between [Ca2+]i oscillations, Ca2+ retreated back to the original hot spots. This study demonstrates the cellular and subcellular heterogeneity of [Ca2+]i both in resting VSMC and during stimulation by ANG II and AVP and reports the direct measurement of [Na+]i in VSMC. The results suggest an action of Ca2+ in both the initial and sustained phases of the response in VSMC and a link between changes in [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1607600381,"We cloned a new functional ALDH gene (ALDHx) from a human genomic library in cosmid pWE-15 by screening with a 29-nucleotide probe partially matched to a conserved region of the ALDH1 and ALDH2 genes. The new ALDHx gene does not contain introns in the coding sequence for 517 amino acid residues. The degree of resemblance between the deduced amino acid sequences of the new ALDHx gene and the ALDH2 gene is 72.5% (alignment of 517 amino acid residues), while that between the ALDHx and the ALDH1 gene is 64.6% (alignment of 500 amino acid residues). The amino acid residues (Cys-162, Cys-302, Glu-268, Glu-487, Gly-223, Gly-225, Gly-229, Gly-245 and Gly-250), which exist in both ALDH1 and ALDH2 isozymes and have been implicated in functional and structural importance, are also preserved in the deduced sequence of the new ALDHx gene. Northern blot hybridization with ALDHx probe revealed the existence of a unique mRNA band (3.0 kilobases) in the human liver and testis tissues. Using the new ALDHx probe, we cloned the cDNA of the gene from a human testis cDNA library in lambda gt11 vector. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA differs from that of the genomic sequence at three nucleotide positions resulting in the exchange of 2 deduced amino acid residues. These positions are polymorphic as further demonstrated by the PCR amplification of the targeted region followed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the genomic DNA from eight unrelated individuals. Alignment of the genomic and cDNA sequence indicates that although the ALDHx gene appears to have no intron in its coding sequence, an intron of 2.6 kilobases is found to interrupt the 5'-untranslated (5'-UT) sequence. Primary extension and S1 mapping analysis indicate the existence of at least two 5'-UT exons. The new ALDHx gene was assigned to chromosome 9 by Southern blot hybridization of DNA samples from a panel of rodent-human hybrid cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W126427411,"Heat shock, cold shock, ethanol, and alkaline shift, but not hydrogen peroxide, stimulate the accumulation of monoacetylspermidine in Escherichia coli. Acetylation occurs with nearly equal frequencies at both the N1 and N8 positions of this ubiquitous polycation. Spermidine acetylation does not appear to be associated with known stress regulons, such as htpR, oxyR, and SOS. E. coli, capable of acetylating spermidine, constitutively express a spermidine acetyltransferase activity during all phases of growth, and this activity is unaffected by cold shock. A mutant strain, incapable of acetylating spermidine, does not express this enzyme activity but grows at an identical rate as the parent strain at 37 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the monoacetylation of spermidine in E. coli is regulated by some mechanism other than a stress-inducible acetyltransferase and is not essential for growth of these cells. They suggest that polyamine acetylation is involved in the responses of these organisms to a variety of chemical and physical stresses."

We have cloned ETR101 cDNA whose mRNA was induced immediate early (30 min) and transiently by TPA. The mRNA is superinduced by addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The sequence of ETR101 cDNA (1826 base pairs) reveals that (i) it will encode a protein of 223 amino acids with a formula molecular weight of 24,200, (ii) the amino acid sequence is highly homologous to mouse chx1 protein whose mRNA was found recently to be enhanced in activated T lymphocytes in response to cycloheximide, (iii) the amino acid sequence is also weakly homologous to jun family gene products, and (iv) in the mRNA 3'-flanking region, there is a unique GUUUG sequence which is complementary to a part of B1 repetitive sequence and may be involved in mRNA degradation. ETR101 mRNA is induced by TPA in a wide variety of leukemia cells including myeloid, T-lymphoid, and B-lymphoid lineages. We have found that this mRNA is also induced by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, and that TPA or cycloheximide act synergistically with okadaic acid. In addition, the induction is inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors. Therefore, ETR101 mRNA level is controlled, either directly or indirectly, by protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1574018129,"The coordination of N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of heparan sulfate was examined in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells and mutant pgsE-606. This mutant expresses about 3-fold less N-sulfotransferase activity, which causes the proportion of N-sulfated GlcN residues in heparan sulfate to decline from 39 to 21% of total GlcN (Bame, K.J., and Esko, J.D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8059-8065). In this report, we show that microsomes from pgsE-606 cells have about twice the N-deacetylase activity found in microsomes from wild-type cells. However, N-deacetylation in vivo was actually depressed since heparan sulfate preparations from the mutant contained very few unsubstituted GlcN residues and 2-fold less N-sulfated GlcN residues. Treatment of mutant cells with chlorate, a general inhibitor of sulfation, depressed adenosine 3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate pools more than 10-fold and further reduced the extent of N-sulfation from 21% to less than 6% of total GlcN. Unsubstituted GlcN residues accumulated under these conditions to the extent that N-sulfated residues declined. Thus, N-deacetylation remained depressed in the mutant in the presence of chlorate. These findings show that N-deacetylation is regulated in vivo and support the idea that the activity of N-deacetylase may be linked to N-sulfotransferase."

Initial velocity, product inhibition, and binding studies were performed, and from the data obtained, it was determined that the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is random. Initial velocity rates were measured with varied amounts of both substrates, and double-reciprocal plots gave patterns which converged on or near the abscissa. The products, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and methylated receptor, were found to be competitive inhibitors with respect to both AdoMet and receptor. Equilibrium dialysis and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the two substrates can bind to the enzyme independent of each other. These results are consistent with a random mechanism with no abortive complexes being formed. The Michaelis constants calculated for AdoMet and receptor were 8.62 microM and 2.03 mg/ml total membrane protein (approximately 2.10 microM Tar protein), and the apparent dissociation constants of AdoMet and the receptor were 16.8 microM and 4.07 mg/ml total membrane protein (approximately 4.2 microM Tar protein), respectively. The Kd of AdoMet for the enzyme was 10.9 microM as determined by binding studies."

Both peptides were purified by reverse phase chromatography of trypsin-nicked PFO. Neither peptide retained hemolytic activity. Peptide T1 had no apparent effect on the hemolytic activity of PFO, whereas T2 was found to inhibit the hemolytic activity of PFO and was analyzed further. The order of binding of T2 and PFO to membranes did not alter the inhibitory effect of T2 on PFO-induced hemolysis, indicating that competitive binding by T2 for PFO membrane binding sites was not the basis for the observed inhibition. Further analysis showed that T2 could inhibit membrane-dependent fluorescence energy transfer (FET) between PFO molecules labeled with fluorescein (fluorescent donor) or tetramethylrhodamine (fluorescent acceptor). This provided evidence that T2 could complex with PFO. T2 was also found to be incapable of self-aggregation (as opposed to PFO), since preincubation of T2 with either erythrocytes or erythrocyte ghost membranes did not affect the T2-dependent inhibition of hemolysis or FET. These data indicate that T2 inhibits PFO-dependent hemolysis by forming a complex with PFO, which inhibits aggregation and that the membrane binding site and a single aggregation site remain intact on T2."
https://openalex.org/W1501048409,"Upon differential centrifugation of guinea pig intestine mucosal cells homogenate, fatty acyl-CoA:NADPH oxidoreductase (long chain alcohol forming) was found to be enriched in the light mitochondrial (L) fraction (sedimenting between 66,000 x g min and 500,000 x g min) which contained mainly mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes. Peroxisomes (marker enzymes: catalase and dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase) present in the L fraction were separated from other organelles in a Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation employing a vertical rotor. By comparing the distribution of acyl-CoA reductase with different marker enzymes in the gradient, it was concluded that this reductase is primarily localized in the microperoxisomes (microbodies). The topography of the membrane-bound enzyme in the isolated organelles was studied by checking its lability toward trypsin in the absence and presence of the detergent Triton X-100. The results suggested that acyl-CoA reductase is localized on the outer surface (cytosolic side) of microperoxisomal membrane."

There exists a high degree of amino acid identity between Xenopus protein 4.1 and human protein 4.1, suggesting that the mechanisms known to modulate the function(s) of human protein 4.1 may also serve to regulate Xenopus protein 4.1. Calmodulin (CaM) is one regulatory protein known to affect membrane-cytoskeletal interactions. An in vitro binding assay was used to test the ability of Xenopus protein 4.1 to bind CaM. Two independent approaches, involving protein 4.1 synthesized in vitro from synthetic RNA or a partial length protein 4.1 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli, demonstrate calcium-dependent, CaM binding. Both approaches demonstrate that the CaM-binding site is within the amino-terminal region of Xenopus protein 4.1. Results of this calmodulin binding activity suggest a possible regulatory mechanism by which calcium and calmodulin may affect the function of protein 4.1 during development."
https://openalex.org/W1585078325,"Orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) has been overexpressed in yeast 15C cells transformed with a plasmid carrying the URA3 gene that encodes ODCase. Twenty g of cells having ODCase activity equal to 30 mg of pure enzyme per liter of cell culture were obtained after 9 h of galactose induction. To remove yeast proteases, a 60-90% ammonium sulfate fractionation step plus the addition of EDTA as an inhibitor of metallopeptidases was necessary. The purification protocol yielded ODCase that was protease-free and stable to storage at 4 degrees C for 16 months. The pure enzyme had a specific activity of 40 units/mg in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6, and could be stored at -20 degrees C in 20% glycerol with retention of full activity for more than 2 years. The enzyme had a Km for orotidine 5'-monophosphate of 0.7 microM at pH 6 and 25 degrees C. The molecular weight of the plasmid-derived ODCase monomer determined by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels was 29,500. ODCase sedimented through sucrose density gradients as a monomer of about 30 kDa at low protein concentration and in the absence of ligands that bind at the catalytic site. An increase in the sedimentation rate could be induced by increasing the ODCase concentration or by adding ligands that are competitive inhibitors. ODCase sedimented in a single band typical of a protein of 46 kDa at the highest protein concentration studied or in the presence of 50 mM phosphate or 933 microM substrate (orotidine 5'-monophosphate) or product (UMP). A dimer sedimenting as a protein of about 64 kDa occurred in the presence of 50 microM 6-azauridine 5'-monophosphate or 2 microM 1-(5'-phospho-beta-D-ribofuranosyl) barbituric acid, competitive inhibitors of ODCase. These results resemble the ligand-induced subunit association of the ODCase domain of bifunctional UMP synthase and support the use of yeast ODCase as a model for ODCases from other species."

https://openalex.org/W1577248693,"The major route of phosphatidylcholine (Ptd-choline) biosynthesis in mammalian cells is the CDP-choline pathway which involves stepwise conversion of choline to phosphocholine (P-choline), cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP-choline), and Ptd-choline. Our previous studies with electropermeabilized (EP) rat glioma (C6) cells have indicated that the intermediates of this pathway are not freely diffusible in the cell but are channeled toward synthesis of Ptd-choline (George, T.P., Morash, S.C., Cook, H.W., Byers, D.M., Palmer, F. B. St.C., and Spence, M.W. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1004, 283-291). In this study, Ca(2+)-[ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid buffers were used to investigate the role of intracellular free Ca2+ levels in functional organization of this pathway in EP glioma cells. In EP cells reduction of free Ca2+ in the medium from 1.8 mM to less than 200 nM resulted in 2-3-fold stimulation of exogenous [3H]choline and [14C]P-choline incorporation into Ptd-choline whereas incorporation of exogenous CDP-[14C]choline was augmented 100-fold; there was no uptake or incorporation of labeled P-choline or CDP-choline in intact cells. In EP cells incubated at 1.8 mM Ca2+ the water-soluble products of choline metabolism (choline, P-choline, CDP-choline, and glycerophosphocholine) were retained at 37 degrees C; in contrast, in the presence of 100 nM Ca2+ there was uniform leakage of these metabolites. Experiments with hemicholinium-3, an inhibitor of choline transport, and EP cells at 100 nM Ca2+ show that linkage of choline transport and Ptd-choline biosynthesis is also dependent on Ca2+. These results suggest that channeling of intermediates in the CDP-choline pathway of Ptd-choline biosynthesis in glioma cells is mediated by intracellular Ca2+ levels that may coordinately regulate the steps involved in conversion of choline to Ptd-choline."
https://openalex.org/W2114778973,"Several peptides derived from the gastrin-predicted preprohormone sequence were isolated from a human gastrinoma by gel permeation, anion exchange, and reverse phase chromatography. The peptides were identified and characterized structurally by a combination of radioimmunoassays, mass spectral analysis, and microsequence analysis. The largest peptide, progastrin-(1-35) (cryptagastrin), extends from the putative processing site for the signal peptidase to the double basic residues adjacent to the amino terminus of gastrin 34. A shorter form of this peptide, progastrin-(6-35) (cryptagastrin-(6-35), was also isolated in smaller amounts. In addition, sulfated and nonsulfated gastrin 17 amides (progastrin-(55-71)) and the glycine-extended nonsulfated gastrin 17 (progastrin-(55-72)) were identified by radioimmunoassay, and their structures were confirmed by mass spectral analysis. Isolation of cryptagastrin indicates that the signal peptide of human preprogastrin contains 21 amino acid residues, and progastrin, therefore, contains 80 amino acids. There is minimal processing of the cryptic peptide preceding the sequence of gastrin 34. An amidated gastrin form larger than gastrin 34 could contain 71 amino acids. No evidence was obtained for processing that would produce gastrins containing more than 34 but less than 71 amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1532098814,"Abstract The conformational changes of human apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 which accompany the conversion of plasma very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to low density lipoproteins (LDL) were investigated by studying the accessibility of apoB-100 in LDL and VLDL to limited proteolysis with cathepsin D, an aspartyl proteinase involved in intracellular protein degradation. We characterized the proteolytic products of apoB-100 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis to locate cleavage sites. The results identified at least 10 cleavage products generated from apoB-100 and showed differential accessibility of cleavage sites for cathepsin D in apoB-100 between LDL and VLDL. We identified a specific peptide region (residues 2660-2710), which is preferentially accessible to limited proteolysis by cathepsin D but inaccessible to limited proteolysis by 12 other enzymes tested. Within this peptide region, cathepsin D cleaved apoB-100 of LDL and VLDL preferentially at different sites, separated by 33-36 amino acids (2665-2666 or 2668-2669 (LDL) and 2701-2702 (VLDL]. In addition, we identified a cleavage site, located at residues 3272-3273, specific for cathepsin D, which is contained within the COOH-terminal enzyme-accessible peptide region (residues 3180-3280), which we have demonstrated using 12 endoproteases with various specificities. The previously identified NH2-terminal region (residues 1280-1320) appears to be resistant to limited cleavage by cathepsin D. However, a new site was revealed only approximately 66 kDA from the NH2 terminus. We conclude that differential accessibility and the shift of the novel scission site for cathepsin D by 33-36 amino acids indicate significant differences in local conformation at these sites in apoB-100 as VLDL are converted to LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1577165275,"Chemical modification of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli with phenylglyoxal resulted in an inhibition of enzyme activity with a second-order rate constant of 13.6 M-1 min-1. The substrates, GTP or IMP, partially protected the enzyme against inactivation by the chemical modification. The other substrate, aspartate, had no such effect even at a high concentration. In the presence of both IMP and GTP during the modification, nearly complete protection of the enzyme against inactivation was observed. Stoichiometry studies with [7-14C]phenylglyoxal showed that only 1 reactive arginine residue was modified by the chemical reagent and that this arginine residue could be shielded by GTP and IMP. Sequence analysis of tryptic peptides indicated that Arg147 is the site of phenylglyoxal chemical modification. This arginine has been changed to leucine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzyme (R147L) showed increased Michaelis constants for IMP and GTP relative to the wild-type system, whereas the Km for aspartate exhibited a modest decrease as compared with the native enzyme. In addition, kcat of the R147L mutant decreased by a factor of 1.3 x 10(4). On the bases of these observations, it is suggested that Arg147 is critical for enzyme catalysis."

This region of the POMC gene is involved in the control of constitutive POMC gene expression since mutation of the PO-B DNA-binding site severely reduces transcription from the POMC promoter both in vivo and in vitro (Riegel, A. T., Remenick, J., Wolford, R., Berard, D., and Hager, G. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 4513-4521). We have now purified PO-B from HeLa cells approximately 25,000-fold to greater than 90% homogeneity by a combination of ion exchange and reversed phase chromatography. In addition we have studied post-translational modifications that alter the affinity of purified PO-B for its cognate DNA binding site. In Southwestern analysis of column fractions, two bands of apparent molecular masses of 54 and 56 kDa bound specifically to the PO-B recognition sequence. The two copurified components have indistinguishable amino acid composition, are highly hydrophobic, and are heat and acid stable. DNA-binding specificity studies suggest that PO-B does not represent any previously described transcription factor. In addition, dephosphorylation of both species with acid phosphatase induced an about 30-fold increase in DNA binding but failed to produce any significant change in electrophoretic mobility. We conclude that the purified PO-B species represent products of the same gene and suggest that the in vivo function of PO-B may be regulated by its phosphorylation status."
https://openalex.org/W2126697711,"Chromium GTP (CrGTP) has been used to probe the stereochemistry of metal-GTP binding to exchangeable site of tubulin and to examine the fate and role of nucleotide-bound metal ion in GTP hydrolysis associated with microtubule assembly. The absolute stereoconfiguration of the two pairs of diastereomers of beta,gamma-bidentate CrGTP has been determined by comparison of their visible circular dichroism spectra with those of the beta,gamma-CrATP isomers whose configurations have been established (Lin, I., and Dunaway-Mariano, D. (1988) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 950-956). Tubulin binds metal-GTP preferentially in the delta pseudoaxial configuration. CrGTP-tubulin shows a high propensity to undergo tubulin-tubulin interactions with associated hydrolysis of CrGTP. Hydrolysis of CrGTP in microtubule assembly develops in two consecutive steps: cleavage of the gamma-phosphate followed by release of Pi and chromium. In contrast to other NTPases (actin, hexokinase) tubulin appears able to catalyze the dissociation of the stable chromium-phosphate bonds, which implies a highly nucleophilic environment of the binding site of the metal-triphosphate moiety of GTP. Microtubules assembled from CrGTP-tubulin are made of 90% GDP subunits, and their stability is linked to a 10% proportion of CrGDP-Pi subunits, scattered along the microtubule, from which Pi does not dissociate. The possibility is evoked that some tubulin variants do not catalyze release of Pi and metal ion efficiently, and their presence could affect microtubule dynamics."
