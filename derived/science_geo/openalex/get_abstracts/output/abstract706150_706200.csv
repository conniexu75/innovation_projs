https://openalex.org/W4312019047,"Continuous evolution of Omicron has led to a rapid and simultaneous emergence of numerous variants that display growth advantages over BA.5 (ref. 1). Despite their divergent evolutionary courses, mutations on their receptor-binding domain (RBD) converge on several hotspots. The driving force and destination of such sudden convergent evolution and its effect on humoral immunity remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that these convergent mutations can cause evasion of neutralizing antibody drugs and convalescent plasma, including those from BA.5 breakthrough infection, while maintaining sufficient ACE2-binding capability. BQ.1.1.10 (BQ.1.1 + Y144del), BA.4.6.3, XBB and CH.1.1 are the most antibody-evasive strains tested. To delineate the origin of the convergent evolution, we determined the escape mutation profiles and neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies isolated from individuals who had BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough infections2,3. Owing to humoral immune imprinting, BA.2 and especially BA.5 breakthrough infection reduced the diversity of the neutralizing antibody binding sites and increased proportions of non-neutralizing antibody clones, which, in turn, focused humoral immune pressure and promoted convergent evolution in the RBD. Moreover, we show that the convergent RBD mutations could be accurately inferred by deep mutational scanning profiles4,5, and the evolution trends of BA.2.75 and BA.5 subvariants could be well foreseen through constructed convergent pseudovirus mutants. These results suggest that current herd immunity and BA.5 vaccine boosters may not efficiently prevent the infection of Omicron convergent variants."
https://openalex.org/W4312114253,"Abstract Iron dysregulation has been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Iron-loaded microglia are frequently found in affected brain regions, but how iron accumulation influences microglia physiology and contributes to neurodegeneration is poorly understood. Here we show that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia grown in a tri-culture system are highly responsive to iron and susceptible to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. Furthermore, iron overload causes a marked shift in the microglial transcriptional state that overlaps with a transcriptomic signature found in PD postmortem brain microglia. Our data also show that this microglial response contributes to neurodegeneration, as removal of microglia from the tri-culture system substantially delayed iron-induced neurotoxicity. To elucidate the mechanisms regulating iron response in microglia, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen and identified novel regulators of ferroptosis, including the vesicle trafficking gene SEC24B . These data suggest a critical role for microglia iron overload and ferroptosis in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4312018467,"Chromatin states are functionally defined by a complex combination of histone modifications, transcription factor binding, DNA accessibility and other factors. Current methods for defining chromatin states cannot measure more than one aspect in a single experiment at single-cell resolution. Here we introduce nanobody-tethered transposition followed by sequencing (NTT-seq), an assay capable of measuring the genome-wide presence of up to three histone modifications and protein-DNA binding sites at single-cell resolution. NTT-seq uses recombinant Tn5 transposase fused to a set of secondary nanobodies (nb). Each nb-Tn5 fusion protein specifically binds to different immunoglobulin-G antibodies, enabling a mixture of primary antibodies binding different epitopes to be used in a single experiment. We apply bulk-cell and single-cell NTT-seq to generate high-resolution multimodal maps of chromatin states in cell culture and in human immune cells. We also extend NTT-seq to enable simultaneous profiling of cell surface protein expression and multimodal chromatin states to study cells of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W4312019342,"Craving is a core feature of substance use disorders. It is a strong predictor of substance use and relapse and is linked to overeating, gambling, and other maladaptive behaviors. Craving is measured via self-report, which is limited by introspective access and sociocultural contexts. Neurobiological markers of craving are both needed and lacking, and it remains unclear whether craving for drugs and food involve similar mechanisms. Across three functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (n = 99), we used machine learning to identify a cross-validated neuromarker that predicts self-reported intensity of cue-induced drug and food craving (P < 0.0002). This pattern, which we term the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS), includes ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices, ventral striatum, temporal/parietal association areas, mediodorsal thalamus and cerebellum. Importantly, NCS responses to drug versus food cues discriminate drug users versus non-users with 82% accuracy. The NCS is also modulated by a self-regulation strategy. Transfer between separate neuromarkers for drug and food craving suggests shared neurobiological mechanisms. Future studies can assess the discriminant and convergent validity of the NCS and test whether it responds to clinical interventions and predicts long-term clinical outcomes. Craving—the urge to use a drug or to eat—is a core feature of substance use disorders. Koban et al. present an fMRI-based and machine-learning-based neuromarker that predicts the intensity of drug and food craving and separates drug users from non-users."
https://openalex.org/W4311943826,"Probing histone modifications at a single-cell level in thousands of cells has been enabled by technologies such as single-cell CUT&Tag. Here we describe nano-CUT&Tag (nano-CT), which allows simultaneous mapping of up to three epigenomic modalities at single-cell resolution using nanobody-Tn5 fusion proteins. Multimodal nano-CT is compatible with starting materials as low as 25,000-200,000 cells and has significantly higher sensitivity and number of fragments per cell than single-cell CUT&Tag. We use nano-CT to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 in juvenile mouse brain, allowing for discrimination of more cell types and states than unimodal single-cell CUT&Tag. We also infer chromatin velocity between assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and H3K27ac in the oligodendrocyte lineage and deconvolute H3K27me3 repressive states, finding two sequential waves of H3K27me3 repression at distinct gene modules during oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Given its high resolution, versatility, and multimodal features, nano-CT allows unique insights in epigenetic landscapes in complex biological systems at the single-cell level."

https://openalex.org/W4312080096,"Background Long COVID or long-term symptoms after COVID-19 has the ability to affect health and quality of life. Knowledge about the burden and predictors could aid in their prevention and management. Most of the studies are from high-income countries and focus on severe acute COVID-19 cases. We did this study to estimate the incidence and identify the characteristics and predictors of Long COVID among our patients. Methodology We recruited adult (≥18 years) patients who were diagnosed as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection and were either hospitalized or tested on outpatient basis. Eligible participants were followed up telephonically after four weeks and six months of diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection to collect data on sociodemographic, clinical history, vaccination history, Cycle threshold (Ct) values during diagnosis and other variables. Characteristics of Long COVID were elicited, and multivariable logistic regression was done to find the predictors of Long COVID. Results We have analyzed 487 and 371 individual data with a median follow-up of 44 days (Inter quartile range (IQR): 39,47) and 223 days (IQR:195,251), respectively. Overall, Long COVID was reported by 29.2% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 25.3%,33.4%) and 9.4% (95% CI: 6.7%,12.9%) of participants at four weeks and six months of follow-up, respectively. Incidence of Long COVID among patients with mild/moderate disease (n = 415) was 23.4% (95% CI: 19.5%,27.7%) as compared to 62.5% (95% CI: 50.7%,73%) in severe/critical cases(n = 72) at four weeks of follow-up. At six months, the incidence among mild/moderate (n = 319) was 7.2% (95% CI:4.6%,10.6%) as compared to 23.1% (95% CI:12.5%,36.8%) in severe/critical (n = 52). The most common Long COVID symptom was fatigue. Statistically significant predictors of Long COVID at four weeks of follow-up were—Pre-existing medical conditions (Adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.16,3.44), having a higher number of symptoms during acute phase of COVID-19 disease (aOR = 11.24, 95% CI: 4.00,31.51), two doses of COVID-19 vaccination (aOR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.17,4.58), the severity of illness (aOR = 5.71, 95% CI: 3.00,10.89) and being admitted to hospital (Odds ratio (OR) = 3.89, 95% CI: 2.49,6.08). Conclusion A considerable proportion of COVID-19 cases reported Long COVID symptoms. More research is needed in Long COVID to objectively assess the symptoms and find the biological and radiological markers."

https://openalex.org/W4312019335,"Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) control microtubule specialization and are as such essential for cell division and morphogenesis. Here we investigated interactions and functions of the budding yeast Kar9 network consisting of the core +TIP proteins Kar9 (functional homologue of APC, MACF and SLAIN), Bim1 (orthologous to EB1) and Bik1 (orthologous to CLIP-170). A multivalent web of redundant interactions links the three +TIPs together to form a '+TIP body' at the end of chosen microtubules. This body behaves as a liquid condensate that allows it to persist on both growing and shrinking microtubule ends, and to function as a mechanical coupling device between microtubules and actin cables. Our study identifies nanometre-scale condensates as effective cellular structures and underlines the power of dissecting the web of low-affinity interactions driving liquid-liquid phase separation in order to establish how condensation processes support cell function."
https://openalex.org/W4312053268,"Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and receptor agonists are used to treat obesity, anxiety and depression. Here we studied the role of the serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) in weight regulation and behavior. Using exome sequencing of 2,548 people with severe obesity and 1,117 control individuals without obesity, we identified 13 rare variants in the gene encoding 5-HT2CR (HTR2C) in 19 unrelated people (3 males and 16 females). Eleven variants caused a loss of function in HEK293 cells. All people who carried variants had hyperphagia and some degree of maladaptive behavior. Knock-in male mice harboring a human loss-of-function HTR2C variant developed obesity and reduced social exploratory behavior; female mice heterozygous for the same variant showed similar deficits with reduced severity. Using the 5-HT2CR agonist lorcaserin, we found that depolarization of appetite-suppressing proopiomelanocortin neurons was impaired in knock-in mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that 5-HT2CR is involved in the regulation of human appetite, weight and behavior. Our findings suggest that melanocortin receptor agonists might be effective in treating severe obesity in individuals carrying HTR2C variants. We suggest that HTR2C should be included in diagnostic gene panels for severe childhood-onset obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4312019374,"Growing microtubule ends organize end-tracking proteins into comets of mixed composition. Here using a reconstituted fission yeast system consisting of end-binding protein Mal3, kinesin Tea2 and cargo Tip1, we found that these proteins can be driven into liquid-phase droplets both in solution and at microtubule ends under crowding conditions. In the absence of crowding agents, cryo-electron tomography revealed that motor-dependent comets consist of disordered networks where multivalent interactions may facilitate non-stoichiometric accumulation of cargo Tip1. We found that two disordered protein regions in Mal3 are required for the formation of droplets and motor-dependent accumulation of Tip1, while autonomous Mal3 comet formation requires only one of them. Using theoretical modelling, we explore possible mechanisms by which motor activity and multivalent interactions may lead to the observed enrichment of Tip1 at microtubule ends. We conclude that microtubule ends may act as platforms where multivalent interactions condense microtubule-associated proteins into large multi-protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W4312019927,"The single-neuron basis of cognitive processing in primates has mostly been studied in laboratory settings where movements are severely restricted. It is unclear, therefore, how natural movements might affect neural signatures of cognition in the brain. Moreover, studies in mice indicate that body movements, when measured, account for most of the neural dynamics in the cortex. To examine these issues, we recorded from single-neuron ensembles in the prefrontal cortex in moving monkeys performing a cognitive task and characterized eye, head and body movements using video tracking. Despite considerable trial-to-trial movement variability, single-neuron tuning could be precisely measured and decision signals accurately decoded on a single-trial basis. Creating or abolishing spontaneous movements through head restraint and task manipulations had no measurable impact on neural responses. However, encoding models showed that uninstructed movements explained as much neural variance as task variables, with most movements aligned to task events. These results demonstrate that cognitive signals in the cortex are robust to natural movements, but also that unmeasured movements are potential confounds in cognitive neurophysiology experiments. Tremblay, Testard et al. show that, in monkeys, spontaneous movements do not occlude neural coding of cognitive variables. However, movements predict upcoming decisions and partly explain neural activity, potentially confounding brain recording experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4312018460,"Human cognition recruits distributed neural processes, yet the organizing computational and functional architectures remain unclear. Here, we characterized the geometry and topography of multitask representations across the human cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging during 26 cognitive tasks in the same individuals. We measured the representational similarity across tasks within a region and the alignment of representations between regions. Representational alignment varied in a graded manner along the sensory–association–motor axis. Multitask dimensionality exhibited compression then expansion along this gradient. To investigate computational principles of multitask representations, we trained multilayer neural network models to transform empirical visual-to-motor representations. Compression-then-expansion organization in models emerged exclusively in a rich training regime, which is associated with learning optimized representations that are robust to noise. This regime produces hierarchically structured representations similar to empirical cortical patterns. Together, these results reveal computational principles that organize multitask representations across the human cortex to support multitask cognition. What are the representations that enable diverse human cognition? The authors investigate cortical representations across 26 tasks and the conditions by which artificial neural network models reproduce these representations."
https://openalex.org/W4312036648,"Background Diabetes, one of the major metabolic disorders, is rising in Bangladesh. Studies indicate there is inequality in prevalence and care-seeking behavior, which requires further exploration to understand the socioeconomic disparities in the pathophysiology of diabetes. This study examined the latest nationally representative estimates of diabetes prevalence, awareness, and management among adults aged 18 years and above in Bangladesh and its association with socioeconomic status in 2017–18. Methods We used the 2017–18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data. Diabetic status of 12,092 adults aged 18 years and above was measured in the survey using fasting plasma glucose levels. We applied multivariate logistic regressions to examine the role of socioeconomic status on diabetes prevalence, awareness, and management, after controlling for relevant covariates. Results Overall, 10% of adults had diabetes in Bangladesh in 2017–18, with the highest prevalence of 16% in the age group 55−64 years. Our analyses found statistically significant disparities by socioeconomic status in the prevalence of diabetes as well as the person’s awareness of his/her diabetic condition. However, the effect of socioeconomic status on receiving anti-diabetic medication only approached significance (p = 0.07), and we found no significant association between socioeconomic status and control of diabetes. Conclusions We expect to see an ‘accumulation’ of the number of people with diabetes to continue in the coming years. The rising prevalence of diabetes is only the tip of an iceberg; a large number of people with uncontrolled diabetes and a lack of awareness of their condition will lead to increased morbidity and mortality, and that could be the real threat. Immediate measures to increase screening coverage and exploration of poor control of diabetes are required to mitigate the situation."

https://openalex.org/W4312003505,"To increase the coverage of HPV vaccination, Malaysia implemented a national school-based vaccination program for all 13-year-old girls in 2010. Two years later, a clinic-based catch-up program was started for 16 to 21-year-old girls. We assessed the prevalence of a range of HPV genotypes, among a sample of urban women within the age groups of 18–24 and 35–45 years in 2019–2020, a decade into the national vaccination program. The HPV prevalence was then compared to that reported in an unvaccinated population in 2013–2015. We sampled a total of 1134 participants, comprising of 277 women aged 18–24 years and 857 women aged 35–45 years, from several urban clinics in the state of Selangor. Participants provided a self-acquired vaginal sample for HPV genotyping. Comprehensive sociodemographic and vaccination history were collected. The HPV vaccination coverage among women in the younger age group increased from 9.3% in 2013–2015 to 75.5% in 2019–2020. The prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV16/18 decreased 91% (CI: 14.5%–99.0%) among the younger women, from 4.0% in 2013–2015 to 0.4% in 2019–2020. There was also an 87% (CI: 27.5%–97.5%) reduction in HPV6/11/16/18. There was no difference in the prevalence of non-vaccine targeted HPV genotypes among younger women. The HPV prevalence among older women, for both vaccine targeted and non-vaccine targeted genotypes in 2019–2020, did not differ from 2013–2015. The observed decline in prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV genotype among younger women a decade after the national HPV vaccination program is an early indication of its effectiveness in reducing the burden of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4312036718,"It is estimated that 50,000–60,000 pregnant people in the United States (US) experience severe maternal morbidity (SMM). SMM includes life-threatening conditions, such as acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, amniotic fluid embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or sepsis. Prior research has identified both rising rates through 2014 and wide racial disparities in SMM. While reducing maternal death and SMM has been a global goal for the past several decades, limited progress has been made in the US in achieving this goal. Our objectives were to examine SMM trends from 1998–2018 to identify factors contributing to the persistent and rising rates of SMM by race/ethnicity and describe the Black non-Hispanic/White non-Hispanic rate ratio for each SMM condition. We used a population-based data system that links delivery records to their corresponding hospital discharge records to identify SMM rates (excluding transfusion) per 10, 000 deliveries and examined the trends by race/ethnicity. We then conducted stratified analyses separately for Black and White birthing people. While the rates of SMM during the same periods steadily increased for all racial/ethnic groups, Black birthing people experienced the greatest absolute increase compared to any other race/ethnic group going from 69.4 in 1998–2000 to 173.7 per 10,000 deliveries in 2016–2018. In addition, we found that Black birthing people had higher rates for every individual condition compared to White birthing people, with rate ratios ranging from a low of 1.11 for heart failure during surgery to a high of 102.4 for sickle cell anemia. Obesity was not significantly associated with SMM among Black birthing people but was associated with SMM among White birthing people [aRR 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.36)]. An unbiased understanding of how SMM has affected different race/ethnicity groups is key to improving maternal health and preventing SMM and mortality among Black birthing people. SMM needs to be addressed as both a medical and public health challenge."
https://openalex.org/W4312079979,"As the existing data on the correlation of adiposity with adverse outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are inconsistent, the aim of the present study is to examine the correlation of an increased body mass index with 30-day complications after carotid endarterectomy. The cohort study comprises 1586 CEAs, performed at the Clinic for Vascular Surgery in Belgrade, from 2012–2017. Out of them, 550 CEAs were performed in patients with normal body mass index (18.5–24.9), 750 in overweight (25.0–29.9), and 286 in obese (≥30) patients. The association of overweight and obesity with early outcomes of carotid endarterectomy was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Overweight patients, in whom CEAs were performed, were significantly more frequently males, compared to normal weight patients–Odds Ratio (OR) 1.51 (95% confidence interval– 1.19–1.89). Moreover, overweight patients significantly more frequently had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus—OR 1.44 (1.09–1.90), and more frequently used ACEI in hospital discharge therapy—OR 1.41 (1.07–1.84) than normal weight patients. Additionally, the CEAs in them were less frequently followed by bleedings—OR 0.37 (0.16–0.83). Compared to normal weight patients, obese patients were significantly younger—OR 0.98 (0.96–0.99), and with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus—OR 1.83 (1.09–3.06) and OR 2.13 (1.50–3.01) respectively. They also more frequently had increased triglyceride levels–OR 1.36 (1.01–1.83), and more frequently used oral anticoagulants in therapy before the surgery–OR 2.16 (1.11–4.19). According to the results obtained, overweight and obesity were not associated with an increased death rate, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, myocardial infarction, or with minor complications, and the need for reoperation after carotid endarterectomy. The only exception was bleeding, which was significantly less frequent after CEA in overweight compared to normal weight patients."
https://openalex.org/W4311942735,"Background Women of reproductive age are at a higher risk of insufficient micronutrient intake due to their low dietary diversity which has an impact on child growth and development, anemia and low birth weight. However, there are no information from the study area. Hence, the study aimed to assess dietary diversity and associated factors among reproductive-age women in Jeldu District, West Shoa Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia, 2018. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was undertaken among 634 women of reproductive age. The study participants were recruited using a systematic sampling method. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire based on 24-hour dietary recalls. The data were checked, coded, and entered into EpiData version 3.1 before being exported to SPSS Version 21 for analysis. Descriptive statistics like frequency standard deviation, mean and proportions were computed., both binary and multivariable logistic regressions were run at 95 percent confidence intervals. A P-value of &lt;0.05 was used to declare a statistically significant association between dietary diversity and explanatory variables. Results The proportions of women who consumed greater than or equal to five food groups were 81.9%. Agro-ecological zone of highland (AOR = 7.71: 95% CI: 3.72, 15.99), women who have a radio (AOR; 1.87: 95% CI; 1.17, 2.99) and women’s decision-making power to purchase food for household (AOR; 3.93:95% CI; 2.3, 6.71) and having own mobile phone (AOR: 1.92 (1.74, 3.16)) were statistically associated with food dietary diversity. Conclusion The proportion of women who met the minimal standard for dietary variety requirements was high. The presence of radios, mobile phones, women’s purchasing decision power, as well as possessing large cattle, and the agroecological zone of the participants were all important predictors of dietary variety among reproductive-age women. The local media, agriculture office, health office, and women, youth, and children office all need to pay more attention to the determinants of dietary variety in women."
https://openalex.org/W4312003339,"The aerosol characteristics of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are important parameters in predicting health outcomes since parameters such as aerosol particle size correlate strongly to aerosol delivery and deposition efficiency. However, many studies to date do not account for aerosol aging, which may affect the measurement of ultra-fine particles that typically coagulate or agglomerate during puff development. To reduce aerosol aging, we herein present a unique instrumentation method that combines a) positive pressure ENDS activation and sample collection, b) minimization of both sample tubing length and dilution factors, and c) a high-resolution, electrical low-pressure impactor. This novel approach was applied to systematically investigate the effects of coil design, coil temperature, and propylene glycol to vegetable glycerol ratios on aerosol characteristics including aerosol mass generation, aerosol count generation, and the mass and count size distributions for a high-powered ENDS. Aerosol count measurements revealed high concentrations of ultra-fine particles compared to fine and coarse particles at 200°C, while aerosol mass measurements showed an increase in the overall aerosol mass of fine and coarse particles with increases in temperature and decreases in propylene glycol content. These results provide a better understanding on how various ENDS design parameters affect aerosol characteristics and highlight the need for further research to identify the design parameters that most impact ultra-fine particle generation."
https://openalex.org/W4312003406,"Vasoactive drugs are one of the most common patient-related barriers to early mobilization. Little is known about the hemodynamic effects of early mobilization on patients receiving vasoactive drugs. This study aims to observe and describe the impact of mobilization on the vital signs of critical patients receiving vasoactive drugs as well as the occurrence of adverse events.This is a cohort study performed in an Intensive Care Unit with patients receiving vasoactive drugs. All patients, either mobilized or non-mobilized, had their clinical data such as vital signs [heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation], type and dosage of the vasoactive drug, and respiratory support collected at rest. For mobilized patients, the vital signs were also collected after mobilization, and so was the highest level of mobility achieved and the occurrence of adverse events. The criteria involved in the decision of mobilizing the patients were registered.53 patients were included in this study and 222 physiotherapy sessions were monitored. In most of the sessions (n = 150, 67.6%), patients were mobilized despite the use of vasoactive drugs. There was a statistically significant increase in heart rate and respiratory rate after mobilization when compared to rest (p<0.05). Only two (1.3%) out of 150 mobilizations presented an adverse event. Most of the time, non-mobilizations were justified by the existence of a clinical contraindication (n = 61, 84.7%).The alterations observed in the vital signs of mobilized patients may have reflected physiological adjustments of patients' cardiovascular and respiratory systems to the increase in physical demand imposed by the early mobilization. The adverse events were rare, not serious, and reversed through actions such as a minimal increase of the vasoactive drug dosage."
https://openalex.org/W4312003514,"The Recency, Frequency, and Monetary model, also known as the RFM model, is a popular and widely used business model for determining beneficial client segments and analyzing profit. It is also recommended and frequently used in superstores to identify customer segments and increase profit margins. Later, the Length, Recency, Frequency, and Monetary model, also known as the LRFM model, was introduced as an improved version of the RFM model to identify more relevant and exact consumer groups for profit maximization. Superstores have a varying number of different products. In RFM and LRFM models, the relationship between profit and purchased quantity has never been investigated. Therefore, this paper proposed an efficient customer segmentation model, namely LRFMV (Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary and Volume) and studied the profit-quantity relationship. A new dimension V (volume) has been added to the existing LRFM model to show a direct profit-quantity relationship in customer segmentation. The V stands for volume, which is derived by calculating the average number of products purchased by a frequent superstore client in a single day. The data obtained from feature extraction of the LRMFV model is then clustered by using conventional K-means, K-Medoids, and Mini Batch K-means methods. The results obtained from the three algorithms are compared, and the K-means algorithm is chosen for the superstore dataset of the proposed LRFMV model. All clusters created using these three algorithms are evaluated in the LRFMV model, and a close relationship between profit and volume is observed. A clear profit-quantity relationship of items has yet not been seen in any prior study on the RFM and LRFM models. Grouping customers aiming at profit maximization existed previously, but there was no clear and direct depiction of profit and quantity of sold items. This study applied unsupervised machine learning to investigate the patterns, trends, and correlations between volume and profit. The traits of all the clusters are analyzed by the Customer-Classification Matrix. The LRFMV values, larger or less than the overall average for each cluster, are identified as their traits. The performance of the proposed LRFMV model is compared with the legacy RFM and LRFM customer segmentation models. The outcome shows that the LRFMV model creates precise customer segments with the same number of customers while maintaining a greater profit."
https://openalex.org/W4312003538,"Introduction Assessing patient expectations in orthopaedic surgery has gained significant importance over time. However, there have been only a few studies on how to measure such expectations in hand surgery. Against the backdrop, the study was designed to develop a valid and reliable expectations survey for patients undergoing hand surgery and to identify the correlations between preoperative expectations and postoperative satisfaction. Materials and methods This is a three-phase prospective cohort study. In the first phase of the study (146 patients), patient expectations were assessed while developing a draft questionnaire based on frequency and clinical relevance. In the second phase (154 patients newly included), test-retest reliability was measured to ensure test consistency. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) served as a basis for developing the final survey questionnaire. In the third phase, we followed up with patients, who completed the preoperative expectations survey, 3 months after surgery to assess the fulfillment of their expectations. The Pearson correlation method was used to measure the association between preoperative expectations and postoperative satisfaction. Results In the first phase, 146 patients shared 406 different expectations, which were grouped into nine categories. Then, in the second phase, the final survey was populated by questionnaire items under respective category that have revealed strong test-retest reliability (ICC of 0.91). A significant positive correlation between patient expectations and satisfaction was observed (R = 0.181, p = 0.034). Conclusion The survey was designed to offer a valid and reliable approach for the comprehensive assessment of patient expectations in hand surgery. The survey results show that patients with high expectations tend to be more satisfied with surgical outcomes. It is strongly believed that this approach would serve as a useful tool at a time when patient perspective is taken into account increasingly more in the clinical practice."

Here we investigated whether the virulence of M. abscessus clinical isolates could be evaluated by calculating the median lethal dose (LD50) in a silkworm infection model. M. abscessus subsp. abscessus cells were injected into the silkworm hemolymph. When reared at 37˚C, the silkworms died within 2 days post-infection with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus. Viable cell numbers of M. abscessus increased in the hemolymph of silkworms injected with M. abscessus. Silkworms were not killed by injections with heat-killed M. abscessus cells. The administration of clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug used to treat the infection in humans, prolonged the survival time of silkworms injected with M. abscessus. The LD50 values of 7 clinical isolates in the silkworm infection model were differed by up to 9-fold. The Mb-17 isolate, which was identified as a virulent strain in the silkworm infection model, induced more detachment of human THP-1-derived macrophages during infection than the Mb-10 isolate. These findings suggest that the silkworm M. abscessus infection model can be used to quantitatively evaluate the virulence of M. abscessus clinical isolates in a short time period."

https://openalex.org/W4311914527,"Depth image-based rendering (DIBR) is an important technology in the process of 2D-to-3D conversion. It uses texture images and related depth maps to render virtual views. While there are still some challenging problems in the current DIBR systems, such as disocclusion occurrences. Inpainting methods based on deep learning have recently shown significant improvements and generated plausible images. However, most of these methods may not deal well with the disocclusion holes in the synthesized views, because on the one hand they only treat this issue as generative inpainting after 3D warping, rather than following the full DIBR processing procedures. While on the other hand the distributions of holes on the virtual views are always around the transition regions of foreground and background, which makes them more difficult to distinguish without special constraints. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes a novel learning-based method for stereoscopic view synthesis, in which the disocclusion regions are restored by a progressive structure reconstruction strategy instead of direct texture inpainting. Additionally, some special cues in the synthesized scenes are further exploited as constraints for the network to alleviate hallucinated structure mixtures among different layers. Extensive empirical evaluations and comparisons validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that the model is more suitable for stereoscopic synthesis in the 2D-to-3D conversion applications."
https://openalex.org/W4311942691,"Introduction Clinical prediction and decision tools that generate outcome-based risk stratification and/or intervention recommendations are prevalent. Appropriate use and validity of these tools, especially those that inform complex clinical decisions, remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the methodologic quality and applicability of clinical risk scoring tools used to guide hospitalization decision-making. Methods In February 2021, a comprehensive search was performed of a clinical calculator online database (mdcalc.com) that is publicly available and well-known to clinicians. The primary reference for any calculator tool informing outpatient versus inpatient disposition was considered for inclusion. Studies were restricted to the adult, acute care population. Those focused on obstetrics/gynecology or critical care admission were excluded. The Wasson-Laupacis framework of methodologic standards for clinical prediction rules was applied to each study. Results A total of 22 calculators provided hospital admission recommendations for 9 discrete medical conditions using adverse events (14/22), mortality (6/22), or confirmatory diagnosis (2/22) as outcomes of interest. The most commonly met methodologic standards included mathematical technique description (22/22) and clinical sensibility (22/22) and least commonly met included reproducibility of the rule (1/22) and measurement of effect on clinical use (1/22). Description of the studied population was often lacking, especially patient race/ethnicity (2/22) and mental or behavioral health (0/22). Only one study reported any item related to social determinants of health. Conclusion Studies commonly do not meet rigorous methodologic standards and often fail to report pertinent details that would guide applicability. These clinical tools focus primarily on specific disease entities and clinical variables, missing the breadth of information necessary to make a disposition determination and raise significant validation and generalizability concerns."
https://openalex.org/W4312003148,"In response to pheromone, many proteins localize on the plasma membrane of yeast cell to reform it into a polarized shmoo structure. The adaptor protein Ste50p, known as a pheromone signal enhancer critical for shmoo polarization, has never been explored systematically for its localization and function in the polarization process. Time-lapse single-cell imaging and quantitation shown here characterizes Ste50p involvement in the establishment of cell polarity. We found that Ste50p patches on the cell cortex mark the point of shmoo initiation, these patches could move, and remain associated with the growing shmoo tip in a pheromone concentration time-dependent manner until shmoo maturation. A Ste50p mutant impaired in patch localization suffers a delay in polarization. By quantitative analysis we show that polarization correlates with the rising levels of Ste50p, enabling rapid cell responses to pheromone that correspond to a critical level of Ste50p at the initial G1 phase. We exploited the quantitative differences in the pattern of Ste50p expression to correlate with the cell-cell phenotypic heterogeneity, showing Ste50p involvement in the cellular differentiation choice. Taken together, these findings present Ste50p to be part of the early shmoo development phase, suggesting that Ste50p may be involved with the polarisome in the initiation of polarization, and plays a role in regulating the polarized growth of shmoo during pheromone response."
https://openalex.org/W4312003200,"Background International migration has increased during the past years and little is known about the mortality of young adult immigrants and refugees that came to Sweden as children. This study aimed to investigate 1) the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in young accompanied and unaccompanied refugees and non-refugee immigrants compared to Swedish born individuals; and 2) to determine the role of educational level and migrations-related factors in these associations. Methods This register linkage study is based on 682,358 individuals (633,167 Swedish-born, 2,163 unaccompanied and 25,658 accompanied refugees and 21,370 non-refugee immigrants) 19–25 years old, who resided in Sweden 31.12.2004. Outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality due to suicide and external causes. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox regression models with a maximum follow-up to 2016. Results After adjusting for covariates, all-cause mortality was significantly lower in non-refugee immigrants (aHR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59–0.84) and refugees (aHR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65–0.88) compared to Swedish-born individuals. The same direction of association was observed for mortality due to suicide and external causes. No differences between accompanied and unaccompanied refugees were found. Risk estimates for all migrant groups varied with educational level, duration of residency, age at arrival and country of birth. Further, the mortality risk of migrants arriving in Sweden before the age of 6 years did not significantly differ from the risk of their Swedish-born peers. Low education was a considerable risk factor. Conclusion In general, young adult refugees and non-refugee immigrants have a lower risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality than Swedish-born individuals. The identified migrant groups with higher mortality risk need specific attention."

We conducted a cross-sectional study (Study 1) and a longitudinal study (Study 2) to examine the association between food intake and stress resilience in Japanese middle and high school students. In Study 1, 865 participants (412 males and 453 females) completed the questionnaires. In Study 2, 109 students (51 males and 58 females) participated each year from 2016 to 2018. Dietary intake was assessed using a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. Stress resilience was evaluated using a 13-item sense of coherence (SOC) questionnaire. Correlation coefficients were calculated in Study 1 to investigate the relationship between food group intake and SOC. In Study 2, a cross-lagged panel model was tested using structural equation modeling to investigate the effect of dairy product consumption on SOC. Study 1 revealed that only dairy product intake positively correlated with SOC and other food intake indicated no significant relationship. Study 2 indicated that augmented dairy product intake was positively associated with SOC. Among all foods, only dairy products were associated with SOC in adolescents. Although the association was weak, the longitudinal study confirmed that dairy consumption was associated with SOC. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to examine the causal relationship."
https://openalex.org/W4312003260,"Background Metabolic syndrome (MS) is common among Muslim patients living in China, most of whom are Kazakh adults. Continuous and effective health self-management plays a critical role in preventing negative health outcomes for individuals with MS. However, Muslim minority patients with MS face many difficulties in actively participating in health self-management, and the factors supporting their successful self-management of MS remain unclear. Objective This study aimed to identify the factors predicting health self-management behaviour among Kazakh MS patients and provide empirical evidence for establishing recommendation guidelines or intervention programmes for health self-management among Muslim minorities. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Xinjiang Province, China, with the use of convenience sampling to explore the current health self-management behaviour of 454 Kazakh MS patients and its influencing factors. Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results The total health self-management behaviour score of Kazakh MS patients was 85.84±11.75, and the weaknesses in self-management behaviour were mainly reflected in three dimensions: disease self-monitoring, emotion management and communication with physicians. The significant positive predictors of health self-management behaviour were sex, education, family monthly income per capita, weight, knowledge of MS, and self-efficacy, while the significant negative predictors were blood pressure, the number of MS components, chronic disease comorbidities, and social support (objective support and utilization of support). Conclusion The health self-management behaviour of Kazakh MS patients is poor. Health care providers should aim to develop culturally specific and feasible health management intervention programmes based on the weaknesses and major modifiable influencing factors in Muslim minority MS patient health self-management, thus improving the health outcomes and quality of life of patients."
https://openalex.org/W4312003281,"Despite the emphasis on reporting of Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFIs) during didactic training sessions, especially prior to new vaccine introductions, it remains low in Ghana. We explored the factors underlying the under-reporting of AEFI by healthcare workers (HCWs) to provide guidance on appropriate interventions to increase reporting.We conducted an exploratory descriptive in-depth study of the factors contributing to low reporting of AEFI among HCWs in four regions in Ghana. Key informant interviews (KII) were held with purposively selected individuals that are relevant to the AEFI reporting process at the district, regional, and national levels. We used KII guides to conduct in-depth interviews and used NVivo 10 qualitative software to analyse the data. Themes on factors influencing AEFI reporting were derived inductively from the data, and illustrative quotes from respondents were used to support the narratives.We conducted 116 KIIs with the health managers, regulators and frontline HCWs and found that lack of information on reportable AEFIs and reporting structures, misunderstanding of reportable AEFIs, heavy workload, cost of reporting AEFIs, fear of blame by supervisors, lack of motivation, and inadequate feedback as factors responsible for underreporting of AEFIs. Respondents suggested that capacity building for frontline HCWs, effective supervision, the provision of motivation and feedback, simplification of reporting procedures, incentives for integrating AEFI reporting into routine monitoring and reporting, standardization of reporting procedures across regions, and developing appropriate interventions to address the fear of personal consequences would help improve AEFI reporting.From the perspectives of a broad range of key informants at all levels of the vaccine safety system, we found multiple factors (both structural and behavioural), that may impact HCW reporting of AEFI in Ghana. Improvements in line with the suggestions are necessary for increased AEFI reporting in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W4312003325,"Market making is a high-frequency trading problem for which solutions based on reinforcement learning (RL) are being explored increasingly. This paper presents an approach to market making using deep reinforcement learning, with the novelty that, rather than to set the bid and ask prices directly, the neural network output is used to tweak the risk aversion parameter and the output of the Avellaneda-Stoikov procedure to obtain bid and ask prices that minimise inventory risk. Two further contributions are, first, that the initial parameters for the Avellaneda-Stoikov equations are optimised with a genetic algorithm, which parameters are also used to create a baseline Avellaneda-Stoikov agent (Gen-AS); and second, that state-defining features forming the RL agent’s neural network input are selected based on their relative importance by means of a random forest. Two variants of the deep RL model (Alpha-AS-1 and Alpha-AS-2) were backtested on real data (L2 tick data from 30 days of bitcoin–dollar pair trading) alongside the Gen-AS model and two other baselines. The performance of the five models was recorded through four indicators (the Sharpe, Sortino and P&amp;L-to-MAP ratios, and the maximum drawdown). Gen-AS outperformed the two other baseline models on all indicators, and in turn the two Alpha-AS models substantially outperformed Gen-AS on Sharpe, Sortino and P&amp;L-to-MAP. Localised excessive risk-taking by the Alpha-AS models, as reflected in a few heavy dropdowns, is a source of concern for which possible solutions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4312003375,"The role of leaders in conflict management remains the favorite area of researchers. This study aims to introduce a unique role of leaders in conflict named as leader instigated task conflict. We proposed that leader instigated task conflict promotes job crafting behaviors of employees by considering attributions regarding leader instigated conflict as mechanism for this relationship. Data were collected from 247 employees working in teams in marketing departments of different organizations across Pakistan. Data analyses was conducted through multilevel structural equation modeling. Findings revealed that leader instigated task conflict is positively related to promotion-focused job crafting and negatively related to prevention-focused job crafting via the mediating role of constructive conflict instigation attribution and destructive conflict instigation attribution respectively. The current study contributes to the literature on conflict by suggesting that leaders can be a source of task based conflict to achieve its positive outcomes. However, employee attributions play a vital role in achieving the positive outcomes of leader instigated task conflict, hence leaders must be careful about shaping constructive attributions of followers regarding their conflict instigation behavior in order to promote constructive behavioral responses of employees."
https://openalex.org/W4312003394,"It can be important for consumers to know whether food products contain animal material and, if so, of which species. Food products with animal material as an ingredient often contain collagen type 1. LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography–tandem Mass Spectrometry) was applied as technique to generically detect bird. Unlike for example fish, that have experienced longer divergence times, it is still possible to find generic LC-MS targets for avian type 1 collagen. After theoretical target selection using 83 collagen 1α2 bird sequences of 33 orders and construction of a common ancestor sequence of birds, experimental evidence was provided by analyzing extracts from 10 extant bird species. Two suitable options have been identified. The combination of VGPIGPAGNR and VGPIGAAGNR (pheasant only) covers all investigated birds and was not found in other species. The peptide EGPVGF p GADGR covers all investigated birds, but also occurs in several species of crocodiles and turtles. The presence of the generic peptide (combination) was confirmed in food products, proving the principle, and can therefore be used to detect the presence of bird. Furthermore, it is shown how the use of constructed ancestor sequences could benefit the field of paleoproteomics, in the interpretation of collagen MS/MS spectra of ancient species. Our theoretical analysis and assessment of reported Brachylophosaurus canadensis collagen 1α2 MS/MS data provided support for several previous peptide sequence assignments, but we also propose that our constructed ancestral bird sequence GP p GESGAVGPAGPIGSR may fit the MS/MS data better than the original assignment GLPGESGAVGPAGP p GSR."
https://openalex.org/W4312003408,"Suicide is considered as one of the major public health concerns, which can be prevented with cost-effective and timely intervention. In Bangladesh, very few studies assessed the suicidal behavior of rural community people. Thus, this Bangladesh Community Mental Health Study (BD ComMen Study) attempted to understand the current situation of suicidality in Bangladeshi rural community people considering three-time frames: lifetime, past year, and past month.A cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural community in Bangladesh between May 17 and 31, 2022, using a cluster sampling technique. Information on socio-demographics, COVID-19-related factors, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and suicidal behaviors was collected. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used to analyze the data.During their lifetime, 33.1% of the rural community people had suicidal thoughts, whereas 5.5% made a plan for suicide and 1.8% attempted suicide. The prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation was 3.9%, whereas 1.4% had a suicide plan. In addition, 0.6% had past-month suicidal thoughts, although none of them had planned or attempted suicide. The factors associated with suicidal behaviors included males, lower age, lower educational grade, low-earning jobs, living in a government-provided house, family history of mental health and suicide, and suffering from anxiety and insomnia.Suicidal behaviors among the rural community people are of great concern as most of the rural people in Bangladesh do not have enough mental health literacy for treatment-seeking due to a high level of mental health-related stigma. Thus, this study would likely help to initiate further studies and stimulate suicide prevention programs, because most suicide can be prevented."
https://openalex.org/W4312003412,"Most animals, including rats, show a preference for more complex environments. This is demonstrated particularly well when complexity increases due to the addition of new elements to the environment. The aim of the study was to investigate the reaction to novelty, understood as a change in environmental properties that involve both changes in complexity and controllability. Controllability may allow for dealing with challenges of an environment of low predictability in a way that the animal's own activity reduces the uncertainty of environmental events. In our study, the animals underwent a spontaneous exploration test in low-stress conditions. After a period of habituation to the experimental arena, additional stationary (increased complexity) and/or movable (increased complexity and controllability) tunnels were introduced, and the reaction of the rats to the novel objects was measured. The results of the study confirmed that an increase in the complexity of the environment through the addition of objects triggers a more intensive exploratory activity in rats. However, an increased spatial complexity combined with the movability of the novel objects seems to result in increased caution towards the novelty after an initial inspection of the changed objects. It suggests that the complexity of the novelty may trigger both neophilia and neophobia depending on the level of the predictability of the novel environment and that the movability of newly introduced objects is not independent of other parameters of the environment."
https://openalex.org/W4312003509,"Background Risk compensation, or matching behavior to a perceived level of acceptable risk, can blunt the effectiveness of public health interventions. One area of possible risk compensation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is antibody testing. While antibody tests are imperfect measures of immunity, results may influence risk perception and individual preventive actions. We conducted a randomized control trial to assess whether receiving antibody test results changed SARS-CoV-2 protective behaviors. Purpose Assess whether objective information about antibody status, particularly for those who are antibody negative and likely still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, increases protective behaviors. Secondarily, assess whether a positive antibody test results in decreased protective behaviors. Methods In September 2020, we enrolled 1076 undergraduate students, used fingerstick tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and randomized participants to receive their results immediately or delayed by 4 weeks. Two weeks later, participants completed a survey about their engagement in 4 protective behaviors (mask use, social event avoidance, staying home from work/school, ensuring physical distancing). We estimated differences between conditions for each of these behaviors, stratified by antibody status. For negative participants at baseline, we also estimated the difference between conditions for seroconversion over 8 weeks of follow-up. Results For the antibody negative participants (n = 1029) and antibody positive participants (n = 47), we observed no significant differences in protective behavior engagement between those who were randomized to receive test results immediately or after 4 weeks. For the baseline antibody negative participants, we also observed no difference in seroconversion outcomes between conditions. Conclusions We found that receiving antibody test results did not lead to significant behavior change in undergraduate students whether the SARS-CoV-2 antibody result was positive or negative."

Currently, such models have received widespread attention in the study of SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicable to a large set of organoid models and viruses, we provide a step-by-step work instruction for the infection of human alveolar-like organoids with SARS-CoV-2 in this protocol collection. We also prepared a detailed description on state-of-the-art methodologies to assess the infection impact and the analysis of relevant host factors in organoids. This protocol collection consists of five different sets of protocols. Set 1 describes the protein extraction from human alveolar-like organoids and the determination of protein expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN as exemplary host factors of SARS-CoV-2. Set 2 provides detailed guidance on the extraction of RNA from human alveolar-like organoids and the subsequent qPCR to quantify the expression level of ACE2 , TMPRSS2 , and FURIN as host factors of SARS-CoV-2 on the mRNA level. Protocol set 3 contains an in-depth explanation on how to infect human alveolar-like organoids with SARS-CoV-2 and how to quantify the viral replication by plaque assay and viral E gene-based RT-qPCR. Set 4 provides a step-by-step protocol for the isolation of single cells from infected human alveolar-like organoids for further processing in single-cell RNA sequencing or flow cytometry. Set 5 presents a detailed protocol on how to perform the fixation of human alveolar-like organoids and guides through all steps of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize SARS-CoV-2 and its host factors. The infection and all subsequent analytical methods have been successfully validated by biological replications with human alveolar-like organoids based on material from different donors."
https://openalex.org/W4312036682,"Among patients with Alzheimer’s disease and its related dementias (ADRD) with behavioral disturbances, antipsychotic prescriptions have limited efficacy and increase the risk of death. Yet, physicians continue to routinely prescribe low-value antipsychotic medications for behavioral disturbances among patients with ADRD. We designed a pragmatic randomized-controlled trial to measure the impact of a behavioral economic electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) intervention to reduce physician prescriptions of new antipsychotic medications among patients with ADRD. Utilizing a pragmatic parallel arm randomized-controlled trial design, the study will randomize eligible physicians from a large academic health system to either receive a EHR CDS intervention or not (control) when they prescribe a new antipsychotic medication during visits with patients with ADRD. The intervention will include three components: 1) alerts prescribers that antipsychotic prescriptions increase mortality risk (motivating physicians’ intrinsic desire for non-malfeasance); 2) offers non-pharmacological behavioral resources for caregivers; 3) auto-defaults the prescription to contain the lowest dose and number of pill-days (n = 30) without refills if the prescriber does not cancel the order (appealing to default bias). Over 1 year, we will compare the cumulative total of new antipsychotic pill-days prescribed (primary outcome) by physicians in the intervention group versus in the control group. The study protocol meets international SPIRIT guidelines. Behavioral economics, or the study of human behavior as a function of more than rational incentives, considering a whole host of cognitive and social psychological preferences, tendencies, and biases, is increasingly recognized as an important conceptual framework to improve physician behavior. This pragmatic trial is among the first to combine two distinct behavioral economic principles, a desire for non-malfeasance and default bias, to improve physician prescribing patterns for patients with ADRD. We anticipate this trial will substantially advance understanding of how behavioral-economic informed EHR CDS tools can potentially reduce harmful, low-value care among patients with ADRD."

https://openalex.org/W4312036745,"Background Point-of-care-tests (POCTs) have been advocated to optimise care in patients with infections but their actual use varies. This study aimed to estimate the variability in the adoption of current POCTs by paediatricians across Europe, and to explore the determinants of variability. Methods and findings A cross-sectional survey was conducted of hospital and primary care paediatricians, recruited through professional networks. Questions focused on the availability and use of currently available POCTs. Data were analysed descriptively and using Median Odds Ratio (MOR) to measure variation between countries. Multilevel regression modelling using changes in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of models were used to assess the contribution of individual or workplace versus country level factors, to the observed variation. The commonest POCT was urine dipsticks (UD) which were available to &gt;80% of primary care and hospital paediatricians in 68% (13/19) and 79% (23/29) countries, respectively. Availability of all POCTs varied between countries. In primary care, the country (MOR) varied from 1.61 (95%CI: 1.04–2.58) for lactate to 7.28 (95%CI: 3.04–24.35) for UD. In hospitals, the country MOR varied from 1.37 (95%CI:1.04–1.80) for lactate to 11.93 (95%CI:3.35–72.23) for UD. Most paediatricians in primary care (69%, 795/1154) and hospital (81%, 962/1188) would use a diagnostic test in the case scenario of an infant with undifferentiated fever. Multilevel regression modelling showed that the country of work was more important in predicting both the availability and use of POCTs than individual or workplace characteristics. Conclusion There is substantial variability in the adoption of POCTs for the management of acute infections in children across Europe. To inform future implementation of both existing and innovative tests, further research is needed to understand what drives the variation between countries, the needs of frontline clinicians, and the role of diagnostic tests in the management of acute childhood infections."
https://openalex.org/W4312036846,"Diagnostic screening models for the interpretation of null hypothesis significance test (NHST) results have been influential in highlighting the effect of selective publication on the reproducibility of the published literature, leading to John Ioannidis' much-cited claim that most published research findings are false. These models, however, are typically based on the assumption that hypotheses are dichotomously true or false, without considering that effect sizes for different hypotheses are not the same. To address this limitation, we develop a simulation model that overcomes this by modeling effect sizes explicitly using different continuous distributions, while retaining other aspects of previous models such as publication bias and the pursuit of statistical significance. Our results show that the combination of selective publication, bias, low statistical power and unlikely hypotheses consistently leads to high proportions of false positives, irrespective of the effect size distribution assumed. Using continuous effect sizes also allows us to evaluate the degree of effect size overestimation and prevalence of estimates with the wrong sign in the literature, showing that the same factors that drive false-positive results also lead to errors in estimating effect size direction and magnitude. Nevertheless, the relative influence of these factors on different metrics varies depending on the distribution assumed for effect sizes. The model is made available as an R ShinyApp interface, allowing one to explore features of the literature in various scenarios."

https://openalex.org/W4312066683,"Emergence of novel human pathogens pose significant challenges to human health as highlighted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) has previously been employed to identify viral pathogens and outbreaks by testing samples from regional wastewater treatment plants. Near source tracking (NST) allows for more targeted WBE by analysing samples from individual buildings such as schools or even individual floors such as in multi-floor office buildings. Despite the public health advantages of WBE, few strategies exist for optimising NST sampling methodologies. Therefore, we developed a protocol to evaluate virus detection in NST sampling using Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV) as a proxy for RNA viruses. PMMoV is the most abundant enteric human associated RNA virus and is present in peppers/pepper-containing foods. Two bespoke TaqMan RT-PCR assays were developed to detect a PMMoV genomic 5' region and a capsid associated gene. To evaluate the protocol against field samples, pepper homogenates were flushed down an in-use toilet (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK) to spike wastewater with PMMoV on multiple days, and samples collected from two sewage access points to validate NST samplers. These wastewater samples were assessed for PMMoV based on Ct values and results compared to pepper and Tabasco derived PMMoV positive controls. Positive detection of PMMoV was comparable and consistent in ten independent samples across two NST samplers regardless of pepper homogenate spiking. We have developed two novel one step TaqMan assays that amplify both PMMoV targets in viral RNA extractions from peppers, Tabasco, and wastewater samples with cDNA synthesis through to RT-PCR results taking approximately 30 minutes. Pepper homogenate flushing was not required to detect PMMoV in our wastewater samples, however this strategy of flushing PMMoV containing materials outlined here could be valuable in assessing and validating NST in buildings with no previous or current sewage flow."
