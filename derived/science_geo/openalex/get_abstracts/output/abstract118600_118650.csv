https://openalex.org/W1996183144,"Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) entry requires fusion cofactors on the CD4+ target cell. Fusin, a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor, serves as a cofactor for T cell line-tropic isolates. The chemokines RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β, which suppress infection by macrophage-tropic isolates, selectively inhibited cell fusion mediated by the corresponding envelope glycoproteins (Envs). Recombinant CC CKR5, a G protein-coupled receptor for these chemokines, rendered CD4-expressing nonhuman cells fusion-competent preferentially with macrophage-tropic Envs. CC CKR5 messenger RNA was detected selectively in cell types susceptible to macrophage-tropic isolates. CC CKR5 is thus a fusion cofactor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains."
https://openalex.org/W2044616474,"The basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS) is characterized by developmental abnormalities and by the postnatal occurrence of cancers, especially basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the most common human cancer. Heritable mutations in BCNS patients and a somatic mutation in a sporadic BCC were identified in a human homolog of the Drosophila patched (ptc) gene. The ptc gene encodes a transmembrane protein that in Drosophila acts in opposition to the Hedgehog signaling protein, controlling cell fates, patterning, and growth in numerous tissues. The human PTC gene appears to be crucial for proper embryonic development and for tumor suppression."

https://openalex.org/W2076945013,"DnaK and other members of the 70-kilodalton heat-shock protein (hsp70) family promote protein folding, interaction, and translocation, both constitutively and in response to stress, by binding to unfolded polypeptide segments. These proteins have two functional units: a substrate-binding portion binds the polypeptide, and an adenosine triphosphatase portion facilitates substrate exchange. The crystal structure of a peptide complex with the substrate-binding unit of DnaK has now been determined at 2.0 angstroms resolution. The structure consists of a beta-sandwich subdomain followed by alpha-helical segments. The peptide is bound to DnaK in an extended conformation through a channel defined by loops from the beta sandwich. An alpha-helical domain stabilizes the complex, but does not contact the peptide directly. This domain is rotated in the molecules of a second crystal lattice, which suggests a model of conformation-dependent substrate binding that features a latch mechanism for maintaining long lifetime complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2081210383,"A ""Schrodinger cat""-like state of matter was generated at the single atom level. A trapped 9Be+ ion was laser-cooled to the zero-point energy and then prepared in a superposition of spatially separated coherent harmonic oscillator states. This state was created by application of a sequence of laser pulses, which entangles internal (electronic) and external (motional) states of the ion. The Schrodinger cat superposition was verified by detection of the quantum mechanical interference between the localized wave packets. This mesoscopic system may provide insight into the fuzzy boundary between the classical and quantum worlds by allowing controlled studies of quantum measurement and quantum decoherence."

https://openalex.org/W2049998759,"T cell proliferation in vivo is presumed to reflect a T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated polyclonal response directed to various environmental antigens. However, the massive proliferation of T cells seen in viral infections is suggestive of a bystander reaction driven by cytokines instead of the TCR. In mice, T cell proliferation in viral infections preferentially affected the CD44hi subset of CD8+ cells and was mimicked by injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], an inducer of type I interferon (IFN I), and also by purified IFN I; such proliferation was not associated with up-regulation of CD69 or CD25 expression, which implies that TCR signaling was not involved. IFN I [poly(I:C)]-stimulated CD8+ cells survived for prolonged periods in vivo and displayed the same phenotype as did long-lived antigen-specific CD8+ cells. IFN I also potentiated the clonal expansion and survival of CD8+ cells responding to specific antigen. Production of IFN I may thus play an important role in the generation and maintenance of specific memory."

https://openalex.org/W2092643850,"The requirements for T cell activation have been reported to vary widely depending on the state of the T cell, the type of antigen-presenting cell, and the nature of the T cell receptor (TCR) ligand. A unitary requirement for T cell responses was revealed by measurement of the number of triggered TCRs. Irrespective of the nature of the triggering ligand, T cells ""counted"" the number of triggered TCRs and responded when a threshold of approximately 8000 TCRs was reached. The capacity to reach the activation threshold was severely compromised by a reduction in the number of TCRs. Costimulatory signals lowered the activation threshold to approximately 1500 TCRs, thus making T cells more sensitive to antigenic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1994510458,Data on rocks from Spitsbergen and the equatorial sections of Italy and Slovenia indicate that the world's oceans became anoxic at both low and high paleolatitudes in the Late Permian. Such conditions may have been responsible for the mass extinction at this time. This event affected a wide range of shelf depths and extended into shallow water well above the storm wave base.
https://openalex.org/W2004077983,"The self-assembly mechanism of alkanethiol monolayers on the (111) surface of gold was discovered with the use of an ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscope. Monolayer formation follows a two-step process that begins with condensation of low-density crystalline islands, characterized by surface-aligned molecular axes, from a lower density lattice-gas phase. At saturation coverage of this phase, the monolayer undergoes a phase transition to a denser phase by realignment of the molecular axes with the surface normal. These studies reveal the important role of molecule-substrate and molecule-molecule interactions in the self-assembly of these technologically important material systems."

https://openalex.org/W2062487397,"The REV3 and REV7 genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are required for DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. The Rev3 and Rev7 proteins were shown to form a complex with DNA polymerase activity. This polymerase replicated past a thymine-thymine cis-syn cyclobutane dimer, a lesion that normally severely inhibits replication, with an efficiency of approximately 10 percent. In contrast, bypass replication efficiency with yeast DNA polymerase alpha was no more than 1 percent. The Rev3-Rev7 complex is the sixth eukaryotic DNA polymerase to be described, and is therefore called DNA polymerase zeta."
https://openalex.org/W2078901980,"Allogeneic transplantation of islets of Langerhans was facilitated by the cotransplantation of syngeneic myoblasts genetically engineered to express the Fas ligand (FasL). Composite grafting of allogeneic islets with syngeneic myoblasts expressing FasL protected the islet graft from immune rejection and maintained normoglycemia for more than 80 days in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Graft survival was not prolonged with composite grafts of unmodified myoblasts or Fas-expressing myoblasts. Islet allografts transplanted separately from FasL-expressing myoblasts into the contralateral kidney were rejected, as were similarly transplanted third-party thyroid allografts. Thus, the FasL signal provided site- and immune-specific protection of islet allografts."
https://openalex.org/W2065434867,"The molybdoenzyme dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) reductase contributes to the release of dimethylsulfide, a compound that has been implicated in cloud nucleation and global climate regulation. The crystal structure of DMSO reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides reveals a monooxo molybdenum cofactor containing two molybdopterin guanine dinucleotides that asymmetrically coordinate the molybdenum through their dithiolene groups. One of the pterins exhibits different coordination modes to the molybdenum between the oxidized and reduced states, whereas the side chain oxygen of Ser147 coordinates the metal in both states. The change in pterin coordination between the Mo(VI) and Mo(IV) forms suggests a mechanism for substrate binding and reduction by this enzyme. Sequence comparisons of DMSO reductase with a family of bacterial oxotransferases containing molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide indicate a similar polypeptide fold and active site with two molybdopterins within this family."
https://openalex.org/W1995016187,"Mutations that eliminate KatG catalase-peroxidase activity prevent activation of isoniazid and are a major mechanism of resistance to this principal drug for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. However, the loss of KatG activity in clinical isolates seemed paradoxical because KatG is considered an important factor for the survival of the organism. Expression of either KatG or the recently identified alkyl hydroperoxidase AhpC was sufficient to protect bacilli against the toxic effects of organic peroxides. To survive during infection, isoniazid-resistant KatG mutants have apparently compensated for the loss of KatG catalase-peroxidase activity by a second mutation, resulting in hyperexpression of AhpC."
https://openalex.org/W2035999312,"Many bacteria, including several pathogens of plants and humans, use a pheromone called an autoinducer to regulate gene expression in a cell density-dependent manner. Agrobacterium autoinducer [AAI, N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone] of A. tumefaciens is synthesized by the Tral protein, which is encoded by the tumor-inducing plasmid. Purified hexahistidinyl-Tral (H6-Tral) used S-adenosylmethionine to make the homoserine lactone moiety of AAI, but did not use related compounds. H6-Tral used 3-oxo-octanoyl-acyl carrier protein to make the 3-oxo-octanoyl moiety of AAI, but did not use 3-oxo-octanoyl-coenzyme A. These results demonstrate the enzymatic synthesis of an autoinducer through the use of purified substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1978779796,"To investigate the functional organization of object recognition, the technique of optical imaging was applied to the primate inferotemporal cortex, which is thought to be essential for object recognition. The features critical for the activation of single cells were first determined in unit recordings with electrodes. In the subsequent optical imaging, presentation of the critical features activated patchy regions around 0.5 millimeters in diameter, covering the site of the electrode penetration at which the critical feature had been determined. Because signals in optical imaging reflect average neuronal activities in the regions, the result directly indicates the regional clustering of cells responding to similar features."
https://openalex.org/W2009261781,"Drosophila limb development is organized by interactions between anterior and posterior compartment cells. Posterior cells continuously express and require engrailed (en) and secrete Hedgehog (Hh) protein. Anterior cells express the zinc-finger protein Cubitus interruptus (Ci). It is now shown that anterior cells lacking ci express hh and adopt posterior properties without expressing en. Increased levels of Ci can induce the expression of the Hh target gene decapentaplegic (dpp) in a Hh-independent manner. Thus, expression of Ci in anterior cells controls limb development (i) by restricting hh secretion to posterior cells and (ii) by conferring competence to respond to Hh by mediating the transduction of this signal."
https://openalex.org/W2078720990,"Theoretical spectra and evolutionary models that span the giant planet-brown dwarf continuum have been computed based on the recent discovery of the brown dwarf Gliese 229 B. A flux enhancement in the 4- to 5-micrometer wavelength window is a universal feature from jovian planets to brown dwarfs. Model results confirm the existence of methane and water in the spectrum of Gliese 229 B and indicate that its mass is 30 to 55 jovian masses. Although these calculations focus on Gliese 229 B, they are also meant to guide future searches for extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs."
https://openalex.org/W1977765637,Atomic force microscopy was used to characterize the sliding of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) nanocrystals on single-crystal molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) surfaces. Highly anisotropic friction was observed whereby MoO3 nanocrystals moved only along specific directions of the MoS2 surface lattice. The energy per unit area to move the MoO3 nanocrystals along their preferred sliding direction was an order of magnitude less than required to slide macroscopic MoS2-bearing contacts. This extreme friction anisotropy was exploited to fabricate multicomponent MoO3 nanostructures. These reversibly interlocking structures could serve as the basis for devices such as mechanical logic gates.

https://openalex.org/W2009014910,"Because stimulation of CD4+ lymphocytes leads to activation of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) replication, viral spread, and cell death, adoptive CD4+ T cell therapy has not been possible. When antigen and CD28 receptors on cultured T cells were stimulated by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD3 and CD28 that had been immobilized, there was an increase in the number of polyclonal CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected donors. Activated cells predominantly secreted cytokines associated with T helper cell type 1 function. The HIV-1 viral load declined in the absence of antiretroviral agents. Moreover, CD28 stimulation of CD4+ T cells from uninfected donors rendered these cells highly resistant to HIV-1 infection. Immobilization of CD28 mAb was crucial to the development of HIV resistance, as cells stimulated with soluble CD28 mAb were highly susceptible to HIV infection. The CD28-mediated antiviral effect occurred early in the viral life cycle, before HIV-1 DNA integration. These data may facilitate immune reconstitution and gene therapy approaches in persons with HIV infection."

https://openalex.org/W1989321171,"Unlike the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, Ras-related GTP-binding proteins have hitherto been considered not to bind or become activated by tetrafluoroaluminate (AIF4-). However, the product of the proto-oncogene ras in its guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound form interacted with AIF4 - in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of either of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating proteins (GAPs) p120GAP and neurofibromin. Neither oncogenic Ras nor a GAP mutant without catalytic activity produced such a complex. Together with the finding that the Ras-binding domain of the protein kinase c-Raf, whose binding site on Ras overlaps that of the GAPs, did not induce formation of such a complex, this result suggests that GAP and neurofibromin stabilize the transition state of the GTPase reaction of Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2039055983,"The chromosomal requirements for achiasmate (nonexchange) homolog disjunction in Drosophila female meiosis I have been identified with the use of a series of molecularly defined minichromosome deletion derivatives. Efficient disjunction requires 1000 kilobases of overlap in the centric heterochromatin and is not affected by homologous euchromatin or overall size differences. Disjunction efficiency decreases linearly as heterochromatic overlap is reduced from 1000 to 430 kilobases of overlap. Further observations, including rescue experiments with nod kinesin-like protein transgenes, demonstrate that heterochromatin does not act solely to promote chromosome movement or spindle attachment. Thus, it is proposed that centric heterochromatin contains multiple pairing elements that act additively to initiate or maintain the proper alignment of achiasmate chromosomes in meiosis I. How heterochromatin could act to promote chromosome pairing is discussed here."

https://openalex.org/W2025013345,"As a model for studying the generation of antibody diversity, a gene-targeted mouse was produced that is hemizygous for a rearranged V(D)J segment at the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus, the other allele being nonfunctional. The mouse also has no functional kappa light chain allele. The heavy chain, when paired with any lambda light chain, is specific for the hapten (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl (NP). The primary repertoire of this quasi-monoclonal mouse is monospecific, but somatic hypermutation and secondary rearrangements change the specificity of 20 percent of the antigen receptors on B cells. The serum concentrations of the Ig isotypes are similar to those in nontransgenic littermates, but less than half of the serum IgM binds to NP, and none of the other isotypes do. Thus, neither network interactions nor random activation of a small fraction of the B cell population can account for serum Ig concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W2077869706,"Activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors induce the formation of various complexes of intracellular signaling proteins that are mediated by SRC homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains. The activated receptors are also rapidly internalized into the endocytotic compartment and degraded in lysosomes. EGF stimulation of canine epithelial cells induced a rapid and transient association of the SH3-SH2-SH3 protein GRB2 with dynamin, a guanosine triphosphatase that regulates endocytosis. Disruption of GRB2 interactions by microinjection of a peptide corresponding to the GRB2 SH2 domain or its phosphopeptide ligand blocked EGF receptor endocytosis; other SH2 domains that bind EGF receptors or antibodies that neutralize RAS did not. Both activation and termination of EGF signaling appear to be regulated by the diverse interactions of GRB2."
https://openalex.org/W2046128235,"When the Mg2+ ion in the catalytic center of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) is replaced with Fe2+, hydroxyl radicals are generated. In the promoter complex, such radicals cleave template DNA near the transcription start site, whereas the beta' subunit is cleaved at a conserved motif NADFDGD (Asn-Ala-Asp-Phe-Asp-Gly-Asp). Substitution of the three aspartate residues with alanine creates a dominant lethal mutation. The mutant RNAP is catalytically inactive but can bind promoters and form an open complex. The mutant fails to support Fe2+-induced cleavage of DNA or protein. Thus, the NAD-FDGD motif is involved in chelation of the active center Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1539435207,"Homozygous weaver mice are profoundly ataxic because of the loss of granule cell neurons during cerebellar development. This granule cell loss appears to be caused by a genetic defect in the pore region (Gly156-->Ser) of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (K+) channel subunit (GIRK2). A related subunit, GIRK1, associates with GIRK2 to constitute a neuronal G protein-gated inward rectifier K+ channel. The weaver allele of the GIRK2 subunit (wvGIRK2) caused loss of K+ selectivity when expressed either as wvGIRK2 homomultimers or as GIRK1-wvGIRK2 heteromultimers. The mutation also let to loss of sensitivity to G protein betagamma dimers. Expression of wvGIRK2 subunits let to increased cell death, presumably as a result of basal nonselective channel opening."
https://openalex.org/W2008608436,"Yeast galactokinase (Gal1p) is an enzyme and a regulator of transcription. In addition to phosphorylating galactose, Gal1p activates Gal4p, the activator of GAL genes, but the mechanism of this regulation has been unclear. Here, biochemical and genetic evidence is presented to show that Gal1p activates Gal4p by direct interaction with the Gal4p inhibitor Gal80p. Interaction requires galactose, adenosine triphosphate, and the regulatory function of Gal1p. These data indicate that Gal1p-Gal80p complex formation results in the inactivation of Gal80p, thereby transmitting the galactose signal to Gal4p."
https://openalex.org/W2056178963,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, termed MAPK modules, channel extracellular signals into specific cellular responses. Chimeric molecules were constructed between p38 and p44 MAPKs, which transduce stress and growth factor signals, respectively. A discrete region of 40 residues located in the amono-terminal p38MAPK lobe directed the specificity of response to extracellular signals, whereas the p44MAPK chimera, expressed in vivo, redirected stress signals into early mitogenic responses, demonstrating the functional independence of these domains."
https://openalex.org/W2078030647,The ocean currents connecting the western tropical Pacific Ocean with the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are driven by surface winds. The surface winds are in turn driven by the sea-surface temperature (SST) differences between these two regions. This dynamic coupling between the atmosphere and ocean may limit the SST in the tropical Pacific Ocean to below 305 kelvin even in the absence of cloud feedbacks.

The encoded protein functions as an RNA polymerase sigma factor in vitro and it is localized to the chloroplast in vivo. SigA shows high sequence similarity to the sigma factors of cyanobacteria, which is indicative of the ancestral endosymbiotic event and subsequent transfer of the sigA gene to the nuclear genome."

The monophyly of each order is well established, but interrelations have been less certain. A superordinal grouping of up to seven extant orders plus a variety of extinct orders, all included within Ungulata (""hoofed"" mammals), can be linked to Late Cretaceous mammals from the 85-million-year-old Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan (and, less certainly, North America and Europe), thus pushing the origin of this major clade back by 20 million years. Ungulatomorphs are not closely related to primates, rodents, or rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W2044892704,Supergene chalcocite enrichment during weathering is an economically vital natural process that may lead to severalfold increases in the copper content of sulfide deposits. A scanning electron microscope study of chalcocite (Cu2S) from major enriched copper deposits in northern Chile revealed myriad bacterioform bodies in original growth positions near replacement interfaces with remnant hypogene sulfide grains. These minute (0.03 to 0.2 micrometers) chalcocite bodies are interpreted as fossilized and metallized nannobacteria that promoted the fixation of mobilized copper ions. Bacterial activity may thus be a fundamental factor in supergene enrichment of copper deposits.
https://openalex.org/W2044512234,"Cysteine residues were introduced into three different positions distributed on the surface of ribosomal protein S5, to serve as targets for derivatization with an Fe(II)-ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid linker. Hydroxyl radicals generated locally from the tethered Fe(II) in intermediate ribonucleoprotein particles or in 30S ribosomal subunits reconstituted from derivatized S5 caused cleavage of the RNA, resulting in characteristically different cleavage patterns for the three different tethering positions. These findings provide constraints for the three-dimensional folding of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and for the orientation of S5 in the 30S subunit, and they further suggest that antibiotic resistance and accuracy mutations in S5 may involve perturbation of 16S rRNA."

Robin Weiss (Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, UK) wryly portrays the differences between the experimentalists and the theorists as they try to understand how the interactions of HIV and its human host result in disease.

Evidence presented here suggests that the intracellular domains of LIN-12 and GLP-1 interact with the C. elegans EMB-5 protein and that the emb-5 gene functions in the same pathway as the lin-12 and glp-1 genes. EMB-5 is similar in sequence to a yeast protein that controls chromatin structure.

https://openalex.org/W1970746034,"Nucleic acid bulges have been implicated in a number of biological processes and are specific cleavage targets for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin chromophore in a base-catalyzed, radical-mediated reaction. The solution structure of the complex between an analog of the bulge-specific cleaving species and an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a two-base bulge was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance. An unusual binding mode involves major groove recognition by the drug carbohydrate unit and tight fitting of the wedge-shaped drug in the triangular prism pocket formed by the two looped-out bulge bases and the neighboring base pairs. The two drug rings mimic helical DNA bases, complementing the bent DNA structure. The putative abstracting drug radical is 2.2 +/- 0.1 angstroms from the pro-S H5' of the target bulge nucleotide. This structure clarifies the mechanism of bulge recognition and cleavage by a drug and provides insight into the design of bulge-specific nucleic acid binding molecules."

M13 ss DNA molecules containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were maintained but not replicated in Xenopus oocytes yet were replicated in progesterone-matured oocytes. The replication arrest functioned only in cis. The replication arrest was alleviated by injection into oocytes of messenger RNAs encoding the prokaryotic mutagenesis proteins UmuD'C or MucA'B. These results may help explain how cells stabilize repair or replication events on DNA with unrepairable lesions.
