Homocysteine is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. Plasma concentrations of homocysteine can be lowered by dietary administration of B vitamins. Objective To determine whether supplementation with B vitamins that lower levels of plasma total homocysteine can slow the rate of brain atrophy in subjects with mild cognitive impairment in a randomised controlled trial (VITACOG, ISRCTN 94410159). Methods and Findings Single-center, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of high-dose folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 in 271 individuals (of 646 screened) over 70 y old with mild cognitive impairment. A subset (187) volunteered to have cranial MRI scans at the start and finish of the study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups of equal size, one treated with folic acid (0.8 mg/d), vitamin B12 (0.5 mg/d) and vitamin B6 (20 mg/d), the other with placebo; treatment was for 24 months. The main outcome measure was the change in the rate of atrophy of the whole brain assessed by serial volumetric MRI scans. Results A total of 168 participants (85 in active treatment group; 83 receiving placebo) completed the MRI section of the trial. The mean rate of brain atrophy per year was 0.76% [95% CI, 0.63–0.90] in the active treatment group and 1.08% [0.94–1.22] in the placebo group (P = 0.001). The treatment response was related to baseline homocysteine levels: the rate of atrophy in participants with homocysteine >13 µmol/L was 53% lower in the active treatment group (P = 0.001). A greater rate of atrophy was associated with a lower final cognitive test scores. There was no difference in serious adverse events according to treatment category. Conclusions and Significance The accelerated rate of brain atrophy in elderly with mild cognitive impairment can be slowed by treatment with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins. Sixteen percent of those over 70 y old have mild cognitive impairment and half of these develop Alzheimer's disease. Since accelerated brain atrophy is a characteristic of subjects with mild cognitive impairment who convert to Alzheimer's disease, trials are needed to see if the same treatment will delay the development of Alzheimer's disease.

To elucidate immediate early protein dynamics at the plant plasma membrane in response to the bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flagellin (flg22) we employed quantitative mass spectrometric analysis on detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) of Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells. This approach revealed rapid and profound changes in DRM protein composition following PAMP treatment, prominently affecting proton ATPases and receptor-like kinases, including the flagellin receptor FLS2. We employed reverse genetics to address a potential contribution of a subset of these proteins in flg22-triggered cellular responses. Mutants of three candidates (DET3, AHA1, FER) exhibited a conspicuous defect in the PAMP-triggered accumulation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, these mutants showed altered mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, a defect in PAMP-triggered stomatal closure as well as altered bacterial infection phenotypes, which revealed three novel players in elicitor-dependent oxidative burst control and innate immunity. Our data provide evidence for dynamic elicitor-induced changes in the membrane compartmentalization of PAMP signaling components.

Our data provide evidence for dynamic elicitor-induced changes in the membrane compartmentalization of PAMP signaling components. To cope with the great number of potential pathogens, plants evolved specialized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 5The abbreviations used are: PMplasma membraneRLKreceptor-like kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePRRpattern recognition receptorPAMPpathogen-associated molecular patternFLS2flagellin sensitive 2DSMdetergent-soluble membraneROSreactive oxygen speciesDRMdetergent-resistant membrane. through which they detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at the cell surface (1Nicaise V. Roux M. Zipfel C. Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1638-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Within seconds to minutes after PAMP perception manifold intracellular responses occur, including ion fluxes across the plasma membrane (PM), increase of cytosolic Ca2+ levels, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein phosphorylation. At later time points profound transcriptional changes, stomatal closure as well as local cell wall reinforcement take place (2Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). plasma membrane receptor-like kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pattern recognition receptor pathogen-associated molecular pattern flagellin sensitive 2 detergent-soluble membrane reactive oxygen species detergent-resistant membrane. The best characterized plant PAMP perception system is the recognition of bacterial flagellin and its elicitor-active epitope, flg22, by the Arabidopsis PRR FLS2 (flagellin sensitive 2; (2Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar)). FLS2 undergoes flg22-induced complex formation with BRl1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), which precedes and is required for FLS2 endocytosis (2Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 3Robatzek S. Chinchilla D. Boller T. Genes. Dev. 2006; 20: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Indeed, ligand-induced reduction in lateral membrane mobility of FLS2 has been observed in protoplasts (4Ali G.S. Prasad K.V. Day I. Reddy A.S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which could be explained by either ligand-dependent interactions of FLS2 with e.g. BAK1, the confinement of FLS2 to less mobile membrane compartments, or a combination of both. To ensure adequate perception of PAMPs and tightly regulated downstream signaling, the PM must be spatially highly organized and dynamic. In this context, the recruitment of FLS2 to specialized membrane domains seems crucial to enable ligand-induced endocytosis (5Geldner N. Robatzek S. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). During the past years, lateral compartmentalization has become a well-recognized topic in plant membrane research (6Zappel N.F. Panstruga R. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2008; 11: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The membrane raft hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the spatial and temporal organization of biological membranes based on the tight interaction between sterols and sphingolipids. Proteins are believed to associate with membrane rafts in a dynamic manner, allowing stimulus-induced alterations in the raft proteome. Even though the membrane raft hypothesis is still a matter of debate, few researchers doubt the existence of large-scale lateral membrane compartmentalization (7van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4618) Google Scholar). The most widely used method to study membrane rafts is the isolation of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs, (8Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar)). The differential solubilization of membrane proteins points to a different membrane environment and/or a differential affinity of proteins to certain lipids. The most meaningful application of DRM extraction is achieved when differences in DRM composition are induced by a biological stimulus (9Lingwood D. Kaiser H.J. Levental I. Simons K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). DRMs from plant tissues harbor a similar repertoire of proteins as those from animal cells (6Zappel N.F. Panstruga R. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2008; 11: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In this study we applied quantitative proteomics based on 15N/14N-labeled Arabidopsis cells to quantify immediate early responses at the PM following flg22 stimulation. We focused our analysis on changes in the DRM proteome to address the role of induced membrane compartmentalization. This approach revealed 64 proteins that showed significant enrichment in the DRM fraction within 15 min. We employed reverse genetics and pharmacological interference to unravel a potential contribution of these proteins in flg22-induced responses and innate immunity. These experiments identified three novel components that play a role in elicitor-dependent processes and defense against bacterial invasion. Full metabolic 15N/14N-labeling of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) suspension cell cultures was carried out as described (10Engelsberger W. Erban A. Kopka J. Schulze W. Plant Methods. 2006; 2: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the 15N-labeled cell cultures the conventional 14N-containing nitrogen source in the medium (K14NO3) was replaced with K15NO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) as the only nitrogen source, yielding a fully 15N-labeled proteome within 2 weeks of growth in the labeling medium. The experimental design is outlined in Fig. 1. 15N- and 14N-labeled parent cell culture suspensions were split up for reciprocal sample pairs and either treated with active flg22 or antagonistic flg22Δ2 (EZBiolab) at 100 nm final concentration. Samples were taken before (0 min) as well as 5 and 15 min after induction. Additionally, cell culture suspensions were treated with flg22 or flg22Δ2 and compared with untreated cells, also in reciprocal pairs. Samples were taken 5 min after peptide addition. After harvesting, equal amounts (gram fresh weight) of labeled and unlabeled cells were pooled for combined protein extraction, DRM preparation, and mass spectrometric analysis. PM preparation and DRM extraction were performed as described (11Kierszniowska S. Walther D. Schulze W.X. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1916-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, PM fractions were isolated by two-phase partitioning, and the protein amount was determined (51Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). PMs were resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA) and treated with Triton X-100 at a protein to detergent ratio of 1:13 (final concentration 1%) for 30 min on ice while continuously shaking. Solubilized PM extracts were adjusted to a final concentration of 1.8 m sucrose, overlaid with a sucrose step gradient (1.6, 1.4, and 0.15 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 18 h. An opaque ring (DRM fraction; see also Fig. S3) was collected from below the 1.4 m/0.15 m interface. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. DRM pellets were denatured in 6 m urea and 2 m thiourea and subsequently reduced in 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Cysteine groups were alkylated in iodoacetamide and proteins were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako Chemical) and trypsin (Promega). Digested peptides were desalted over C18 STAGE-tips before mass spectrometric analysis (12Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptide mixtures were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using nanoflow HPLC (Proxeon Biosystems) and a linear ion trap instrument (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific) as mass analyzer. Peptides were eluted from a 75 μm analytical column (Reprosil C18, Dr. Maisch GmbH) on a linear gradient running from 10–30% acetonitrile in 50 min and sprayed directly into the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) via information-dependent acquisition of fragmentation spectra of multiple-charged peptides. Full scans were obtained at a resolution of FWHM (full width at half-maximum) of 60,000 and CID fragment spectra were acquired in the LTQ. Additional fragmentation through multistage activation was used if peptides displayed a loss of phosphoric acid (neutral loss, 98 Da) upon MS/MS fragmentation. Fragment MS/MS spectra from raw files were extracted as DTA-files and then merged to peak lists using default settings of DTASuperCharge version 1.19 with a tolerance for precursor ion detection of 50 ppm. Spectra were searched against a non-redundant Arabidopsis protein data base (TAIR8, version 2008–04; 31921 entries) using the Mascot algorithm (version 2.2.0; Matrix Science). The database contained the full Arabidopsis proteome and commonly observed contaminants (human keratin, trypsin, lysyl endopeptidase), thus no taxonomic restrictions were used during automated data base search. The following search parameters were applied: Trypsin as cleaving enzyme, peptide mass tolerance 10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance 0.8 Da, one missed cleavage allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine were chosen as variable modifications. Only peptides with a length of more than five amino acids were considered. MS spectra for protein identification were deposited in the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database, accession numbers 10723–10725). For comparative proteomic analysis, reciprocal labeling experiments were set up using 15N-labeled and unlabeled (14N) cell cultures (Fig. 1). The reciprocal labeling setup was chosen rather than an experimental setup using the same 15N-labeled cultures as repeated internal standard to specifically distinguish which proteins are responding to the treatment with flg22 or flg22Δ2 (treatment effects) from those proteins that are a priori different between the 15N-labeled and unlabeled cell cultures (culture effects, Ref. 11Kierszniowska S. Walther D. Schulze W.X. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1916-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Intensity ratios of the 15N- to 14N-form of each identified peptide were averaged across all peptides belonging to the same protein within one experimental set. Protein abundance ratios were converted into log2 values and were normalized to the median log2 ratio of all proteins identified in the non-treated sample (0 min). Only those proteins for which intensity ratios were obtained in both of the paired reciprocal experimental sets were considered for further analysis. The data analysis workflow is based on first determining the variation between cultures based on 15N/14N ratios in independent 1:1 mixtures (Fig. 1) before any treatment is applied. The ratios in two control experiments show normal distribution (supplemental Fig. S2A) and are used to define ratio-dependent standard deviations (11Kierszniowska S. Walther D. Schulze W.X. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1916-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In a second step, the distances to the diagonal in a graphic display of ratios in reciprocal experiments (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C) were calculated. Proteins, for which the ratios of 15N-form to 14N-form in the two reciprocal experiments lie on a 45° diagonal, are those proteins, which show inherent variation between 15N and 14N cell culture. Proteins with reciprocal behavior, i.e. with high ratios in one of the reciprocal experiments and low ratios in the other, lie away from this diagonal. Using this information, for each data point the p value was determined by a 2-tailed t-distribution (11Kierszniowska S. Walther D. Schulze W.X. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1916-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and a multiple testing correction was applied to the whole data set using the false discovery rate (FDR) method introduced by Benjamini and Hochberg (13Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Reported proteins correspond to a cut-off FDR of 5%. By this method, proteins with clear reciprocal behavior (i.e. high ratios in one experiment and low ratios in the reciprocal experiment) were determined as significant (red symbols in supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). For label-free protein quantification, separate LC-MS/MS runs were performed for protein extracts treated with flg22 for either 15 or 5 min and respective control cells (either untreated or treated with inactive flg22Δ2). For each protein, ion intensities of all observed charge states of peptides belonging to that protein were extracted from the different LC-MS/MS runs and normalized to total ion intensities per run. Ratios were calculated for each peptide separately based on normalized ion intensities, and peptide ratios were subsequently averaged to obtain protein ratios. In total, two independent cell culture sets were analyzed. Immunoblot analysis of FLS2 in PM-derived DRMs and mutant seedlings, the oxidative burst assay, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity assay, measurement of stomatal aperture, callose (aniline blue) and cell death (trypan blue) staining as well as the bacterial infection assays are described in detail in the supplemental Methods. To elucidate rapid dynamic changes in PM compartmentalization after flg22 elicitation, we performed quantitative mass spectrometric analyses on PM-derived cell culture DRMs in a time-course experiment. To allow ratiometric quantification of protein levels we employed full 15N/14N metabolic labeling. Since ligand-induced endocytosis of FLS2 takes place as early as 15–20 min after flg22 elicitation (3Robatzek S. Chinchilla D. Boller T. Genes. Dev. 2006; 20: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), PAMP-induced membrane compartmentalization is expected to occur within or even prior to this time frame. Changes in protein abundance due to de novo protein biosynthesis can be largely excluded at these early time points (14Navarro L. Zipfel C. Rowland O. Keller I. Robatzek S. Boller T. Jones J.D.G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 15Benschop J.J. Mohammed S. O'Flaherty M. Heck A.J. Slijper M. Menke F.L.H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1198-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We induced cell cultures with flg22 (100 nm) or control treatment and collected samples after 0, 5, and 15 min (Fig. 1). We previously verified responsiveness of the cell culture to flg22 in an oxidative burst assay (supplemental Fig. S1). In one experimental setup differentially labeled pairs of cell cultures were either induced with flg22 or the antagonistic flg22 derivative, flg22Δ2 (Fig. 1A; Ref. 16Bauer Z. Gómez-Gómez L. Boller T. Felix G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45669-45676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). An additional paired sample set with the identical treatment but reciprocal 15N/14N labeling was included. In a second setup, flg22 and flg22Δ2 treatments were each compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1B), again using two pairs of cell cultures with reciprocal 15N/14N labeling. In experiments, PM fractions of pooled 15N- or 14N-labeled treatment and control samples were extracted by two-phase partitioning and subsequently DRMs were isolated by Triton X-100 treatment and sucrose gradient centrifugation. After liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis proteins were identified based on the fragmentation patterns of peptides using automated data base matching algorithms and ratiometrically quantified (11Kierszniowska S. Walther D. Schulze W.X. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1916-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With this workflow we efficiently filtered out the between-sample variation and at the same time were able to detect subtle stimulus-induced differences in protein abundance. Based on the procedure outlined above, we identified 316 unique proteins. These overlapped extensively with the reported inventory of DRM-associated plant proteins (6Zappel N.F. Panstruga R. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2008; 11: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 188 of the 316 proteins were present in reciprocal sample pairs and thus met our criteria for quantitative analysis (supplemental Table S1). Histograms of log2-transformed 15N/14N ratios matched Gaussian fits for each tested treatment and time point, indicative of normal distribution of the data sets (supplemental Fig. S2A). Of the 188 proteins suitable for quantification, 34% (n = 64) were significantly enriched in DRMs after flg22 treatment in a least one reciprocal sample pair (p < 0.05; Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S2, B and C, for detailed information see supplemental Table S1). Unaltered abundance of the majority (66%) of the DRM proteins suggests that the PAMP-induced shift in DRM protein abundance is specific and not an artifact caused by a change in phase partitioning behavior after flg22 elicitation. Based on prediction by the ARAMEMNON data base the majority of the 188 proteins (73%) found in the DRM fraction possess at least one transmembrane (TM) domain (56%), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor (12%) or a lipid modification (5%) (Table 1). Importantly, only 0–2% of the proteins responded in a statistically significant manner in the control samples (either treated with the antagonistic flg22Δ2 peptide or in 1:1 mixtures of untreated cells). We thus conclude that we successfully identified proteins that specifically respond to flg22 exposition. An independent experiment with two replicates using unlabeled cell cultures and quantifying protein abundance based on ion intensities at 0, 5, and 15 min after flg22 or flg22Δ2 treatment corroborated enrichment (with a similar fold change) of the majority of the proteins identified in the reciprocal 15N/14N label experiments (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table S1).TABLE 1Responding proteinsFC AGI code and annotationflg22 vs flg22Δ2flg22 vs untreatedflg22Δ2 vs untreatedTMExpression analysisMAROS0 min av fold5 min av fold15 min av fold5 min av fold5 min av foldPMATTEDflg22 upP flg22Signaling receptor-like kinase AT5G46330 FLS2 (flagellin-sensitive 2)1,91,41,511✓fls21 AT3G17840 RLK902 (receptor-like kinase 902)0,81,91,71 AT3G51550 FER (feronia)1,01,81,31enr.158fer4 AT3G02880 LRR transmembrane protein kinase, putative0,91,51,01,31,01enr.✓ AT5G16590 LRR transmembrane protein kinase, putative1,01,61,11,21enr.

https://openalex.org/W2023933362,"Background Evaluation of cancer biomarkers from blood could significantly enable biomarker assessment by providing a relatively non-invasive source of representative tumor material. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) isolated from blood of metastatic cancer patients hold significant promise in this regard. Methodology/Principal Findings Using spiked tumor-cells we evaluated CTC capture on different CTC technology platforms, including CellSearch® and two biochip platforms, and used the isolated CTCs to develop and optimize assays for molecular characterization of CTCs. We report similar performance for the various platforms tested in capturing CTCs, and find that capture efficiency is dependent on the level of EpCAM expression. We demonstrate that captured CTCs are amenable to biomarker analyses such as HER2 status, qRT-PCR for breast cancer subtype markers, KRAS mutation detection, and EGFR staining by immunofluorescence (IF). We quantify cell surface expression of EGFR in metastatic lung cancer patient samples. In addition, we determined HER2 status by IF and FISH in CTCs from metastatic breast cancer patients. In the majority of patients (89%) we found concordance with HER2 status from patient tumor tissue, though in a subset of patients (11%), HER2 status in CTCs differed from that observed in the primary tumor. Surprisingly, we found CTC counts to be higher in ER+ patients in comparison to HER2+ and triple negative patients, which could be explained by low EpCAM expression and a more mesenchymal phenotype of tumors belonging to the basal-like molecular subtype of breast cancer. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggests that molecular characterization from captured CTCs is possible and can potentially provide real-time information on biomarker status. In this regard, CTCs hold significant promise as a source of tumor material to facilitate clinical biomarker evaluation. However, limitations exist from a purely EpCAM based capture system and addition of antibodies to mesenchymal markers could further improve CTC capture efficiency to enable routine biomarker analysis from CTCs."
https://openalex.org/W2034297000,"Southeast Asia is recognized as a region of very high biodiversity, much of which is currently at risk due to habitat loss and other threats. However, many aspects of this diversity, even for relatively well-known groups such as mammals, are poorly known, limiting ability to develop conservation plans. This study examines the value of DNA barcodes, sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene, to enhance understanding of mammalian diversity in the region and hence to aid conservation planning.DNA barcodes were obtained from nearly 1900 specimens representing 165 recognized species of bats. All morphologically or acoustically distinct species, based on classical taxonomy, could be discriminated with DNA barcodes except four closely allied species pairs. Many currently recognized species contained multiple barcode lineages, often with deep divergence suggesting unrecognized species. In addition, most widespread species showed substantial genetic differentiation across their distributions. Our results suggest that mammal species richness within the region may be underestimated by at least 50%, and there are higher levels of endemism and greater intra-specific population structure than previously recognized.DNA barcodes can aid conservation and research by assisting field workers in identifying species, by helping taxonomists determine species groups needing more detailed analysis, and by facilitating the recognition of the appropriate units and scales for conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W2054541267,"Dysregulation of microRNAs is observed in many cancers, including breast cancer. In particular, miR-10b appears to play an important role in tumor cell invasion and breast cancer progression. In this study, we investigated hyaluronan (HA)-induced CD44 (a primary HA receptor) interaction with c-Src kinase and the transcriptional factor, Twist, in breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). Our results indicate that HA binding to CD44 promotes c-Src kinase activation, which, in turn, increases Twist phosphorylation, leading to the nuclear translocation of Twist and transcriptional activation. Further analyses reveal that miR-10b is controlled by an upstream promoter containing the Twist binding site(s), whereas ChIP assays demonstrate that stimulation of miR-10b expression by HA/CD44-activated c-Src is Twist-dependent in breast tumor cells. This process results in the reduction of a tumor suppressor protein (HOXD10), RhoA/RhoC up-regulation, Rho-kinase (ROK) activation, and breast tumor cell invasion. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with PP2 (a c-Src inhibitor) or Twist-specific siRNAs effectively blocks HA-mediated Twist signaling events, abrogates miR-10b production, and increases HOXD10 expression. Subsequently, this c-Src/Twist signaling inhibition causes down-regulation of RhoA/RhoC expression and impairment of ROK-regulated cytoskeleton function (e.g. tumor cell invasion). To further evaluate the role of miR-10b in RhoGTPase signaling, MDA-MB-231 cells were also transfected with a specific anti-miR-10b inhibitor in order to silence miR-10b expression and block its target functions. Our results demonstrate that anti-miR-10b inhibitor not only enhances HOXD10 expression but also abrogates HA/CD44-mediated tumor cell behaviors in breast tumor cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that the HA-induced CD44 interaction with c-Src-activated Twist plays a pivotal role in miR-10b production, leading to the down-regulation of tumor suppressor protein (HOXD10), RhoGTPase-ROK activation, and tumor cell invasion. All of these events are critical prerequisite steps for the acquisition of metastatic properties by human breast cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W1993630867,"Reduced brain levels of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3), a neurotrophic and neuroprotective fatty acid, may contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigated whether the liver enzyme system that provides docosahexaenoic acid to the brain is dysfunctional in this disease. Docosahexaenoic acid levels were reduced in temporal cortex, mid-frontal cortex and cerebellum of subjects with Alzheimer's disease, compared to control subjects (P = 0.007). Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores positively correlated with docosahexaenoic/α-linolenic ratios in temporal cortex (P = 0.005) and mid-frontal cortex (P = 0.018), but not cerebellum. Similarly, liver docosahexaenoic acid content was lower in Alzheimer's disease patients than control subjects (P = 0.011). Liver docosahexaenoic/α-linolenic ratios correlated positively with MMSE scores (r = 0.78; P<0.0001), and negatively with global deterioration scale grades (P = 0.013). Docosahexaenoic acid precursors, including tetracosahexaenoic acid (C24:6n-3), were elevated in liver of Alzheimer's disease patients (P = 0.041), whereas expression of peroxisomal d-bifunctional protein, which catalyzes the conversion of tetracosahexaenoic acid into docosahexaenoic acid, was reduced (P = 0.048). Other genes involved in docosahexaenoic acid metabolism were not affected. The results indicate that a deficit in d-bifunctional protein activity impairs docosahexaenoic acid biosynthesis in liver of Alzheimer's disease patients, lessening the flux of this neuroprotective fatty acid to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2044703255,"Background It has long been thought that mammalian cardiomyocytes are terminally-differentiated and unable to proliferate. However, myocytes in more primitive animals such as zebrafish are able to dedifferentiate and proliferate to regenerate amputated cardiac muscle. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we test the hypothesis that mature mammalian cardiomyocytes retain substantial cellular plasticity, including the ability to dedifferentiate, proliferate, and acquire progenitor cell phenotypes. Two complementary methods were used: 1) cardiomyocyte purification from rat hearts, and 2) genetic fate mapping in cardiac explants from bi-transgenic mice. Cardiomyocytes isolated from rodent hearts were purified by multiple centrifugation and Percoll gradient separation steps, and the purity verified by immunostaining and RT-PCR. Within days in culture, purified cardiomyocytes lost their characteristic electrophysiological properties and striations, flattened and began to divide, as confirmed by proliferation markers and BrdU incorporation. Many dedifferentiated cardiomyocytes went on to express the stem cell antigen c-kit, and the early cardiac transcription factors GATA4 and Nkx2.5. Underlying these changes, inhibitory cell cycle molecules were suppressed in myocyte-derived cells (MDCs), while microRNAs known to orchestrate proliferation and pluripotency increased dramatically. Some, but not all, MDCs self-organized into spheres and re-differentiated into myocytes and endothelial cells in vitro. Cell fate tracking of cardiomyocytes from 4-OH-Tamoxifen-treated double-transgenic MerCreMer/ZEG mouse hearts revealed that green fluorescent protein (GFP) continues to be expressed in dedifferentiated cardiomyocytes, two-thirds of which were also c-kit+. Conclusions/Significance Contradicting the prevailing view that they are terminally-differentiated, postnatal mammalian cardiomyocytes are instead capable of substantial plasticity. Dedifferentiation of myocytes facilitates proliferation and confers a degree of stemness, including the expression of c-kit and the capacity for multipotency."

Species identification is a key problem throughout the life cycle of fishes: from eggs and larvae to adults in fisheries research and control, as well as processed fish products in consumer protection.This study aims to evaluate the applicability of the three mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA (16S), cytochrome b (cyt b), and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) for the identification of 50 European marine fish species by combining techniques of ""DNA barcoding"" and microarrays. In a DNA barcoding approach, neighbour Joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees of 369 16S, 212 cyt b, and 447 COI sequences indicated that cyt b and COI are suitable for unambiguous identification, whereas 16S failed to discriminate closely related flatfish and gurnard species. In course of probe design for DNA microarray development, each of the markers yielded a high number of potentially species-specific probes in silico, although many of them were rejected based on microarray hybridisation experiments. None of the markers provided probes to discriminate the sibling flatfish and gurnard species. However, since 16S-probes were less negatively influenced by the ""position of label"" effect and showed the lowest rejection rate and the highest mean signal intensity, 16S is more suitable for DNA microarray probe design than cty b and COI. The large portion of rejected COI-probes after hybridisation experiments (>90%) renders the DNA barcoding marker as rather unsuitable for this high-throughput technology.Based on these data, a DNA microarray containing 64 functional oligonucleotide probes for the identification of 30 out of the 50 fish species investigated was developed. It represents the next step towards an automated and easy-to-handle method to identify fish, ichthyoplankton, and fish products."
https://openalex.org/W2081138250,"One challenge to the development of new antitubercular drugs is the existence of multiple virulent strains that differ genetically. We and others have recently demonstrated that CYP125A1 is a steroid C26-monooxygenase that plays a key role in cholesterol catabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 but, unexpectedly, not in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain. This discrepancy suggests that the H37Rv strain possesses compensatory activities. Here, we examined the roles in cholesterol metabolism of two other cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP124A1 and CYP142A1. In vitro analysis, including comparisons of the binding affinities and catalytic efficiencies, demonstrated that CYP142A1, but not CYP124A1, can support the growth of H37Rv cells on cholesterol in the absence of cyp125A1. All three enzymes can oxidize the sterol side chain to the carboxylic acid state by sequential oxidation to the alcohol, aldehyde, and acid. Interestingly, CYP125A1 generates oxidized sterols of the (25S)-26-hydroxy configuration, whereas the opposite 25R stereochemistry is obtained with CYP124A1 and CYP142A1. Western blot analysis indicated that CYP124A1 was not detectably expressed in either the H37Rv or CDC1551 strains, whereas CYP142A1 was found in H37Rv but not CDC1551. Genetic complementation of CDC1551 Δcyp125A1 cells with the cyp124A1 or cyp142A1 genes revealed that the latter can fully rescue the growth defect on cholesterol, whereas cells overexpressing CYP124A1 grow poorly and accumulate cholest-4-en-3-one.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of human tubercular infection (tuberculosis) that, even today, poses a great threat to global human health. More than two billion people (a third of the world population) are infected latently with the bacterium, and of those individuals, ∼10% will develop active tuberculosis infections during their lifetime. Currently, more than two million lives are claimed annually due to active M. tuberculosis infections (1World Health OrganizationWorld Health Organization Facts Sheets on Tuberculosis. 2009; (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheet/fs104/en/index.html)Google Scholar). Among first world countries, the spread of M. tuberculosis has been kept mostly under control, but there has been a resurgence in developing countries in large part due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains that make the traditional frontline antibiotics less effective (2Russell D.G.

The participation of cyp125A1 as a steroid C26-monooxygenase in cholesterol side chain degradation in mycobacteria and rhodococci was recently demonstrated by gene inactivation (11Ouellet H. Guan S.

The essential nature of the cyp125A1 gene for growth on cholesterol and alleviation of the toxicity of the cholesterol-derived metabolite cholest-4-en-3-one was observed with M. tuberculosis CDC1551 but not with the H37Rv Δcyp125A1 mutant when similarly grown, suggesting that H37Rv possesses compensatory enzymes that allow it to cope with the absence of CYP125A1.

However, very recent work in our laboratory has shown that CYP130A1 and CYP141A1 do not oxidize cholesterol or cholest-4-en-3-one (11Ouellet H. Guan S. Johnston J.B. Chow E.D. Kells P.M.

Here, we examine whether two other P450 4The abbreviations used are: P450cytochrome P450 enzymeCYPcytochrome P450 enzymeMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrin. enzymes, CYP124A1 and CYP142A1, can substitute for CYP125A1 in degradation of the cholesterol side chain in M. tuberculosis. Comparison of the genome sequences of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 and H37Rv reveal key differences in cytochrome P450 loci. In CDC1551, a 639-bp deletion is found upstream of the cyp142 (Rv3518c) gene. The deletion encompasses the promoter region and the sequence encoding the first 18 amino acids of the protein. The cyp124A1 genes of H37Rv and CDC1551 only differ by two amino acids, G25D and Y75N, respectively. In contrast, the cyp125A1 genes are identical in both strains. CYP124A1 is adjacent to a three-gene operon encoding a sulfotransferase implicated in the biosynthesis of a sulfated menaquinone called S881 (20Holsclaw C.M. Sogi K.M. Gilmore S.A. Schelle M.W.

CYP124A1 was selected as a possible surrogate for CYP125A1 both because of its close sequence and structural homology to CYP125A1 and because it has been shown to catalyze the regioselective oxidation of the terminal methyl in methyl-branched lipids (21Johnston J.B. Kells P.M. Podust L.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20687-20692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CYP142A1 is part of a cluster of genes involved in lipid degradation that has been postulated to play a role in the metabolism of host lipids, including cholesterol (23Ouellet H. Johnston J.B. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 493: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). cytochrome P450 enzyme cytochrome P450 enzyme methyl-β-cyclodextrin. We report here the results of a broad analysis of these two enzymes employing both comparative in vitro characterization of the three P450 enzymes and cellular analysis of their expression. This analysis included determination of the absolute stereochemistry of cholesterol hydroxylation by the three enzymes. Our results clarify the differential phenotype when grown on cholesterol of the H37Rv and CDC1551 Δcyp125A1 strains and highlight the basis for the strain differences that are relevant to the targeting of cholesterol degradation as a therapeutic target. All solvents and reagents were of the highest purity commercially available unless noted otherwise. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin, glucose 6-phosphate, Tween 20, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), ferredoxin (Spinacea oleracea), ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (S. oleracea), cholesterol oxidase (Streptomyces sp.), cholesterol, cholest-4-en-3-one, ergosterol, and tyloxapol were purchased from Sigma. (25R)-26-Hydroxycholesterol and (25S)-26-hydroxycholesterol were purchased from Research Plus (Barnegat, NJ). Cholest-4-en-3-one-(25S)-carboxylic acid was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Polyclonal antibodies to purified M. tuberculosis CYP124A1, CYP125A1, and CYP142A1 were raised in rabbits (Pacific Immunology, Ramona, CA). The CYP124A1, CYP125A1, and CYP142A1 enzymes from M. tuberculosis H37Rv were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified as described previously (21Johnston J.B. Kells P.M. Podust L.M.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The protein preparations used in this study exhibited typical P450 CO-deoxy difference spectrum (data not shown). For CYP125A1 only, a small amount (20%) of P420 was observed. The concentration of P450 for the three enzymes was determined from difference spectra using the extinction coefficient e450–490 = 91,000 mm−1 cm−1 (25Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total heme b content was quantified by the pyridine hemochrome method (26Appleby C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All ligand binding assays were performed by spectrophotometric titration in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm EDTA using a Cary UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer (Varian). Steroid stock solutions were first prepared at a concentration of 5 mm in warmed 10% (w/v) methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) dissolved in water, sonicated for 10 min, and finally diluted at 0.5 or 1.0 mm in 2% MβCD. To account for the absorbance of the tested compounds, 1 ml of protein (1.0 μm) in buffer was placed in the first chamber of two split cuvettes, and 1 ml of buffer was placed in the second chamber. After background scanning, equal volumes (0.5–1.0 μl) of ligand solution were titrated into both the second chamber of the reference cuvette containing only buffer and the first chamber containing the protein. The same volume of 2% MβCD was added into the alternate chambers to correct for solvent effects. Difference spectra were recorded from 300 to 500 nm. To determine the KD values, titration data points were fitted to the quadratic equation using Kaleidagraph (Synergy). In Equation 1, Aobs is the absorption shift determined at any ligand concentration; Amax is the maximal absorption shift obtained at saturation; KD is the apparent dissociation constant for the inhibitor-enzyme complex; [Et] is the total enzyme concentration used; [S] is the ligand concentration. Aobs=Amax([[S]+[Et]+KD)−(([S]+[Et]+KD)2−(4[S][Et]))0.5)/2[Et](Eq. 1) Enzymatic activities of CYP124A1, CYP125A1, and CYP142A1 were determined as described (11Ouellet H. Guan S. Johnston J.B. Chow E.D. Kells P.M. Burlingame A.L. Cox J.S. Podust L.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 730-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), except that MβCD was included at a final concentration of 0.45% (w/v) MβCD. To identify metabolites, reaction mixtures were incubated up to 2 h. The products were extracted three times with hexanes and derivatized by resuspending the dried organic extracts in ∼70 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. The products and control reaction mixtures were analyzed by GC-MS on an Agilent HP 6850 gas chromatography system using a DB-5MS analytical column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness) equipped with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV. A 3-μl portion of each reaction was injected and subsequently separated by holding the column at 70 °C for 1 min, then increasing the temperature by 10 °C/min to 300 °C, and finally holding at 300 °C for 20 min. To determine steady-state kinetic parameters of the three P450 isoforms toward cholesterol and cholest-4-en-3-one, the reaction conditions were optimized for the formation of the respective 26-hydroxy derivatives. The reactions were terminated after 20 min by adding an equal volume of acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid containing 50 μm ergosterol as an internal standard, mixed vigorously, and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove any precipitated products. 100-μl aliquots of each reaction were analyzed using an Agilent Series 1200 HPLC system fitted with a reverse phase C8 column (Varian Polaris C8-A, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) and a diode array detector. Using an isocratic mobile phase system consisting of 30% H2O (0.1% formic acid) and 70% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, the products were monitored with a diode array detector set at 240 nm. Enzymatic reactions with cholest-4-en-3-one as the substrate were analyzed directly following quenching and centrifugation. For the detection of cholesterol-derived metabolites, an additional step was required to convert the 3-OH group to a 3-oxo-Δ4-enone structure. The UV-visible absorbance of the α,β-unsaturated ketone of cholest-4-en-3-one facilitates detection of the metabolites. The sterols were extracted three times with hexanes, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and resuspended in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.6) along with 2.5 units of cholesterol oxidase and 1 unit of catalase (bovine). In all cases, the steroid enzyme incubation mixtures were compared with control reactions, and steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting to an appropriate kinetic model (21Johnston J.B. Kells P.M. Podust L.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20687-20692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Assays were performed as described above but were instead quenched with an equal volume of 1 n HCl. The products were extracted with 2 volumes of ethyl acetate containing progesterone as an internal standard. The organic phase was collected and evaporated by flushing with argon. The dried metabolites were solubilized with acetonitrile and finally mixed with water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Each commercial 26-hydroxycholesterol diastereomer was individually converted and analyzed as its respective cholest-4-en-3-one counterpart by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with cholesterol oxidase (2.5 units) and bovine liver catalase (10 μg/ml) prior to quenching and extraction. The standards and enzymatic reactions were analyzed by HPLC with a Chiralcel-OD column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter analytical column, Chiral Technologies Europe, France) using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 15% H2O (0.1% formic acid) and 85% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Wild-type CDC1551 strain was obtained from Colorado State University. All experiments with M. tuberculosis cells were performed in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facility. The CDC1551 Δcyp125A1 mutant strain was created by homologous recombination using specialized transducing phages, as described previously (11Ouellet H. Guan S. Johnston J.B. Chow E.D. Kells P.M. Burlingame A.L. Cox J.S. Podust L.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 730-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis cells were cultured in 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% of oleic acid-albumin-dextrose complex, 0.2% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80. Hygromycin and Zeocin (50 mg/liter) were used where necessary. For growth on cholesterol, log-phase cells grown in 7H9 medium were used to inoculate a defined minimal medium (1 g/liter KH2PO4, 2.5 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter asparagine, 50 mg/liter ferric ammonium citrate, 10 mg/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 mg/liter CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/liter ZnSO4 at an initial A600 of 0.05 and 0.1 mm cholesterol. A stock solution of cholesterol (100 mm) was prepared in tyloxapol/ethanol (1:1) and warmed at 65 °C for 30 min before addition. The coding sequences of cyp124A1, cyp125A1, and cyp142A1 were amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA by using the forward and reverse primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The DNA sequences were confirmed by amplifying the coding region using PCR and then ligating into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the NdeI-XbaI digested fragments were then subcloned downstream of the constitutive hsp60 promoter into a derivative of the pMV361 vector that confers resistance to Zeocin. The three constructs were electroporated into Δcyp125A1 cells, and transformants were selected at 37 °C on 7H10 plates containing 50 mg/ml Zeocin. Western blots were carried out to detect either the native or overexpressed P450 isoforms (CYP124A1, CYP125A1, or CYP142A1) from the whole cell lysate of various M. tuberculosis strains. Cells were precultured in 7H9 medium, washed in the same medium lacking glycerol, synchronized to an A600 of 0.2, and grown for an additional 24 h in the presence of 0.1 mm cholesterol or 0.1% (v/v) glycerol. Cells (50 ml) were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 25 ml of 15% isopropyl alcohol, and kept frozen at −80 °C until used. The pellets were resuspended on ice with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm PMSF, 1.5% SDS, and cells were disrupted by bead beating. Soluble extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein concentration was determined using the micro-BCA assay (Pierce). Western blot analysis was performed according to standard protocols. Three identical membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies against CYP125A1, CYP124A1, and CYP142A1. We also stained the membranes after the immunodetection procedure to ensure equal loading in the different wells. To analyze the buildup of cholest-4-en-3-one in the various M. tuberculosis strains, cells were pre-cultured in 7H9 medium, washed in the same medium lacking glycerol, synchronized to an A600 of 0.2, and grown for an additional 36 h in the presence of 0.1 mm cholesterol. Cells (25 ml) were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 25 ml of 15% isopropyl alcohol in saline, and resuspended in saline at a similar A600 for all strains. One-milliliter samples were extracted with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (17:1) for 24 h. The lower organic phase containing apolar lipids was collected. The lipid extracts were evaporated under a stream of argon and resuspended in 1.5 ml of methanol. Tween 80 was removed from the lipid solutions by precipitation using a cobalt/thiocyanate solution and back-extraction with hexane, according to a published procedure (27Shen C.F. Hawari J. Kamen A. J. Chromatogr. B. 2004; 810: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, the lipid extracts were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and analyzed by HPLC at 240 nm as described previously (11Ouellet H. Guan S. Johnston J.B. Chow E.D. Kells P.M.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 1A, CYP124A1 displayed the spectral properties of a ferric P450 with most of the heme iron (∼70%) in a low spin state and an observable amount of high spin heme, as evidenced by a Soret band and a shoulder centered at 419 and 395 nm, respectively. In contrast, the CYP142A1 protein is more homogeneous with virtually all its heme in the low spin state (Fig. 1C). Specific binding of a substrate-like molecule to P450 enzymes typically results in a type I shift (transition from low to high spin) of the Soret band, as a result of the displacement of the water molecule coordinated to the heme iron atom (29Jefcoate C.R.

In this study, we show that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) stimulates phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2))-dependent rapid release of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and regulation of bone-related gene transcription and mineralization in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells (WT) via a mechanism involving Pdia3. Pdia3 was present in caveolae based on co-localization with lipid rafts and caveolin-1. In Pdia3-silenced (Sh-Pdia3) cells, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) failed to stimulate PKC and PGE(2) responses; in Pdia3-overexpressing cells (Ov-Pdia3), responses to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) were augmented. Downstream mediators of Pdia3, PLA(2)-activating protein (PLAA) and arachidonic acid, stimulated similar PKC activation in wild-type, Sh-Pdia3, and Ov-Pdia3 cells supporting the hypothesis that Pdia3 mediates the membrane action of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) for 9 min stimulated rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and increased expression of alkaline phosphatase, MMP-13, and osteopontin but decreased expression of osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin (mRNA and protein), and smad2. These effects were attenuated in Sh-Pdia3 cells. Sh-Pdia3 cells produced higher numbers of von Kossa-positive nodules and alizarin red-positive nodules compared with WT cells with or without 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment whereas Ov-Pdia3 did not show any mineralization. Our data suggest Pdia3 is an important initiator of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-stimulated membrane signaling pathways, which have both genomic and non genomic effects during osteoblast maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2090849482,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) plays a critical role in neuronal apoptosis. The two mammalian isoforms of the kinase, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, are inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser-21 and Ser-9, respectively. Depolarization, which is vital for neuronal survival, causes both an increase in Ser-21/9 phosphorylation and an inhibition of GSK-3α/β. However, the role of GSK-3 phosphorylation in depolarization-dependent neuron survival and the signaling pathway contributing to GSK-3 phosphorylation during depolarization remain largely unknown. Using several approaches, we showed that both isoforms of GSK-3 are important for mediating neuronal apoptosis. Nonphosphorylatable GSK-3α/β mutants (S21A/S9A) promoted apoptosis, whereas a peptide encompassing Ser-9 of GSK-3β protected neurons in a phosphorylation-dependent manner; these results indicate a critical role for Ser-21/9 phosphorylation on depolarization-dependent neuron survival. We found that Ser-21/9 phosphorylation of GSK-3 was mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) but not by Akt/PKB, PKA, or p90(RSK). CaMKII associated with and phosphorylated GSK-3α/β. Furthermore, the pro-survival effect of CaMKII was mediated by GSK-3 phosphorylation and inactivation. These findings identify a novel Ca(2+)/calmodulin/CaMKII/GSK-3 pathway that couples depolarization to neuronal survival."

For example, the lambda class of GSTs (GSTLs) have members that are selectively induced by chemical stress treatments and based on their enzyme chemistry are predicted to have roles in redox homeostasis. However, using conventional approaches these functions have yet to be determined. To address this, recombinant GSTLs from wheat and Arabidopsis were tagged with a Strep tag and after affinity-immobilization, incubated with extracts from Arabidopsis, tobacco, and wheat. Bound ligands were then recovered by solvent extraction and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). With the wheat enzyme TaGSTL1, the ligand profiles obtained with in vitro extracts from tobacco closely matched those observed after the protein had been expressed in planta, demonstrating that these associations were physiologically representative. The stress-inducible TaGSTL1 was found to selectively recognize flavonols (e.g. taxifolin; Kd = 25 nm), with this binding being dependent upon S-glutathionylation of an active site cysteine. In the case of the wheat extracts, this selectivity in ligand recognitions lead to the detection of flavonols that had not been previously described in this cereal. Subsequent in vitro assays showed that the co-binding of flavonols, such as quercetin, to the thiolated TaGSTL1 represented an intermediate step in the reduction of the respective S-glutathionylated quinone derivatives to yield free flavonols.

Skipsey M. Edwards R. Phytochemistry. 2010; 71: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In the majority of cases, the endogenous roles of these proteins are unknown. Attempts to unravel the function of GSTs using reverse genetic approaches has only rarely proved successful (2Kitamura S. Shikazono N. Tanaka A. Plant J. 2004; 37: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), with even multiple knock-outs of related genes giving negligible perturbations in metabolic or physiological phenotype (3Sappl P.G. Carroll A.J. Clifton R. Lister R. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Singh K.B. Plant J. 2009; 58: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The most plausible reason for this inability to disrupt phenotype is that at any given time, the expression of multiple GSTs with overlapping functions effectively masks the loss of function of individual members. Defining the roles for these abundant and stress responsive proteins using methods other than molecular genetics therefore represents a major challenge in functional genomics. glutathione transferase 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene dehydroascorbate dehydroascorbate reductase lambda-class glutathione transferase 4-hydroxyazobenzene-2′-carboxylic acid hydroxyethyldisulfide isothermal titration calorimetry kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside mass spectrometry quercetin-glutathione conjugate time of flight. Whereas disrupting the expression of plant GSTs normally gives no measurable perturbation in metabolite contents in planta (3Sappl P.G. Carroll A.J. Clifton R. Lister R. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Singh K.B. Plant J. 2009; 58: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), these proteins do have the ability to bind natural products with high affinity. For example, we have determined that members of the tau (U) class of GSTs bind porphyrin intermediates and fatty acids derived from bacteria and plants both in vitro and in vivo (4Dixon D.P.

Chem. 2009; 284: 21249-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whereas most of the ligands identified were substrate analogs rather than physiological binding partners, the studies did point to the potential of using advanced ligand-fishing approaches to identify physiological intermediates residing in the active sites of GSTs. Such bound entities could either represent substrates, reaction intermediates, or ligands being transported. The identification of these ligands could then provide a useful starting point for deducing the function of these proteins. To test this ligand-fishing approach, we have looked for putative substrates of lambda (L) class GSTs. These GSTLs are one of the smaller groupings within the superfamily in plants and differ from the more numerous phi and tau GSTs involved in the classical glutathionylation of xenobiotics, in possessing a catalytic cysteine in place of the usual serine residue. The presence of this active site cysteine suggests that the GSTLs must use the co-substrate glutathione (GSH) to catalyze redox reactions, rather than acting to activate the thiol for nucleophilic substitution or addition reactions as is the case with the phi and tau enzymes. Consistent with roles in redox biochemistry, GSTLs catalyze GSH-dependent thiol exchange reactions with glutathionylated mixed disulfides in vitro (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, based on the activity of other well characterized GSH-dependent thiol transferases, this activity is unlikely to reflect their roles in vivo and an alternative stress-responsive function for these proteins is suggested, with cytosolic GSTLs strongly induced in Arabidopsis, maize, and wheat in response to chemical treatments (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Theodoulou F.L. Clark I.M. He X.L. Pallett K.E. Cole D.J.

The primary GSTLs selected for ligand fishing screening in this study were the enzymes from wheat (Triticum aestivum). These TaGSTLs are of particular interest as some are strongly induced by safeners, which are a group of agrochemicals which enhance herbicide detoxification, and hence selectivity in this major crop (7Theodoulou F.L.

Biol. 2003; 52: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, the induction of the lambda GST originally termed cla30 and now renamed TaGSTL1, was among the strongest of all those differentially expressed genes determined in a subtractive library screen following treatment of wheat with the safener cloquintocet mexyl (7Theodoulou F.L. Clark I.M. He X.L. Pallett K.E. Cole D.J. Hallahan D.L. Pesticide Man. Sci. 2003; 59: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To identify the functions of these stress-inducible wheat proteins, the strategy adopted in the current study has been to clone and express affinity-tagged TaGSTLs, then immobilize the proteins and look for retained ligands after incubation with plant (tobacco, wheat) extracts. For comparison we have also utilized AtGSTLs, the homologous proteins previously identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), In each case, the ligands retained by these GSTLs have been identified by high resolution mass spectrometry, with compounds whose binding is dependent on the presence of GSH, being of particular interest. The cDNA sequence of TaGSTL1 was available from previous studies (7Theodoulou F.L. Clark I.M. He X.L. Pallett K.E. Cole D.J. Hallahan D.L. Pesticide Man. Sci. 2003; 59: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Full-length coding sequences for the other family members, TaGSTL2 and TaGSTL3, were deduced from assembled ESTs. In each case, the GSTLs were PCR-amplified from a wheat (cv. Hunter) seedling cDNA library (9Cummins I. O'Hagan D. Jablonkai I. Cole D.J. Hehn A. Werck-Reichhart D. Edwards R. Plant Mol.

Products were cloned after restriction enzyme digestion into the bacterial expression vector pET-STRP3 (10Dixon D.P. Hawkins T. Hussey P.J. Edwards R. J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Cloned Arabidopsis AtGSTLs were available from previous studies (10Dixon D.P. Hawkins T. Hussey P.J. Edwards R. J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In each case, the recombinant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli strain Tuner(DE3) pRARE and purified as described (10Dixon D.P. Hawkins T. Hussey P.J. Edwards R. J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of TaGSTL1, to replace each of it's component three cysteines (Cys-38, Cys-41, and Cys-53) with serine residues, was performed using overlap extension PCR with KOD DNA polymerase (Merck Chemicals Ltd., Nottingham, UK) and suitable oligonucleotides. For plant expression, sequences were subcloned into the BIN-STRP3 vector (10Dixon D.P. Hawkins T. Hussey P.J. Edwards R. J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). GST activity toward xenobiotics was determined with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate. The GSH-dependent redox activities of the GSTs were determined by assaying the reduction of dehydroascorbate and thiol transferase activity (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The reduction of S-glutathionyl-quercetin was determined in 0.1 m KPO4 pH 6.5 containing 5 mm DTT, using 16 μm substrate (from stock solution in sodium citrate, pH 3.5). The reaction was monitored by following the increase in A380 due to quercetin formation (using ϵ380 = 17.4 mm−1·cm−1). Similar assays were used to test for modification of 2′-S-glutathionyl-rutin, except that reaction products were analyzed by LC-MS. Recombinant Strep-tagged GSTLs were first immobilized on 1 ml of Strep-tactin Sepharose columns (Stratech Scientific Ltd., Soham, UK). Plant tissue was homogenized in 5 (v/w) 60% methanol and extracted at 20 °C for 30 min prior to clarification by filtration and centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The extract was then dried under vacuum. The resulting powder was re-suspended in HBS (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 1 g of original tissue ml−1, with a small amount of avidin added to complex any biotin present. The clarified extract was then either used directly, or after the addition of either 5 mm DTT, or 1 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and 5 ml loaded onto the GSTL-affinity column. After washing, the GSTLs and associated ligands were eluted as described (5Dixon D.P. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21249-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For the in vivo capture of ligands, the Strep-tagged enzymes were transiently expressed in unwounded Nicotiana benthamiana leaves prior to affinity recovery and analysis (5Dixon D.P. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21249-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Extracts containing recovered protein and bound ligands were concentrated to 50 μl using a Vivaspin 2 centrifugal concentrator (Sartorius Stedim, Epsom, UK). Protein was precipitated by centrifugation after the addition of 2 vol of methanol, with the supernatant analyzed by HPLC-MS, and the pellet dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid prior to MS (5Dixon D.P. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21249-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, ligand mixtures were resolved by reversed phase HPLC, with the eluate analyzed by photodiode array detection and electrospray mass spectrometry in series. For ions of interest, accurate mass and relative isotope abundance data were used to generate candidate molecular formulae. Subsequent MS/MS analyses and comparison with previously identified plant products enabled tentative identifications to be made that, where possible, were confirmed using authentic standards. The binding affinity of TaGSTL1 for chosen ligands was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in HBS buffer using a Microcal VP-ITC instrument (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Amersham Biosciences, UK). In each case, 100 μm ligand was titrated into 10 μm TaGSTL1 at 25 °C. Ligand concentrations were determined gravimetrically, while TaGSTL1 concentration was calculated from its absorbance at 280 nm. Where additives (GSH, DTT, GSSG) were used, these were added to both protein and ligand. Thermal data for each injection peak were integrated and fitted to a one binding site model using the supplied Origin software. Quercetin (in ethanol) and aqueous GSH were slowly mixed to final concentrations of 500 μm and 625 μm, respectively, in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 625 μm H2O2 and 1 μm horse radish peroxidase (HRP). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5–10 min until no further loss of yellow coloration was observed and the mixture applied to a Strata-X reversed phase SPE cartridge (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK). After washing with water, the conjugate was eluted with 25% methanol, concentrated by lyophilization and purified by semi-preparative reversed-phase C18 chromatography. Rutin and taxifolin conjugates were prepared essentially similarly, with the SPE purification step omitted. Purified compounds were analyzed by 1H NMR immediately after dissolution in D2O buffered either with 20 mm KPO4 pD 7.0 or sodium citrate pD 3.5 on a Varian VNMRS-700, with resonances reported relative to HDO at 4.75 ppm. Using the sequence of TaGSTL1 = Cla30 (7Theodoulou F.L. Clark I.M. He X.L. Pallett K.E. Cole D.J. Hallahan D.L. Pesticide Man. Sci. 2003; 59: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) for homology searching, over 100 related sequences were identified in the full-length and EST datasets derived from Triticum species. The sequences clustered into 5 distinct clades, based on phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequences. For each clade, ESTs were assembled to form the full-length contigs TaGSTL1 (clade 1, EBI accession Y17386), TaGSTL2 (clade 2, ESTs CJ684065, and CJ583943), TaGSTL3 (clade 3, CJ808737, CJ660389, CJ657451, CJ808410, and CJ552837) and TaGSTL4 (clade 4, CA502651 and CA486301). Clade 5 sequences were also identified, as exemplified by EST CA485755, but lacked sufficient sequence conservation for further cloning. The full-length contigs were PCR-amplified from wheat seedling cDNA. Products were obtained for TaGSTs L1, L2 and L3, but not for clade 4. In the case of TaGSTL2, the cDNA was recovered without the putative N-terminal chloroplast targeting sequence identified in the respective ESTs. TaGSTs L1, L2, and L3 were then cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-STRP3 to generate N-terminal Strep II tag fusions (10Dixon D.P. Hawkins T. Hussey P.J. Edwards R. J. Exp. Bot. 2009; 60: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). On sequencing (supplemental information), TaGSTL1 was found to be identical to Cla30 (7Theodoulou F.L. Clark I.M. He X.L. Pallett K.E. Cole D.J. Hallahan D.L. Pesticide Man. Sci. 2003; 59: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), while TaGSTL2 was essentially identical to EBI accession CJ718665, albeit missing five N-terminal alanine residues due to mispriming with an oligonucleotide designed to amplify a closely related sequence. TaGSTL3 was identical to EST CJ808410 (C terminus from CJ552837). Each GSTL was expressed in E. coli as described (5Dixon D.P. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21249-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and purified. In the absence of known in vivo activities for GSTLs, potential side activities were assayed to help characterize the enzymes. In particular, GSTLs from Arabidopsis have previously been shown to possess thiol transferase activity (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition, the dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) class of GSTs also contains an active site cysteinyl residue (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine if the GSTLs also showed DHAR activity. Enzyme assays (Table 1) showed that all three native wheat enzymes were active as thiol transferases, confirming that these GSTLs can catalyze redox reactions. In contrast, only TaGSTL1 showed appreciable activity as a DHAR, suggesting that this was not the in vivo activity for GSTLs. Studies with the Arabidopsis GSTLs had identified the importance of an active site cysteine in the thioltransferase activity (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Similarly, TaGSTL1 activities both as a thioltransferase and DHAR were abolished on the mutagenesis of the presumed active site cysteinyl residue to generate the C41S substitution (Table 1). Mutation of either of the two other cysteine residues present in the TaGSTL1 sequence did not abolish these activities. Uniquely, the C41S mutant possessed low but measurable glutathione transferase activity toward CDNB, an activity associated with phi and tau GSTs containing a serine active site residue, confirming the critical importance of this residue in determining enzyme function.TABLE 1Enzyme activities of TaGSTLs as thiol transferases towards HED, as glutathione transferases towards CDNB and as DHARActivity towards substratenkat/mgnkat/mgnkat/mgEnzymeHEDCDNBDHARTaGSTL1337 ± 9<217.3 ± 2.2TaGSTL228 ± 1<2<0.5TaGSTL3106 ± 2<2<0.5TaGSTL1 C38S449 ± 8<260.4 ± 1.4TaGSTL1 C41S<57.5 ± 0.5<0.5TaGSTL1 C53S322 ± 9<25.6 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab In each case, the MS-measured masses of purified TaGSTLs were as predicted from their coding sequences, except that each showed a varying degree of +305 Da modification. This addition was symptomatic of mixed disulfide formation with glutathione and termed thiolation (6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Whereas the majority of TaGSTL1 ionized as a mono-glutathionylated species, TaGSTs L2 and L3 showed near quantitative thiolation. This modification was reversed following treatment with 10 mm DTT in all cases. The availability of the Cys-Ser mutants of TaGSTL1 allowed for the dissection of the site of disulfide formation. Whereas both the C38S and C53S mutants showed a reduction in glutathionylation, mixed disulfide formation was only abolished in the case of the C41S substitution. The Cys-41 residue of TaGSTL1 was therefore the primary site of glutathionylation and the reactive catalytic residue in TaGSTL1. In previous studies (5Dixon D.P. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21249-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Strep-tagged GSTs were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves and bound ligands then identified by HPLC-MS after extracting the affinity-purified fusion proteins. This method (in vivo ligand fishing) worked well but was relatively laborious and was limited to species such as N. benthamiana that allowed straightforward transient expression of recombinant proteins. To study the interaction between wheat GSTLs and their endogenous ligands a second, in vitro, method was therefore developed. Bacterially expressed GSTLs were immobilized on a Strep-tactin column and subsequently exposed to metabolite extracts from the plant species of interest. After allowing any ligands present to bind to the immobilized protein, the affinity-eluted protein-ligand samples were then analyzed as detailed for the in vivo method. To look for GSTL ligands, both in vivo and in vitro ligand fishing methods were used, and their results subsequently compared. TaGSTL1 and its point mutants C38S and C41S were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana and affinity purified. Additionally, E. coli-expressed TaGSTL1 and TaGSTL1-C41S were immobilized on the Strep-tactin matrix and challenged with a metabolite extract from N. benthamiana to allow direct comparison with the in vivo experiment. When the bound ligands from the in vivo expression experiments were analyzed by HPLC-MS, the control extraction gave a very clean profile (Fig. 1A). TaGSTL1 extracts contained 5 UV absorbing peaks (1, 2, 3, 6, and 8) not observed in the controls, with the same subset of ligands also found in the TaGSTL-C38S mutant. In contrast, the TaGSTL-C41S mutant bound a simpler set of compounds with peak 7 being the only major ligand retained. This peak was subsequently identified as an artifact corresponding to the reagent HABA (4-hydroxyazobenzene-2′-carboxylic acid), which was used in the regeneration of the affinity columns. In all cases the yields of GSTL proteins were similar (Fig. 1, inset). Similar ligand profiles were obtained when the same proteins were exposed to the plant extracts in vitro (Fig. 1B), with some additional peaks observed (4 and 5) because of a higher overall sensitivity. Again, TaGSTL1 gave a much more complex profile than TaGSTL1-C41S. The ligands present in the samples derived from both methods were then further analyzed by tandem MS which, coupled with UV spectral and accurate mass information allowed the compounds of interest to be tentatively identified (Table 2 and Fig. 2, supplemental Fig. S1). The compounds which were selectively retained by TaGSTL1, but not by TaGSTL1-C41S, notably peaks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, were of particular interest. These were all identified as flavonoids derived from kaempferol or quercetin. In the case of rutin (1), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (2), and taxifolin (3) the identities of these metabolites were confirmed by comparison with authentic standards.TABLE 2Identification of metabolites isolated from TaGSTL1 binding experimentsCompoundm/z (MH+)Identification1611.159Rutin (= quercetin 3-O-rutinoside)2595.161Kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside3305.063Taxifolin (= dihydroquercetin)4289.077Dihydrokaempferol5584.275Tricoumaroylspermidine?6301.083Isokaempferide7243.080HABA (column regenerant)8315.089Kaempferol dimethylether9625.176Quercetin methylether-O-rutinoside10565.117Unknown11639.204Unknown12569.201Unknown13616.291GSH + C18H28O4 (oxylipin conjugate)14618.307GSH + C18H30O4 (oxylipin conjugate)15600.290GSH + C18H28O3 (oxylipin conjugate)16355.101Chlorogenic acid17463.123Kaempferol methylether-O-hexoside Open table in a new tab The results obtained with the wild type and mutant enzymes demonstrated that Cys-41 of TaGSTL1 was critical for ligand binding. Because this residue was also the site of S-glutathionylation, the relationship between mixed disulfide formation and flavonoid binding was investigated. Binding studies with plant extracts were performed with TaGSTL1 that had been pretreated with either DTT (Cys-41 unmodified), or GSSG (Cys-41 glutathionylated). In each case, MS was used to confirm that the GST was modified as expected. The immobilized GSTLs were exposed to the plant extracts and bound ligands were identified by HPLC-MS. These plant extracts were obtained from plants treated with chemicals known to induce the expression of GSTLs to maximize the likelihood of identifying physiologically relevant ligands, based on the known strong induction of GSTLs under these conditions. Thus, extracts from safener-treated wheat shoots (7Theodoulou F.L. Clark I.M. He X.L. Pallett K.E. Cole D.J. Hallahan D.L. Pesticide Man. Sci. 2003; 59: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis plants sprayed with AgNO3 (public microarray data) were tested. These studies revealed that extracts from different plant species gave very different results, but in all cases glutathionylated TaGSTL1 bound more chromophores than the fully reduced enzyme (Fig. 3). This result was clearly seen with N. benthamiana extracts where TaGSTL1, which had been pretreated with DTT bound hardly any metabolites compared with the high yields of ligands recovered with the GSSG-treated protein. With the wheat extracts, which are most likely to contain the physiological substrates/ligands for TaGSTL1, both DTT- and GSSG-treated enzymes bound a series of metabolites that were tentatively identified as tricin-derived flanonolignans (11Bouaziz M. Veitch N.C. Grayer R.J. Simmonds M.S. Damak M. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, these compounds were not considered to be specific GSTL ligands as similar binding was observed with the unrelated GSTs AtGSTF2, AtGSTF6, and AtGSTU19 (data not shown). In contrast, GSSG-treated TaGSTL1, but not the DTT-treated protein, selectively retained a more polar group of compounds with properties consistent with them being glycosylated flavonoids. Some of the compounds identified matched those previously identified in N. benthamiana, notably peaks 1 and 2 (rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside). Novel peaks included the flavonoid peak 9 and unknown compounds 10, 11, and 12 (Table 2). This result was surprising, as rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside have not been previously described as natural products in wheat. The possibility of contamination from N. benthamiana extracts was considered, but dismissed as these compounds could be reproducibly isolated from wheat extracts and in each case the profile differed from that obtained with tobacco in lacking peak 8 which was characteristically present in N. benthamiana extracts (Table 2). In experiments with Arabidopsis extracts these compounds were not observed. Instead low levels of ligands were seen, with little differential binding seen with reduced versus glutathionylated TaGSTL1. Interestingly, some compounds were retained only by DTT-reduced TaGSTL1. In wheat extracts these included compounds 13, 14, and 15 (Table 2), which were all GSH conjugates of oxylipins, with peak 15 also selectively retained by DTT-reduced TaGSTL1 in N. benthamiana extracts. Having determined GSH-dependent binding of flavonoids with TaGSTL1, it was then of interest to determine if other GSTLs were similarly selective. The other wheat and Arabidopsis GSTLs were incubated with extracts from N. benthamiana and the presence of ligands determined under c"

Electron microscopy (EM) previously allowed a low resolution assignment of most orf products belonging to these regions. We report here the structure of the SPP1 distal tail protein (Dit, gp19.1). The combination of x-ray crystallography, EM, and light scattering established that Dit is a back-to-back dimer of hexamers. However, Dit fitting in the virion EM maps was only possible with a hexamer located between the tail-tube and the tail-tip. Structure comparison revealed high similarity between Dit and a central component of lactophage baseplates. Sequence similarity search expanded its relatedness to several phage proteins, suggesting that Dit is a docking platform for the tail adsorption apparatus in Siphoviridae infecting Gram-positive bacteria and that its architecture is a paradigm for these hub proteins. Dit structural similarity extends also to non-contractile and contractile phage tail proteins (gpVN and XkdM) as well as to components of the bacterial type 6 secretion system, supporting an evolutionary connection between all these devices.

More than 95% of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages) belong to the Caudovirales order, i.e. phages with a tail. Their vast majority is Siphoviridae, characterized by the presence of a long non-contractile tail. The assembly pathway of this structure essential for infection was genetically dissected for Escherichia coli phage λ (1Katsura I. J. Mol.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tail assembly remain poorly understood. Despite the diverse infection mechanisms displayed by Siphoviridae, using surface proteins and/or cell-wall saccharides as receptors, their tail architecture is rather conserved. It is characterized by a long non-contractile tube, assembled by stacking several tens of homo-hexameric major tail protein (MTP) 2The abbreviations used are: MTPmajor tail proteinTMPtape measure proteinT6SStype 6 secretion systemMALSmultiangle static light scatteringQELSquasielastic light scatteringPDBProtein data bank. rings, and a central core formed by a few copies of the tape measure protein (TMP) extending between both tail extremities and determining its length. At the proximal tail end (near the capsid), the homo-hexameric terminator that stops tube elongation during assembly is found, whereas the distal tail end (opposite to the capsid) is characterized by the presence of the tail adsorption apparatus. In phages of Gram-positive bacteria this structure is composed of the distal tail protein (Dit), the tail fiber, and eventually ancillary proteins, all forming the baseplate (4Mc Grath S. Neve H.

Several tail components of the Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 show significant sequence similarity to equivalent proteins from lactococcal phages Tuc2009 and TP901-1. This is the case for the TMP (gp18), Dit (gp19.1), and tail-spike (gp21). However, these two lactococcal phages possess a large and bulky baseplate of 1 to 2 MDa anchored at the end of the tail-tube (3Vegge C.S. Brøndsted L. Neve H. Mc Grath S. van Sinderen D.

The precise location of the different SPP1 tail and tail-tip proteins as well as their structures and interactions remain poorly understood.

Based on structure and sequence comparisons between several Gram-positive infecting Siphoviridae, we suggest that the presence of Dit-like structures is a conserved feature in such phages, acting as a hub between the tail and the tail-tip/baseplate. Finally, a striking structural similarity was found between SPP1 Dit and Siphoviridae/Myoviridae tail components as well as with components of the bacterial type 6 secretion system (T6SS) providing additional evidence for a common origin between phage tails and T6SS. orf19.1 of B. subtilis phage SPP1 (NC_004166.2) was cloned into the pETG-20A expression vector according to standard GatewayTM protocols. The final construct encoded a N-terminal thioredoxin fusion followed by a hexahistidine tag and a TEV protease cleavage site before the gene of interest. The resulting plasmid was used to transform the E. coli T7 Express Iq pLysS strain (New England Biolabs). Cells were grown in Terrific Broth at 37 °C until the optical density reached 0.5 and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside overnight at 25 °C. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared following standard procedures in M9 minimal medium through blocking of the methionine biosynthesis pathway and with an induction temperature of 25 °C (11Doublié S.

Briefly, after cell harvesting, lysis was achieved by adding 0.25 mg/ml of lysozyme, followed by a freezing/thawing cycle and sonication. Soluble proteins were separated from inclusion bodies and cell debris by a 30-min centrifugation step at 20,000 × g. We used an ÄKTA FPLC system to achieve four steps: a Ni2+-affinity chromatography (5-ml HisTrap, GE Healthcare) with a step gradient of 250 mm imidazole, an overnight TEV protease digestion at 4 °C using a 1:10 (w/w) protease:target ratio, a second Ni2+-affinity step (to remove the His-tagged TEV and digested peptides), and a preparative Superdex 200 HR 26/60 gel filtration run in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Orf19.1 was then concentrated up to 6–8 mg/ml. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out on an Alliance 2695 HPLC system (Waters) using a KW804 column (Shodex) run in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl at 0.5 ml/min.

Open table in a new tab 3 μl of freshly prepared protein at ∼10 μg/ml was applied on a 400-mesh glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid. Excess Dit solution was blotted and 4 μl of 1% uranyl acetate was applied twice on the grid and incubated for 1 min. Grids were then dried and kept in a desiccator cabinet until use. The grids were observed under low-dose conditions with a Jeol 2200FS transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Images were recorded at ×50,000 magnification and digitized using a Nikon coolscan 9000 ED with a step size of 10 μm. Individual particles (10,875) were extracted semiautomatically from 8 micrographs with Boxer (34Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct.

Briefly, an initial model was computed using a C1 start-up procedure, included in the ANGular-REConstitution program, followed by three iterative cycles of image alignment, class averaging, and three-dimensional reconstruction. The resolution of the final reconstruction including 9,027 particles was estimated at 21.5 Å using the Fourier shell correlation criterion with a cutting level of 0.5 (36Harauz G. van Heel M.

SPP1 Dit was overproduced and purified to homogeneity yielding 60 mg of purified protein per liter of culture.

The Dit measured mass and hydrodynamic radius were 325,629 ± 500 Da (supplemental Fig. S1) and 6.7 ± 0.4 nm, respectively, establishing the dodecameric nature of Dit in solution (theoretical monomer mass: 28,489 Da). The asymmetric unit of Dit crystals contains three monomers. The final model was refined at 2.95-Å resolution resulting in Rwork and Rfree values of 20.0 and 23.6%, respectively (Table 1). Applying crystallographic symmetry operators results in the completion of two hexameric rings stacked back-to-back with 12 protruding domains located at the periphery (Fig. 1, A–C). The two rings are rotated relative to each other by 10°. The crystal packing is formed by piles of dodecamers aligned along their channel axis (unit cell a axis) and contacting each other through the tip of the 2 × 6 protruding domains on both faces. Each pile laterally contacts 6 neighboring piles, shifted by translation of one hexamer, via the protruding domain sides. The dodecamer central core is a 75-Å high and 80-Å wide hollow cylinder made of a double ring (excluding the protruding domains). Taking into account the 12 protruding domains, radiating from the core rings, results in Dit overall dimensions of 105 Å (height) and 140 Å (diameter). The circular-shaped core harbors a ∼40-Å wide central channel whose inner surface is mainly covered by acidic residues and displays hence a strong negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). This feature facilitates DNA traffic into the host cytoplasm during infection and prevents interactions with the channel wall. A similar negatively charged conduit is observed in the SPP1 head-to-tail connector channel (37Lhuillier S. Gallopin M. Gilquin B. Brasilès S. Lancelot N. Letellier G. Gilles M. Dethan G. Orlova E.V. Couprie J. Tavares P. Zinn-Justin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8507-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as in the phage λ tail-terminator channel (6Pell L.G. Liu A. Edmonds L. Donaldson L.W. Howell P.L. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 938-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The interface buried surface area between two neighboring monomers within a Dit hexameric ring is ∼1,300 Å2 per monomer (∼10% of the monomer surface). A total surface of ∼16,000 Å2 thus ensures the cohesion of one hexamer. The interaction between the two hexameric rings of a dodecamer is mediated by a smaller buried surface area (∼5700 Å2). Each monomer was built in the electron density between residues 9 and 253, the C-terminal amino acid. The N terminus is situated at the periphery of the cylinder. Some blobs of extra density account for the presence of the first 8 residues but their discontinuity precludes further modeling. In contrast, the C terminus is well ordered due to interactions of its negatively charged carboxyl-terminal group with the Arg60 guanidinium moiety from the same monomer and the Asn85 amide nitrogen from a neighboring monomer. Each Dit monomer can be divided in two domains corresponding to the N- and C-terminal parts of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 1, E–H). The N-domain (residues 9 to 135) is well defined in the electron density map and is composed of two layers comprising 8 β-strands organized in two β-sheets, a β-hairpin, and an α-helix (Fig. 1, E–G). The layer forming the wall of the central channel is folded as a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, constituted by strands 2, 5, 8, and 7b, from which extends a β-hairpin, termed the belt, encompassing strands 3 and 4 (residues 32 to 55). The belt projects toward the N-domain of a neighboring monomer and interacts with its four-stranded β-sheet ensuring the strength of the hexamer association (Fig. 1C). The outward layer forms the external wall of the cylinder and contains an α-helix (h1) and a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet made of strands 1, 6, and 7a (Fig. 1, E–G). The Dit C-domain (residues 136 to 253) protrudes out of the cylinder core and mediates all the crystal contacts. The C-domain folds as a nine-stranded β-sandwich organized in two β-sheets and an additional extended stretch (Fig. 1, E, F, and H). The domain starts at residue 136 with β-strand 1, belonging to a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that includes also strands 9, 3, 6, and 7. Strand 2 initiates a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet formed with strands 8, 4, and 5. An elongated segment (7b) links strands 7 and 8. A preliminary EM reconstruction, from negatively stained Dit, resulted in a convincing dodecameric structure constituted by two identical hexameric rings in the absence of any enforced symmetry. As the single particle three-dimensional reconstruction converged to a structure with a clear 6-fold dihedral symmetry (D6), we imposed this symmetry to improve its quality. The resulting structure is a thick-wall hollow cylinder delimiting a central channel. Six identical globular domains protrude regularly outwards from each of the two back-to-back hexameric rings (Fig. 2). The 6-fold symmetry operator coincides with the channel axis. The overall dimensions and shape of our Dit EM reconstruction (at 21-Å resolution) are in good agreement with those observed in the crystal structure. Indeed, correlation coefficient values of 82.3 and 69.2% were obtained in fitting the dodecameric Dit structure into the EM map with COLACOR and VEDA, respectively, revealing a similar architecture for the isolated molecule. Noteworthy, the poor quality of the map in the protruding domain regions is likely due to their flexibility. A DALI search (38Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) with the Dit monomer resulted in a striking structural similarity with ORF15 (PDB code 2WZP, Z = 13.6, Fig. 3, A and B), a component of the phage p2 baseplate (7Sciara G. Bebeacua C. Bron P. Tremblay D. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Lichière J. van Heel M. Campanacci V. Moineau S. Cambillau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2010; 172: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ORF15 is composed of a N-terminal domain (residues 1–120), whose hexamer forms a channel, with two layers of β-sheets and an α-helix associated with the external one. The ORF15 hexamer is very similar to the SPP1 Dit one (Fig. 3, C and D) and is also maintained by six belt extensions. The ORF15 C-terminal domain (121–298) is a β-sandwich resembling remotely galectin, as is the case of the SPP1 Dit C-domain (Z = 5.9 with PDB code 2YV8). Phage p2 ORF15 galectin domain exhibits, however, a long insertion of ∼60 residues, termed the arm, attaching ORF18 (the receptor-binding protein, RBP) to the central core of the baseplate. This feature is absent in SPP1 Dit because it does not serve to assemble peripheral elements of a baseplate. Reconstructions of the SPP1 tail, cap and tail-tip, before and after DNA ejection, were previously obtained using contrast EM (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The tail-tube was observed to be formed by stacked hexameric MTP rings and to contact the density volume termed cap at its distal extremity. It was proposed that the cap is formed by the TMP C-terminal domain. Progressing toward the tail-tip, a globular density, located between the cap and the terminal density, was assigned to a putative gp19.1 trimer. However, neither the Dit structures (x-ray or EM) nor its mass corroborate this assignment. Fitting the Dit dodecamer into the cap density envelope provides a significantly better match for one hexamer (located in the middle part of the cap density), whereas most of the second one is outside the EM density (Fig. 4, A and B). A computational fitting of one Dit hexameric ring in the cap before DNA ejection, using COLORES, results in positioning it either into the last ring assigned to MTP and the upper cap density (Fig. 4, C and D) or in the middle part of the cap with an opposite orientation (as the proximal ring in the dodecameric fitting case, Fig. 4G). In the cap after DNA ejection, only the former solution was obtained (Fig. 4, E and F). We decided to perform thorough fitting experiments, using COLACOR and VEDA, to help assign the Dit orientation. Our results did not allow to unambigously distinguish which of the two orientations is correct because in both cases the Dit central ring and the six protruding domains are accommodated into the cap density before and after DNA ejection (Fig. 4, C–H, and supplemental Table S1). We thus believe that in the SPP1 virion, Dit might consist of a single hexamer positioned in the cap region in either of the two proposed orientations. We thus suspect that the observation of a dodecameric Dit in solution and in the crystal is an artifact that might result from the absence of its partners when expressed alone in E. coli. The above Dit assignment is in agreement with the observation of a ∼40-Å wide channel at the center of the protein, which matches the inner diameter of the tail-tube in the virion EM map after DNA ejection (42 Å) (10Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. São-José C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We also observed that the electrostatic character of the continuous channel forming the DNA ejection pathway is conserved: most components (head-to-tail connector, tail terminator, and Dit) display a negatively charged surface in the tunnel. We expect that this property could also be observed in the tail-tube interior because the MTP of phage SPP1 has an acidic pI. Finally, we demonstrated that Dit remains associated to the tail after SPP1 DNA ejection that leads to loss of the tail-spike (10Plisson C. White H.E. Au"
https://openalex.org/W2010397514,"Podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells on the visceral side of the glomerulus. Their interdigitating primary and secondary foot processes contain an actin based contractile apparatus that can adjust to changes in the glomerular perfusion pressure. Thus, the dynamic regulation of actin bundles in the foot processes is critical for maintenance of a well functioning glomerular filtration barrier. Since the actin binding protein, cofilin-1, plays a significant role in the regulation of actin dynamics, we examined its role in podocytes to determine the impact of cofilin-1 dysfunction on glomerular filtration.We evaluated zebrafish pronephros function by dextran clearance and structure by TEM in cofilin-1 morphant and mutant zebrafish and we found that cofilin-1 deficiency led to foot process effacement and proteinuria. In vitro studies in murine and human podocytes revealed that PMA stimulation induced activation of cofilin-1, whereas treatment with TGF-β resulted in cofilin-1 inactivation. Silencing of cofilin-1 led to an accumulation of F-actin fibers and significantly decreased podocyte migration ability. When we analyzed normal and diseased murine and human glomerular tissues to determine cofilin-1 localization and activity in podocytes, we found that in normal kidney tissues unphosphorylated, active cofilin-1 was distributed throughout the cell. However, in glomerular diseases that affect podocytes, cofilin-1 was inactivated by phosphorylation and observed in the nucleus.Based on these in vitro and in vivo studies we concluded cofilin-1 is an essential regulator for actin filament recycling that is required for the dynamic nature of podocyte foot processes. Therefore, we describe a novel pathomechanism of proteinuria development."

We observed that hypoxia-induced erythropoietin expression in Senp1−/− embryos was much lower than that in Senp1 wild-type, indicating that SENP1 is essential for hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling (6Cheng J.

However, it is unknown how SENP1 activation and hypoxia signaling are coordinated in the cellular response to hypoxia. In this study, we report that hypoxia can induce SENP1 transcription and identify a positive feedback loop in which SENP1 regulates hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling. We have also demonstrated that SENP1 plays an essential role in HIF-1α-driven VEGF production and angiogenesis in endothelial cells. We purchased primary human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) from ATCC. The retrovirus containing SENP1 siRNA or nonspecific siRNA, which were described previously (6Cheng J. Kang X. Zhang S. Yeh E.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), infected HUVECs to generate si-SENP1-transfected HUVEC cells (si-SENP1-HUVECs) or nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells (si-NS-HUVECs) after puromycin selection. The si-SENP1-HUVEC cells were transfected with a SENP1 siRNA-resistant mutant (SENP1m with a mutation in the DNA sequence and with a wild-type in protein sequence) to generate si-SENP1+SENP1m-HUVEC cells. All HUVECs were grown in a complete endothelial cell medium (ScienCell). For starvation, HUVECs were cultured in basal medium without serum and endothelial cell growth supplement. Hypoxic treatment (1% O2) was performed in a specially designed hypoxia incubator (Thermo Electron, Forma Therapeutics) and generated by flushing a mixture of air and N2 plus 5% CO2. Each well of prechilled 24-well plates was coated with 100 μl/well of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 4 × 104 HUVECs in 0.5-ml medium were seeded onto the solidified gel. After incubation for 16 h, the endothelial tubes were assessed with a photomicroscope. We performed HUVEC sprouting beads assay as described in Nehls et al. (30Nehls V. Drenckhahn D. Microvasc Res. 1995; 50: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, microcarrier beads coated with denatured collagen (Cytodex 3, Sigma) were seeded with HUVECs and embedded in fibrin gels in 96-well plates. For preparation of fibrin gels, bovine fibrinogen (Sigma) was dissolved in endothelial cell medium at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Aprotinin was added at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml, and the solution was passed through a 0.22-μm filter. Then, the fibrinogen solutions were transferred to 96-well plates together with HUVEC-coated beads at a density of 50 beads/well. Clotting was induced by the addition of thrombin (1.2 units/ml). After clotting was complete, gels were equilibrated with medium at 37 °C with or without VEGF supplement. Photographs were taken after 3 days of incubation. The potential Senp1 promoter (−859 to +141) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of NIH3T3 cells, subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega). The hypoxia response element (HRE) sites were mutated by using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primer pairs: HRE1 (−498), 5′-CCTGTGATCAGTCAAGAATGTCAAGCGTGACAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTGTCACGCTTGACATTCTTGACTGATCACAGG-3′ (reverse); HRE2 (−489), 5′-GTCAAGCGTGTCAAGAATGACAAGATGCACAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGTGCATCTTGTCATTCTTGACACGCTTGAC-3′ (reverse). We performed ChIP by using the Upstate ChIP assay kit (Millipore) and followed the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were first incubated with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then pelleted and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Cell lysates were sonicated with a Sonicator ultrasonic processor (Misonix, Inc.) until the DNA was cleaved into 500–1000 bp in size. The extracts were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-human HIF-1α monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) and normal preimmune mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PCR primers were used for amplification of the HRE segment of the SENP1 promoter (5′-GACGTTCCTTAGTGCTGGCGGGTAGGTTTGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCACCAAGTTTGTGGAGCTGAGAACGGG-3′ (reverse)). Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). Complementary DNA was synthesized using the cDNA synthesis kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence real-time RT-PCR was performed with the double-stranded DNA dye SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents (PE Biosystems, Warrington, UK) using the ABI PRISM 7300 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR was done in triplicate, and S.D. representing experimental errors were calculated. All data were analyzed by ABI PRISM SDS software (version 2.0, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). This software, which is coupled to the instrument, allows the determination of the threshold cycle (Ct) that represents the number of the cycle where the fluorescence intensity is significantly above the background fluorescence intensity. Pairs of PCR primers used to amplification of the target genes were as follows: SENP1, 5′-ATCAGGCAGTGAAACGTTGGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGGCTTCATTGTTTATCCCA-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-CATCCTCACCCTGAAGTACCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCCTGGATAGCAACGTACATG-3′) (reverse). Tissue samples were fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences) was used for immunostaining mouse brain tissue, the VECTASTAIN ABC system (Vector Laboratories) was used for immunohistochemistry. The values were expressed as mean ± S.D. The paired t test was used for statistical analysis between two groups. The significant level was set at p < 0.05. In a previous study, we found that SENP1 was essential for erythropoietin, a HIF-1α target gene, expression under hypoxia conditions (6Cheng J. Kang X. Zhang S. Yeh E.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that hypoxia might induce SENP1 expression, which would further enhance HIF-1α activity. To test this possibility, we determined the expression of SENP1 in HUVEC cells in response to hypoxia by using real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of SENP1 transcripts was significantly increased in HUVEC cells after 6 h of treatment with hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia is an important factor in the regulation of SENP1 expression. As HIF-1α mediates most of the cellular response to hypoxia, we reasoned that the hypoxia-induced SENP1 expression was mediated through the HIF-1α signaling pathway. U937HIF1 (a Tet-off inducible HIF-1α U937 cell line) and vector control U937PT cell lines (31Song L.P. Zhang J. Wu S.F. Huang Y. Zhao Q. Cao J.P. Wu Y.L. Wang L.S. Chen G.Q. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were used to test this hypothesis. At day 2 after Tet was withdrawn, the mRNA level of HIF-1α was significantly increased in U937HIF1, but not in U937PT. Similarly, SENP1 expression was also significantly up-regulated in U937HIF1, but not in U937PT cells, after Tet was withdrawn (Fig. 1B), suggesting that HIF-1α could control SENP1 transcription. We further confirmed the role of HIF-1α in hypoxia-induced SENP1 expression by siRNA approach. As shown in Fig. 1C, silencing of HIF-1α expression abolished the hypoxia-induced SENP1 expression in U937 cells. All these data suggest that SENP1 expression is regulated by the hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling pathway. The above results indicate that SENP1 might be a target gene of HIF-1α. To test this, we first searched the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the Senp1 promoter. The HRE core sequence (A/G)CGTG was found in around −498 bp and −489 bp in the mouse Senp1 promoter (32Wenger R.H. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re12PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a series of truncated mouse Senp1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter genes. The results from a luciferase assay showed that Senp1 promoter region around the predicted HRE core sequence was required for hypoxia response (data not shown). Moreover, we confirmed the HRE sites located in Senp1 promoter by using a mutation approach. As shown in Fig. 2A, mutation of any one of the two HRE sites of mouse Senp1 promoter significantly decreased its response to hypoxia, and the two-site mutant lost all hypoxia-induced Senp1 transcription. Additionally, ChIP assay confirmed that HIF-1α was a transcription factor of SENP1 transcription. As shown in Fig. 2B, hypoxia- but not normoxia-treated cells showed increased in HIF-1α binding to the Senp1 promoter. These data strongly suggest that HIF-1α is a transcription factor that regulates SENP1 expression under hypoxia conditions. We previously reported that SENP1 was an essential regulator for the stability and activity of HIF-1α during hypoxia (6Cheng J. Kang X. Zhang S. Yeh E.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the present study, we found that hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling could induce SENP1 expression (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Based on those observations, we proposed that SENP1 might regulate hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling pathway through a positive feedback loop. If it is true, SENP1 would be essential for the expression of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α target genes. Indeed, we have previously reported that SENP1 is essential for the expression of erythropoietin in the Senp1−/− embryos. Here, we asked whether the activity of SENP1 was important in the regulation of VEGF expression in endothelial cells, as VEGF plays an essential role in control the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. To address this, we generated SENP1-silenced HUVECs by SENP1-specific siRNA. The mRNA level of SENP1 in si-SENP1-HUVEC was down by 80% in comparison with that in si-NS-HUVEC (Fig. 3A). We then compared the mRNA expression of VEGF in si-SENP1 with si-NS-HUVEC cells under hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 3B, VEGF message RNA was significantly decreased in si-SENP1-HUVEC cells in comparison with that in si-NS control cells under hypoxia conditions. We also measured the secreted VEGF protein in the cultural medium of these HUVEC cells by ELISA. VEGF protein secreted by si-SENP1-HUVEC was also much less than that of si-NS-HUVEC cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that SENP1 was essential for hypoxia-induced VEGF expression in endothelial cells. To determine the specificity of siRNA against SENP1, we transfected SENP1 siRNA-resistant mutant plasmid into si-SENP1-HUVEC cells and found VEGF expression was partially recovered in the transfected cells (Fig. 3, B and C). To further determine whether VEGF expression regulated by SENP1 in endothelial cells is mediated through HIF-1α, we employed a VEGF promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 3D, either overexpression of SENP1 or HIF-1α could induce VEGF transcription. Overexpression of both SENP1 and HIF-1α synergistically enhanced the activity of VEGF reporter. Importantly, mutation of HRE site in the VEGF promoter completely abolished the action of SENP1 on the VEGF transcription, indicating that HIF-1α was essential for SENP1 regulation in VEGF expression. These data suggest that SENP1 plays an important role in hypoxia-driven VEGF production in endothelial cells. The above observation raised the possibility that SENP1 might have a regulatory role in the angiogenic function of endothelial cells. To address this, we performed a series of analysis on the angiogenic activity of si-NS-HUVEC and si-SENP1-HUVEC cells. Under complete culture conditions, there was no significant difference in cell proliferation between the si-SENP1- and si-NS-HUVEC cells (Fig. 4A). However, silencing SENP1 significantly decreased HUVEC cell survival (Fig. 4A) and increased apoptosis in basal medium without addition of serum and growth factors (starvation) (Fig. 4B). Both activities could be recovered by transfection of SENP1 siRNA-resistant mutant plasmid. Importantly, silencing of SENP1 expression markedly reduced the angiogenic tube formation of HUVEC cells under basal medium culture condition (Fig. 4C). Similarly, SENP1 siRNA-resistant mutant could markedly rescue the defect of the tube formation in si-SENP1-HUVEC cells (Fig. 4C). We also performed an in vitro endothelial sprouting assay to confirm the defect of angiogenic function in si-SENP1-HUVEC cells. The si-NS-HUVEC cells were coated on beads and sprouted for 3 days when cultured in basal medium, and showed multiple vessel structures protruding from each beads. However, silencing SENP1 blocked sprouting of HUVEC cells (Fig. 4D). Migration is another critical aspect of endothelial cells during angiogenesis. To determine whether SENP1 regulates endothelial cell migration, we measured the migration ability of si-NS- and si-SENP1-HUVEC cells through a Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber. We tested for chemotaxis by placing VEGF in the lower chamber. The motility of si-SENP1-HUVEC was greatly reduced in comparison with si-NS-HUVEC cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that SENP1 was required for endothelial cell migration. All these data indicate that SENP1 is essential for angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. To further determine the role of SENP1 in endothelial cells, we examined morphologic changes of endothelial cells in Senp1−/− embryo sections. As shown in Fig. 5A, there were much fewer elongated endothelial cells in embryonic brain section of Senp1−/− than those in wild-type littermates at day 15, indicating SENP1 played an essential role in embryonic endothelial cell angiogenesis. We also observed much fewer vascular endothelial cells in embryonic renal glomeruli in Senp1−/− than those in wild-type littermates (Fig. 5B), suggesting that SENP1 was essential for the proliferation of endothelial cells during development. The above observations show that SENP1 is essential for VEGF production and angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. We thought that down-regulation of VEGF in si-SENP1-HUVEC might be responsible for the defect in angiogenic function; therefore, addition of VEGF should rescue the angiogenic ability of si-SENP1-HUVEC. To test this possibility, we carried out a VEGF rescue experiment in si-SENP1-HUVEC cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, apoptosis of si-SENP1-HUVEC induced by serum starvation was inhibited by addition of VEGF in its cultural medium. An in vitro tube formation assay also showed that addition of VEGF in the medium could significantly recover the defect in si-SENP1-HUVEC cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). We also carried out a spouting assay and confirmed that addition of VEGF in medium could promote si-SENP1-HUVEC sprouting from coated beads (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that VEGF production regulated by SENP1 is essential for angiogenic function in endothelial cells. Hypoxia-induced cellular processes such as erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and anaerobic metabolism are mediated by HIF-1α through regulating the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes (8Wang G.L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we indentified a novel hypoxia-responsive gene, SENP1, a member of a SUMO-specific protease family. We showed that SENP1 expression could be induced by hypoxia. Moreover, induction of SENP1 expression is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α. To support this conclusion, we have gathered the following evidence. First, SENP1 expression was increased following the induction of HIF-1α expression in the inducible HIF-1α expression cells. Second, silencing of HIF-1α expression can block hypoxia-induced SENP1 expression. Third, two HRE sites were indentified in the Senp1 promoter, and mutation of the two caused the loss of trans-activation in response to hypoxia. Fourth, we also determined that hypoxia enhanced HIF-1α binding to the SENP1 promoter. Collectively, these results illustrated that HIF-1α is a transcription factor mediating the hypoxia-induced Senp1 expression. Although several studies have reported that SUMOylation can be induced by hypoxia (25Bae S.H. Jeong J.W. Park J.A. Kim S.H. Bae M.K. Choi S.J. Kim K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 2007; 131: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, this is the first study to directly show a SUMOylation enzyme as a hypoxia-responsive target gene. We have previously reported that SENP1 enhances HIF-1α stability and activity under hypoxia conditions (6Cheng J. Kang X. Zhang S. Yeh E.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). This study shows that hypoxia promotes SENP1 expression through HIF-1α transactivation. Therefore, we propose a positive feedback loop model to depict SENP1 action in the hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling pathway. In this model, SENP1, as one of the HIF-1α target genes, can be induced by hypoxia. Then induction of SENP1 expression further enhance hypoxia-induced HIF-1α activity through deconjugating SUMOylated HIF-1α, which is induced by hypoxia (Fig. 7). We have shown a similar regulatory mechanism involved by SENP1 in androgen signaling (34Bawa-Khalfe T. Cheng J. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37341-37349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). SENP1 was indentified as an androgen-responsive target gene, and SENP1 was shown to promote the activity of androgen receptor and the biological consequence resulted from the activated androgen receptor (34Bawa-Khalfe T. Cheng J. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37341-37349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results suggest the positive feedback loop model might be a general mechanism in cellular signaling regulated by SENP1. The biological significance of SENP1 regulation in HIF-1α signaling has been clearly demonstrated in the regulation of VEGF production and angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Silencing of SENP1 expression in endothelial cells significantly decreased VEGF transcripts and protein production. VEGF, a key regulator of angiogenesis, is one of the well known targets of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling (10Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S.

As a consequence of down-regulation of VEGF, multiply angiogenic activities of endothelial cells were shown to decrease in SENP1-silenced endothelial cells. In Senp1−/− embryos, we have also observed the deficiency of endothelial cells. The elongated endothelial cells in brain tissue of Senp1−/− were decreased significantly. Vascular endothelial cells were much fewer in Senp1−/− embryonic renal glomeruli than those in wild-type. These results support the concept that SENP1 plays an important role in the regulation of angiogenic activity of endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2095506424,"Background Phyllanthus is a traditional medicinal plant that has been used in the treatment of many diseases including hepatitis and diabetes. The main aim of the present work was to investigate the potential cytotoxic effects of aqueous and methanolic extracts of four Phyllanthus species (P.amarus, P.niruri, P.urinaria and P.watsonii) against skin melanoma and prostate cancer cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Phyllanthus plant appears to possess cytotoxic properties with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 150–300 µg/ml for aqueous extract and 50–150 µg/ml for methanolic extract that were determined using the MTS reduction assay. In comparison, the plant extracts did not show any significant cytotoxicity on normal human skin (CCD-1127Sk) and prostate (RWPE-1) cells. The extracts appeared to act by causing the formation of a clear “ladder” fragmentation of apoptotic DNA on agarose gel, displayed TUNEL-positive cells with an elevation of caspase-3 and -7 activities. The Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level was lower than 15% in Phyllanthus treated-cancer cells. These indicate that Phyllanthus extracts have the ability to induce apoptosis with minimal necrotic effects. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that Phyllanthus induced a Go/G1-phase arrest on PC-3 cells and a S-phase arrest on MeWo cells and these were accompanied by accumulation of cells in the Sub-G1 (apoptosis) phase. The cytotoxic properties may be due to the presence of polyphenol compounds such as ellagitannins, gallotannins, flavonoids and phenolic acids found both in the water and methanol extract of the plants. Conclusions/Significance Phyllanthus plant exerts its growth inhibition effect in a selective manner towards cancer cells through the modulation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis via caspases activation in melanoma and prostate cancer cells. Hence, Phyllanthus may be sourced for the development of a potent apoptosis-inducing anticancer agent."
https://openalex.org/W2014449218,"Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-β family, plays important roles in hormonal homeostasis and embryogenesis. In this study, we produced recombinant human activin A and examined its abilities to bind to extracellular matrix proteins. Recombinant activin A expressed in 293-F cells was purified as complexes of mature dimeric activin A with its pro-region. Among a panel of extracellular matrix proteins tested, recombinant activin A bound to perlecan and agrin, but not to laminins, nidogens, collagens I and IV, fibronectin, and nephronectin. The binding of recombinant activin A to perlecan was inhibited by heparin and high concentrations of NaCl and abolished by heparitinase treatment of perlecan, suggesting that activin A binds to the heparan sulfate chains of perlecan. In support of this possibility, recombinant activin A was capable of directly binding to heparin and heparan sulfate chains. Site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant activin A revealed that clusters of basic amino acid residues, Lys259-Lys263 and Lys270-Lys272, in the pro-region were required for binding to perlecan. Interestingly, deletion of the peptide segment Lys259-Gly277 containing both basic amino acid clusters from the pro-region did not impair the activity of activin A to stimulate Smad-dependent gene expressions, although it completely ablated the perlecan-binding activity. The binding of activin A to basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans through the basic residues in the pro-region was further confirmed by in situ activin A overlay assays using frozen tissue sections. Taken together, the present results indicate that activin A binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans through its pro-region and thereby regulates its localization within tissues.

It serves as a scaffold for cell adhesion, and regulates cell survival, proliferation, migration, and gene expression through interactions with cell surface receptors including integrins and membrane-anchored proteoglycans (1Nelson C.M. Bissell M.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 287-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The ECM also binds to a variety of growth factors including fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thereby modulates the availability and biological activities of these growth factors (2Macri L. Silverstein D. Clark R.A. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 2007; 59: 1366-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The binding of growth factors to ECM components, particularly heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), is believed to protect them against proteolytic degradation, concentrate their activity in the vicinity of cells, and allow their rapid release during wound healing and tissue remodeling (2Macri L. Silverstein D. Clark R.A. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 2007; 59: 1366-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The activities of such growth factors bound to HSPGs are considered to be regulated by heparanase, which cleaves heparan sulfate chains and consequently releases the growth factors from the ECM (3Vlodavsky I.

Nature. 2008; 455: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The TGF-β family members play central roles in the regulation of multiple physiological processes such as cell differentiation, mitogenesis, embryogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammation (12Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Many, if not all, TGF-β family members are produced as latent complexes of the mature dimeric growth factor and its pro-region (13Saharinen J. Hyytiäïnen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The pro-region of TGF-β1, which is known to be a latency-associated peptide, forms two disulfide bonds with latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBPs), thus targeting the latent TGF-β1 complexes to the ECM. The resulting latent TGF-β-LTBP complexes bind to fibrillins and fibronectins, and consequently facilitate the ECM targeting of TGF-β1. Fibrillin-1 has also been shown to bind to the pro-regions of BMP-2, -4, -7, and -10 at its N-terminal region (14Sengle G. Charbonneau N.L. Ono R.N. Sasaki T. Alvarez J. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P.

These observations indicate the importance of the pro-regions of TGF-β family proteins for their ECM deposition. Activin A, a member of the TGF-β family, is a disulfide-linked homodimer of inhibin βA. The inhibin βA-subunit is synthesized as a precursor and processed by a furin protease to give an N-terminal pro-region and a C-terminal mature βA region (15Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Activin A participates not only in the release of follicle-stimulating hormone from anterior pituitary cells (16Vale W. Rivier J. Vaughan J. McClintock R. Corrigan A. Woo W. Karr D. Spiess J.

Hinton A. Firpo M.T. King C.C. Hayek A. Stem. Cells. 2005; 23: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and induce their differentiation into defined cell lineages (22Asashima M. Michiue T. Kurisaki A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2008; 50: S35-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By analogy to TGF-β1 and some BMPs, the biological activity of activin A may also be modulated by the ECM, although the interactions of activin A with ECM components remain unexplored. In Xenopus, activin has been shown to act as a long-range dorsalizing signal to establish a concentration gradient (23McDowell N. Zorn A.M. Crease D.J. Gurdon J.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 671-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting the potential associations of Xenopus activin with ECM components. In this study, we examined the interactions of activin A with a panel of ECM proteins as a first step toward addressing the roles of the ECM in the regulation of activin A function and tissue distribution. We found that recombinant activin A produced in human 293-F cells specifically bound to perlecan and agrin through its pro-region that was capable of binding to heparin/heparan sulfate chains. We mapped the regions responsible for the binding to perlecan to clusters of basic amino acid residues, Lys259-Lys263 and Lys270-Lys272, in the pro-region, although these residues were dispensable for the Smad-dependent signaling activity of activin A. KOD plus DNA polymerase was purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Human follistatin was purchased from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). Bovine activin A was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against activin A (MAB3381) and human follistatin (MAB669) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A mouse anti-perlecan mAb (7B5) was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-pentaHis mAb and nickel-nitrilotriacetic (Ni-NTA) agarose were purchased from Qiagen (Piscataway, NJ). Heparin and hyaluronidase were obtained from Sigma. Chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris), heparitinase (Flavobacterium heparinum), and mAbs against heparan sulfate (3G10 and 10E4) were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B dry resin was purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Recombinant human laminins, agrin, nidogen 1, nidogen 2, and nephronectin were produced using a FreeStyleTM 293 Expression System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified from conditioned medium by immunoaffinity chromatography or Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography. Perlecan was purified from conditioned medium of JAR human choriocarcinoma cells by immunoaffinity chromatography using an anti-perlecan mAb (kindly provided by Dr. Masahiko Katayama, Eisai Co. Ltd., Tsukuba, Japan). Recombinant perlecan was also expressed and purified as described below. Fibronectin was purified from outdated human plasma by gelatin affinity chromatography (24Sekiguchi K. Hakomori S. Funahashi M. Matsumoto I. Seno N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14359-14365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type I collagen was extracted from calf skin using 50 mm acetic acid and purified by salt fractionation under acidic and neutral conditions (25Sato K. Ebihara T. Adachi E. Kawashima S. Hattori S.

Type IV collagen was extracted from bovine lens capsule using 0.5 m acetic acid (26Iwata M. Imamura Y. Sasaki T. Hayashi T. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1298-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). pSecTag 2C (Invitrogen) was used to construct expression vectors for human activin A and its mutants. A full-length cDNA encoding the human inhibin βA subunit (GeneBankTM accession number: BC007858) was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and inserted into pSecTag 2C to produce the expression vector pSecTag-Act. Expression vectors for activin A with a His6 tag at either the N- or C-terminal end and a panel of activin A mutants with amino acid substitutions or deletions were prepared as follows: forward and reverse primers flanking the sites to be mutated were used to amplify pSecTag-Act by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting linearized pSecTag-Act DNA fragments with added, deleted, or mutated nucleotides at their 3′- or 5′-ends were ligated again to obtain expression vectors for the individual mutants. A His6 tag was also added to the N terminus of the pro-region of the βA subunit (between Ser21 and Pro22) and the C terminus of the βA subunit. The nucleotide sequences of the resulting expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. A full-length cDNA encoding human perlecan was constructed from a human fetus cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR and inserted into pSecTag 2B (Invitrogen) between the HindIII and NotI sites with a His6 tag at its C terminus. Recombinant activin A and its mutants were expressed and purified using the FreeStyleTM 293 Expression System according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3 × 107 293-F cells were transfected with expression vectors and cultured for 3 days at 37 °C. The medium was initially centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min to remove the cells and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of Ni-NTA agarose and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Next, the Ni-NTA agarose was packed into a column and extensively washed with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 40 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl. Activin A was eluted from the column with 0.2 m imidazole and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The purity of the purified activin A was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a 12% gel, followed by silver staining. Purified activin A and its mutants were quantified by ELISA using bovine activin A as a standard. Expression and purification of recombinant perlecan were performed as described for activin A. Immunoblotting was carried out using specific mAbs and signals were detected with a chemiluminescence reagent (ECL; GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 96-well plates (MaxiSorpTM; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with individual ECM proteins at 10 nm overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing with TBS and blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The plates were then incubated with 50 nm recombinant activin A at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, the bound recombinant activin A was detected with the HRP-conjugated anti-pentaHis mAb. Phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated chondroitin sulfate-A, chondroitin sulfate-C, chondroitin sulfate-D, chondroitin sulfate-E, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, and heparin were synthesized as described (27Sugiura N. Sakurai K. Hori Y. Karasawa K. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15779-15787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and coated on 96-well MaxiSorpTM plates at 20 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then incubated with 50 nm recombinant activin A at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, the bound recombinant activin A was detected with the HRP-conjugated anti-PentaHis mAb. Perlecan purified from JAR cells was coated on 96-well MaxiSorpTM plates at 10 nm overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1 h. After washing with TBS, chondroitinase ABC (20 mU) or heparitinase (5 mU) was added, and the digestions were conducted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 25 mm sodium acetate and 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 3 h. The enzymes were removed by washing with TBS, and the binding activities of the enzyme-treated perlecan toward recombinant activin A were quantified by solid-phase binding assays as described above. Fifteen microliters of recombinant activin A (300 ng) or bovine mature activin A (300 ng) was mixed with 10 μl of heparin-Sepharose beads and incubated on ice for 30 min. Unbound activin A was separated from the heparin-Sepharose beads by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. The heparin-Sepharose beads were washed three times with TBS, and the activin A bound to the beads was recovered in 15 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The amounts of activin A in the supernatant and those recovered from the heparin-Sepharose beads were detected by SDS-PAGE using a 12% gel followed by silver staining. The activin-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid p3TP-lux (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) and plasmid pSVβGal (Promega, Madison, WI) were used for activin A activity assays after transfection into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG44 cells (28Arai K.Y. Tsuchida K. Li C. Watanabe G. Sugino H. Taya K. Nishiyama T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 49: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The CHO cells were plated on 24-well plates (Falcon, San Jose, CA) at 150,000 cells/well and cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with p3TP-lux (600 ng) and pSVβGal (200 ng) using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). At 24 h after the transfection, the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant activin A or bovine activin A for 20 h in α-MEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. The activity of the induced luciferase was measured and normalized by the activity of β-galactosidase using a Dual-Light® System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serial sections of mouse embryos at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) were air-dried, fixed with acetone for 30 min and digested with chondroitinase ABC (5 U/ml) and hyaluronidase (1 U/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The sections were then incubated with recombinant activin A (5 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.5% goat serum and HRP-conjugated anti-pentaHis mAb (1:100) at 4 °C overnight, followed by visualization of the bound HRP-conjugated mAbs with a DAKO Envision Kit (K3466; DAKO, Milan, Italy). For immunohistochemical detection of heparan sulfate chains, the sections were incubated with anti-heparan sulfate mAb 10E4 (1:500) in PBS containing 0.5% goat serum overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by visualization of the bound antibodies with a DAKO Envision Kit. All sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Activin A was expressed in 293-F cells with a C-terminal His6 tag and purified using Ni-NTA-agarose. After SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, recombinant activin A produced a 25-kDa band that corresponded to the disulfide-linked mature activin A (“βA/βA”) and two closely spaced bands in the 44–46 kDa region that corresponded to the pro-region (Fig. 1A). The 25-kDa band was recognized by MAB3381, a function-blocking anti-activin A mAb that recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope on mature activin A (Fig. 1B). Under reducing conditions, the mature activin A produced a 15 kDa band, thus endorsing its disulfide-linked dimeric nature. Amino acid sequencing of the two major bands migrating in the 44–46-kDa region revealed that both had the same N-terminal sequence, SPTPG, which was identical to the deduced N-terminal sequence of the pro-region. The mass difference between these two bands could be caused by differential N-glycosylation and/or partial protease degradation. These results indicated that recombinant activin A expressed in 293-F cells was properly processed to yield a mature dimer that remained in a complex with its pro-region. The ability of recombinant activin A to bind to the ECM was surveyed using a panel of ECM proteins including types I and IV collagens, laminin-111, -332, and -511, nidogens 1 and 2, perlecan, agrin, nephronectin, and fibronectin by solid-phase binding assays. Among these ECM proteins, recombinant activin A only bound to perlecan and agrin (Fig. 1C). None of the laminin isoforms examined, i.e. laminin-121, -211, -221, -411, -421, and -521, showed any affinities toward recombinant activin A (data not shown). The ECM proteins tested were recombinant proteins expressed in 293-F cells except for perlecan (purified from conditioned medium of JAR human choriocarcinoma cells), types I and IV collagens (extracted from calf skin and bovine lens, respectively) and fibronectin (purified from human plasma). To exclude the possibility that the binding of recombinant activin A to perlecan was caused by contaminants present in the JAR-derived perlecan, we produced recombinant human perlecan with a C-terminal His6 tag using 293-F cells and purified it with Ni-NTA agarose. The recombinant perlecan had a molecular weight similar to that of perlecan from JAR cells and was recognized by anti-perlecan mAb 7B5 (Fig. 2A). The attachment of heparan sulfate chains to the recombinant perlecan was verified by heparitinase treatment. Upon SDS-PAGE, the heparitinase-treated recombinant perlecan exhibited a thinner band with a decreased molecular mass (Fig. 2B). The presence of heparan sulfate chains was further corroborated by the reactivity of mAb 3G10, which specifically recognizes heparitinase-cleaved heparan sulfate chains (29David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), toward the heparitinase-treated recombinant perlecan (Fig. 2B). The recombinant perlecan bound to activin A in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), confirming the specific binding of recombinant activin A to perlecan. Because both perlecan and agrin are proteoglycans that contain heparan sulfate chains, which have been shown to bind many proteins including growth factors (30Whitelock J.M. Melrose J. Iozzo R.V. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11174-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we examined whether the heparan sulfate chains of perlecan were involved in the interaction with recombinant activin A. As shown in Fig. 3A, binding of recombinant activin A to perlecan was inhibited by increasing concentrations of NaCl, reaching >80% inhibition in the presence of 1.64 m NaCl. EDTA did not show any significant inhibitory effects. However, heparin at a concentration of 10 μg/ml completely abrogated the binding of recombinant activin A to perlecan. The strong inhibition by heparin was further confirmed by the binding of recombinant activin A to recombinant perlecan and agrin (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that the interactions of recombinant activin A with perlecan occur via the heparan sulfate chains on perlecan and are predominantly of an ionic nature. To corroborate this conclusion, perlecan was treated with heparitinase or chondroitinase ABC. Treatment with chondroitinase ABC barely compromised the interaction of activin A with perlecan, whereas treatment with heparitinase resulted in an almost complete loss of the binding activity (Fig. 3C). The interactions of recombinant activin A with heparan sulfate and other GAGs were further investigated using an array of GAGs. Recombinant activin A preferentially bound to heparin, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate-E, but did not bind to chondroitin sulfate-A, -C, and -D, dermatan sulfate or hyaluronic acid (Fig. 3D). These results provided further evidence that recombinant activin A binds to the heparan sulfate chains of perlecan. Follistatin is known to bind to activin A and other TGF-β family members. It also binds to heparan sulfate chains (31Innis C.A. Hyvönen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39969-39977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the heparan sulfate-binding activity of recombinant activin A may be caused by follistatin co-purified with activin A. To address this possibility, we probed recombinant activin A coated on 96-well plates or electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes with an anti-follistatin mAb (Fig. 4, A and B). No follistatin signals were detected for recombinant activin A coated at 640 ng/well or loaded at 640 ng/lane, while control follistatin was detectable at concentrations as low as 1 ng/well, thus making it unlikely that the heparan sulfate-binding activity of recombinant activin A was caused by follistatin copurified with activin A. It has been reported that the binding sites for heparin/heparan sulfate chains are comprised of clusters of basic amino acid residues (32Gandhi N.S. Mancera R.L. Chem. Biol. Drug. Des. 2008; 72: 455-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). There are four clusters of basic amino acid residues in the pro-region of the βA-subunit, comprising Lys69Lys70Arg71 (Cluster 1), Lys259Lys260Lys261Lys262Lys263 (Cluster 2), Lys270Lys271Lys272 (Cluster 3), and Arg306Arg307Arg308Arg309Arg310 (Cluster 4) (Fig. 5A), suggesting that recombinant activin A may bind to the heparan sulfate chains of perlecan through its pro-region. To explore the involvement of these basic amino acid clusters in the binding of recombinant activin A to perlecan, we first compared the heparin binding activity of recombinant activin A with that of bovine mature activin A without the pro-region by pull-down assays using heparin-Sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE analyses of the bound and unbound fractions from the pull-down assays revealed that the recombinant activin A was fully recovered in the bound fraction, while mature dimeric activin A was largely recovered in the unbound fraction (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that the pro-region harbors the major heparin-binding sites. The involvement of the clusters of Lys/Arg residues in perlecan binding was investigated by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of these positively charged residues. Mutant proteins with individual or entire alanine substitutions at these basic amino acid clusters were expressed in 293-F cells and purified using Ni-NTA-agarose. Although individual alanine substitutions at Cluster 2 did not compromise the expressions and secretions of the mutant proteins, alanine substitutions at Cluster 1 resulted in severe reductions in the amounts of recombinant proteins recovered from Ni-NTA-agarose (Fig. 5C). Notably, we failed to obtain any detectable amount of the mutant with alanine substitution for Lys69. These results suggested that the basic amino acid residues in Cluster 1, particularly Lys69, play critical roles in the proper folding and/or subsequent secretion of activin A. On the other hand, amino acid substitutions at Clusters 3 and 4 exhibited only partial, if any, reductions in the amounts of the mutant proteins recovered from Ni-NTA-agarose, except that entire substitutions of all five arginine residues in Cluster 4 resulted in a failure of proteolytic processing by a furin protease into the pro-region and mature activin A. The perlecan-binding activities of the mutant proteins were examined by solid phase binding assays (Fig. 5D). Entire substitutions of the basic amino acid residues in Clusters 2 and 3 caused ∼95 and ∼90% reductions in the perlecan binding activity, respectively. In contrast, entire substitutions of all five arginine residues in Cluster 4 did not compromise the activity. These results suggested that the basic residues in Clusters 2 and 3, but not those in Cluster 4, are critically involved in the perlecan-binding activity of recombinant activin A. Although the mutant with substitutions of all three basic residues in Cluster 1 failed to be expressed and its perlecan-binding activity could not be determined, individual substitutions at Lys70 and Lys71 showed no significant decreases in the perlecan binding activity, suggesting the possibility that Cluster 1 is not required for binding to perlecan. Among the five mutant proteins with individual alanine substitutions at Cluster 2, the K259A mutant exhibited"

Here, we demonstrate that DMP1 mediated calcium signaling, and its downstream effectors play an essential role in the differentiation of preosteoblasts to fully functional osteoblasts.

The way an animal moves through its environment influences the dynamics of local populations and will determine how susceptible it is to natural or anthropogenic perturbations. It is of particular interest to understand the patterns of movement for species which are susceptible to human activities (e.g. fishing), or that exert a large influence on community structure, such as sharks. Methodology/Principal Findings We monitored the patterns of movement of 34 sixgill sharks Hexanchus griseus using two large-scale acoustic arrays inside and outside Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Sixgill sharks were residents in Puget Sound for up to at least four years before making large movements out of the estuary. Within Puget Sound, sixgills inhabited sites for several weeks at a time and returned to the same sites annually. Across four years, sixgills had consistent seasonal movements in which they moved to the north from winter to spring and moved to the south from summer to fall. Just prior to leaving Puget Sound, sixgills altered their behavior and moved twice as fast among sites. Nineteen of the thirty-four sixgills were detected leaving Puget Sound for the outer coast. Three of these sharks returned to Puget Sound. Conclusions/Significance For most large marine predators, we have a limited understanding of how they move through their environment, and this clouds our ability to successfully manage their populations and their communities. With detailed movement information, such as that being uncovered with acoustic monitoring, we can begin to quantify the spatial and temporal impacts of large predators within the framework of their ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2088992673,"The Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 has been implicated in a variety of growth factor signaling pathways, but its role in insulin signaling has remained unresolved. In vitro studies suggest that Shp2 is both a negative and positive regulator of insulin signaling, although its physiological function in a number of peripheral insulin-responsive tissues remains unknown. To address the metabolic role of Shp2 in the liver, we generated mice with either chronic or acute hepatic Shp2 deletion using tissue-specific Cre-LoxP and adenoviral Cre approaches, respectively. We then analyzed insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and insulin signaling in liver-specific Shp2-deficient and control mice. Mice with chronic Shp2 deletion exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and increased glucose tolerance compared with controls. Acute Shp2 deletion yielded comparable results, indicating that the observed metabolic effects are directly caused by the lack of Shp2 in the liver. These findings correlated with, and were most likely caused by, direct dephosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 in the liver, accompanied by increased PI3K/Akt signaling. In contrast, insulin-induced ERK activation was dramatically attenuated, yet there was no effect on the putative ERK site on IRS1 (Ser(612)) or on S6 kinase 1 activity. These studies show that Shp2 is a negative regulator of hepatic insulin action, and its deletion enhances the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway downstream of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2028820337,"As laser acupuncture is being increasingly used to treat mental disorders, we sought to determine whether it has a biologically plausible effect by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the cerebral activation patterns from laser stimulation of relevant acupoints.Ten healthy subjects were randomly stimulated with a fibreoptic infrared laser on 4 acupoints (LR14, CV14, LR8 and HT7) used for depression following the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and 1 control non-acupoint (sham point) in a blocked design (alternating verum laser and placebo laser/rest blocks), while the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI response was recorded from the whole brain on a 3T scanner. Many of the acupoint laser stimulation conditions resulted in different patterns of neural activity. Regions with significantly increased activation included the limbic cortex (cingulate) and the frontal lobe (middle and superior frontal gyrus). Laser acupuncture tended to be associated with ipsilateral brain activation and contralateral deactivation that therefore cannot be simply attributed to somatosensory stimulation.We found that laser stimulation of acupoints lead to activation of frontal-limbic-striatal brain regions, with the pattern of neural activity somewhat different for each acupuncture point. This is the first study to investigate laser acupuncture on a group of acupoints useful in the management of depression. Differing activity patterns depending on the acupoint site were demonstrated, suggesting that neurological effects vary with the site of stimulation. The mechanisms of activation and deactivation and their effects on depression warrant further investigation."

In this study, we have characterized the phosphorylation status of αB-crystallin in breast epithelial carcinoma cells line MCF7 submitted to anti-cancer agents like vinblastine. We have showed that the main phosphorylation site of αB-crystallin in response to vinblastine is serine 59 and determined a correlation between this post-translational modification and higher apoptosis level. The overexpression of the serine 59 “pseudophosphorylated” mutant (S59E) induces a significant increase in the apoptosis level of vinblastine-treated MCF7 cells. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type αB-crystallin or “nonphosphorylatable” mutant (S59A) result in a resistance to this microtubule-depolymerizing agent, while inhibition of endogenous levels of αB-crystallin by expression of shRNA lowers it. Analyzing further the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon, we report for the first time that phosphorylated αB-crystallin preferentially interacts with Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, and this interaction prevents the translocation of Bcl-2 to mitochondria.

The canonical BMP signaling pathway is known to contribute greatly to biomineralization, however, it is not known whether it is involved in Dspp expression. Here, we investigated this question. Activation of the canonical BMP-2 signaling pathway in MDPC-23, preodontoblast cell, by overexpression of constitutively active Smad1/5 or downstream transcription factors Dlx5 and Runx2 stimulated Dspp expression. Conversely, knockdown of each element with siRNA significantly blocked the BMP-2-induced Dspp expression. To test whether these transcription factors downstream of BMP-2 are directly involved in regulating Dspp, we analyzed the mouse Dspp promoter. There are 5 well conserved homeodomain binding elements, H1 to H5, in Dspp proximal promoter regions (−791 to +54). A serial deletion of H1 and H2 greatly changed basal promoter activity and responsiveness to Dlx5 or Msx2. However, further deletions did not change the responsiveness to Dlx5 or Msx2. H1 and H2 sites can be suggested as specific response elements of Dlx5 and Msx2, respectively, based on their promoter activity modulation.

https://openalex.org/W2086207143,"The 26 S proteasome, composed of the 20 S core and 19 S regulatory particle, plays a central role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Disruption of this process contributes to the pathogenesis of the various diseases; however, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of 26 S proteasome activity remain elusive. Here, cell culture experiments and in vitro assays demonstrated that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family, negatively regulated 26 S proteasome activity. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analyses revealed that ASK1 did not interact with 20 S catalytic core but did interact with ATPases making up the 19 S particle, which is responsible for recognizing polyubiquitinated proteins, unfolding them, and translocating them into the 20 S catalytic core in an ATP-dependent process. Importantly, ASK1 phosphorylated Rpt5, an AAA ATPase of the 19 S proteasome, and inhibited its ATPase activity, an effect that may underlie the ability of ASK1 to inhibit 26 S proteasome activity. The current findings point to a novel role for ASK1 in the regulation of 26 S proteasome and offer new strategies for treating human diseases caused by proteasome malfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2052802966,"Tryparedoxins (TXNs) are oxidoreductases unique to trypanosomatids (including Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites) that transfer reducing equivalents from trypanothione, the major thiol in these organisms, to sulfur-dependent peroxidases and other dithiol proteins. The existence of a TXN within the mitochondrion of trypanosomatids, capable of driving crucial redox pathways, is considered a requisite for normal parasite metabolism. Here this concept is shown not to apply to Leishmania. First, removal of the Leishmania infantum mitochondrial TXN (LiTXN2) by gene-targeting, had no significant effect on parasite survival, even in the context of an animal infection. Second, evidence is presented that no other TXN is capable of replacing LiTXN2. In fact, although a candidate substitute for LiTXN2 (LiTXN3) was found in the genome of L. infantum, this was shown in biochemical assays to be poorly reduced by trypanothione and to be unable to reduce sulfur-containing peroxidases. Definitive conclusion that LiTXN3 cannot directly reduce proteins located within inner mitochondrial compartments was provided by analysis of its subcellular localization and membrane topology, which revealed that LiTXN3 is a tail-anchored (TA) mitochondrial outer membrane protein presenting, as characteristic of TA proteins, its N-terminal end (containing the redox-active domain) exposed to the cytosol. This manuscript further proposes the separation of trypanosomatid TXN sequences into two classes and this is supported by phylogenetic analysis: i) class I, encoding active TXNs, and ii) class II, coding for TA proteins unlikely to function as TXNs. Trypanosoma possess only two TXNs, one belonging to class I (which is cytosolic) and the other to class II. Thus, as demonstrated for Leishmania, the mitochondrial redox metabolism in Trypanosoma may also be independent of TXN activity. The major implication of these findings is that mitochondrial functions previously thought to depend on the provision of electrons by a TXN enzyme must proceed differently."

This disorder is characterized by a primary defect in metabolism-secretion coupling and decreased beta cell mass, attributed to excessive beta cell apoptosis. Here, we investigated the link between energy stress and apoptosis activation following HNF1A inactivation. This study employed single cell fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, gene expression analysis, and gene silencing to study the effects of overexpression of dominant-negative (DN)-HNF1A expression on cellular bioenergetics and apoptosis in INS-1 cells. Induction of DN-HNF1A expression led to reduced ATP levels and diminished the bioenergetic response to glucose. This was coupled with activation of the bioenergetic stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which preceded the onset of apoptosis. Pharmacological activation of AMPK using aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) was sufficient to induce apoptosis in naive cells. Conversely, inhibition of AMPK with compound C or AMPKα gene silencing protected against DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, AMPK mediated the induction of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain-3-only protein Bmf (Bcl-2-modifying factor). Bmf expression was also elevated in islets of DN-HNF1A transgenic mice. Furthermore, knockdown of Bmf expression in INS-1 cells using siRNA was sufficient to protect against DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis.

Although much work has focused on elucidating the role of DN-HNF1A-induced bioenergetic dysfunction in the impaired insulin secretion response, the effects of DN-HNF1A-induced bioenergetic stress on cell survival have not been examined. In this context, we here demonstrate that expression of DN-HNF1A led to ATP depletion, bioenergetic dysfunction, and activation of the bioenergetic stress sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We identified the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bmf as the primary mediator of DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis, and we related AMPK activation to increased Bmf expression. This study suggests that in addition to leading to a diminished insulin secretion response to glucose, bioenergetic dysfunction results in beta cell apoptosis in HNF1A-MODY.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 1 mmol/liter pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50 μmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol. For experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 for 48 h prior to treatment and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 6 mmol/liter glucose and co-treated with reagents as indicated. Following treatments cells were lysed in buffer (62.5 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS (w/v), 10% glycerin (w/v), and protease inhibitors), and samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA micro protein assay kit, and equal amounts (20–50 μg) were separated on 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (w/v) and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Protean BA 85, Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: goat polyclonal antibody to HNF1A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:1000; mouse monoclonal β-actin antibody (clone DM 1A; Sigma), diluted 1:5000; rabbit polyclonal phospho(Thr-172) AMPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:1000; rabbit polyclonal AMPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:1000; rabbit polyclonal antibody to cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology), diluted 1:1000; rabbit polyclonal antibody to Bmf (Cell Signaling Technology), diluted 1:1000. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were diluted 1:1000 (Pierce). Bands were detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and imaged using a FujiFilm LAS-3000 imaging system (Fuji, Sheffield, UK). Images were quantified using Image J 1.41o. Briefly, the integrated intensity of each band was measured, and the intensities of background regions of the same size on the gel were subtracted. The ratio of intensity of the protein of interest was divided by the intensity of β-actin in the respective lane. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1.5 μg of total RNA as template. Reverse transcription was achieved using Superscript II (Invitrogen) primed with 50 pmol of random hexamers (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Real time PCR was performed on the LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics) using the QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Sense and antisense primer sequences were as follows: CAATTTCATCATCGCCCTCT and GTCTCTGATGACCCCAGGAA for glut2; GAGACGCTGTCCTGGAGTCA and GGCCTTGTCTTCCTGGCTTA for bmf; AGGCACTGCAACACAGATGC and GGAAGGAACTCAACGCTGTACG for bad; CCAGCTGACTGCCCTGTCTA and AGCAACTTCACCTGCTGTGC for bim; ATGGACTCAGCATCGGAAGG and TGGCTCATTTGCTCTTCACG for puma; and AGCCATCCAGGCTGTGTTGT and CAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAGCTG for β-actin. All samples were normalized to β-actin, and the data were analyzed using the Lightcycler software 4.0. Cells were treated in 24-well plates before aspiration of media and addition of 200 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.75), and samples were immediately stored at −80 °C. ATP measurements were performed using the ENLITEN ATP assay system bioluminescence detection kit (Promega, Southampton, UK) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was recorded using a Tecan GENios in luminescence mode. ATP content values were corrected for protein concentration (determined using the Pierce BCA micro protein assay kit) and normalized to untreated control samples. Cells (2 × 105) were seeded on Willco (Willco Wells, Amsterdam, Netherlands) dishes (1 cm diameter) and mounted on a thermostatically regulated stage set to 37 °C. Time lapse imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope, and NAD(P)H autofluorescence and TMRM fluorescence were observed through a 63×, 1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective lens (Zeiss). Excitation and emission wavelengths were as follows: NAD(P)H, excitation 375 ± 25 nm and emission 448 ± 32 nm; TMRM, excitation 530 ± 21 nm and emission, 592 ± 22 nm; filters and dichroic mirrors were made by Semrock (Rochester, NY). Emission and bright field images were recorded using a cooled EM CCD camera (Ixon BV 887-DCS; Andor, Belfast, Ireland). The imaging setup was controlled by MetaMorph 6.3r2, and images were analyzed using the same software as described previously (15Ward M.W. Huber H.J. Weisová P. Düssmann H. Nicholls D.G. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8238-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Images were captured at 2-min intervals. Cells were preincubated for 1 h with TMRM (20 mmol/liter) or in experimental buffer (120 mmol/liter NaCl, 3.5 mmol/liter KCl, 0.4 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 20 mmol/liter HEPES, 5 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 1.2 mmol/liter Na2SO4, 1.2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 6 mmol/liter glucose, pH 7.4). For Hoechst staining of nuclear chromatin, cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, nuclear morphology was observed using an Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany) and a 20× dry objective. For each treatment, cells were analyzed for apoptotic nuclear morphology in three image subfields of each culture. Condensed and/or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic nuclei and expressed as a percentage of the total population. Where cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing copGFP, only the copGFP-positive cells were analyzed. For immunohistochemistry experiments, pancreatic sections were obtained from rat insulin promoter-DN-HNF1A and control wild-type C57BL/6JBomTac mice, the generation and genotyping of which have been previously described (16Hagenfeldt-Johansson K.A. Herrera P.L. Wang H. Gjinovci A. Ishihara H. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5311-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The slices were first deparaffinized and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal Bmf antibody diluted 1:20 (Cell Signaling Technology). Slides were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with an Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200, Molecular Probes). The following day, the slides were stained with guinea pig anti-insulin antibody (1:20, Dako Diagnostics, Ireland) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following this, slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in FITC-labeled anti-guinea pig secondary antibody (1:200, Dako Diagnostics Ireland). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). FITC was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser (1%), and the emission was collected through a 505–550-nm barrier filter. Alexa 568 was excited at 543 nm with a helium neon laser (3%), and the emission was collected through 560-nm long pass barrier filter. Images were processed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser 3,2,0,115 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Plasmids and siRNAs were transfected using DharmaFECT Duo (Dharmacon, CO) in Opti-MEM (BioSciences, Dublin, Ireland). Inhibition of AMPK expression was achieved by transiently transfecting cells with a vector expressing siRNA targeting α1/α2 AMPK, while control samples were transfected with a scrambled sequence, as described previously (17Weisová P.

Silencing of Bmf expression was performed utilizing siRNA duplexes purchased from Sigma Proligo (Paris, France). Sequences were as follows: sense, CCAGAAAGCUUCAGUGCAUdTdT; antisense, AUGCACUGAAGCUUUCUGGdTdT. Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. Cells were resuspended in binding buffer (10 mmol/liter HEPES, 135 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2) containing annexin V-FITC conjugate and propidium iodide (Biovision, Mountain View, CA), as per manufacturer's instructions, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were analyzed using a Cyflow ML 16 flow cytometer (Partec, Münster, Germany). For all treatments, 1 × 104 cells were acquired and analyzed using the Flowmax software (Partec, Münster, Germany). Statistics were carried out on GraphPad InStat software using one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Where the p value was < 0.05, groups were considered to be significantly different. Overexpression of wild-type or dominant-negative mutant of HNF1A was induced in INS-1 cells using a tetracycline-dependent transactivator system using 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 and 48 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Previously, we demonstrated a reduction in expression of pyruvate kinase over this time scale after dominant-negative suppression of HNF1A function (8Farrelly A.M. Wobser H. Bonner C. Anguissola S. Rehm M. Concannon C.G. Prehn J.H. Byrne M.M. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Indeed, numerous other downstream target genes involved in energy metabolism have been shown to be down-regulated 24 h after suppression (9Pongratz R.L. Kibbey R.G. Kirkpatrick C.L. Zhao X.

This study correlated expression of DN-HNF1A with a significant decrease in the level of glucose transporter glut2 mRNA (Fig. 1C). The downstream effects of such reductions in expression levels on beta cell bioenergetic function were examined. Intracellular ATP level was decreased by ∼20% by 24 h and by 40% after 48 h (Fig. 1D). ATP is generated mainly by metabolism of glucose via glycolysis and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism, which relies on the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential. We have previously shown that overexpression of DN-HNF1A in INS-1 cells also affects the mitochondrial membrane potential, with hyperpolarization prominent after 24 h, followed by depolarization in most cells by 48 h (5Wobser H. Düssmann H. Kögel D. Wang H. Reimertz C. Wollheim C.B. Byrne M.M. Prehn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6413-6421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion from beta cells is mediated by the bioenergetic response to secretagogues, and the increased ATP level in response to increased extracellular glucose has been well characterized (2Wang H. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4257-4264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B.

Metab. 2005; 288: E1-E15Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The ATP response to glucose in INS-1 cells is diminished by dominant-negative suppression of HNF1A function, with mitochondrial dysfunction thought to contribute to this effect (9Pongratz R.L. Kibbey R.G. Kirkpatrick C.L. Zhao X. Pontoglio M. Yaniv M. Wollheim C.B. Shulman G.I. Cline G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16808-16821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the response of NAD(P)H autofluorescence to increased extracellular glucose in single cells, and in parallel we monitored the membrane potential response using TMRM. NAD(P)H autofluorescence has been shown previously to immediately increase in INS-1 cells in response to increased extracellular glucose concentrations in the medium with concurrent hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential under these conditions (19Mármol P. Pardo B. Wiederkehr A. del Arco A. Wollheim C.B. Satrústegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed increased NAD(P)H autofluorescence within 10 min following glucose stimulation, an effect that was shown to be abolished in cells expressing DN-HNF1A for 48 h (Fig. 1E). The TMRM response to high glucose showed an immediate increase in fluorescence, indicative of hyperpolarization, and which was similarly diminished in cells expressing DN-HNF-1A for 48 h (Fig. 1F). In summary, these data allowed us to conclude that bioenergetic failure becomes prominent after 24–48 h of DN-HNF1A induction. We have previously demonstrated that dominant-negative inactivation of HNF1A function triggers apoptosis in INS-1 cells (5Wobser H. Düssmann H. Kögel D. Wang H. Reimertz C. Wollheim C.B. Byrne M.M. Prehn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6413-6421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, the induction of apoptosis was quantified using Hoechst staining of nuclei (Fig. 2A). The percentage of nuclei that was were condensed and fragmented (apoptotic) was found to be significantly increased after a 24-h induction of DN-HNF1A and was further increased after 48 h (Fig. 2B). The translocation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was considered to be an earlier marker of apoptosis than the changes in nuclear morphology (20Schutte B. Nuydens R. Geerts H. Ramaekers F. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 86: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and was quantified by flow cytometry using an annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate and propidium iodide (PI). Apoptosis was also shown to be increased by this method after a 48-h induction of DN-HNF1A (Fig. 2C). To investigate the relationship between cellular stress induced by energy depletion and apoptosis in our model, we examined the activation of the bioenergetic stress sensor AMPK. AMPK is activated in response to the reduced ATP:AMP ratio and acts to reduce ATP consumption by switching the primary means of generating ATP to catabolism in times of energy stress (21Hardie D.G. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S7-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated AMPK is the activated form and is increased in numerous cell types in response to bioenergetic dysfunction (22Viollet B. Mounier R. Leclerc J. Yazigi A. Foretz M. Andreelli F. Diabetes Metab. 2007; 33: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Chronic activation of AMPK has previously been shown to induce apoptosis in primary beta cells (23Kefas B.A. Heimberg H. Vaulont S. Meisse D. Hue L. Pipeleers D. Van de Casteele M. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in an insulin-secreting beta cell line (24Kefas B.A. Cai Y. Ling Z. Heimberg H. Hue L. Pipeleers D. Van de Casteele M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 30: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the level of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) following DN-HNF1A induction. The level of phosphorylated AMPK was significantly increased by induction of DN-HNF1A for 24 and 36 h (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, activation of AMPK using the pharmacological agonist AICAR in naive INS-1 cells resulted in a time-dependent increase in p-AMPK (Fig. 2F), which interestingly was coupled to increased levels of apoptosis as assessed after 24 and 48 h of AICAR treatment (Fig. 2, G–I). Because AMPK was activated during DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis, and AMPK activation per se was sufficient to induce apoptosis, we investigated the effect of inhibition of AMPK activity on DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis. To this end, we first pharmacologically inhibited AMPK activity using compound C and examined its effects on phosphorylated AMPK and cleaved caspase 3 by Western blot. Caspase 3 is cleaved to become active, which is considered to be a primary event in the initiation of apoptosis. Compound C was found to inhibit DN-HNF1A-induced activation of AMPK (Fig. 3, A and B), which correlated with decreased levels of DN-HNF1A-induced cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, the level of DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis after 48 h was dramatically attenuated in cells co-treated with compound C (Fig. 3E). To ensure that the protective effects observed using compound C were not due to possible off-target effects, we utilized siRNA technology to silence AMPK expression, which we have previously used to effectively target the α1/α2 subunit (17Weisová P. Concannon C.G. Devocelle M. Prehn J.H. Ward M.W. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2997-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 3F, siRNA knockdown of AMPK was also shown to be protective against DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3F). We have already established that dominant-negative suppression of HNF1A function initiates cell death via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which is regulated by pro-apoptotic proteins within the Bcl-2 family of BH3-only proteins, including Bmf, Bad, Puma, and Bim (25Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3504) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of these proteins in DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis, we performed quantitative PCR analysis of their mRNA levels 24 and 48 h after DN-HNF1A induction. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, bmf mRNA was most prominently up-regulated, showing a 3-fold increase in mRNA levels 24 h after treatment and a >6-fold increase at 48 h (Fig. 4A). This was confirmed at the protein level with increased Bmf levels following overexpression of DN-HNF1A but not WT-HNF1A (Fig. 4, B and C). Because dominant-negative suppression of HNF1A function increased AMPK activity and resulted in increased bmf expression, we next examined the effects of"
https://openalex.org/W2038499721,"Background In contrast to man the majority of higher plants use sucrose as mobile carbohydrate. Accordingly proton-driven sucrose transporters are crucial for cell-to-cell and long-distance distribution within the plant body. Generally very negative plant membrane potentials and the ability to accumulate sucrose quantities of more than 1 M document that plants must have evolved transporters with unique structural and functional features. Methodology/Principal Findings To unravel the functional properties of one specific high capacity plasma membrane sucrose transporter in detail, we expressed the sucrose/H+ co-transporter from maize ZmSUT1 in Xenopus oocytes. Application of sucrose in an acidic pH environment elicited inward proton currents. Interestingly the sucrose-dependent H+ transport was associated with a decrease in membrane capacitance (Cm). In addition to sucrose Cm was modulated by the membrane potential and external protons. In order to explore the molecular mechanism underlying these Cm changes, presteady-state currents (Ipre) of ZmSUT1 transport were analyzed. Decay of Ipre could be best fitted by double exponentials. When plotted against the voltage the charge Q, associated to Ipre, was dependent on sucrose and protons. The mathematical derivative of the charge Q versus voltage was well in line with the observed Cm changes. Based on these parameters a turnover rate of 500 molecules sucrose/s was calculated. In contrast to gating currents of voltage dependent-potassium channels the analysis of ZmSUT1-derived presteady-state currents in the absence of sucrose (I = Q/τ) was sufficient to predict ZmSUT1 transport-associated currents. Conclusions Taken together our results indicate that in the absence of sucrose, ‘trapped’ protons move back and forth between an outer and an inner site within the transmembrane domains of ZmSUT1. This movement of protons in the electric field of the membrane gives rise to the presteady-state currents and in turn to Cm changes. Upon application of external sucrose, protons can pass the membrane turning presteady-state into transport currents."
https://openalex.org/W2084714810,"Background Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria in infants using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP-IPTi) is recommended by WHO for implementation in settings where resistance to SP is not high. Here we examine the relationship between the protective efficacy of SP-IPTi and measures of SP resistance. Methods and Results We analysed the relationship between protective efficacy reported in the 7 SP-IPTi trials and contemporaneous data from 6 in vivo efficacy studies using SP and 7 molecular studies reporting frequency of dhfr triple and dhps double mutations within 50km of the trial sites. We found a borderline significant association between frequency of the dhfr triple mutation and protective efficacy to 12 months of age of SP-IPTi. This association is significantly biased due to differences between studies, namely number of doses of SP given and follow up times. However, fitting a simple probabilistic model to determine the relationship between the frequency of the dhfr triple, dhps double and dhfr/dhps quintuple mutations associated with resistance to SP and protective efficacy, we found a significant inverse relationship between the dhfr triple mutation frequency alone and the dhfr/dhps quintuple mutations and efficacy at 35 days post the 9 month dose and up to 12 months of age respectively. Conclusions A significant relationship was found between the frequency of the dhfr triple mutation and SP-IPTi protective efficacy at 35 days post the 9 month dose. An association between the protective efficacy to 12 months of age and dhfr triple and dhfr/dhps quintuple mutations was found but should be viewed with caution due to bias. It was not possible to define a more definite relationship based on the data available from these trials."

The designation PimB had originally been assigned to open reading frame Rv0557, also encoding an α-mannosyltransferase.

Instead, extending the mannosyl chain at the 6-OH requires a distinct set of mannosyltransferases. For instance, bioinformatic analysis of the genome of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 led to the identification of PimC, which catalyzes synthesis of the trimannoside Ac3PIM3 (19Kremer L. Gurcha S.S.

Still, the pimC deletion in Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin does not interrupt formation of higher PIMs, LM or LAM, for which PIMn (where n = 1–3) is considered a precursor, whereas genes orthologous to pimC were found in only 22% of clinical isolates. Thus, compensatory synthetic pathways must exist. Higher order PIM, LM, and LAM depend on glycosyl transfer from the lipid-saccharide donor C30/C50-P-Man and membrane-embedded glycosyltransferases, including PimE (20Morita Y.S. Sena C.B. Waller R.F.

The three-dimensional structures of soluble glycosyltransferases display only two fundamental fold topologies, termed GT-A and GT-B (23Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), contrasting with the diversity of protein folds among glycoside hydrolase enzymes (24Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). According to the sequence-based classification of carbohydrate-active enzymes, PimB′ (Rv2188c) belongs to glycosyltransferase family 4 (GT4; see the CAZy database) (25Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar)). Encompassing a diverse range of enzymatic activities and substrate specificities, GT4 family enzymes assume the GT-B fold, with known structures for about half a dozen family members (26Martinez-Fleites C.

Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GT-B topology is characterized by two Rossmann fold-like domains, where donor and acceptor substrates bind in the central cleft between the two domains. In GT4 family transferases, the C-terminal domain provides the majority of contacts for the nucleoside-diphosphate-saccharide donor substrate, whereas the diverse acceptor-substrates bind to the more variable N-terminal domain. A hinge region allows for conformational flexibility between the two domains, which can be dramatic, as is illustrated by the structures of ligand-free and substrate-bound C. glutamicum MshA (Protein Data Bank entries 3c48 and 3c4v (29Vetting M.W. Frantom P.A. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15834-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). Between these two states, the relative orientation of the domains changes by a 97° rotational movement. Similar if less dramatic examples of interdomain flexibility have been observed in structures of several other GT4 family members. Recently determined structures of GT4 family enzymes include that of M. smegmatis PimA, the enzyme catalyzing transfer of the first mannosyl group to PI (27Guerin M.E. Kordulakova J. Schaeffer F. Svetlikova Z. Buschiazzo A. Giganti D. Gicquel B. Mikusova K. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20705-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This structure shed light on the mode of nucleotide binding and suggested a model for recognition of the acceptor substrate. Although PimA and PimB′ utilize the same donor substrate, their acceptor specificity is distinct. PimB′ appears unable to mannosylate phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (or myo-inositol-1-phosphate) on the 2-hydroxyl, whereas PimA does not mannosylate PI or PIM1 on the 6-hydroxyl. In order to clarify structural differences between PimA and PimB′ that could explain regio-selectivity, we undertook the structure determination of PimB′. Attempts to generate recombinant protein of M. tuberculosis PimB′ (Rv2188c) were unsuccessful, but overexpression of the C. glutamicum ortholog (NCgl2106) in Escherichia coli yielded soluble protein that crystallized when incubated with the donor substrate. Herein, we report the crystal structure of C. glutamicum PimB′ in complex with nucleotide to a resolution of 2.0 Å, revealing flexibility of both the nucleotide conformation and the structural framework of the active site. The results of our site-directed mutational analysis are consistent with a substrate-mediated SNi (internal return) reaction mechanism and indicate that a conserved aspartic acid in the acceptor-binding domain is critical in determining regio-selectivity of mannosyl transfer. Cloning of C. glutamicum PimB′ has been described previously (15Mishra A.K. Batt S. Krumbach K. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3), harboring pET16b-pimB′, were grown at 30 °C in LB broth medium (Difco), supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/ml). Expression of pimB′ was induced at A600 0.4–0.6 by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cultures were incubated for a further 4 h before being harvested (4 °C, 4000 × g), washed with 0.85% saline, and stored at −20 °C. For the expression of SeMet-labeled PimB′, liquid cultures were grown to A600 0.4 and then pelleted and resuspended in 1 liter of minimal medium twice (50 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.4% (w/v) glucose). Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 0.5, and then 100 mg of l-lysine, l-phenylalanine, and l-threonine; 50 mg of isoleucine, leucine, and valine; and 60 mg of l-selenomethionine were added. After 30 min at 37 °C, expression of pimB′ was induced, adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested and treated as before. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (Buffer A), supplemented with an EDTA-free protease mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). The suspension was sonicated (Sonicator Ultrasonic Liquid Processor XL, Misonix Inc.) on ice for a total time of 10 min, using 20-s pulses and 40-s cooling periods. The lysate was centrifuged (27,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was passed through a Buffer A-equilibrated Ni2+-charged His-Trap column (1 ml; GE Healthcare). The column was subsequently washed with 50 ml of Buffer A with 20 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with a 50–300 mm step gradient of imidazole. Fractions containing protein were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. After dialysis, proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration to 8 mg/ml using a 10 kDa cut-off (Centriprep, Millipore). Prior to setting up crystallization trials, N-terminally tagged PimB′ was incubated overnight with 10 mm GDP-Man. Commercial sparse matrix screens (Molecular Dimensions) were used to identify crystallization conditions in hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments. Thin plate crystals formed at 6–26% PEG 3350, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, 0.1 m lithium sulfate, and 0.1 m glycine. Crystals were cryoprotected by adding reservoir solution supplemented with 8% (w/v) sucrose and 8% (v/v) glycerol to the crystallization drop with subsequent flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of N-terminally tagged PimB′ were in space group P1, diffracting to 3.5 Å on the in-house x-ray source (Rigaku MicroMax 007HF, Saturn 944 CCD) and to 2.2 Å at the synchrotron. Single wavelength data of native C. glutamicum PimB′ were recorded on beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France) (Table 1) at 10% transmission. Analysis of the Matthews volume suggested the presence of two molecules of PimB′ per asymmetric unit (VM = 2.28 Da/Å3) with a predicted solvent fraction of 47%. Initial attempts to phase by molecular replacement resulted in a statistically significant solution in terms of the PHASER Z-score (Z = 9.0, resolution range 10–3 Å) (31McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14746) Google Scholar) but failed to yield a useful electron density map. Because the thin plate crystals did not tolerate soaking in heavy metal salts, we generated SeMet-derivatized crystals of PimB′ and recorded data at the Se-K edge (Table 1). Significant radiation damage of the cryogenically cooled crystals limited data acquisition to the peak wavelength and, due to the triclinic symmetry, resulted in data of low multiplicity (Table 1). In order to optimize the anomalous signal and completeness of Bijvoet pairs, an inverse beam protocol was used, recording data in sets of 20 successive frames (0.5° oscillation) at φ and φ + 180°, respectively. Data were reduced using XDS and XSCALE (32Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). Only one of several SeMet single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data sets (SeMet 1 in Table 1) recorded from a series of crystals provided a sufficiently strong anomalous signal to extract the selenium positions using SHELXD (33Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81063) Google Scholar). Patterson self-rotation maps indicated a non-crystallographic (NCS) 2-fold rotation axis parallel to the b-axis, consistent with the assumption of two molecules per asymmetric unit. Therefore, selenium positions obtained in runs of SHELXD were analyzed with PROFESSS (34CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) to derive the NCS operator and to verify that this operator was consistent with the self-rotation function. An initial set of 10 selenium positions (five per molecule) could be identified this way. Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing in SHARP (35de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) allowed us to establish an additional set of eight positions through difference Fourier analysis. Thus, 18 of 20 possible selenium positions were obtained but were not sufficient to obtain an interpretable map, either in single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the best SeMet data or in phasing by multiple isomorphous replacement using the best SeMet together with the native data.TABLE 1Data acquisition and structure refinement statisticsData acquisitionPimB′ + GDP-ManSeMet 1SeMet 2SeMet 3SeMet 4PimB′ + Br-GDP-ManPimB′ + GDP-ManPimB′ + GDPBeamlineESRF ID29Diamond I04Diamond I04ESRF ID23.1ESRF ID29Diamond I02Diamond I04ESRF ID14.2Wavelength (Å)0.97620.98050.98050.979050.978880.92010.97630.933Space groupP1P1P1P1P1P1P212121P212121Cell parameters a, b, c (Å)44.1, 50.0, 85.344.1, 50.1, 85.344.1, 50.0, 85.343.9, 49.9, 85.444.0, 50.0, 85.743.9, 49.9, 85.744.8, 87.0, 106.944.8, 86.3, 106.4Cell parameters α, β, γ92.1, 92.7, 89.992.2, 92.6, 90.192.0, 92.8, 90.091.9, 92.4, 90.192.2, 92.6, 90.092.1, 92.7, 89.990, 90, 9090, 90, 90Resolution (Å)44.0-2.229.96-2.9029.91-2.9025.38-2.9029.97-2.8029.91-2.9037.29-2.045.37-2.23High resolution shell (Å)2.32-2.203.06-2.903.06-2.903.06-2.902.95-2.803.06-2.902.11-2.002.35-2.23Rmerge (%)aHigh resolution shell in parentheses.7.3 (23.8)4.9 (11.1)7.1 (15.5)6.7 (11.3)8.5 (18.1)11.6 (26.2)9.6 (38)9.3 (38.2)Total no. of observationsaHigh resolution shell in parentheses.103582 (12352)40261 (5462)46289 (6804)44487 (6484)52162 (7446)46058 (6569)208274 (29919)64840 (4871)Unique reflectionsaHigh resolution shell in parentheses.35191 (4400)13101 (1951)13931 (2092)13532 (2027)17456 (2507)15023 (2197)28997 (4147)19982 (2147)〈I/σ(I)〉aHigh resolution shell in parentheses.11.6 (5.9)18.1 (7.1)11.6 (5.3)12.5 (7.8)9 (5.2)7.2 (3.2)18.3 (5.7)9.9 (2.3)Completeness (%)aHigh resolution shell in parentheses.95.1 (81.2)81 (83.1)86.4 (89.3)84 (86.4)97.4 (95.8)93.4 (93.4)100 (99.8)95.8 (72.5)MultiplicityaHigh resolution shell in parentheses.2.9 (2.8)3.1 (2.8)3.3 (3.3)3.3 (3.2)3 (3)3.1 (3.0)7.2 (7.2)3.2 (2.3)Anomalous completeness (%)aHigh resolution shell in parentheses.70.5 (70.0)84.5 (87.1)77.3 (80.3)92.5 (90.1)82.4 (82.7)Anomalous multiplicityaHigh resolution shell in parentheses.1.7 (1.6)1.7 (1.7)1.7 (1.7)1.5 (1.5)1.7 (1.6)Δano correlation between half-setsaHigh resolution shell in parentheses.0.483 (0.174)0.272 (0.138)0.265 (0.132)0.246 (0.198)0.101 (0.073)RefinementPimB′ + GDP-ManPimB′ + GDP-Man (orth)PimB′ + GDP (orth)Space groupP1P212121P212121Resolution range (Å)44.0–2.237.3–2.045.4–2.4Unique reflections332432751915991Rcryst (%)18.920.319Rfree (%)bRfree was calculated based on 5% of reflections set aside for cross-validation.22.123.223.6No. of non-hydrogen atoms Total623530683019 Protein582928292851 Ligand565628 Solvent350183140r.m.s. deviation bonds (Å)cDeviations relative to ideal bond distances and angles in Ref. 53.0.0080.0070.007r.m.s. deviation angles (degrees)cDeviations relative to ideal bond distances and angles in Ref. 53.1.151.021.09B-factor (Å2) Wilson17.315.928 Average13.114.220.4 Protein12.213.820.1 Ligand31.920.638.2 Solvent17.519.324.7r.m.s. deviation B-factor Between bonded main chain atoms0.420.260.34 Bonded side chain atoms1.170.650.55Ramachandran plotdCalculated using MOLPROBITY (54).

Open table in a new tab Next, we co-crystallized PimB′ (N-terminally tagged) with a brominated derivative of GDP-Man, the synthesis of which has been described (36Collier A. Wagner G.K. Chem. Commun. 2008; : 178-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combining the PimB′ native data with this brominated derivative and the best four SeMet data sets led to a density map with recognizable secondary structure features (supplemental Fig. 2SA), albeit still too poor to build. 2-fold NCS averaging and phase extension to nominally 2.2 Å distinctly improved the map (supplemental Fig. 2SB). In order to support map interpretation, we reconciled the previously established molecular replacement solution with the experimentally determined set of selenium positions. This was aided by generating a homology model of the C-terminal domain of PimB′ (using MODELLER (37Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Pieper U. Sali A. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2007; (Chapter 2, Unit 2.9)PubMed Google Scholar)), which reproduced a subset of distance vectors between selenium positions. Superimposing the homology model onto the experimental map aided interpretation of poorly defined areas, greatly accelerating model building. Iterative rounds of model building and minimization in REFMAC5 (38Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) very quickly led to a high quality 2Fo − Fc map (supplemental Fig. 2SC) that revealed previously undefined parts of the structure. The final model describes residues 4–381 of the PimB′ (381 residues), with excellent stereochemistry (Table 1). In both molecules of the triclinic crystals, the active site contains weak density for GDP-Man. Therefore, the ligand was omitted from the model until the structure refinement had converged to Rcryst/Rfree values of 19.1%/22.4%. Adding GDP to this late stage model, at full occupancy, reduced Rfree marginally, giving rise to negative difference density. Systematic variation of the occupancy of GDP between 0.5 and 1 resulted in a flat difference map around the ligand for 0.75. At this occupancy, the B-factors of the ligand atoms refined to an average of 31 Å2, compared with a protein average of 12.5 Å2 and an overall Wilson B-factor of 19.3 Å2. Although density for the mannose moiety is visible (see Fig. 4A), it is insufficient to fit the saccharide unequivocally. C-terminally tagged PimB′ (8 mg/ml) was incubated overnight with either GDP or GDP-Man (20 mm) prior to setting up vapor diffusion experiments. Crystals of sufficient size appeared over reservoirs containing 0.1 m dl-malic acid, pH 6.1, 13% PEG 3350 (GDP-Man complex) or 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.1, 22% PEG 3350 (GDP complex). Crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 8% (w/v) sucrose and 8% glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The structure of the orthorhombic crystal form of PimB′ was solved by molecular replacement, using a monomer of the refined “triclinic” structure as search model in PHASER (31McCoy A.J.

Each residue of TM VI was mutated to cysteine in the background of the cysteineless NHE1 protein, and the sensitivity to water-soluble sulfhydryl-reactive compounds (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) and (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) was determined for those residues with significant activity remaining. Three residues were essentially inactive when mutated to Cys: Asp238, Pro239, and Glu247. Of the remaining residues, proteins with the mutations N227C, I233C, and L243C were strongly inhibited by MTSET, whereas amino acids Phe230, Gly231, Ala236, Val237, Ala244, Val245, and Glu248 were partially inhibited by MTSET. MTSES did not affect the activity of the mutant NHE1 proteins. The structure of a peptide representing TM VI was determined using high resolution NMR spectroscopy in dodecylphosphocholine micelles.

https://openalex.org/W2066136818,"In this study, we tested the efficacy of increasing liver glycogen synthase to improve blood glucose homeostasis. The overexpression of wild-type liver glycogen synthase in rats had no effect on blood glucose homeostasis in either the fed or the fasted state. In contrast, the expression of a constitutively active mutant form of the enzyme caused a significant lowering of blood glucose in the former but not the latter state. Moreover, it markedly enhanced the clearance of blood glucose when fasted rats were challenged with a glucose load. Hepatic glycogen stores in rats overexpressing the activated mutant form of liver glycogen synthase were enhanced in the fed state and in response to an oral glucose load but showed a net decline during fasting. In order to test whether these effects were maintained during long term activation of liver glycogen synthase, we generated liver-specific transgenic mice expressing the constitutively active LGS form. These mice also showed an enhanced capacity to store glycogen in the fed state and an improved glucose tolerance when challenged with a glucose load. Thus, we conclude that the activation of liver glycogen synthase improves glucose tolerance in the fed state without compromising glycogenolysis in the postabsorptive state. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the activation of liver glycogen synthase may provide a potential strategy for improvement of glucose tolerance in the postprandial state."
https://openalex.org/W1970787607,"Solid tumor development is frequently accompanied by energy-deficient conditions such as glucose deprivation and hypoxia. Follistatin (FST), a secretory protein originally identified from ovarian follicular fluid, has been suggested to be involved in tumor development. However, whether it plays a role in cancer cell survival under energy-deprived conditions remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that glucose deprivation markedly enhanced the expression and nucleolar localization of FST in HeLa cells. The nucleolar localization of FST relied on its nuclear localization signal (NLS) comprising the residues 64–87. Localization of FST to the nucleolus attenuated rRNA synthesis, a key process for cellular energy homeostasis and cell survival. Overexpression of FST delayed glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of FST exerted the opposite effect. These functions depended on the presence of an intact NLS because the NLS-deleted mutant of FST lost the rRNA inhibition effect and the cell protective effect.

Altogether, we identified a novel nucleolar function of FST, which is of importance in the modulation of cancer cell survival in response to glucose deprivation. Solid tumors over a certain size are continuously exposed to glucose deficiency and hypoxia microenvironments because of the inadequate vascular supply. The cancer cells comprising these tumors thus have to limit energy expenditure to survive under such energy-deprived conditions (1Dewhirst M.W. Cao Y. Moeller B. Nat. Rev.

An effective way is to reduce ribosome biogenesis, the most energy-consuming process in eukaryotic cells. As a matter of fact, the rate of cellular rRNA transcription is tightly regulated in response to metabolic changes (3Grummt I.

Energy deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase, which then inactivates the polymerase I-associated transcription factor TIF-IA and thereby impairs rRNA synthesis (6Hoppe S. Bierhoff H.

Later, FST was found to be expressed in a variety of tissues and organisms, participating in various processes such as cell growth, development, differentiation, and secretion (12Hemmati-Brivanlou A.

Recently, several reports have shown that FST regulates a variety of processes during tumor progression including angiogenesis (14Krneta J. Kroll J. Alves F. Prahst C. Sananbenesi F. Dullin C.

In this study, we report that FST was up-regulated and translocated to the nucleoli in HeLa cells in response to glucose deprivation. Nucleolar accumulation of FST caused cells to reduce rRNA transcription, which in turn protected them from glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis. HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher) and penicillin-streptomycin mixed solution (Invitrogen). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. To achieve glucose deprivation, the cells were washed with PBS and transferred to glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen). The whole cell lysate was extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) with freshly added complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and cleared by centrifugation (13,200 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). To detect the subcellular distribution of FST, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared according to the previously reported method (21Saito S. Sidis Y. Mukherjee A. Xia Y. Schneyer A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5052-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). The suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min before adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.3% to allow a sufficient breakage of the cytoplasmic membranes. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the resultant supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with hypotonic buffer and reconstituted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The resultant supernatant was used as the nuclear lysate. The proteins were qualified using a modified Bradford protocol (Bio-Rad) and applied to immunoblotting analysis as described previously (22Hu H. Gao X. Sun Y. Zhou J. Yang M. Xu Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The membrane was blocked with 3% bone serum album in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), probed with antibodies targeting to FST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), α-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), Lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or PARP (Cell Signaling Technology), incubated with horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies, detected with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and finally exposed to an x-ray film. Cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After rinsing twice with PBS, the cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with monoclonal anti-FST monoclonal antibodies (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) together with anti-nucleolin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, stained with the appropriate FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS for 1 h and mounted on microscope slides. Confocal microscopic images were obtained with a Zeiss confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY). The relative fluorescence intensities were quantified with Image J software. The construction of pECFP-FST, in which a FST gene lacking its signal sequence has been fused to the C terminus of the enhanced CFP gene, was described previously (20Gao X. Hu H. Zhu J. Xu Z. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5505-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To construct CFP-tagged FST deletion mutants, the corresponding DNA domains (supplemental Table S1) were amplified by PCR from plasmid pFS288mycHis (kindly provided by Henry T. Keutmann, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) using the primers listed in supplemental Table S2. PCR products were cloned into the pECFP-C1 vector to produce fusion proteins with the CFP in the N terminus. To generate FST eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA-FST, full FST gene with its signal sequence was amplified by PCR from plasmid pFS288mycHis using primer set sigFST-F/sigFST-R (supplemental Table S2) and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of vector pcDNA3.1(+). To generate the plasmid pcDNA-FST/ΔNLS for eukaryotic expression of NLS-deleted FST, cDNAs encoding the N-terminal (residues −29 to 63) and C-terminal (residues 88–288) of the FST gene were amplified (supplemental Table S1) and cloned to the EcoRI and XhoI sites of vector pcDNA3.1(+). All of the primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S2. ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HeLa cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was stopped with 0.125 m glycine. The cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). After sonication to yield DNA fragments of 300–1000 base pairs, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation, diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors), and precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. For each immunoprecipitation assay, the lysates were incubated with 5 μg of anti-FST (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-K4-dimethylated histone H3 (H3K4me2) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-acetylated histone H3 (acetyl-H3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), or control IgGs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The immunocomplexes were then collected with protein G-agarose slurry, eluted, and de-cross-linked at 65 °C. After RNase digestion and proteinase digestion, immunoprecipitated DNA was extracted. The purified DNA was amplified by real time PCR with the ABI7900 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences for rDNA were as reported (23Grandori C. Gomez-Roman N. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Ngouenet C. Galloway D.A. Eisenman R.N. White R.J. Nat.

The primer sequences for the GAPDH gene were as follows: 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′. To knock down the endogenous FST, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 10 nm of the chemically synthesized siRNAs targeting FST or with the negative control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were harvested or treated for further experiments 48 h after transfection. siRNA sequences used in the present study are designed as follows: FST siRNA1 (FSTi-1): forward, GAUCUAUUGGAUUAGCCUATT, and reverse, UAGGCUAAUCCAAUAGAUCTG; FST siRNA2 (FSTi-2): forward, GGUCCUGUACAAGACCGAATT, and reverse, UUCGGUCUUGUACAGGACCTG; and negative control siRNA: forward, UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT, and reverse, ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT. siRNAs were synthesized by GenePhama (Shanghai, China). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 0.5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Real time quantitative PCR analysis was performed in 10-μl reactions using the ABI7900 (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers 5′-CCTGCTGTTCTCTCGCGCGTCCGAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCTCGTCTCGTCTCACT-3′ were used for PCR amplification of 5′ external transcribed spacer of the human pre-rRNA as described (23Grandori C. Gomez-Roman N. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Ngouenet C. Galloway D.A. Eisenman R.N. White R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Primers 5′-TTGCGTTACACCCTTTCTTG-3′ and 5′-CACCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTT-3′ were used for β-actin gene amplification. Primers 5′-GGGAACTGCTGGCTCC-3′ and 5′-TTTACAGGGGATGCAG-3′ were used for FST gene amplification. Expression of pre-rRNA and FST gene was normalized relative to β-actin endogenous control using the 2−ΔΔCT method (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). RNA was separated on the agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. Hybridization was carried out using a DIG Northern starter kit (Roche Applied Science). The digoxigenin-labeled probes were synthesized by TaKaRa Biotechnology Company (Dalian, China). The probe sequence for 47 S rRNA is 5′-GGTCGCCAGAGGACAGCGTGTCAG-3′. The probe sequence for β-actin mRNA is 5′-AGGGATAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAAC-3′. The plasmid pcDNA-FST, pcDNA-FST/ΔNLS, or the null vector pcDNA3.1 was transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The cells were then selected with 500 μg/ml of G-418. Cell clones were subsequently screened by immunoblotting analysis with anti-FST polyclonal antibody. FST- or FST/ΔNLS-expressing clones were then obtained for further experiments. Both floating (dead) and attached cells were harvested and applied to different assays for apoptosis detection. The cells were incubated with 5 μl of annexin V-FITC (Biovision, Mountain View, CA) and 10 μl of PI for 10 min and analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Annexin V-FITC staining was detected in the FL1 channel, whereas PI staining was monitored in the FL3 channel. Alternatively, total proteins were extracted, and PARP cleavage was visualized by immunoblotting. Because survival of cancer cells under energy deficiency conditions is an important aspect for tumor progression, it is of interest to study whether FST is involved in this process. Therefore, we first measured FST expression in HeLa cells when glucose in the medium was withdrawn. The data showed that the mRNA level of FST started to increase 1 h after glucose deprivation and reached the peak at 12 h (Fig. 1A). The protein level started to significantly increase 6 h after glucose removal (Fig. 1B). Because overexpressed FST-CFP was reported to localize in the nuclei of HeLa cells (20Gao X. Hu H. Zhu J. Xu Z. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5505-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we therefore analyze the subcellular localization of the endogenous FST in response to glucose deprivation. HeLa cells cultured with or without glucose were stained with FST monoclonal antibodies using the indirect immunofluorescence method and observed under a confocal microscope. Surprisingly, the endogenous FST showed clear nucleolar localization in addition to its commonly reported cytoplasm distribution (21Saito S. Sidis Y. Mukherjee A. Xia Y. Schneyer A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5052-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Tortoriello D.V. Sidis Y. Holtzman D.A. Holmes W.E. Schneyer A.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Glucose deprivation enhanced the FST expression, and a great fraction was in the nucleus (44% in normal conditions versus 57% under glucose deprivation; Fig. 1C). The nucleolar localization was confirmed by simultaneous staining of the nucleolar protein nucleolin (Fig. 1C). To exclude artifacts that might have occurred in the staining, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were fractioned and applied to immunoblotting analysis. The data showed that FST was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas the nuclear FST increased when glucose was deprived (Fig. 1D). Taken together, our data revealed that FST is a nucleolar protein and that glucose deprivation promotes its expression and nucleolar localization. Nuclear import of a protein generally relies on the presence of a NLS (26Jans D.A. Hassan G. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, bioinformatics searching of FST sequence by the programs PROSITE (27Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and PredictNLS (28Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) failed to detect any traditional NLSs in it. To map a potential NLS, a series of FST truncated fragments were fused to the C-terminal of CFP, and subcellular localizations of the fusion proteins were observed with a confocal microscope. Our results showed that FST mutants containing residues 64–87 accumulated in the nucleus, whereas FST mutants lacking these residues did not (Fig. 2, A and B). The data demonstrated that residues 64–87 are both essential and sufficient for FST nuclear localization. Sequence analysis revealed that it contained several basic amino acids (75KKCRMNKKNKPR86), which is in accordance with the common characteristic of a NLS (29Fontes M.R. Teh T. Jans D. Brinkworth R.I. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27981-27987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To further explore whether those residues could control the nucleolar localization of FST as well, we expressed full-length FST and NLS-deleted FST (FST/ΔNLS) in HeLa cells and detected their localizations using the immunofluorescence method. The data showed that the full-length FST could accumulate in the nucleolus but the NLS-deleted FST could not (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that residues 64–87 in FST indeed control its nucleolar localization. It should be noted that full-length FST was mainly localized in the nucleolus (Fig. 2C), whereas the signal peptide-deleted FST-CFP was diffused in the nucleus (Fig. 2B, FST/1–288), suggesting that the signal peptide might play a role in controlling FST nucleolar translocation, or the CFP might influence the localization. Ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) reside in the nucleoli, and nucleolar localization of FST suggests that FST might bind to rDNA. To test this possibility, we performed ChIP assays in HeLa cells with anti-FST antibody. DNA enrichment was measured by real time PCR using sets of primer pairs spanning the rRNA gene promoter (H42.9), the 47 S rRNA coding region (H1), the 28 S rRNA coding region (H8), or the intergenic spacer region (H18), respectively (Fig. 3A). The data revealed that endogenous FST was bound throughout the rDNA loci, and glucose deprivation significantly increased the binding of FST to rDNA (Fig. 3B). Association of FST with rDNA clusters prompted us to test whether FST could regulate rRNA transcription. For this purpose, the levels of 47 S pre-rRNA were measured by both RT quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Northern blot when FST expression was down-regulated or overexpressed. The silencing of FST with siRNAs (FSTi-1 and FSTi-2) resulted in an increased expression of pre-rRNA compared with the control siRNA under normal glucose conditions (Fig. 3C), suggesting that FST is a repressor of rRNA transcription. Glucose deprivation decreased pre-rRNA expression, and knockdown of FST under glucose-deprived conditions also increased the pre-rRNA level (Fig. 3C). However, the pre-rRNA level was lower than the one in FST down-regulated but normal glucose-cultured cells, suggesting that other mediators might participate in glucose deprivation-repressed rRNA synthesis as well (Fig. 3C). Consistently, cells overexpressing FST displayed a marked decrease in pre-rRNA synthesis compared with null vector-transfected cells under both normal and glucose-deprived conditions (Fig. 3D). To investigate whether FST-mediated rRNA repression relies on its nucleolar localization, pre-rRNA levels in cells expressing NLS-deleted FST (FST/ΔNLS) were also measured. The data revealed that the loss of NLS prevented FST from repressing rRNA synthesis (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our data demonstrated that nucleolar FST directly binds to rDNA and inhibits pre-rRNA synthesis. Epigenetic modifications of histones play key roles in regulating rRNA transcription (30McStay B. Grummt I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 31Grummt I. Ladurner A.G. Cell. 2008; 133: 577-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To explore whether the nucleolar FST attenuates rRNA synthesis through affecting histone modifications, we employed ChIP assays to analyze the H3K4me2 and acetyl-H3 status when FST was down-regulated. The data showed that knockdown of FST with FSTi-1 significantly increased the H3K4me2 level at the rDNA region, especially near the transcription start site (H42.9; Fig. 4A), and the acetyl-H3 level at the intergenic spacer region (H18; Fig. 4B). The same histone modification pattern was observed under glucose deprivation (Fig. 4, A and B). To further confirm the above results, we stably expressed FST in HeLa cells. Real time PCR confirmed that nucleolar accumulation of FST resulted in a reduction of pre-rRNA synthesis (supplemental Fig. S1). ChIP analysis revealed that overexpressed FST decreased the H3K4me2 and acetyl-H3 levels at the rDNA region under both normal and glucose-deprived conditions (Fig. 4, C and D). The NLS-deleted mutant served as non-nucleolar control and had no effect on these modifications. Because both H3K4me2 and acetyl-H3 are recognized as active gene markers (32Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7578) Google Scholar, 33Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), our results suggested that nucleolar FST might change the ratio of euchromatin to heterochromatin and then decrease the rRNA transcription. Apoptosis is a common cellular response to metabolic stress in mammalian cells. Cellular energy reservation has been reported to protect cells from glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis (34Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2969) Google Scholar, 35Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), and down-regulating rRNA transcription is one of the key mechanisms (8Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M. Nagata K. Fukamizu A. Kimura K. Shimizu T. Yanagisawa J. Cell. 2008; 133: 627-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because FST repressed rRNA transcription and its expression was up-regulated in response to glucose deprivation, we suspected that FST has an anti-apoptotic role. To test this hypothesis, the expression of FST was down-regulated with the siRNA FSTi-1, and apoptosis was determined by an annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. The fractions of annexin V-positive cells were low in both groups (6.2 ± 0.4 and 5.9 ± 0.6%, respectively) under normal glucose conditions. Glucose deprivation markedly increased cell apoptosis in control siRNA-transfected HeLa cells (48.6 ± 7.5%), and elimination of FST enhanced the apoptotic tendency to 72.9 ± 2.9% (p < 0.01 compared with control) (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that FST has a protective role on apoptosis. The cleavage of PARP is recognized as an apoptosis marker. Our data revealed that PARP was cleaved after glucose deprivation and that down-regulation of FST increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 5C). To further confirm the protective effect of FST on glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis and to determine the role of nucleolar FST in this process, the apoptotic rates of HeLa cells stably transfected with FST, FST/ΔNLS, or null vector were determined. The apoptotic tendency induced by glucose deprivation was significantly reduced in FST-expressing cells compared with control (29.2 ± 1.2% versus 43.5 ± 4.7%, p < 0.01), but not in FST/ΔNLS-expressing cells (41.6 ± 1.7%) (Fig. 5, D and E), indicating that the protective effect of FST relied on its nucleolar localization. PARP cleavage detection also revealed a consistent result (Fig. 5F). Meanwhile, we performed a TUNEL assay to determine cell apoptosis and found that overexpression of FST inhibited glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis (20.5% versus 42.5%), whereas knockdown of FST promoted glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis (61.1% versus 41.1%), further confirming the protective effect of FST (data not shown). FST was traditionally recognized as a secretory protein and has been reported to exert its biological functions through extracellularly inactivating activin (36Phillips D.J. de Kretser D.M. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 19: 287-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), myostatin (18Amthor H. Nicholas G. McKinnell I. Kemp C.F. Sharma M. Kambadur R. Patel K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and bone morphogenic proteins (19Glister C. Kemp C.F. Knight P.G. Reproduction. 2004; 127: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, nuclear localization of FST has been observed in epithelial cells of breast tissue (37Bloise E. Couto H.L. Massai L. Ciarmela P. Mencarelli M. Borges L.E. Muscettola M. Grasso G. Amaral V.F. Cassali G.D. Petraglia F. Reis F.M. BMC Cancer. 2009; 9: 320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells (20Gao X. Hu H. Zhu J. Xu Z. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5505-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible nuclear function of FST. In this study, we provide experimental evidence to support a nucleolar function of FST-inhibiting rRNA synthesis and promoting cancer cell survival. The major findings of our study include: 1) glucose deprivation significantly increases endogenous expression and nucleolar accumulation of FST; 2) nucleolar translocation of FST is dependent on its NLS comprised of residues 64–87; 3) the nucleolar FST negatively regulates rRNA synthesis; and 4) the nucleolar FST inhibits glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that repression of rRNA synthesis by the nucleolar FST plays a vital role in inhibiting glucose deprivation-induced cell apoptosis, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The regulation of rRNA transcription is complicated and not restricted to the promoter region. One human rDNA transcription unit contains a pre-rRNA coding sequence separated by a long intergenic spacer. Regulatory elements, including gene promoters, spacer promoters, repetitive enhancer elements, and transcription terminators, are located in the long intergenic spacer (3Grummt I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Many rRNA transcription regulators have been reported to be associated with the entire rDNA region. The upstream binding factor binds throughout the long intergenic spacer, and the transcribed region of rDNA repeats with low sequence specificity of DNA binding (38O'Sullivan A.C. Sullivan G.J. McStay B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and plays an important structural and functional role in the formation of active nucleolar organizer regions (39Mais C. Wright J.E. Prieto J.L. Raggett S.L. McStay B. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). c-Myc was reported to bind to the E-box sequence within the promoter region, the coding region as well as the long intergenic spacer region of rDNA. The binding of c-Myc with rDNA influences polymerase I machinery formation and histone acetylation at rDNA (23Grandori C. Gomez-Roman N. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Ngouenet C. Galloway D.A. Eisenman R.N. White R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Histone-modifying proteins such as the eNoSC (8Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M. Nagata K. Fukamizu A. Kimura K. Shimizu T. Yanagisawa J. Cell. 2008; 133: 627-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and the plant homeo domain finger protein 8 (40Feng W. Yonezawa M. Ye J. Jenuwein T. Grummt I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) were also reported to be associated with the entire rDNA. Here we found that FST could also bind throughout the rDNA loci and function as an rRNA transcription repressor. Further studies are needed to determine how FST discriminates rDNA from the remainder of the genome and whether there are conserved DNA elements within FST-binding regions. Ribosomal RNA genes are present in hundreds of copies in the genome, and its transcription level could be controlled by regulating the transcription rate per gene or by varying the number of active genes epigenetically (30McStay B. Grummt I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 31Grummt I. Ladurner A.G. Cell. 2008; 133: 577-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A key player in the epigenetic state establishment at the rDNA region is TTF-I. TTF-I binds to the promoter-proximal terminator T0 and recruits the nucleolar remodeling complex to the rDNA promoter. The nucleolar remodeling complex is composed of two subunits: the ATPase SNF2h and TTF-I-interacting protein 5. TTF-I-interacting protein 5 recruits histone-modifying enzymes to induce histone methylations at H3K9, and H3K27, histone demethylations at H3K4, as well as histone deacetylations. The ATPase SNF2h may senses the signals of heterochromatic histone modifications and induces rDNA silencing (30McStay B. Grummt I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We found that the euchromatin marker H3K4me2 levels were reduced at the rDNA promoter region in FST down-regulated cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that FST represses rRNA levels partially through reducing the number of active rRNA genes. Further studies on the relationships between FST and the nucleolar remodeling complex and other histone-modifying enzymes will improve our knowledge on the mechanisms of FST-regulated rRNA transcription. The synthesis of rRNA is tightly tuned to match environmental nutrition conditions. Because of insufficient nutrition supply, cells thus have to down-regulate rRNA synthesis to reduce energy utilization and make a survival. Our data demonstrated that up-regulation of FST expression is one of the mechanisms for cancer cells to restrict rRNA synthesis under glucose-deprived conditions (Fig. 3C) and then protect cells from apoptosis (Fig. 5). However, the data also showed that FST down-regulated cells express lower levels of pre-rRNA under glucose-deprived conditions than under normal conditions (Fig. 3C), suggesting that other mediators were synchronously involved in glucose deprivation-repressed rRNA synthesis. Recently, eNoSC (8Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M. Nagata K. Fukamizu A. Kimura K. Shimizu T. Yanagisawa J. Cell. 2008; 133: 627-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) has been reported to induce rDNA silencing on glucose deprivation. Therefore, FST might work in concert with eNoSC to achieve rRNA gene silencing and thus low energy consumption. Because the increased resistance of cancer cells to glucose deficiency contributes positively to tumor progression (2Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (9964) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that FST could promote tumor development. As a matter of fact, FST has been implied to facilitate tumorigenesis. Up-regulated expression of FST was observed in experimentally induced rodent liver tumors (41Grusch M. Drucker C. Peter-Vörösmarty B. Erlach N. Lackner A. Losert A. Macheiner D. Schneider W.J. Hermann M. Groome N.P. Parzefall W. Berger W. Grasl-Kraupp B. Schulte-Hermann R. J.

Losert A. Macheiner D. Schneider W.J. Hermann M. Groome N.P. Parzefall W. Berger W. Grasl-Kraupp B. Schulte-Hermann R. J. Hepatol. 2006; 45: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and mouse gastric tumors (42Kang W. Saqui-Salces M. Zavros Y. Merchant J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 376: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the deficiency of the tumor suppressor gene parkin caused the up-regulation of endogenous FST and rendered hepatocytes resistant to apoptosis in a FST-dependent manner, which resulted in hepatic tumor development (16Fujiwara M. Marusawa H. Wang H.Q. Iwai A. Ikeuchi K. Imai Y. Kataoka A. Nukina N. Takahashi R. Chiba T. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6002-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that an inhibitory role of FST in tumor development has also been reported (14Krneta J. Kroll J. Alves F. Prahst C. Sananbenesi F. Dullin C. Kimmina S. Phillips D.J. Augustin H.G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5686-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Ogino H. Yano S. Kakiuchi S. Muguruma H. Ikuta K. Hanibuchi M. Uehara H. Tsuchida K. Sugino H. Sone S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hence, FST might play different roles in different types of tumors and in different stages during tumor progression. In summary, FST has an anti-apoptotic effect in glucose deprivation condition through the inhibition of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis. Nucleolar translocation of FST is required to exert the effect. This activity of FST represents a novel molecular mechanism of tumor cell survival under conditions of glucose deprivation and may be a possible target for tumor therapy.

The preferred substrates of the enzyme are 2-keto-4-hydroxy acids with a 4-carboxylate substitution. The enzyme also exhibits oxaloacetate decarboxylation and pyruvate α-proton exchange activity. Sodium oxalate is a competitive inhibitor of the aldolase reaction. The pH dependence of k(cat)/K(m) and k(cat) for the enzyme is consistent with a single deprotonation with pK(a) values of 8.0 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.1 for free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex, respectively. The 1.8 Å x-ray structure shows a four-layered α-β-β-α sandwich structure with the active site at the interface of two adjacent subunits of a hexamer; this fold resembles the RNase E inhibitor, RraA, but is novel for an aldolase. The catalytic site contains a magnesium ion ligated by Asp-124 as well as three water molecules bound by Asp-102 and Glu-199'. A pyruvate molecule binds the magnesium ion through both carboxylate and keto oxygen atoms, completing the octahedral geometry. The carbonyl oxygen also forms hydrogen bonds with the guanadinium group of Arg-123, which site-directed mutagenesis confirms is essential for catalysis. A mechanism for HMG/CHA aldolase is proposed on the basis of the structure, kinetics, and previously established features of other aldolase mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2050564100,"Alterations in glycosylation play an important role during intestinal cell differentiation. Here, we compared expression of mucin-type O-glycan synthases from proliferating and differentiated HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. Mucin-type O-glycan structures were analyzed at both stages by mass spectrometry. Core2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-2 (C2GnT-2) was markedly increased in differentiated HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, but the core3 structure was hardly detectable. To determine whether such differential expression of mucin-type O-glycan structures has physiological significance in intestinal cell differentiation, expression of sucrase isomaltase (SI) and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV), two well known intestinal differentiation markers, was examined. Interestingly, the fully glycosylated mature form of SI was decreased in C2GnT-2 knock-out mice but not in core2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-3 (C2GnT-3) nulls. In addition, expression of SI and DPP-IV was dramatically reduced in C2GnT-1-3 triple knock-out mice. These patterns were confirmed by RNAi analysis; C2GnT-2 knockdown significantly reduced cell surface expression of SI and DPP-IV in Caco-2 cells. Similarly, overexpression of the core3 structure in HT-29 cells attenuated cell surface expression of both enzymes. These findings indicate that core3 O-glycan structure regulates cell surface expression of SI and DPP-IV and that core2 O-glycan is presumably an essential mucin-type O-glycan structure found in both molecules in vivo. Finally, goblet cells in the upper part of the crypt showed impaired maturation in the core2 O-glycan-deficient mice. These studies are the first to clearly identify functional mucin-type O-glycan structures modulating cell surface expression of SI and DPP-IV during the intestinal cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2067350937,"Degradation of the cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan is one of the earliest events that occurs in association with osteoarthritis. Little is known concerning the fate of the residual N-terminal G1 domains of cleaved aggrecan; domains that remain bound to hyaluronan. In this study, 68-72-kDa bands representative of aggrecan G1 domains containing ITEGE(373) neoepitope were detected within a hyaluronidase-sensitive pool at the cell surface of bovine articular chondrocytes and within a hyaluronidase-insensitive, intracellular pool. To determine the mechanisms that contribute to this distribution, CD44 expression was knocked down by siRNA or function by CD44-DN. Both approaches prevented the retention and internalization of G1-ITEGE. Inhibition of CD44 transit into lipid rafts blocked the endocytosis of G1-ITEGE but not the retention at the cell surface. Chondrocytes derived from CD44 null mice also exhibited limited potential for retention and internalization of G1-VTEGE. The consequence of a lack of chondrocyte-mediated endocytosis of these domains in cartilage of the CD44 null mice was the accumulation of the degradation fragments within the tissue. Additionally, chondrocytes or fibroblasts derived from CD44 null mice exhibited little capacity for retention and internalization of exogenous G1-ITEGE derived from bovine cartilage explants. Bovine or wild type mouse fibroblasts were able to bind and internalize bovine-derived G1-ITEGE. Although several pathways are available for the clearance of these domains, CD44-mediated cellular internalization is the most prominent."

The unspliced RNAs were retained in the nucleus, and block of nonsense-mediated decay did not affect their accumulation. Thus, a perturbation of human PRP2/DHX16 results in accumulation of unspliced transcripts, similar to the outcome in yeast prp2 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2053269710,"There is increasing evidence that thiazolidinediones (TZDs), antidiabetic compounds that are synthetic ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), have cardiovascular effects through as yet poorly defined mechanisms. We tested the effect of two TZD class drugs, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, on human aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Both TZDs dose dependently up-regulated IGF-1R protein levels (rosiglitazone, 10 μmol/liter, 67% increase, n = 4, p < 0.01; pioglitazone, 10 μmol/liter, 41% increase, n = 4, p < 0.01) and increased IGF-1R signaling activity (36% increase in Akt phosphorylation). However, the endogenous PPARγ ligand, 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2), dose dependently reduced IGF-1R (10 μmol/liter, 80% decrease, n = 4, p < 0.01), and overexpression of PPARγ using an adenovirus likewise reduced IGF-1R (50% decrease versus SMC infected with control adenovirus), suggesting a PPARγ-independent action of TZDs. All three PPARγ ligands (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2)), however, did not change IGF-1R mRNA levels, indicating that their effects were posttranscriptional. Use of bicistronic constructs revealed that TZD induction of IGF-1R translation occurred via internal ribosomal entry. To examine the potential physiological relevance of TZD up-regulation of IGF-1R, we determined the effect of rosiglitazone on oxidized LDL (oxLDL)-induced apoptosis. 20 μmol/liter of rosiglitazone reduced oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis by 40% and neutralizing antibody to IGF-1R (αIR3) counteracted this rescue, suggesting the rosiglitazone survival effect was, at least in part, mediated by IGF-1R. In conclusion, TZDs markedly up-regulate SMC IGF-1R expression and signaling, likely via a PPARγ-independent mechanism. This novel action of TZDs may play an important role in their cardiovascular effects."
https://openalex.org/W2025668322,"Because DNA damage is so rare, DNA glycosylases interact for the most part with undamaged DNA. Whereas the structural basis for recognition of DNA lesions by glycosylases has been studied extensively, less is known about the nature of the interaction between these proteins and undamaged DNA. Here we report the crystal structures of the DNA glycosylase AlkA in complex with undamaged DNA. The structures revealed a recognition mode in which the DNA is nearly straight, with no amino acid side chains inserted into the duplex, and the target base pair is fully intrahelical. A comparison of the present structures with that of AlkA recognizing an extrahelical lesion revealed conformational changes in both the DNA and protein as the glycosylase transitions from the interrogation of undamaged DNA to catalysis of nucleobase excision. Modeling studies with the cytotoxic lesion 3-methyladenine and accompanying biochemical experiments suggested that AlkA actively interrogates the minor groove of the DNA while probing for the presence of lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2080167396,"Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are molecular machines responsible for creating electrochemical gradients and preserving pH-dependent cellular compartments by way of proton translocation across the membrane. V-ATPases employ a dynamic rotary mechanism that is driven by ATP hydrolysis and the central rotor stalk. Regulation of this rotational catalysis is the result of a reversible V1Vo-domain dissociation that is required to preserve ATP during instances of cellular starvation. Recently the method by which the free V1-ATPase abrogates the hydrolytic breakdown of ATP upon dissociating from the membrane has become increasingly clear. In this instance the central stalk subunit F adopts an extended conformation to engage in a bridging interaction tethering the rotor and stator components together. However, the architecture by which this mechanism is stabilized has remained ambiguous despite previous work. In an effort to elucidate the method by which the rotational catalysis is maintained, the architecture of the peripheral stalks and their respective binding interactions was investigated using cryo-electron microscopy. In addition to confirming the bridging interaction exuded by subunit F for the first time in a eukaryotic V-ATPase, subunits C and H are seen interacting with one another in a tight interaction that provides a base for the three EG peripheral stalks. The formation of a CE3G3H sub-assembly appears to be unique to the dissociated V-ATPase and highlights the stator architecture in addition to revealing a possible intermediate in the assembly mechanism of the free V1-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2040578293,"Between-population crosses may replenish genetic variation of populations, but may also result in outbreeding depression. Apart from direct effects on plant fitness, these outbreeding effects can also alter plant-herbivore interactions by influencing plant tolerance and resistance to herbivory. We investigated effects of experimental within- and between-population outbreeding on herbivore resistance, tolerance and plant fitness using plants from 13 to 19 Lychnis flos-cuculi populations. We found no evidence for outbreeding depression in resistance reflected by the amount of leaf area consumed. However, herbivore performance was greater when fed on plants from between-population compared to within-population crosses. This can reflect outbreeding depression in resistance and/or outbreeding effects on plant quality for the herbivores. The effects of type of cross on the relationship between herbivore damage and plant fitness varied among populations. This demonstrates how between-population outbreeding effects on tolerance range from outbreeding depression to outbreeding benefits among plant populations. Finally, herbivore damage strengthened the observed outbreeding effects on plant fitness in several populations. These results raise novel considerations on the impact of outbreeding on the joint evolution of resistance and tolerance, and on the evolution of multiple defence strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1993680359,"Background Predictors of adverse events (AE) associated with nevirapine use are needed to better understand reports of severe rash or liver enzyme elevation (LEE) in HIV+ women. Methodology AE rates following ART initiation were retrospectively assessed in a multi-site cohort of 612 women. Predictors of onset of rash or LEE were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Principal Findings Of 612 subjects, 152 (24.8%) initiated NVP-based regimens with 86 (56.6%) pregnant; 460 (75.2%) initiated non-NVP regimens with 67 (14.6%) pregnant. LEE No significant difference was found between regimens in the development of new grade ≥2 LEE (p = 0.885). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated an increased likelihood of LEE with HCV co-infection (OR 2.502, 95% CI: 1.04 to 6, p = 0.040); pregnancy, NVP-based regimen, and baseline CD4 >250 cells/mm3 were not associated with this toxicity. Rash NVP initiation was associated with rash after controlling for CD4 and pregnancy (OR 2.78; 95%CI: 1.14–6.76), as was baseline CD4 >250 cells/mm3 when controlling for pregnancy and type of regimen (OR 2.68; 95% CI: 1.19–6.02 p = 0.017). Conclusions CD4 at initiation of therapy was a predictor of rash but not LEE with NVP use in HIV+ women. Pregnancy was not an independent risk factor for the development of AEs assessed. The findings from this study have significant implications for women of child-bearing age initiating NVP-based ART particularly in resource limited settings. This study sheds more confidence on the lack of LEE risk and the need to monitor rash with the use of this medication."
https://openalex.org/W2087527607,"The stimulation of fluid and electrolyte secretion in salivary cells results in ionic changes that promote rapid increases in the activity of the Na,K-ATPase. In many cell systems, there are conflicting findings concerning the regulation of the phosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit, which is the catalytic moiety. Initially, we investigated the phosphorylation sites on the α1 subunit in native rat parotid acinar cells using tandem mass spectrometry and identified two new phosphorylation sites (Ser222, Ser407), three sites (Ser217, Tyr260, Ser47) previously found from large scale proteomic screens, and two sites (Ser23, Ser16) known to be phosphorylated by PKC. Subsequently, we used phospho-specific antibodies to examine the regulation of phosphorylation on Ser23 and Ser16 and measured changes in ERK phosphorylation in parallel. The G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptor mimetic carbachol, the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, and the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A increased Ser23 α1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of classical PKC proteins blocked carbachol-stimulated Ser23 α1 subunit phosphorylation but not ERK phosphorylation, which was blocked by an inhibitor of novel PKC proteins. The carbachol-initiated phosphorylation of Ser23 α1 subunit was not modified by ERK or PKA activity. The Na,K-ATPase inhibitor ouabain reduced and enhanced the carbachol-promoted phosphorylation of Ser23 and Ser16, respectively, the latter because ouabain itself increased Ser16 phosphorylation; thus, both sites display conformational-dependent phosphorylation changes. Ouabain-initiated phosphorylation of Ser16 α1 was not blocked by PKC inhibitors, unlike carbachol- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-initiated phosphorylations, suggesting that this site was also a substrate for a kinase other than PKC.

https://openalex.org/W2163325287,"Discrete phonological phenomena form our conscious experience of language: continuous changes in pitch appear as distinct tones to the speakers of tone languages, whereas the speakers of quantity languages experience duration categorically. The categorical nature of our linguistic experience is directly reflected in the traditionally clear-cut linguistic classification of languages into tonal or non-tonal. However, some evidence suggests that duration and pitch are fundamentally interconnected and co-vary in signaling word meaning in non-tonal languages as well. We show that pitch information affects real-time language processing in a (non-tonal) quantity language. The results suggest that there is no unidirectional causal link from a genetically-based perceptual sensitivity towards pitch information to the appearance of a tone language. They further suggest that the contrastive categories tone and quantity may be based on simultaneously co-varying properties of the speech signal and the processing system, even though the conscious experience of the speakers may highlight only one discrete variable at a time."
https://openalex.org/W2098968239,"Androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in prostate cancer and male sexual differentiation. We have identified AR from a primitive vertebrate with a sex reversal characteristic, the rice field eel. AR of this species (eAR) is distinct from human AR, especially in the ligand binding domain (LBD), and its expression in gonads shows an increasing tendency during gonadal transformation from ovary via ovotestis to testis. eAR has a restricted androgen-dependent transactivation function after a nuclear translocation upon dihydrotestosterone exposure. A functional nuclear localization signal was further identified in the DNA binding domain and hinge region. Although nuclear export is CRM1-independent, eAR has a novel nuclear export signal, which is negatively charged, indicating that a nuclear export pathway may be mediated by electrostatic interaction. Further, our studies have identified critical sequences for ligand binding in the C terminus. A structure of three α-helices in the LBD has been conserved from eels to humans during vertebrate evolution, despite a distinct amino acid sequence. Mutation analysis confirmed that the LBD is essential for dihydrotestosterone-induced nuclear import of eAR and following transactivation function in the nucleus. In addition, eAR interacts with both Sox9a1 and Sox9a2, and their interaction regulates transactivation of eAR. Our data suggest that the primitive species conserves and especially acquires key novel domains, the nuclear export signal and LBD, for the eAR function in spite of a rapid sequence evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1981488537,"Background Protein kinases are key regulators of cellular processes (such as proliferation, apoptosis and invasion) that are often deregulated in human cancers. Accordingly, kinase genes have been the first to be systematically analyzed in human tumors leading to the discovery that many oncogenes correspond to mutated kinases. In most cases the genetic alterations translate in constitutively active kinase proteins, which are amenable of therapeutic targeting. Tumours of the pancreas are aggressive neoplasms for which no effective therapeutic strategy is currently available. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a DNA-sequence analysis of a selected set of 35 kinase genes in a panel of 52 pancreatic exocrine neoplasms, including 36 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and 16 ampulla of Vater cancer. Among other changes we found somatic mutations in ATM, EGFR, EPHA3, EPHB2, and KIT, none of which was previously described in cancers. Conclusions/Significance Although the alterations identified require further experimental evaluation, the localization within defined protein domains indicates functional relevance for most of them. Some of the mutated genes, including the tyrosine kinases EPHA3 and EPHB2, are clearly amenable to pharmacological intervention and could represent novel therapeutic targets for these incurable cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1987406337,"The H19/Igf2 imprinting control region (ICR) functions as an insulator exclusively in the unmethylated maternal allele, where enhancer-blocking by CTCF protein prevents the interaction between the Igf2 promoter and the distant enhancers. DNA methylation inhibits CTCF binding in the paternal ICR allele. Two copies of the chicken β-globin insulator (ChβGI)(2) are capable of substituting for the enhancer blocking function of the ICR. Insulation, however, now also occurs upon paternal inheritance, because unlike the H19 ICR, the (ChβGI)(2) does not become methylated in fetal male germ cells. The (ChβGI)(2) is a composite insulator, exhibiting enhancer blocking by CTCF and chromatin barrier functions by USF1 and VEZF1. We asked the question whether these barrier proteins protected the (ChβGI)(2) sequences from methylation in the male germ line.We genetically dissected the ChβGI in the mouse by deleting the binding sites USF1 and VEZF1. The methylation of the mutant versus normal (ChβGI)(2) significantly increased from 11% to 32% in perinatal male germ cells, suggesting that the barrier proteins did have a role in protecting the (ChβGI)(2) from methylation in the male germ line. Contrary to the H19 ICR, however, the mutant (mChβGI)(2) lacked the potential to attain full de novo methylation in the germ line and to maintain methylation in the paternal allele in the soma, where it consequently functioned as a biallelic insulator. Unexpectedly, a stricter enhancer blocking was achieved by CTCF alone than by a combination of the CTCF, USF1 and VEZF1 sites, illustrated by undetectable Igf2 expression upon paternal transmission.In this in vivo model, hypomethylation at the ICR position together with fetal growth retardation mimicked the human Silver-Russell syndrome. Importantly, late fetal/perinatal death occurred arguing that strict biallelic insulation at the H19/Igf2 ICR position is not tolerated in development."
https://openalex.org/W2167954017,"Lim3 encodes an RNA polymerase II transcription factor with a key role in neuron specification. It was also identified as a candidate gene that affects lifespan. These pleiotropic effects indicate the fundamental significance of the potential interplay between neural development and lifespan control. The goal of this study was to analyze the causal relationships between Lim3 structural variations, and gene expression and lifespan changes, and to provide insights into regulatory pathways controlling lifespan. Fifty substitution lines containing second chromosomes from a Drosophila natural population were used to analyze the association between lifespan and sequence variation in the 5'-regulatory region, and first exon and intron of Lim3A, in which we discovered multiple transcription start sites (TSS). The core and proximal promoter organization for Lim3A and a previously unknown mRNA named Lim3C were described. A haplotype of two markers in the Lim3A regulatory region was significantly associated with variation in lifespan. We propose that polymorphisms in the regulatory region affect gene transcription, and consequently lifespan. Indeed, five polymorphic markers located within 380 to 680 bp of the Lim3A major TSS, including two markers associated with lifespan variation, were significantly associated with the level of Lim3A transcript, as evaluated by real time RT-PCR in embryos, adult heads, and testes. A naturally occurring polymorphism caused a six-fold change in gene transcription and a 25% change in lifespan. Markers associated with long lifespan and intermediate Lim3A transcription were present in the population at high frequencies. We hypothesize that polymorphic markers associated with Lim3A expression are located within the binding sites for proteins that regulate gene function, and provide general rather than tissue-specific regulation of transcription, and that intermediate levels of Lim3A expression confer a selective advantage and longer lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2048912057,"Much is known about how genes regulated by nuclear receptors (NRs) are switched on in the presence of a ligand. However, the molecular mechanism for gene down-regulation by liganded NRs remains a conundrum. The interaction between two zinc-finger transcription factors, Nuclear Receptor and GATA, was described almost a decade ago as a strategy adopted by the cell to up- or down-regulate gene expression. More recently, cell-based assays have shown that the Zn-finger region of GATA2 (GATA2-Zf) has an important role in down-regulation of the thyrotropin gene (TSHβ) by liganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR).In an effort to better understand the mechanism that drives TSHβ down-regulation by a liganded TR and GATA2, we have carried out equilibrium binding assays using fluorescence anisotropy to study the interaction of recombinant TR and GATA2-Zf with regulatory elements present in the TSHβ promoter. Surprisingly, we observed that ligand (T3) weakens TR binding to a negative regulatory element (NRE) present in the TSHβ promoter. We also show that TR may interact with GATA2-Zf in the absence of ligand, but T3 is crucial for increasing the affinity of this complex for different GATA response elements (GATA-REs). Importantly, these results indicate that TR complex formation enhances DNA binding of the TR-GATA2 in a ligand-dependent manner.Our findings extend previous results obtained in vivo, further improving our understanding of how liganded nuclear receptors down-regulate gene transcription, with the cooperative binding of transcription factors to DNA forming the core of this process."
