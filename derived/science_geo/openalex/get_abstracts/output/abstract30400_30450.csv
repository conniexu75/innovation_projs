https://openalex.org/W2037944537,"At the level of individual neurons, catecholamine release increases the responsivity of cells to excitatory and inhibitory inputs. A model of catecholamine effects in a network of neural-like elements is presented, which shows that (i) changes in the responsivity of individual elements do not affect their ability to detect a signal and ignore noise but (ii) the same changes in cell responsivity in a network of such elements do improve the signal detection performance of the network as a whole. The second result is used in a computer simulation based on principles of parallel distributed processing to account for the effect of central nervous system stimulants on the signal detection performance of human subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1982794770,"The principal neutralizing determinant (PND) of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 is part of a disulfide bridged loop in the third variable region of the external envelope protein, gp120. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of this domain from 245 different HIV-1 isolates revealed that the PND is less variable than thought originally. Conservation to better than 80 percent of the amino acids in 9 out of 14 positions in the central portion of the PND and the occurrence of particular oligopeptide sequences in a majority of the isolates suggest that there are constraints on PND variability. One constraining influence may be the structural motif (beta strand--type II beta turn--beta strand--alpha helix) predicted for the consensus PND sequence by a neural network approach. Isolates with a PND similar to the commonly investigated human T cell lymphoma virus IIIB (HTLV-IIIB) and LAV-1 (BRU) strains were rare, and only 14 percent of sera from 86 randomly selected HIV-1 seropositive donors contained antibodies that recognized the PND of these virus isolates. In contrast, over 65 percent of these sera reacted with peptides containing more common PND sequences. These results suggest that HIV vaccine immunogens chosen because of their similarity to the consensus PND sequence and structure are likely to induce antibodies that neutralize a majority of HIV-1 isolates."

https://openalex.org/W1858268805,"We have identified previously a xenobiotic-responsive element, which we termed the beta-naphthoflavone-responsive element, between nucleotide -722 and -682 in the 5'-flanking region of the rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene (Rushmore, T.H., King, R.G., Paulson, K.E., and Pickett, C.B. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 3826-3830). The beta-naphthoflavone-responsive element is responsible for part of the transcriptional activation of the Ya subunit gene by planar aromatic compounds but has a sequence distinct from the xenobiotic-responsive element found in multiple copies in the cytochrome P-450 IA1 gene and as a single copy in the Ya subunit gene. In the present study, we demonstrate that the beta-naphthoflavone-responsive element is required for the transcriptional activation of the Ya subunit gene by phenolic antioxidants such as t-butylhydroquinone through a mechanism that does not require functional Ah receptors. Furthermore, we present evidence that planar aromatic compounds must be metabolized before they transcriptionally activate the Ya subunit gene through the beta-naphthoflavone-responsive element. The transcriptional activation of the Ya subunit gene by planar aromatic compounds requires a functional Ah receptor. These data provide evidence that transcriptional activation of the glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene can be mediated by a novel xenobiotic-responsive element which is directly responsive to phenolic antioxidants such as t-butylhydroquinone. Hence we have named this new xenobiotic-responsive element the antioxidant-responsive element or ARE."
https://openalex.org/W2051088635,"A mutation in the age-1 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been shown to result in a 65 percent increase in mean life-span and a 110 percent increase in maximum life-span at 25 degrees. One of the hallmarks of organismic aging and senescent processes is an exponential acceleration of age-specific mortality rate with chronological age. This exponential acceleration is under genetic control: age-1 mutant hermaphrodites show a 50 percent slower rate of acceleration of mortality with chronological age than wild-type strains. Mutant males also show a lengthening of life and a slowing of the rate of acceleration of mortality, although age-1 mutant males still have significantly shorter life-spans than do hermaphrodites of the same genotype. The slower rates of acceleration of mortality are recessive characteristics of the age-1 mutant alleles examined."
https://openalex.org/W2089958448,"The protein Felix was designed de novo to fold into an antiparallel four-helix bundle of specific topology. Its sequence of 79 amino acid residues is not homologous to any known protein sequence, but is ""native-like"" in that it is nonrepetitive and contains 19 of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Felix has been expressed from a synthetic gene cloned in Escherichia coli, and the protein has been purified to homogeneity. Physical characterization of the purified protein indicates that Felix (i) is monomeric in solution, (ii) is predominantly α-helical, (iii) contains a designed intramolecular disulfide bond linking the first and fourth helices, and (iv) buries its single tryptophan in an apolar environment and probably in close proximity with the disulfide bond. These physical properties rule out several alternative structures and indicate that Felix indeed folds into approximately the designed three-dimensional structure."
https://openalex.org/W1966656613,"Soluble antigens (Ags) in the extracellular fluids are excluded from the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted pathway of Ag presentation in most cells. However, an exogenous Ag can be internalized, processed, and presented in association with class I MHC molecules on specialized Ag-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs express class II molecules and can simultaneously present exogenous Ags to both class I and class II MHC-restricted T cells. These APCs may be important participants in the regulation of host immune responses. This APC activity may explain several phenomena of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) priming in vivo and might be exploited for eliciting CTL responses to protein vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W2012318656,"The transcription factor C/EBP uses a bipartite structural motif to bind DNA. Two protein chains dimerize through a set of amphipathic α helices termed the leucine zipper. Highly basic polypeptide regions emerge from the zipper to form a linked set of DNA contact surfaces. In the recently proposed a ""scissors grip"" model, the paired set of basic regions begin DNA contact at a central point and track in opposite directions along the major groove, forming a molecular clamp around DNA. This model predicts that C/EBP must undertake significant changes in protein conformation as it binds and releases DNA. The basic region of ligand-free C/EBP is highly sensitive to protease digestion. Pronounced resistance to proteolysis occurred when C/EBP associated with its specific DNA substrate. Sequencing of discrete proteolytic fragments showed that prominent sites for proteolysis occur at two junction points predicted by the ""scissors grip"" model. One junction corresponds to the cleft where the basic regions emerge from the leucine zipper. The other corresponds to a localized nonhelical segment that has been hypothesized to contain an N-cap and facilitate the sharp angulation necessary for the basic region to track continuously in the major groove of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2159390753,"A class of transcriptional regulator proteins bind to DNA at dyad-symmetric sites through a motif consisting of (i) a ""leucine zipper"" sequence that associates into noncovalent, parallel, alpha-helical dimers and (ii) a covalently connected basic region necessary for binding DNA. The basic regions are predicted to be disordered in the absence of DNA and to form alpha helices when bound to DNA. These helices bind in the major groove forming multiple hydrogen-bonded and van der Waals contacts with the nucleotide bases. To test this model, two peptides were designed that were identical to natural leucine zipper proteins only at positions hypothesized to be critical for dimerization and DNA recognition. The peptides form dimers that bind specifically to DNA with their basic regions in alpha-helical conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2043592675,"Mechanistically, an origin of bidirectional DNA replication (OBR) can be defined by the transition from discontinuous to continuous DNA synthesis that must occur on each template strand at the site where replication forks originate. This results from synthesis of Okazaki fragments predominantly on the retrograde arms of forks. We have identified these transitions at a specific site within a 0.45 kb sequence approximately 17 kb downstream from the 3' end of the dihydrofolate reductase gene in Chinese hamster ovary chromosomes. At least 80% of the replication forks in a 27 kb region emanated from this OBR. Thus, initiation of DNA replication in mammalian chromosomes uses the same replication fork mechanism previously described in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, suggesting that mammalian chromosomes also utilize specific cis-acting sequences as origins of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1910534473,"Carotenoid pigments are an important component in the plumage of birds. The metabolic precursors are dietary in origin but many species have the capacity to chemically modify and selectively deposit the pigments. The ensuing plumage patterns are important in communication and identification. The bright yellows, oranges, and reds are due mostly to xanthophylls; keto and hydroxy carotenes. Some are deposited unmodified (e.g., lutein) whereas others are modified chemically (canthaxanthin, astaxanthin). Early workers concentrated on demonstrating that feather carotenoids were derived from the diet and deposited selectively. Progress in defining and solving biological problems depended on advances in chemical and analytical techniques. Subsequent investigation showed that various plumage colormorphs, seasonal plumage changes or colors in common mutant, were due to relatively simple chemical changes in carotenoids but had profound biological consequences. Equally important was the realization that many of these processes were under genetic control. Validation came from feeding studies of flamingos and finches. Recent studies have employed the plumage carotenoids to test hypotheses of genetic divergence, to relate plumage color to environmental process, and to demonstrate the influence of synthetic changes on color. Understanding the processes has advanced with the introduction of high-resolution separation techniques and the ability to determine both conformation and absolute configuration. The next steps will be in the direction of understanding the enzymatic modification, transport, and tissue selectivity of feather carotenoids."

https://openalex.org/W1646941628,"Desmoplakins (DPs) I and II are two major related proteins located in the innermost portion of the desmosomal plaque where it is thought they may play a role in attaching intermediate filaments (IF) to the cell surface. We have isolated and sequenced human cDNA clones encoding two major DP domains and a portion of a third. These clones can be divided into two classes that we believe to represent DPI and DPII cDNAs; our evidence suggests that the DPII message is derived at least in part from the processing of a larger transcript encoded by a single gene. Computer-aided analysis of the DPI-predicted amino acid sequence indicates that the central domain, which contains the heptad repeat characteristic of many alpha-fibrous proteins, will participate in the formation of a coiled coil dimer approximately 130 nm in length. The periodicity of acidic and basic residues in the rod suggests that DPI will aggregate with itself or similar molecules into higher order filamentous structures. The carboxyl terminus contains three regions with significant homology, each of which comprises almost five repeats of a 38-residue motif. It is likely that these regions each fold into a compact globular conformation stabilized by intrachain ionic interactions. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of a cDNA encoding a portion of the 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (Stanley, J. R., Tanaka, T., Mueller, S., Klaus-Kovtun, V., and Roop, D. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 82, 1864-1870) with DP revealed the presence of a 38-residue repeat with striking similarity to that of the DPs. Significantly, the periodicity in acidic and basic residues of these domains is the same as that found in the 1B rod domain of IF proteins. This suggests the possibility that the DPs might interact with IF via their common periodicity of charged residues."
https://openalex.org/W2011137853,"The mechanisms underlying structural changes that accompany learning and memory have been difficult to investigate in the intact nervous system. In order to make these changes more accessible for experimental analysis, dissociated cell culture and low-light-level video microscopy were used to examine Aplysia sensory neurons in the presence or absence of their target cells. Repeated applications of serotonin, a facilitating transmitter important in behavioral dishabituation and sensitization, produced growth of the sensory neurons that paralleled the long-term enhancement of synaptic strength. This growth required the presence of the postsynaptic motor neuron. Thus, both the structural changes and the synaptic facilitation of Aplysia sensorimotor synapses accompanying long-term behavioral sensitization can be produced in vitro by applying a single facilitating transmitter repeatedly. These structural changes depend on an interaction of the presynaptic neuron with an appropriate postsynaptic target."

https://openalex.org/W2079723348,"Each half of the body surface is represented topographically in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Physiological data are presented showing that homotopic regions of primary somatosensory cortex are linked such that plasticity induced in one hemisphere, in the form of receptive field expansion brought about by a small peripheral denervation, is immediately mirrored in the other hemisphere. Neurons which display the plasticity show no responsiveness to stimulation of the ipsilateral body surface. This suggests that the pathways and mechanisms mediating this transfer are specific to the role of maintaining balance, or integration, between corresponding cortical fields."
https://openalex.org/W1527771705,"Abstract Chromogranin A, the most abundant protein in bovine adrenal chromaffin granules, bound calmodulin in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner, and the calmodulin-binding property was utilized to purify chromogranin A. Chromogranin A has been described in the past as a random-coil polypeptide with little alpha-helix or beta-sheet conformation. However, circular dichroism measurements with pure, native chromogranin A revealed relatively high alpha-helical contents (40% at the intravesicular pH of 5.5). Fluorescence studies confirmed previous observations that chromogranin A binds Ca2+ with low affinity. Considering the high concentration of Ca2+ in the secretory vesicle, the effect of Ca2+ on the secondary structure and self-association of chromogranin A was examined. Ca2+ induced a decrease of alpha-helicity of chromogranin A from 40 to 30% at pH 5.5. In contrast, at pH 7.5 the same amount of Ca2+ increased alpha-helicity of the protein from 25 to 40%. Boiling of the adrenal extract, a commonly used purification procedure for chromogranin A, resulted in the isolation of conformationally distinct chromogranin A molecule. Unlike secretory protein-I of the parathyroid gland (Gorr, S.-V., Dean, W. L., Radley, T. L., and Cohn, D. V. (1988) Bone Mineral 4, 17-25), chromogranin A aggregated rapidly in the presence of Ca2+. The extent and rate of aggregation were highly dependent on Ca2+ concentration. Although both the rate and extent of aggregation at pH 7.5 were much lower than those at pH 5.5, aggregation of chromogranin A proceeded at both pH's. In this respect, chromogranin A differs from human chromogranin C which was shown by Gerdes et al. (Gerdes, H.-H., Rosa, P., Phillips, E., Baeuerle, P. A., Frank, R., Argos, P., and Huttner, W. B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12009-12015) to aggregate at pH 5.2 but not at pH 7.4."

Spectroscopic and magnetic studies have revealed that the purple phosphatases contain a novel dinuclear iron active site that is responsible for the purple color. More biologically and biomedically oriented research has shown that the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases generally occur in osteoclasts and white blood cells, where they appear to be localized in lysosomes or similar organelles. Despite the different names given the enzymes by researchers in the two fields, recent sequence determinations and immunological studies indicate that the enzymes are identical. The status of research in both fields is reviewed in an attempt to present a unified picture of the structure, function, and mode of action of these unique metalloproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1781758807,"Cellular DNA fragmentation can be induced in many biological instances without plasma membrane damage. The fungal metabolite, cytochalasin B, is capable of modifying numerous cellular functions related to DNA synthesis. In this work it is demonstrated that cytochalasin B is capable of inducing DNA fragmentation in a number of cells lines. This DNA fragmentation occurs before plasma membrane lysis and over a period of hours. Cytochalasin E and villin, agents that act on the microfilaments, also induce DNA fragmentation. Phorbol dibutyrate, a diacylglyceral analog, is able to inhibit cytochalasin B-induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings support the interpretation that cytochalasin B is inducing DNA fragmentation via its effect on the actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1594023229,"Purified RNA polymerase II terminates transcription in vitro at sites within genes which also block transcript elongation in vivo. Studies on a termination site within the first intron of the human histone H3.3 gene have shown that transcription elongation factor SII can promote read-through at this site when the polymerase initiates transcription from a promoter in the presence of the accessory initiation factors. Using 3'-extended templates to direct specific initiation by purified RNA polymerase II, we show here that purified SII is sufficient to effect read-through of this terminator by the purified polymerase alone. Thus, the interaction of purified SII with an elongation complex containing only the polymerase, the template, and the nascent transcript can change the termination properties of RNA polymerase II and can effect read-through of a region that blocks elongation in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1651806643,"The NH2-terminal alpha fragments of human complement proteases C1-r and C1-s were obtained by limited proteolysis of the native proteins with trypsin, and isolated. C1-r alpha extended from residues 1 to 208 of C1-r A chain, with at least two cleavage sites within disulfide loops, after lysine 134 and arginine 202. C1-s alpha comprised residues 1-192 of the C1-s A chain, with one cleavage site within a disulfide loop, after arginine 186. C1-r alpha was monomeric either in the presence or absence of Ca2+ but formed Ca2(+)-dependent dimers with native C1-s. C1-s alpha dimerized in the presence of Ca2+ and formed Ca2(+)-dependent tetramers (C1-s alpha-C1-r-C1-r-C1-s alpha) with native C1-r. C1-r alpha and C1-s alpha associated in the presence of Ca2+ to form C1-r alpha-C1-s alpha heterodimers. Equilibrium dialysis studies indicated that each alpha region binds Ca2+ with a dissociation constant ranging from 19 microM (native proteins) to 38 microM (fragments). C1-r alpha, C1-r alpha-C1-s alpha, and the native C1-s-C1-r-C1-r-C1-s tetramer bound 0.9, 1.9, and 4.0 Ca2+ atoms/mol, respectively, whereas dimers C1-s alpha-C1-s alpha and C1-s-C1-s incorporated 2.9 and 3.0 Ca2+ atoms/mol. It is concluded that each alpha region contains one high affinity Ca2+ binding site. This 1:1 stoichiometry is maintained upon heterologous (C1-r-C1-s) interaction, whereas the homologous (C1-s-C1-s) interaction provides one additional binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1481011810,"Poly(ADP-ribosylation) of histones and several other nuclear proteins seem to participate in nuclear processes involving DNA strand breaks like repair, replication, or recombination. This is suggested from the fact that the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase responsible for this modification is activated by DNA strand breaks produced in these nuclear processes. In this article I provide three lines of evidence supporting the idea that histone poly(ADP-ribosylation) is involved in chromatin replication. First, cellular lysates from rapidly dividing mouse or human cells in culture synthesize a significant number of oligo- in addition to mono(ADP-ribosylated) histones. Blocking the cells by treatment of cultures with 5 mM butyrate for 24 h or by serum or nutrient depletion results in the synthesis of only mono- but not of oligo(ADP-ribosylated) histones under the same conditions. Thus, the presence of oligo(ADP-ribosylated) histones is related to cell proliferation. Second, cellular lysates or nuclei isolated under mild conditions in the presence of spermine and spermidine and devoid of DNA strand breaks mainly synthesize mono(ADP-ribosylated) histones; introduction of a small number of cuts by DNase I or micrococcal nuclease results in a dramatic increase in the length of poly(ADP-ribose) attached to histones presumably by activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Free ends of DNA that could stimulate poly(ADP-ribosylation) of histones are present at the replication fork. Third, putatively acetylated species of histone H4 are more frequently ADP-ribosylated than nonacetylated H4; the number of ADP-ribose groups on histone H4 was found to be equal or exceed by one the number of acetyl groups on this molecule. Since one recognized role of tetraacetylated H4 is its participation in the assembly of new nucleosomes, oligo(ADP-ribosylation) of H4 (and by extension of other histones) may function in new nucleosome formation. Based on these results I propose that poly(ADP-ribosylated) histones are employed for the assembly of histone complexes and their deposition on DNA during replication. Modified histones arise at the replication fork by activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by unligated Okazaki fragments."

https://openalex.org/W1601505398,"The four yolk polypeptides of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are found in two types of lipoprotein particle: 12 S particles with Mr estimated at 450,000 and 8 S particles with Mr estimated at 250,000. Both types of particle contain approximately 8% phospholipids, 3% triglycerides, and 3% other lipids by mass. All four C. elegans yolk polypeptides can be found in either 12 or 8 S particles, depending upon the conditions of isolation. While the properties of the 12 and 8 S lipoprotein particles are consistent with a dimermonomer relationship, the asymmetric distribution of the yolk polypeptides between 12 and 8 S fractions suggests that at least two different oligomeric lipoprotein complexes are present in C. elegans embryos. In order to clarify the subunit composition of the C. elegans yolk lipoproteins, the patterns of polypeptides retained in immunoaffinity binding procedures by immunoglobulins of different antigenic specificities have been compared. When immunoaffinity binding is performed in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, three C. elegans yolk proteins (yp170A, yp115, and yp88) are retained together by polyclonal immunoglobulins directed against either yp115 or yp88. A monoclonal immunoglobulin also retains these three proteins together. In contrast, a second monoclonal immunoglobulin retains only the fourth yolk protein (yp170B). Aggregate species, evidently reflecting the spontaneous formation of interchain disulfide bonds, indicate that yp170A and yp88 are physically associated, whereas yp170B self-associates in dimers. It is concluded that there are two distinct lipoprotein complexes in C. elegans: the A complex, which consists of yp170A, yp115, and yp88 and is essentially heterodimeric and the B dimer, a simple dimer of yp170B."
https://openalex.org/W1502496330,"The sparse fur (spf) mutant mouse is a model for human X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Human OTC cDNA placed under transcriptional control of the mouse OTC promoter was microinjected into fertilized oocytes of spf mice. Two founder lines of transgenic mice were phenotypically and biochemically corrected for OTC deficiency by the expression of the human gene at high levels in the small intestine with little or no expression occurring in the liver. The tissue pattern of expression of transgenic mice bearing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene placed under the control of the mouse OTC promoter parallels these results. These experiments demonstrate that human OTC cDNA is selectively expressed in small bowel by a truncated OTC promoter, and such ectopic expression corrects the spf phenotypic and metabolic features of this inborn error. These data suggest that somatic gene therapy of OTC deficiency can be achieved by intestine-targeted gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1556760393,"The discovery of the nuclear localization of estradiol and progesterone receptors in the absence of the steroid hormone has led to reconsideration of the model of cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of these receptors upon exposure to hormone. Unoccupied nonactivated receptors are thought to be weakly bound to nuclei of target cells from which they are leaking during tissue fractionation and thus found in the cytosol fraction of homogenates in a nontransformed heterooligomeric 8-9 form, which includes hsp90. However, no direct biochemical evidence has yet been obtained for the presence of such heterooligomers in the target cell nucleus, possibly because it dissociates in high ionic strength medium used for extraction of the nuclear receptor. We took advantage of the combined stabilizing effects of tungstate ions and antiprogestin RU486 to extract a nuclear non-DNA binding nontransformed 8.5 S-RU486-progesterone receptor complex from estradiol-treated immature rabbit uterine explants incubated with the antagonist. As demonstrated by immunological criteria and by irreversible cross-linking with dimethylpimelimidate, the complex contained, in addition to the hormone binding unit, hsp90, and p59, another nonhormone binding protein. Control experiments carried out with the progestin R5020 yielded the expected nuclear transformed DNA binding 4.5 S-R5020-progesterone receptor complex. These results offer evidence for two distinct forms of steroid receptor in target cell nuclei. Besides the classical 4 agonist-receptor complex, tightly bound to the DNA-chromatin structure and in all probability able to trigger the hormonal response, we have observed in the RU486-bound state a non-DNA binding nontransformed 8.5 S form, presumably already present in the nucleus in the absence of hormone and representing the native nonactive form of the receptor."

In the complex there is an ester bond between C3b and C4b. We analyzed the C5 convertase formed on erythrocytes and localized the covalent binding site of C3b to a small region on C4b. The covalently linked C4b.C3b complex was purified from a detergent extract of the erythrocytes and digested with lysyl endopeptidase. An Mr 17,000 fragment containing the ester linkage between C4b and C3b was purified and its amino-terminal sequence was examined. Two amino acids were obtained at each cycle and identified with those in the sequences of C3 and C4. The sequence derived from C3 corresponded to the thioester region. The sequence derived from C4 started at Ala-1186. Alkali treatment of the fragment yielded an Mr 7,000 peptide derived from C4, which thus appeared to span the region of C4 from Ala-1186 to Lys-1259. Therefore, the covalent C3b-binding site on C4b is located within a 74-residue region of the primary structure. This finding supports the notion that after cleavage of C3 by the C4b2a complex, the covalent binding of metastable C3b to C4b is a specific reaction to form a trimolecular complex with a defined quaternary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2111530979,"Relative to the same site in oncomodulin, the CD ion-binding domain of rat parvalbumin exhibits much greater affinity for Ca2+ and Mg2+. As part of an effort to understand the structural basis for these differences, site-specific variants of oncomodulin have been prepared in which the amino acid residues at positions 52, 54, 57, 59, and 60 have been replaced with the residues present at the corresponding positions in rat parvalbumin. The proteins resulting from the single-site substitutions at residues 52, 54, and 57 are indistinguishable from the wild-type protein on the basis Eu3+ luminescence spectroscopy, and none of the three variants displays increased affinity for Ca2+. By contrast, the substitutions at residues 59 and 60 perturb both the Eu3+ luminescence parameters and the Ca2+ and Mg2+ affinities, and these differences are amplified when both replacements are simultaneously incorporated into the protein. The Eu3+ 7F0—-5D0 spectrum of the double variant (D59E/G60E) at pH 5.0, with a maximum at 5796 A and pronounced shoulder at 5791 A, strongly resembles that obtained with pike parvalbumin. Consistent with this increased parvalbumin-like character, KCa is decreased from 0.78 microM (for the wild-type protein) to 0.41 microM, and KMg is decreased from 3.5 to 0.74 mM. Nevertheless, the affinity of the CD ion-binding domain in D59E/G60E for Ca2+ remains almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding site in rat parvalbumin, strongly suggesting that residues besides those present in the binding loop are involved in dictating the metal ion-binding properties of the oncomodulin CD site."
https://openalex.org/W1577988163,"DNase I footprinting identifies a tissue-general factor, GHF3, binding to the rat growth hormone promoter between nucleotides -239 and -219. Mutation of the GHF3-binding site reduces promoter activity to 30% of that of the wild-type promoter after transfection into GC cells. Southwestern blotting and protein/DNA cross-linking experiments demonstrate that the GHF3-binding factor migrates as a 43-kDa protein. However, multiple GHF3 factor/DNA complexes with different electrophoretic mobilities are detected by gel retardation analysis. A novel technique, the diagonal gel mobility shift assay, is used to demonstrate that five of the different complexes represent multisubunit structures containing a common DNA-binding subunit. In this method, the multisubunit complexes resolved by one-dimensional gel mobility shift assays are observed to partially dissociate during electrophoresis in a second dimension with the DNA-binding subunit detected as a common signal directly below those signals representing the undissociated complexes which lie on a diagonal line. Two of the five complexes also contain an additional subunit in common whereas two other complexes appear to contain completely different subunits interacting with the common DNA-binding subunit. All five complexes copurify during GHF3-binding site-specific DNA affinity chromatography, and this fraction stimulates in vitro transcription in a GHF3-binding site-dependent fashion. Thus, a functionally important region of the rat growth hormone gene promoter interacts with a DNA-binding transcription factor which in turn acts as a docking site for other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1857592341,"The mouse steroid 16 alpha-hydroxylase (C-P450(16 alpha)) family consists of structurally similar genes with very divergent expressions (Wong, G., Itakura, T., Kawajiri, K., Skow, L., and Negishi, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2920-2927). Of five family members, the C-P450(16 alpha) gene exhibits a male-specific expression whereas the P450cb gene is equally expressed in both males and females although the level of expression is much lower than that of the C-P450(16 alpha) gene. By DNase I footprinting and in vitro transcription of the C-P450(16 alpha) gene, we determined two cis-acting transcription elements. SDI (sex difference information) in the -84/-102 region from the transcription start site is one of the two cis-acting transcription elements, which is specific to the sex-specific C-P450(16 alpha) gene and confers a high transcription level of this gene. We substituted the nucleotide(s) in the SDI sequence to the corresponding base(s) in the P450cb gene promoter and tested each substituted gene promoter by in vitro transcription. The results indicate that the function of SDI as the transcription element depends most critically on the nucleotides at positions -100 to -98. Another cis-acting transcription element, CTE (common transcription element), is located between -44 and -68 in both C-P450(16 alpha) and P450cb genes. A column chromatography of nuclear extract indicates that the proteins bound to SDI and CTE are different. We speculate therefore that SDI is a specific and necessary element involved in the male-specific C-P450(16 alpha) gene transcription. The sequence comparisons of the corresponding regions of SDI and CTE among the mouse and the closely related rat P450 genes suggest that SDI is a newly evolved cis-acting element in the sex-specific C-P450(16 alpha) gene which arose through gene duplication and selective nucleotide substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1959308052,"Candida tropicalis peroxisomes contain a 905-residue trifunctional enzyme with hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase activity that is important in fatty acid beta-oxidation. At its amino terminus are two tandem copies of an approximately 280 residue domain of unknown function. We provide evidence that this domain is homologous to oxidoreductases used for metabolizing sugars and synthesizing antibiotics and steroids such as estradiol, androstenedione, corticosterone, and hydrocortisone. The trifunctional enzyme shows no sequence similarity to the bifunctional hydratase-dehydrogenase found in animal peroxisomes and plant glyoxysomes, which are homologs of each other. We suggest that the C. tropicalis trifunctional enzyme and the animal and plant bifunctional enzymes have different ancestors."
https://openalex.org/W1546646223,"With the previously obtained rat liver serine dehydratase cDNA (SDH2; Ogawa, H., Miller, D.A., Dunn, T., Su, Y., Burcham, J. M., Peraino, C., Fujioka M., Babcock, K., and Pitot, H. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 85, 5809-5813) as a probe, we isolated a different species of cDNA (SDH3) from the same cDNA library from which SDH2 was obtained. Nucleotide sequence analysis has indicated that SDH3 has an open reading frame which encodes 327 amino acid residues and which is identical to that of the cDNA obtained by Noda et al. (Noda, C., Ito, K., Nakamura, T., and Ichihara, A., (1988) FEBS Lett. 234, 331-335). Primer extension analysis and RNase protection mapping clarified that the SDH3 mRNA was the major mRNA for serine dehydratase in the liver, and its transcription begins with a T residue located 23 nucleotides down-stream of a TATA-like box. In vitro transcription/translation experiment demonstrated that SDH3 encoded a polypeptide of 35 kDa, a size in agreement with that of the subunit of the purified protein, whereas SDH2, despite having a size larger than SDH3, produced a peptide of much smaller size that reacted with anti-serine dehydratase IgG. SDH2 was found to have a stop codon early in the sequence and is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 8.9 kDa. Also, SDH2 has a 5'-noncoding sequence different from that of SDH3. These results indicate that alternative transcription initiation and different modes of splicing of the primary transcripts of rat serine dehydratase gene result in the formation of two species of mRNA, of which only one is translated into the mature serine dehydratase protein."

https://openalex.org/W1584237771,"An experimental kidney infarction model was developed in the mouse to study the uptake of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody previously shown to bind to degenerating cells in malignant tumors. To determine if this approach is applicable to normal tissue and cell degeneration, kidney infarction was produced by clamping the mouse renal artery for 3 h using surgical procedures. Various groups of mice were injected with 131I-labeled TNT-1 F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody directed against nuclear histone antigens at varying intervals after surgery. Imaging, biodistribution, autoradiography, and histological studies were performed on each group of mice, including sham-operated controls, to quantitate the level of binding and localize the uptake of label in clamped and unclamped (contralateral) kidneys. As additional controls, clamped mice were administered radiolabeled irrelevant monoclonal antibody Lym-1 or mouse albumin. The results showed a marked selective uptake of radiolabeled TNT-1 F(ab')2 in the injured clamped kidney compared with the untreated kidney and other normal organs of the mouse. These studies define a model of normal organ necrosis that may be useful for study of the kinetics of antibody uptake in infarcted tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1589346447,"The relationship between Na/K/2Cl cotransport activation in duck erythrocytes and binding of the diuretic [3H]bumetanide to isolated membranes from stimulated cells has been assessed. Cotransport was activated by either cAMP-dependent (norepinephrine) or -independent (fluoride, hypertonicity) pathways. Membranes isolated from unstimulated cells possessed no specific bumetanide binding. In the presence of norepinephrine, cotransport and saturable binding rose in parallel, reaching a maximum after 5-7 min. In membranes from maximally stimulated cells the K1/2 and Bmax for bumetanide binding were 100 nM and 1.7 pmol/mg protein, respectively. The diuretic binding properties of these membranes were characteristic of interactions of ligands with the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter: specific binding required the presence of all three cotransported ions (Na, K, and Cl), and the rank order of potency for diuretic competition with bumetanide for binding sites was benzmetanide greater than bumetanide greater than furosemide. The appearance of specific bumetanide binding was also seen in membranes from erythrocytes activated by non-cAMP-dependent stimuli, with an excellent temporal correlation between cotransport activation and diuretic binding. On removal of all stimuli both cotransport and bumetanide binding declined in parallel. Duck erythrocytes treated with norepinephrine in a solution containing 15 mM K+ swell to a new stable cell volume after 60 min, during which time cotransport becomes inoperative. Bumetanide binding to both whole cells and isolated membranes paralleled the decline in cotransport activity. It is concluded that bumetanide binding to isolated membranes faithfully reflects the state of activation of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter in intact cells under a variety of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1554001490,"Two novel monosialogangliosides were isolated from rat spleen. The structures of the gangliosides (shown below, where NeuNGc is N-glycolylneuraminic acid) were characterized by compositional analysis, methylation analysis, hydrolyses with exoglycosidases, direct probe fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. A novel structure common to both gangliosides was N-acetyllactosaminyl-GM1 LacN-GM1; where GM1 is II3NeuAc-GgOse4Cer), and this is the first paper to report the occurrence of a new group of gangliosides. [formula: see text] Furthermore, in a monosialoganglioside fraction of rat spleen, the occurrence of a ganglioside having two lactosamine units (Gal alpha 1-3(Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3)2-GM1(NeuAc) (alpha Gal-(LacN)2-GM1] was suggested. These gangliosides have a unique structure, which includes the ganglio series ganglioside core and the extended modification characteristic of the lacto series."
https://openalex.org/W1512015641,"The restriction endonuclease BanII catalyzes the cleavage of double-stranded DNA and recognizes the degenerate sequence 5'-GPuGCPyC-3'. The poly-linker of M13mp18 contains one such sequence, 5'-GAGCTC-3'. The three other possible sites recognized by the enzyme were prepared by site-directed muta-genesis. The substitution of phosphate groups by phosphorothioate residues at some positions within the various recognition sites had relatively little effect on the rate of cleavage of the DNA. However, when the DNA contained a phosphorothioate group at the site of cleavage the rate of linearization of the DNA was decreased by a factor of 9. Interestingly, DNA which contained an additional phosphorothioate internucleotidic linkage immediately 3'-outside the recognition site could not be linearized by the enzyme. The results indicate that an important contact between enzyme and substrate is perturbed by the presence of the sulfur atom at this position."

https://openalex.org/W1819819633,"Flow cytometry was used to measure the binding of enzymes (i.e. lactate dehydrogenases 1 and 5, malate dehydrogenase, and asparaginase) to cells. Of the four enzymes studied, asparaginase showed the greatest binding. Single color analysis revealed that asparaginase bound best to preparations enriched in macrophages, and dual color analysis showed that the binding was to macrophages. Studies on continuous cell lines revealed that asparaginase bound to one mouse macrophage line, but not to another or to murine fibroblasts. Inoculation of mice with lactic dehydrogenase virus, a virus that infects macrophages, decreased the in vivo clearance of asparaginase from the circulation and the in vitro binding of asparaginase to peritoneal macrophages. It is concluded that flow cytometry can be used to study the binding of enzymes to cells, to identify the cell type to which the enzyme binds, and to measure changes in the capacity of cells to bind enzymes."
