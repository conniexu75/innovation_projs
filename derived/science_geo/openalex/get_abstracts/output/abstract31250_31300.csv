https://openalex.org/W1499694712,"The calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem have been shown to reverse multidrug resistance, but the mechanism of action of these agents is still unknown. We measured [3H]verapamil, [3H]desmethoxyverapamil, [3H]diltiazem, and [3H]nitrendipine binding to membrane vesicles made from drug-sensitive (KB-3-1), multidrug-resistant (KB-C4 and KB-V1), and revertant (KB-V1-R2) cells. Membrane vesicles from KB-V1 cells bound 10-20-fold more [3H]verapamil and [3H]diltiazem and about 30-fold more [3H]desmethoxyverapamil than did vesicles from the parental KB-3-1 or revertant KB-V1-R2 cell lines. These drugs reverse the multidrug resistance phenotype by increasing accumulation of drugs in the resistant cells. No difference in binding of [3H]nitrendipine, which did not reverse drug resistance, was observed. The binding of vinblastine, desmethoxyverapamil, and diltiazem to KB-V1 vesicles was specific and saturable and was inhibited by desmethoxyverapamil and quinidine greater than vinblastine and diltiazem much greater than daunomycin. In addition, verapamil and diltiazem inhibited the vinblastine photoaffinity labeling of P170, the protein previously shown to be a marker of multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1490746554,"A subpopulation of canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles has been found to contain a release which mediates the release of intravesicular Ca2+ stores with rates sufficiently rapid to contribute to excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. 45Ca2+ release behavior of passively and actively loaded vesicles was determined by Millipore filtration and with the use of a rapid quench apparatus using the two Ca2+ channel inhibitors, Mg2+ and ruthenium red. At pH 7.0 and 5-20 microM external Ca2+, cardiac vesicles released half of their 45Ca2+ stores within 20 ms. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release was inhibited by raising and lowering external Ca2+ concentration, by the addition of Mg2+, and by decreasing the pH. Calmodulin reduced the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release rate 3-6-fold in a reaction that did not appear to involve a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Under various experimental conditions, ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMP-PCP), and caffeine stimulated 45Ca2+ release 2-500-fold. Maximal release rates (t1/2 = 10 ms) were observed in media containing 10 microM Ca2+ and 5 mM AMP-PCP or 10 mM caffeine. An increased external Ca2+ concentration (greater than or equal to 1 mM) was required to optimize the 45Ca2+ efflux rate in the presence of 8 mM Mg2+ and 5 mM AMP-PCP. These results suggest that cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum contains a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel which is activated by Ca2+, adenine nucleotide, and caffeine, and inhibited by Mg2+, H+, and calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W2035808396,"Several clinical features are consistent with nervous system involvement in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. The neuropeptide substance P is one possible mediator of this interaction, since it can be released into joint tissues from primary sensory nerve fibers. The potential effects of the peptide on rheumatoid synoviocytes were examined. The results show that substance P stimulates prostaglandin E2 and collagenase release from synoviocytes. Furthermore, synoviocyte proliferation was increased in the presence of the neuropeptide. Similar effects were observed with a truncated form of substance P. Synoviocytes were sensitive to very small doses of the neuropeptide (10(-9) M), and its effects were inhibited by a specific antagonist. Thus, the specific stimulation of synoviocytes by the neuropeptide substance P represents a pathway by which the nervous system might be directly involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2080430475,"We have attempted to use antisense RNA techniques in the developing Xenopus embryo and found that although hybrids form between sense and antisense RNAs, they are transient. Our studies indicate that this is due to the presence of an activity that unwinds RNA:RNA hybrids. The activity is present at low, but detectable, levels in Xenopus oocytes, increases during oocyte maturation, and exists at high levels throughout early embryogenesis. The activity has been characterized in S100 extracts. The denaturation of a specific RNA:RNA hybrid is inhibited by the addition of a second duplexed RNA but not by the addition of single-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, or double-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2003476788,"Mice homozygous for the autosomal recessive mutation shiverer (shi) lack myelin basic protein (MBP) and exhibit a distinct behavioral pattern including tremors (shivering), convulsions, and early death. We have previously demonstrated that shiverer mice have a partial deletion in the gene encoding MBP. We now have introduced the wild-type MBP gene into the germ line of shiverer mice by microinjection into fertilized eggs. Transgenic shiverer mice homozygous for the introduced gene have MBP mRNA and protein levels that are approximately 25% of normal, and produce compacted myelin with major dense lines. Correct temporal and spatial expression of the MBP gene is achieved with a genomic MBP cosmid clone containing 4 kb of 5′ flanking sequence and 1 kb of 3′ flanking sequence. Moreover, the four different forms of MBP produced by alternative patterns of RNA splicing are present. These homozygous transgenic shiverer mice no longer shiver nor die prematurely."

https://openalex.org/W1966548950,"Calcium influx through voltage-gated membrane channels plays a crucial role in a variety of neuronal processes, including long-term potentiation and epileptogenesis in the mammalian cortex. Recent studies indicate that calcium channels in some cell types are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity has now been shown for calcium channels in mammalian cortical neurons. When dissociated embryonic hippocampal neurons from rat were grown in culture they first had only low voltage-activated, fully inactivating somatic calcium channels. These channels were metabolically stable and conducted calcium better than barium. Appearing later in conjunction with neurite outgrowth and eventually predominating in the dendrites, were high voltage-activated, slowly inactivating calcium channels. These were metabolically labile and more selective to barium than to calcium. Both types of calcium currents were reduced by classical calcium channel antagonists, but the low voltage-activated channels were more strongly blocked by the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin. These findings demonstrate the development and coexistence of two distinct types of calcium channels in mammalian cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2076934212,"Previous experiments have shown that mRNA translation in frog oocytes can be inhibited by the injection of a complementary antisense RNA. Here we explore the use of antisense RNAs to study the functions of localized maternal mRNAs during postfertilization development. While developmental abnormalities were observed in injected fertilized eggs, these abnormalities could not be attributed to the antisense RNA since they were induced at a similar frequency in control embryos. Biochemical tests show that the injected antisense RNA does not form stable hybrids in vivo with its complementary endogenous mRNA. In addition, a novel activity that unwinds RNA:RNA duplexes was found. This activity exists at high levels in eggs and early embryos and is absent or very much diminished in oocytes and late blastula embryos. These results suggest that antisense RNAs may be of limited use in studying the functions of maternal RNAs in Xenopus."
https://openalex.org/W1523684025,"We have previously described in rats the selective uptake of HDL-associated cholesterol esters (traced by [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether) in excess of the uptake of HDL-associated apoA-I. In the present studies we show that the mechanism also exists in cultured cells of human and mouse origin as well. This selective uptake represents a net uptake of cholesterol esters and not an isotope exchange, as shown by mass flux studies in adrenal cells. Inhibitors of receptor recycling, chloroquine, monensin, and colchicine, inhibited uptake of apoA-I from HDL by Hep G-2 human hepatoma cells to about the same extent as a reference protein, asialofetuin, but inhibited uptake of the cholesteryl ether tracer much less. Levels of NaN3 which effectively inhibited sucrose pinocytosis inhibited uptake of apoA-I to about the same extent but did not inhibit uptake of the cholesteryl ether at all. Thus, not only receptor recycling, but endocytosis as well, appears not to be involved in selective uptake. This conclusion was supported by studies in which synthetic HDL particles were made to contain two neutral lipid core tracers; one of them, the [3H]cholesteryl ether previously used, was selectively taken up, whereas the other, [14C]sucrose octaoleate, was excluded from selective uptake. Thus, selective uptake cannot involve endocytosis of the entire lipid core, but may involve other specific transfer mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1553151363,"The effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol were examined using A431 cells labeled with either 32PO3(4)- or myo-[3H] inositol. EGF was found to increase the incorporation of phosphate into phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate as early as 15 s after addition of hormone. These changes were found to be due to two effects of EGF on the phosphatidylinositol cycle. First, EGF stimulated the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate to diacylglycerol and an inositol triphosphate. In addition, EGF induced a rise in the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate. The EGF-dependent increases in both inositol triphosphate production and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate levels were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin did not inhibit either of these responses. However, treatment of the cells with cholera toxin selectively abolished the ability of EGF to stimulate the rise in phosphatidylinositol monophosphate levels but did not alter the ability of the hormone to induce the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol diphosphate. The effects of cholera toxin were not mimicked by forskolin, cAMP analogs, or isobutyl-methylxanthine. These data demonstrate that EGF stimulates the production of inositol triphosphate. In addition, the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that EGF independently stimulates a phosphatidylinositol kinase. Based on the effects of cholera toxin and the inability of cyclic nucleotides to mimic this response, the effect of EGF on the phosphatidylinositol kinase may be mediated via a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is not involved in cAMP production."
https://openalex.org/W1503253993,"Using affinity purified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase the reaction assay conditions were determined. The optimum incorporation of dTMP into the (rA)n(dT)10 template with HIV reverse transcriptase required 6 mM MgCl2 and 80 mM KCl. The template specificity of HIV reverse transcriptase is quite different from those of the human gamma-polymerase-associated reverse transcriptase or avian virus reverse transcriptase. The preferential inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase as compared to human gamma-reverse transcriptase was observed with several nucleoside analog triphosphates. The Ki values for thymidine triphosphate analogs with HIV reverse transcriptase ranged from 5 to 13 nM with decreasing effectiveness for 3'-fluoro greater than 3'-amino greater than 2',3'-dideoxy greater than 3'-azido groups. This study provides information on the structure activity relationships of the triphosphate analogs inhibitory effects on HIV reverse transcriptase versus human gamma-polymerase-associated reverse transcriptase, and the possible mechanisms of action of 3' azido thymidine and the 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, and also identifies other nucleoside analogs for possible development as inhibitors of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2001182200,"Mice homozygous for the mutation myelin deficient (mld), an allele of shiverer, exhibit decreased CNS myelination, tremors, and convulsions of progressively increasing severity leading to an early death. In this report we demonstrate in mld mice that the gene encoding myelin basic protein (MBP) is expressed at decreased levels and on an abnormal temporal schedule relative to the wild-type gene. Southern blot analyses, field-inversion gel electrophoresis studies, and analyses of mld MBP cosmid clones indicate that there are multiple linked copies of the MBP gene in mld mice. We have introduced an MBP transgene into mld mice and found that myelination increases and tremors and convulsions decrease. Mld and shiverer mice with zero, one, or two copies of the MBP transgene express distinct levels of MBP mRNA and myelin. The availability of a range of mice expressing graded levels of myelin should facilitate quantitative analysis of the roles of MBP in the myelination process and of myelin in nerve function."
https://openalex.org/W2016743088,"A fundamental problem in the cellular analysis of learning and memory is the identification of the neuronal substrates of long-term information storage and their relation to short-term cellular alterations. In this report, biophysical correlates of long-term sensitization of a simple withdrawal reflex in the mollusc Aplysia were examined. A voltage-clamp analysis of the sensory neurons that control the reflex, 24 hours after sensitization training, revealed a significant reduction in net outward current. The results indicate that one mechanism for the storage of long-term sensitization is the regulation of membrane currents that influence the characteristics of the action potential and the excitability of individual neurons. The results also provide insights into the relation between short- and long-term sensitization in that the biophysical loci involved in the storage of long-term sensitization appear similar to those involved in short-term sensitization."

https://openalex.org/W2099387884,"Ryanodine at concentrations of 0.01-10 microM increased, while greater concentrations of 10-300 microM decreased the calcium permeability of both rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle junctional and canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Ryanodine did not alter calcium binding by either sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes or the calcium binding protein, calsequestrin. Therefore, the effects by this agent appear to involve only changes in membrane permeability, and the characteristics of the calcium permeability pathway affected by ryanodine were those of the calcium release channel. Consistent with this, the actions by ryanodine were localized to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and were not observed with either longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum or transverse tubular membranes. In addition, passage of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes through a French press did not diminish the effects of ryanodine indicating that intact triads were not required. Under the conditions used for the permeability studies, the binding of [3H]ryanodine to skeletal junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes was specific and saturable, and Scatchard analyses indicated the presence of a single binding site with a Kd of 150-200 nM and a maximum capacity of 10.1-18.9 pmol/mg protein. [3H]ryanodine binding to this site and the increase in membrane calcium permeability caused by low concentrations of ryanodine had similar characteristics suggesting that actions at this site produce this effect. Depending on the assay conditions used, ryanodine (100-300 microM) could either increase or decrease ATP-dependent calcium accumulation by skeletal muscle junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes indicating that the alterations of sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane calcium permeability caused by this agent can be determined in part by the experimental environment."

https://openalex.org/W1540003878,"The plasma protein alpha 2-antiplasmin is the main physiological inhibitor of the serine protease plasmin, which is responsible for the dissolution of fibrin clots. We have determined the primary structure of mature human alpha 2-antiplasmin by DNA sequencing of overlapping cDNA fragments prepared from human liver mRNA. cDNA clones were identified by hybridization with a 48-base pair deoxyoligonucleotide probe deduced from the sequence of a 16-amino acid peptide of alpha 2-antiplasmin. Mature human alpha 2-antiplasmin contains 452 amino acids. It is homologous (23-28%) with five other proteins belonging to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Its reactive site, i.e. the peptide bond cleaved by reaction with its primary target enzyme, plasmin, consists of Arg364-Met365. This dipeptide corresponds to the reactive site Met358-Ser359 of the archetypal serpin, alpha 1-antitrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1989706524,"In order to determine whether the blood-brain barrier was present in transplants of central nervous tissue, fetal neocortex, which already possesses blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers to protein, was grafted into the undamaged fourth ventricle or directly into the neocortex of recipient rats. Horseradish peroxidase or a conjugated human immunoglobulin G-peroxidase molecule was systemically administered into the host. These proteins were detected within the cortical transplants within 2 minutes regardless of the age of the donor or postoperative time. At later times these compounds, which normally do not cross the blood-brain barrier, inundated the grafts and adjacent host brain and also entered the cerebrospinal fluid. Endogenous serum albumin detected immunocytochemically in untreated hosts had a comparable although less extensive distribution. Thus, transplants of fetal central nervous tissue have permanent barrier dysfunction, probably due to microvascular changes, and are not integrated physiologically within the host. Blood-borne compounds, either systemically administered or naturally occurring, which should never contact normal brain tissue, have direct access to these transplants and might affect neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W1538354139,"A preparation of gently disrupted rat liver mitochondria which shows exposed and easily sedimented Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activities has been characterized further. The exposed malate dehydrogenase is inhibited by high molecular weight blue dextran which indicates the availability of the enzyme to the bulk solvent. Further, mitoplasts are not permeable to citrate synthase antibodies ruling out the possibility of vesicularization of high molecular weight substances. The slightly disrupted mitochondria sedimented more slowly than did intact mitochondria on a Ficoll gradient. Electron microscopy, both thin section and scanning, showed slightly swollen mitochondria with some disruption of the membranes. Labeling with ferritin-labeled second antibody to citrate synthase antibodies showed again the accessibility of these disrupted mitochondria to the antibody. When either the oxidation of fumarate or the malate dehydrogenase-citrate synthase coupled system are studied, relative kinetic advantages are observed of the gently disrupted systems over the completely solubilized system. These kinetic advantages are more labile to disruption than is the binding of the enzymes to the particle. These results indicate that the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle exists as a sequential complex of enzymes, a metabolon, in situ. This study shows that previous studies which showed interactions between sequential enzymes of this pathway and their binding to the inner surface of the inner membrane actually reflected an in vivo organization of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1580371254,"Limited proteolysis, affinity chromatography, and immunoblotting have been used to define the domains of chicken gizzard caldesmon, caldesmon120, that interact with calmodulin, F-actin, and a monoclonal antibody prepared using human platelet caldesmon. Treatment of caldesmon120 with chymotrypsin produces groups of fragments near 100, 80, 60, 38, and 20 kDa. Further digestion produces peptides between 40 and 50 kDa. The 100- and 80-kDa peptides cross-react with the monoclonal antibody; the smaller polypeptides do not. The kinetics of cleavage and the antibody studies indicate that the 38- and 80-kDa fragments are the two major pieces of the 120-kDa protein. The 38-kDa fragment, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and several of its subfragments at 21 and 25 kDa sediment with F-actin, bind to calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+, and are displaced from F-actin by Ca2+-calmodulin. The 80-kDa fragments did not interact with F-actin or calmodulin. We have tentatively placed the 38-kDa fragment at the C-terminal using polyclonal antibodies selected against a beta-galactosidase-caldesmon120 fusion protein produced by a lambda gt11 lysogen. The 38-, 25-, and 21-kDa fragments cross-react with these antibodies; the 80- and 60-kDa fragments do not. Caldesmon77 from human platelets also cross-reacts with these selected antibodies. The results suggest that interacting calmodulin and F-actin binding sites are localized on a 38-kDa C-terminal fragment of caldesmon. The smallest subfragment of this peptide that binds to both F-actin and calmodulin-Sepharose is about 21 kDa. The monoclonal antibody epitope is tentatively localized near the N-terminal of caldesmon77 and must be within 50 kDa of the N-terminal on caldesmon120."
https://openalex.org/W1567737562,"The alpha and beta subunits of the rabbit skeletal muscle sodium channel have been separated and isolated preparatively under denaturing conditions. In this sodium channel, the beta subunit is not linked covalently to the alpha subunit. The isolated subunits have been subjected to amino acid and carbohydrate analysis. Both subunits are heavily glycosylated (alpha = 26.5%, beta = 29.7% carbohydrate by weight) with N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylhexosamines representing the predominant monosaccharides in each. Enzymatic deglycosylation with neuraminidase and endoglycosidase F yielded single core peptides of approximately 209 kDa for the alpha subunit and 26.5 kDa for the beta subunit. Based on the known carbohydrate composition, the molecular masses for the glycosylated subunits are, therefore, 285 and 37.5 kDa for alpha and beta, respectively. Using the isolated subunits, we calibrated our protein-labeling system on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined the subunit stoichiometry for the rabbit skeletal muscle channel; in the native preparation, the molar ratio of alpha:beta is 1 : 1."
https://openalex.org/W1559936443,"Abstract A large number of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome develop disseminated infections due to member serotypes of the Mycobacterium avium complex. Seroagglutination on 181 such isolates followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thin layer chromatography of the type-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) antigens demonstrated that the majority of serotypes were M. avium serotype 4. The specific GPL of serotype 4 was isolated in both the native, acetylated, and the deacetylated forms and its oligosaccharide hapten released as the oligosaccharide alditol by reductive beta-elimination. A comprehensive structural analytical approach developed for more complex carbohydrates was applied to the oligosaccharide alditol in order to reveal glycosyl and glycosyl-linkage composition, sequence arrangements, ring forms, and enantiomeric and anomeric configurations. The structure of the triglycosyl alditol was established as, 4-O-Me-L-Rhap-(alpha 1----4)-2-O-Me-L-Fucp-(alpha 1----3)-L-Rhap- (alpha 1----2)-6-deoxytalitol, in which the nonreducing-end disaccharide unit is unique to serotype 4. The native GPL antigen is diacetylated, presumably at other than the terminal disaccharide, since the antigenicity of both the acetylated and deacetylated antigens are comparable. The structure of the epitope of the type-specific antigen of serotype 4 will serve as the basis for synthetic antigen probes and the target for the monoclonal antibodies required to trace the origins in the environment of the infectious agent and study the epidemiology of human infections."

https://openalex.org/W1502889375,"In isolated mitochondria from HeLa cells, the ATP requirements for mitochondral DNA (mtDNA) transcription and RNA processing can be satisfied by either endogenous synthesis, mainly through oxidative- phosphorylation, or by exogenous supply. The pattern of RNA synthesis changes dramatically depending upon the level of ATP available. At the low intramitochondrial ATP levels produced from endogenous ADP in the presence of an oxidizable substrate and phosphate, the mRNA species are labeled to a substantial extent, whereas there is only a marginal labeling of the rRNA species and light (L) strand transcripts. By contrast, high ATP levels, either provided exogenously or produced endogenously in the presence of an oxidizable substrate, phosphate, and exogenous ADP, strongly stimulate rRNA synthesis (about 10-fold) and light (L) strand transcription (greater than 10-fold), with only a slight increase in mRNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1503583993,"To examine the mechanisms by which transforming growth factors (TGFs) regulate the proliferation of eukaryotic cells, five cell lines, from different species and tissues, were treated with three agents that inhibit DNA synthesis and proliferation: BSC-1 cell-derived growth inhibitor (GI/TGF-beta), platelet-derived transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. The cell lines tested were mink lung CCL 64 epithelial cells, Maloney sarcoma virus-transformed CCL 64.1, monkey kidney BSC-1 epithelial cells, human epidermoid A431 cells, and mouse embryo AKR-2B (clone 84A) cells. All cell lines responded to one or more of these agents by synthesizing and secreting a 48 to 51-kDa protein (IIP48). The TGF-beta s and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate had little or no effect on the incorporation of [35S] methionine into other secreted proteins or on the pattern of [35S]methionine-labeled intracellular proteins analyzed by one-dimensional, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The maximum increase in induction of IIP48 varied from 2-fold to greater than 800-fold compared with the controls and occurred within 6 h of adding GI/TGF-beta to CCL 64 cells. Actinomycin D, alpha-amanitin, or 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole selectively decreased both the control and induced levels of IIP48 even after as little as 6 h of incubation. Thus, it appears that IIP48 mRNA turns over rapidly. Induction of IIP48 was dissociated from the inhibition of DNA synthesis by GI/TGF-beta. However, we found that epidermal growth factor and GI/TGF-beta act synergistically to increase the secreted level of IIP48. Others have shown that epidermal growth factor and TGF-beta act synergistically to stimulate growth of cells in agar. IIP48 from CCL 64, BSC-1, and AKR-2B cells is specifically immunoprecipitated by antibody to bovine plasminogen activator inhibitor. We found previously that TGF-beta also inhibits the production of major excreted protein, a thiol protease. It is proposed that TGF-beta is able to promote anchorage-independent growth of untransformed cells because of its ability to inhibit the production of secreted proteases and to increase the production of protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1602325292,"High resolution gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cell-free translation, and elastin-specific antibodies were used to identify three tropoelastin isoforms secreted by bovine tissue and cells. Tropoelastin isolated from nuchal ligament and from conditioned culture medium or cell-matrix extracts of ligament fibroblasts and auricular chondrocytes resolved as three distinct bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with molecular weights of approximately 67,500 (tropoelastin I), 65,000 (tropoelastin II), and 62,000 (tropoelastin III). Three tropoelastin polypeptides with molecular mass 2-3 kDa higher than their corresponding tissue forms were also evident in cell-free translation products of ligamentum nuchae RNA, suggesting that each tropoelastin species is encoded by a unique mRNA. The presence of cysteine in all three tropoelastin isoforms was demonstrated by the incorporation of [35S]cysteine into newly synthesized tropoelastin polypeptides and by immunoreactivity with an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide that defines the cysteine-containing carboxyl-terminal region of tropoelastin. Immunological co-localization of the carboxyl-terminal antibody with insoluble elastin in lung vasculature and parenchyma suggests that intact tropoelastin and not a processed form is incorporated into the elastin fiber."
https://openalex.org/W1597789675,"In the scutellum of maize kernel after imbibition, lipase activity increased rapidly, concomitant with the decrease in storage triacylglycerols. The enzyme activity peaked at day 6, but remained at the same level from day 6-10 when most of the triacylglycerols had been depleted. By in vitro translation with extracted RNAs followed by immunoprecipitation, and by resolving the translation products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, lipase was found to be de novo synthesized in postgermination. The enzyme was synthesized by RNAs extracted from free polyribosomes and not from bound polyribosomes. Both in vitro and in vivo synthesized lipase had the same Mr of 65,000 as resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as had the purified authentic enzyme; thus there was no appreciable co- or post-translational processing of the enzyme. Lipase-specific mRNA was present only between day 2-6 after imbibition. At day 6 when lipolysis was most active, more than 60% of the lipase activity was recovered in the lipid body fraction and specifically associated with the organelle membrane. From day 6-10, the lipase activity gradually shifted from the lipid body fraction to other subcellular fractions, including the 10,000 X g pellet, the 120,000 X g pellet, and the 120,000 X g supernatant. Lipase in these subcellular fractions was attributed to represent the enzyme associated with membrane ghosts of the lipid bodies which were fusing with the fragile cell vacuoles; such fusions were observed in situ by electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1519595263,"Gangliosides have profound effects on the phosphorylation of several proteins in myelin. Addition of polysialogangliosides to purified guinea pig brain myelin enhanced the endogenous phosphorylation of a 62-kDa phosphoprotein, but completely inhibited the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) (18.5 kDa). The ganglioside-stimulated phosphorylation of the 62-kDa protein was dose-dependent and -specific. Asialo-GM1, ceramide trihexosides, N-acetylneuraminic acid, or colominic acid alone could not mimic this effect, suggesting that the activation process requires both the hydrophobic head group and the anionic character of the gangliosides. Studies on the time course of this reaction revealed that it was a rapid and reversible process and was affected only very slightly by Ca2+. Thus, the stimulatory effect of gangliosides may not involve Ca2+-gangliosides complexes or proteolysis, but may be mediated through an activation of a ganglioside-dependent protein kinase or due to substrate protein-glycolipid interaction. Modulation of the phosphorylation of MBP by gangliosides varies with the states of phosphorylation of this protein. Prior addition of ganglioside to myelin inhibited the phosphorylation of MBP. However, addition of gangliosides to myelin subsequent to maximal phosphorylation of MBP retarded the dephosphorylation of this protein. Phosphorylation of isolated MBP by protein kinase C was stimulated by gangliosides, provided phosphatidylserine was present. In contrast, the glycolipid inhibited the phosphorylation of a unique site catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This site was distinct from those phosphorylated by protein kinase C and was also sensitive to chymotryptic cleavage. Although the exact physiological significance of protein phosphorylation in myelin has yet to be established, gangliosides may play an important role in the modulation of this reversible post-translational modification mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1574890629,"To determine whether hormone synthesis by the GH4C1 pituitary cell line could be regulated by specifically modulating the movement of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive channels, we have compared the effects of the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonist BAY K8644 and the antagonist nimodipine on hormone production and Ca2+ current in these cells. BAY K8644 elicited, after a 10-15-h lag, a dose-dependent increase in prolactin (PRL) production as determined by measurements of total intracellular and secreted hormone. Over a 72-h period, GH4C1 cells incubated with 300 nM BAY K8644 produced 2-3 times as much total PRL as control cells. The effect on PRL was specific, since BAY K8644 did not increase growth hormone production, cell growth rate, or total cell protein. Exposing GH4C1 cells to BAY K8644 for short periods, up to 90 min, did not induce the delayed increase in PRL production observed with longer incubations. The effects of nimodipine were opposite to those of the Ca2+ channel agonist. PRL production was reduced 85% during 48-h treatment with 200 nM nimodipine, whereas growth hormone production was decreased less than 15%, and cell growth and total protein were unaffected. The actions of these two drugs on PRL production were well correlated with their effects on GH4C1 Ca2+ currents as measured by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. BAY K8644 enhanced the magnitude of the peak Ca2+ current and shifted the current-voltage relationship such that Ca2+ channels were activated at less depolarized potentials. Nimodipine potently inhibited Ca2+ movement through the non-inactivating channel, while it antagonized the increases elicited by BAY K8644. These results indicate that PRL synthesis by GH4C1 cells can be specifically regulated by agents that enhance or block the movement of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive channels. They also suggest that hormone synthesis by a secretory cell may be coupled to electrical activity by the opening of Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1500835811,"Treatment of cultured H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells with insulin causes a large decrease in cytoplasmic serum albumin mRNA. This effect is observed at low doses of insulin (ED50 = 2 pM), consistent with the effect being mediated by interaction of insulin with high affinity insulin receptors. The reduction in cytoplasmic albumin mRNA is first observed 8-12 h following insulin addition, and albumin mRNA continues to decrease up to 28 h following hormone addition. Northern blot analysis of purified poly(A)+ RNA has indicated that insulin causes a decrease in albumin mRNA relative to total cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNA. In addition, one other specific mRNA, that encoded by the alpha-tubulin gene, is not decreased following insulin treatment. These results indicate that insulin induces a specific decrease in albumin mRNA. This effect is largely reversed if essential amino acids are added along with the insulin, suggesting that the insulin effect is related to limitation of the cells for essential amino acids. Insulin reduces transcription of the albumin gene 4.7-fold, as measured by nuclear transcription assays. However, this inhibition of albumin gene transcription does not fully account for the 57-fold decrease in albumin mRNA, indicating that insulin also exerts a negative effect on albumin mRNA at a post-transcriptional step."

https://openalex.org/W1604797988,"Sulfation of human alpha 2-antiplasmin, the major plasma inhibitor of fibrinolysis, was examined using both protein isolated from human plasma and protein synthesized and biosynthetically labeled with [35S]sulfate by a human hepatoma-derived cell line. Linkage of sulfate to tyrosine was demonstrated by recovery of labeled tyrosine sulfate after base hydrolysis of sulfate-labeled alpha 2-antiplasmin. Analysis by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of peptides released from alpha 2-antiplasmin by cleavage with trypsin or cyanogen bromide indicated that sulfate is linked to a single segment of the protein. A cyanogen bromide peptide corresponding to the sulfate-labeled peptide was prepared from alpha 2-antiplasmin isolated from human plasma. Consistent with the presence of tyrosine sulfate in this peptide, its chromatographic elution was altered by treatment with acid under conditions which release sulfate from a tyrosine residue. No peptide in the total digest of alpha 2-antiplasmin by cyanogen bromide eluted at the position of the peptide following desulfation, suggesting that all of the protein is in a sulfated form. The sequence of the sulfate-containing cyanogen bromide peptide as determined by sequential Edman degradation, amino acid composition, and fast atom-bombardment-mass spectrometry was: Glu-Glu-Asp-Tyr(SO4)-Pro-Gln-Phe-Gly-Ser-Pro-Lys-COOH. This peptide is a segment of the previously identified plasmin-binding domain of alpha 2-antiplasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1497523215,"In the presence of NADPH and oxygen, menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) elicits low level red chemiluminescence from rodent liver preparations. This chemiluminescence is believed to arise from the formation of active oxygen species that are generated when the quinone undergoes oxidative cycling. The obligatory two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones catalyzed by NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.2) has been implicated in the suppression of this photoemission by competing with oxidative cycling (Wefers, H., Komai, T., Talalay, P., and Sies, H. (1984) FEBS Lett. 169, 63-66 and references therein). Thus, in previous studies, we showed that treatment of mice with BHA (2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole), which elevates cytosolic quinone reductase activity about 10-fold, reduced menadione-dependent chemiluminescence of hepatic post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions, whereas inhibition of quinone reductase by dicoumarol greatly intensified light emission. We demonstrate here that addition of pure quinone reductase to this preparation suppresses menadione-dependent chemiluminescence, and that the protective effect of 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole treatment can be accounted for completely by the induction of this specific enzyme. These results provide conclusive evidence that in this system the protective action of anticarcinogenic antioxidants is entirely attributable to the elevation of the level of an electrophile-processing enzyme."

The transition temperature of DPPC, galactosylceramide, and asialo-GM1 is affected little by MBP while their transition enthalpy is decreased in proportion to the amount of protein in the mixture. The thermotropic behavior of anionic glycosphingolipids is considerably perturbed by MBP. The transition temperature of gangliosides increases in the presence of MBP, whereas that of sulfatide decreases. The enthalpy of the transition of anionic glycosphingolipids increases markedly in the presence of MBP. The excess heat capacity function of these systems can be resolved into two independent phase transitions. Phase separation of enriched lipid/protein domains occurs in a magnitude that depends on the amount of MBP; the rest of the lipid phase exhibits some altered thermodynamic properties. In mixtures of glycosphingolipids with DPPC, phase separation is also present but no phase transition with the characteristic of pure DPPC is found. MBP is changing the properties of the lipid mixture as a whole and does not interact exclusively with the glycosphingolipids. The proportion of MBP required to produce the maximal changes is greater the greater the complexity of the glycosphingolipids polar head group. Relatively small variations of the amount of MBP induce large shifts in the proportion of the different phases present."

https://openalex.org/W1483390914,"Chinese hamster ovary cells transformed with a hybrid expression plasmid containing both the murine interferon-gamma (MuIFN-gamma) and the murine dihydrofolate reductase-coding sequences were subjected to selection in stepwise increasing concentrations of methotrexate. By this procedure the production rate of MuIFN-gamma was increased from an initial level of approximately 20,000 to approximately 500,000 antiviral units per milliliter of culture supernatant. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins secreted by these cells were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with or without prior immunoprecipitation with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against splenocyte-derived MuIFN-gamma. Besides two major components of Mr 19,000 and 38,000, a multiplicity of minor components were immunoprecipitated. Cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, secrete two major components of Mr 14,000 and 27,000 and only two minor components of Mr 12,000 and 13,000. When the proteins were labeled with [35S]cysteine, a residue that is only present at the carboxyl terminus of the mature MuIFN-gamma, no minor components could be detected in the growth medium of tunicamycin-treated cells. The presented results indicate that the heterogeneity of the recombinant Chinese hamster ovary-produced MuIFN-gamma is due to at least three cumulative modifications of the Mr 14,000 MuIFN-gamma peptide: carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing (the Mr 13,000 and 12,000 components), variations in N-glycosylation (components ranging in size from Mr 12,000 to 26,500), and dimerization (components ranging from Mr 27,000 to 50,000)."
https://openalex.org/W1596221189,"The inhibitor protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is a potential high affinity regulator of cAMP function. We now show that it is phosphorylated in Tyr7 by the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptor. The phosphorylated form can be readily separated from the unphosphorylated protein by high pressure liquid chromatography which has permitted the isolation of stoichiometrically phosphorylated protein. Using this method, it has been demonstrated that this phosphorylation, which occurs within the inhibitor protein's active domain, results in a 6 to 9-fold decrease in inhibitory potency. Possibly, a component of growth control could be the coupling of tyrosine kinase activity to cAMP-mediated cellular proliferation via the regulation of the efficacy of the inhibitor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1510279218,"Abstract Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised against pure human renin, but nothing was known about the regions against which they were directed. Using a three-dimensional model of mouse submandibular renin, we selected seven peptide sequences as belonging to potential epitopes. The main criteria for their choice were the location of the peptide sequences near the catalytic region and on the surface of the renin molecule and their hydrophilicity. After transposition of the regions to the 340-amino acid sequence of human renin, the seven peptides (corresponding to amino acids 50-60, 63-71, 81-90, 118-126, 162-169, 247-255, and 287-295) were synthesized, coupled to bovine serum albumin, and injected into rabbits. Five of these peptides elicited antibodies, and 50-68% binding of the corresponding iodinated peptide was obtained with a 1:25 dilution of antiserum. The antisera titers ranged from 1:5,000 to 1:100,000 when tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The same antisera bound 15-65% of labeled pure human renin at a final dilution of 1:2.5, the highest percentage being obtained with peptide 81-90 antiserum. At a 1:5 dilution, the five antisera inhibited renin activity by 23-68% in human plasma with a high renin activity (40 ng of angiotensin I/h/ml). At a final dilution of 1:50, peptide 81-90 antiserum was still capable of producing 25% inhibition. Purified IgG (0.6 mg) from this antiserum inhibited pure human renin activity by up to about 40%, as measured by its reaction with pure synthetic human tetradecapeptide substrate. Antigenic peptides that mimic a part of the human renin sequence, especially peptide 81-90 representing the flap covering the cleft between the two renin lobes, constitute promising tools for the development of a synthetic antirenin vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1512700486,"Abstract Previous work has suggested that myelin basic proteins are phosphorylated prior to their appearance in the myelin sheath (Ulmer, J. B. and Braun, P. E. (1984) Dev. Neurosci. 6, 345-355). In order to corroborate this finding we have examined the phosphorylation of myelin basic proteins in rat brain cell cultures containing 14-17% oligodendrocytes. Incorporation of 32P into the 14-, 17-, 18.5-, and 21.5-kDa myelin basic proteins was observed in cells incubated with 32P at 7, 14, and 21 days in culture. Myelin basic proteins in 14-day cells incorporated 32P linearly until at least 120 min after the addition of isotope. The apparent half-life of myelin basic protein phosphate groups was determined to be approximately 80 min in pulse-chase experiments. However, this value may be an overestimation due to the presence of significant levels of acid-soluble radioactivity in the cells throughout the chase period. The presence of dibutyryl cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP in the incubation medium substantially inhibited the incorporation of 32P into the myelin basic proteins at all time points studied. The presence of dibutyryl cAMP in the chase medium in pulse-chase experiments resulted in an increase in the turnover rate of [32P] phosphate in the myelin basic proteins. These results indicate that cAMP decreases the phosphorylation state of myelin basic proteins in oligodendrocytes by inhibiting the phosphorylation and/or stimulating the dephosphorylation of myelin basic proteins."

Similarly to anti-SRP antibodies human, anti-Alu sera precipitate SRP from HeLa cell extract and detect a 68-kDa SRP subunit on immunoblots. These results indicate that the Alu antigen and the 68-kDa SRP subunit are the same polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1586829686,"Repeated extraction of bovine heart submitochondrial particles with ammonia and EDTA (AE) yields a preparation that is highly deficient in coupling factor B (FB). The activity of the thrice extracted particle (AE-P3) in ATP-driven NAD+ reduction by succinate and the 32Pi-ATP exchange activity were substantially stimulated, 8-fold and 5-fold, respectively, by purified FB. To decrease the basal activity of the particle further, the residual FB in AE-P3 was inactivated by treatment with the -SH reagent, 4-vinylpyridine. The resulting particle was depleted of F1 by treatment with 3.5 M NaBr. This particle was incorporated into asolectin liposomes alone and in the presence of added FB. Passive proton conduction in the FB-deficient proteoliposomes was negligible and restored in the presence of FB. The H+ conductance was inhibited extensively by oligomycin and partially by F1-ATPase. The results show absolute dependence on FB for functioning of the FO proton channel."
https://openalex.org/W1636858207,"The transmembrane potential of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-infected Rat-1 cells, expressing the pp60v-src protein kinase, is markedly less negative (by approximately 30 mV) than that of their normal counterparts. By contrast, the membrane potential of Rat-1 cells infected with Kirsten sarcoma virus is virtually unaltered. The RSV-induced membrane depolarization is shown to be due to a severalfold increase in the cation permeability ratio (PNa/PK) of the plasma membrane. When cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of RSV (ts LA29), encoding a src protein with heat-labile kinase activity, are shifted from the nonpermissive to the permissive temperature, a rapid and sustained membrane depolarization is observed. Conversely, thermal inactivation of the ts LA29 pp60v-src kinase activity rapidly restores the membrane potential to near normal levels. Addition of epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or insulin to uninfected cells fails to cause a detectable change in membrane potential. We conclude that, unlike growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, pp60v-src can induce, either directly or indirectly, a major change in the membrane permeability to monovalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W1583339382,"An unusual new chloroplast RNA has been isolated and sequenced in the siphonous green alga, Codium fragile. This RNA is 94 nucleotides in length, has an unusually high A + U content (73%), contains no modified residues, and is as abundant as a single chloroplast tRNA species. Although this RNA is 4.5 S in size, it bears little sequence homology to the widely found and highly conserved 4.5 S RNAs present in the chloroplasts of higher plants. Nevertheless, this RNA may indeed by analogous to the higher plant 4.5 S RNAs, since the Codium 4.5 S RNA has the potential to form a secondary structure which in many respects is remarkably similar to that of known chloroplast 4.5 S RNAs, and hybridization data strongly suggests that the 4.5 S RNA is part of the ribosomal RNA operon, as is the case in higher plant chloroplasts."
