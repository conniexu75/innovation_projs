https://openalex.org/W1967332436,Four rats were trained to press a lever on a ratio schedule of reinforcement in which the number of lever presses required on each consecutive run increased by a fixed increment. Both concentration and volume of the reward were varied. Relationships were obtained between reward and deprivation variables and the size of the final completed ratio run.

https://openalex.org/W2292440706,"This study of the mechanism of peroxidation of purines by hemoproteins was stimulated by an observation that uric acid was unstable when formed from inosine in the presence of erythrocyte nucleoside phosphorylase, xanthine oxidase, and phosphate buffer. Since the conversion of hypoxanthine to uric acid by xanthine oxidase generates 2 molecules of hydrogen peroxide, a peroxidation was suspected. When catalase was included in the system, the yield of uric acid from inosine was quantitative, and uric acid was stable. The peroxidative catalyst remained inseparable from hemoglobin, and it was eventually concluded that the active principle was methemoglobin. A number of other hemoproteins are also known to catalyze peroxidation of uric acid. These include myeloperoxidase (4,5), horseradish peroxidase (6), lactoperoxidase, verdoperoxidase (7), and cytochrome c (8). The component common to these proteins and of methemoglobm is a trivalent iron porphyrin prosthetic group. Hematin itself was found to be an excellent catalyst for uric acid peroxidation, but the pH optima of methemoglobin and of horseradish peroxidase were quite different from that of hematin. The studies described herein show that any purine with an unsubstitued N-7 or N-9 position and an 8-0~0 substituent is susceptible to peroxidation in the presence of hemoprotein (or hematin) and peroxide. A mechanism of peroxidation of uric acids catalyzed by hemoproteins is proposed. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE"

https://openalex.org/W2048438139,Previous studies have assumed Drosophila to be negatively geotactic and found this to be the case. New methods of observation now yield a spectrum of geotactic behavior both positive and negative. Two-way selection produces races of animals performing in diametrically opposite fashion to the same stimulus conditions.

Many additional detaching ticks were eaten by the hosts. Uninfested bird species numbered 29 (998 individuals)."

This effect may, however, have been produced indirectly through the secretory nerves3. Such a stimulation of the medulla induced by insulin hypoglycæmia or morphine causes a concomitant release of amines and adenosine triphosphate4,5. The essential problem, however, is how reserpine causes amine depletion by direct action on the cells. As a preliminary attempt to elucidate this problem, the effect of reserpine on the nucleotide and amine content of the denervated rat medulla was studied."

This sleep stage is characterized by an increase in reticular stimulation arousal threshold and by the reappearance of 5 to 6 spikes per second on the electroencephalogram immediately after threshold behavioral arousal."

https://openalex.org/W2095176951,"IN an earlier publication1 a new sensitive method for the detection of small amounts of damage to human hair was reported. The method involves counting the numbers of cuticular and cortical cells in the liquid after treating the hair under standard conditions with papain/bisulphite solution. When the ratio of cuticle cells to cortical cells is low, the hair is assumed to have been damaged in some way. Soxhlet extraction of the hair with ethanol increases the rate of breakdown, but ether, benzene and many other non-polar solvents do not affect the ratio. It was suggested that a protective substance soluble in alcohol but not in non-polar solvents exists in the hair which maintains it intact during papain digestion. This protective substance has now been isolated from ethanol extracts and identified as a fatty acid/protein complex."

https://openalex.org/W2064438435,"THE development of graft-versus-host reaction in adult F 1 hybrid mice, following the injection of parental strain spleen cells, is accompanied by a considerable increase in the phagocyte activity of the reticulo-endothelial system1. Two weeks after injection of the spleen cells, the recipients were found to have phagocytic indices (calculated from the rate of clearance of colloidal carbon from the circulation) up to 10 times greater than normal. During investigations on the immunological reactivity of such animals to heterologous antigens2, a few observations suggested that the mice were abnormally susceptible to the toxicity of relatively small doses of killed Salmonella typhi. Recent work has shown that stimulation of the reticulo-endothelial system in mice either by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (BCG) infection3–5 or by repeated injections of the yeast cell-wall preparation ‘Zymosan’6 coincides with a profound lowering in resistance to the lethal effect of endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria. In view of this association, F 1 hybrid mice undergoing graft-versus-host reaction were tested similarly for resistance to purified bacterial endotoxin, and an analogous effect has been demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2278871083,"Important differences have been noted in the way that myosin catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate and of inosine triphosphate. Observations on the myosin catalysis in D/sub 2/O and H/sub 2/O may constitute evidence for the hypothesis that in the 6 to 8 pH range ATP hydrolysis involves a rate-retarding interaction not present in ITP hydrolysis. Except for the use of D/sub 2/O, the techniques involved were the same as those described by Morales and Hotta. Representative results are given graphically as the rate of catalysis v/sub max/, as a function of pH from 6 to 10. The general results are: (a) for ITPase, V/sub max/(H/sub 2/O) always exceeds V/sub max/(D/sub 2/O), and the increment increases with pH and pD; (b) for ATPase, at pH (or pD) approximately 7, V/sub max/(H/sub 2/O) = V/sub max/(D/sub 2/O), but to either side the increment increases; (c) for ATPase at pH = pD = 7.2, if the enzyme is strongly activated, then V/sub max/(H/sub 2/O) appreciably exceeds V/sub max/(D /sub 2/O), and if the enzyme is mildly activated, then V/sub max/(H/sub 2/O) is only slightly greater than V/sub max/(D/sub 2/O).

It does not appear to have been realized, however, that veronal reacts rapidly with formaldehyde to produce a substance that has no buffering capacity within the physiological range of pH values."

https://openalex.org/W2040260583,"IN a previous publication1, the distribution of arginine as demonstrated histoehemically by an improved Sakaguchi reaction2 was examined in sections of rat pituitary gland. The results were discussed in relation to present knowledge of the origin and chemical nature of the hormones of the pituitary gland, with particular reference to the correlation between the stainable ‘neurosecretory’ material of the pars nervosa and the octapeptide antidiuretic-vasopressor hormone (ADH-vasopressin). It was further suggested that a similar examination of the neurohypophysis of the pig would be of interest since the ADH-vasopressin extracted from the posterior lobe of the pituitary of this animal contains lysine in place of arginine. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a specific histochemical method for lysine; nevertheless, some information may be derived by applying the reaction for arginine, for if the stainable ‘neurosecretory’ material represents the hormones oxytocin and ADH-vasopressin, as postulated by the neurosecretory theory, then it might be expected to give no reaction for arginine in the case of the pig."
