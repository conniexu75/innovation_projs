https://openalex.org/W1565512673,"Studies have been carried out on the adsorption properties of plasma fibronectin (FN) on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces used were nonwettable bacteriological dishes and wettable tissue culture dishes, respectively. At low plasma FN concentrations, there was more plasma FN binding to hydrophobic surfaces than to hydrophilic surfaces. Under these conditions, the binding of antifibronectin to adsorbed fibronectin was much higher on the hydrophilic surfaces than the hydrophobic ones suggesting that adsorption of plasma FN on the two surfaces occurred in different conformations. In the presence of small amounts of serum albumin, however, antibody binding to plasma FN adsorbed on hydrophobic surfaces increased markedly indicating that a more favorable conformation had been attained. The adsorption of plasma FN onto both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces from serum-containing solutions was found to depend on the serum concentration. At low serum concentrations in the incubations (up to 0.1%), there was increased adsorption of plasma FN with increasing serum concentrations. The highest concentration of adsorbed fibronectin was about 12 ng/cm2 and was sufficient to promote complete cell spreading. Above 1.0% serum there was a marked decrease in fibronectin adsorption and at 10% serum very little adsorption occurred. This indicated that at high serum concentrations other serum proteins were able to compete with fibronectin for surface adsorption sites. This was ccrfirmed by determining adsorption isotherms for fibro1:ectin in the presence of 0.5 and 10% fibronectin-depleted serum. In long term cell spreading experiments (1 h to 2 days), cell spreading eventually occurred on hydrophilic surfaces but not on hydrophobic ones in the presence of 10% serum. This could not be accounted for by exchange on the surfaces of fibronectin for adsorbed serum proteins in the absence of the cells. In the presence of the cells, however, there was an increase in fibronectin associated with the hydrophilic surfaces and a decrease in fibronectin associated with hydrophobic surfaces that occurred concomitantly with increased or decreased cell spreading. This result suggested the possibility that in long term cultures, cells deposit endogenous spreading factors on top of or in place of the adsorbed non-fibronectin serum proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1580968270,"The intracellular glutathione redox state was estimated using newly adapted methods for tissue analysis. Under standard perfusion conditions of rat liver perfused in situ, intracellular GSH content was 5.5 mumol X g of liver-1, and intracellular GSSG content was 18 nmol X g of liver-1, resulting in a GSH/GSSG ratio of 300. GSSG was transported from the cells into bile. The control rate of release amounts to 0.4 nmol X min-1 X g of liver-1 and corresponds to the rate of release previously observed in anesthetized animals (Sies, H., Koch, O., Martino, E., and Boveris, A. (1979) FEBS Lett. 103, 287-290). No GSSG was released into the caval perfusate. In contrast, GSH release occurs both into bile and into the sinusoidal space, the rates of release being 1 and 14 nmol X min-1 X g of liver-1, respectively. Biliary GSH release in very low in isolated perfused liver. The relationship between intracellular GSSG levels and the rate of biliary GSSG transport was studied. This was achieved in experiments in which internal hydrogen peroxide formation was stimulated with substrates for monoamine oxidase (pargyline-sensitive), or by addition of t-butyl hydroperoxide, or of nitrofurantoin. The apparent concentration ratio, GSSG in bile/GSSG intracellular, was about 50 over the range of intracellular GSSG examined."

https://openalex.org/W1529202366,"We have selected a mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells that is severely deficient in ornithine decarboxylase activity and is auxotrophic for putrescine. The mutant we obtained (C54) has only 3% of the maximum inducible ornithine decarboxylase activity of the parental Chinese hamster ovary cells and the rate of incorporation of [3H]ornithine into acid-soluble material is correspondingly reduced. The defect in the mutant was recessive in somatic cell hybrids. The mutant requires at least 10(-5) M putrescine in the medium to maintain a normal growth rate. Spermidine and spermine can also serve as a polyamine source, and very high (millimolar) concentrations of ornithine can support a normal growth rate. In the absence of polyamine supplementation the cells stop growing after about 3 population doublings and begin to die after 5 or 6 days. The intracellular concentrations of putrescine and spermidine are depleted after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Spermine levels remain essentially constant for 4 days. Unexpectedly, the Km for ornithine of the enzyme from mutant cells was consistently somewhat lower than the Km for the enzyme from wild type cells. It is possible but not yet certain that the mutant is the result of a mutation in the structural gene coding for ornithine decarboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1496437254,"Reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide and vitamin K catalyzed by hepatic microsomal enzymes is required for normal, postribosomal, gamma-carboxyglutamate formation in the prothrombin complex Factors II, VII, IX, and X. The R- and S-warfarin enantiomers differentially inhibit (S-warfarin is 2 to 5 times more active) vitamin K function by mechanisms which have not been unambiguously determined. As a step toward determining the physiologically relevant site(s) of warfarin-antivitamin K activity we investigated in Wistar rats the effects of R- and S-warfarin on vitamin K 2,3-epoxide and vitamin K reductase activities and correlated them with effects on plasma concentrations of the Factors II, VII, and X. Based on the results of these studies we conclude that: 1) warfarin inhibition of the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide and vitamin K reductases is essentially irreversible; 2) S-warfarin stereoselectively inhibits both reductases in vivo but not in vitro; 3) the vitamin K reductase which utilizes dithiothreitol as cofactor in vitro is primarily responsible for vitamin K reduction to vitamin K hydroquinone under physiological conditions; 4) warfarin initially inhibits gamma-carboxyglutamate formation by inhibiting simultaneously the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide and vitamin K reductases; and 5) following enantiomer administration there is an apparent lack of correlation between the restoration of the reductase activities and the reinitiation of coagulation factor synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1492204342,"Previous work (Babcock, D. F., Singh, J. P., and Lardy, H. A. (1979) Dev. Biol. 69, 85-93) has shown that bovine seminal fluid contains a component(s) which is capable of preventing or delaying accumulation of extracellular calcium by ejaculated sperm. We report here the component is proteinaceous in nature and has been purified to apparent homogeneity. Conventional purification techniques were employed including ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. The inhibitor protein is a single peptide of Mr = 9,600-10,500 as determined by gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing in thin layer agarose gels indicates the protein has a pI = 8.3 which is consistent with a determined amino acid composition rich in basic residues. The protein shows no affinity for periodic acid-Schiff reagent and is therefore assumed to contain no carbohydrate. This protein can be distinguished from other previously characterized seminal plasma proteins and it is assumed that this protein is responsible for delaying uptake of calcium into ejaculated sperm by altering a component(s) of the sperm plasma membrane which serves to actively transport calcium into these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1575126937,"The synthesis of methionine from 5'-methylthioadenosine was examined in vitro using cell-free homogenates of rat liver. We had previously reported that methionine synthesized by this system contained carbons from the ribose moiety of 5'-methylthioadenosine (Backlund, P. S., Jr., and Smith, R. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1533-1535). The present study examines some of the steps involved in this conversion. 2-Keto-4-methylthiobutyrate was identified as one of the products of 5'-[methyl]14C]methylthioadenosine when incubated in vitro with rat liver homogenates. Partial purification of the enzyme system by gel exclusion chromatography to remove small molecular weight substrates and cofactors revealed that synthesis of 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate requires magnesium and is inhibited by calcium. 5-Methylthioribose 1-phosphate can replace 5'-methylthioadenosine as a substrate for methionine synthesis under these conditions, but 5-methylthioribose cannot. 5-Methylthioribonic acid was prepared and was found not to be an intermediate compound in this pathway. The final step in this pathway for methionine synthesis is then the transamination of the keto acid, catalyzed by glutamine and asparagine transaminases."
https://openalex.org/W1494715550,"Phosphorylation of the P-light chain of myosin from skeletal muscle by myosin light chain kinase is dependent upon calmodulin and Ca2+. Investigations were performed to determine if the rapid Ca2+ transients that occur during low frequency repetitive stimulation are sufficient to activate myosin light chain kinase with significant P-light chain phosphorylation. In addition, P-light chain phosphorylation was correlated with potentiation of isomeric twitch tension (staircase phenomenon). Stimulation of rat gastrocnemius muscle at 5 Hz in situ results in a time-dependent phosphorylation of the P-light chain of myosin. Initially, there was a rapid rate of phosphorylation within the first 10 muscle twitches (0.19 to 0.40 mol of phosphate/mol of P-light chain) followed by a slower rate of phosphorylation. These data indicate that myosin light chain kinase can be activated during repetitive stimulation at a low frequency in the range that occurs in vivo, despite the fact that the muscle is in the relaxed state during most of the period between each stimulation. Potentiation of isometric twitch tension was found to be temporally correlated to light chain phosphorylation at 5 Hz. It is postulated that the transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration associated with low frequency stimulation are sufficient to activate myosin light chain kinase, and, furthermore, the magnitude of the potentiation of isometric twitch tension may be related to the extent of phosphorylation of myosin during a stimulus train."
https://openalex.org/W1511084903,"Glycophorin A, the major sialoglycoprotein of the human erythrocyte, consists of a NH2-terminal carbohydrate-rich region exposed to the outside, a hydrophobic region which forms a transmembrane bridge, and a COOH-terminal hydrophilic region extending into the cytoplasm. With the aim of further defining the membrane-embedded region, the protein has been reconstituted into vesicles formed from dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and phospholipids containing photosensitive carbene precursors. The photosensitive groups were incorporated either at the omega-position of sn-2 fatty acyl chain or the polar head group of lecithins. Following photolysis, covalent cross-linking (1-2%) of the photoactivatable phospholipids to the protein was demonstrated. Degradation and sequence analysis showed that in the case of phospholipids containing photoactivatable groups in the fatty acyl chains most of the covalent cross-linking involved the carboxyl group of Glu-70. Therefore, the latter residue must be within the bilayer. This conclusion was supported by the reaction of the membrane-permeant [14C] dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with glycophorin reconstituted into vesicles. The same residue was labeled. Photolysis of glycophorin vesicles containing phospholipids with photolabels in the polar head group gave products in which the cross-links were present in peptide fragments (residues 62-81 and 82-96). These results define the probable boundaries of the membrane-embedded segment of glycophorin A. Corresponding experiments with erythrocyte ghosts gave similar results."
https://openalex.org/W1570049651,"Phosphomannosyl residues present on numerous acid hydrolases serve a critical role in mediating the endocytosis and intracellular transport of these glycoproteins. Previous work established that the mannose 6-phosphate on lysosomal enzymes is present on endoglycosidase H releasable oligosaccharides and that much of the phosphate is in diester linkage. In order to determine the number and location of the phosphates as well as the precise arrangement of the neutral sugar residues, we examined the structures of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides from a single acid hydrolase, human beta-glucuronidase isolated from spleen. The beta-glucuronidase-derived phosphorylated oligosaccharides are all high mannose-type oligosaccharides whose linkages correspond to previously described prototypical high mannose structures. They contain 1 or 2 moieties of mannose 6-phosphate/oligosaccharide. The major species contains 1 phosphate in diester linkage and represents approximately 63% of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides. Only 15% of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides have their phosphate exclusively in monoester linkage. The phosphate(s) present on these molecules is heterogeneous in location, but all of the phosphate present on the branch linked to the 3-carbon of the beta-linked mannose is found on its innermost alpha-1,2-linked mannose. Analysis of the phosphate-covering moiety showed it to be alpha-linked N-acetylglucosamine in most, if not all, cases."
https://openalex.org/W1607712148,"Four lines of evidence presented here suggest that the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in rat liver is modulated by changes in its phosphorylation state. 1) Livers were homogenized and microsomes were isolated and washed in the presence of either 50 mM NaCl or 50 mM NaF, the latter an inhibitor of phosphoprotein phosphatases. The 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity of microsomes prepared with NaF was 80% greater than that of microsomes prepared with NaCl. 2) Incubation of 10,000 X g supernatants from rat liver for 20 min at 37 degrees C in the absence of 50 mM KF decreased the activity of microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase by 52%. No significant change was seen in the presence of KF. 3) 7 alpha-Hydroxylase activity fell by 40% when microsomes were incubated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase compared to incubation of microsomes with phosphatase that was inhibited by phosphate and EDTA. 4) 7 alpha-Hydroxylase activity increased by 22% when phosphatase-treated microsomes were incubated for 40 min at 37 degrees C with 1 mM MgATP, 50 microM cAMP, and 200 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1490626694,"The carboxylation of ribulosebisphosphate involves a 6-carbon reaction-intermediate, 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. This labile intermediate, radiolabeled with 14CO2, was reduced (and thereby stabilized) with NaB[3H4]. This yielded a doubly labeled mixture with the chromatographic properties of 2-carboxy- and 4-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. These products (as their respective gamma-lactones) were chromatographically resolved from the gamma-lactones of 2-carboxy-D-ribitol and 2-carboxy-D-xylitol 1,5-bisphosphate, the other possible reduction products to be considered. Reduction of the 6-carbon reaction-intermediate by NaBH4 required prior denaturation of the enzyme. Of various denaturants tested, only acid was rapid enough to give good yields of the carboxypentitol bisphosphates. The reduction products of the reaction-intermediate inhibited the carboxylase stoichiometrically. In contrast to 2-carboxyribitol and 2-carboxyxylitol bisphosphate, 2-carboxy- and 4-carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate are exceptionally potent, essentially irreversible, slow-binding inhibitors of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1514692112,"The binding of 4-methylumbelliferyl galactose and 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylgalactosamine to ricin, Ricinus communis agglutinin, and ricin B chain was studied by fluorescence polarization and equilibrium dialysis. The binding of [3H]galactose to ricin was also studied by equilibrium dialysis. The results were consistent with binding of 2 mol of ligand to ricin (which contains 1 A chain and 1 B chain) and ricin B chain and 4 mol of ligand to the agglutinin (which contains 2 A chains and 2 B chains). There was no evidence for interaction between the 2 sites on any of the B chains."
https://openalex.org/W1576461076,"Bands 4.1 a and b are proteins of 80,000 and 78,000 molecular weight, which are both present at approximately 100,000 copies per erythrocyte ghost. Both proteins are components of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Bands 4.1 a and b are labeled when intact erythrocytes are incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and, therefore, are phosphoproteins. One-dimensional partial proteolytic mapping analysis of 32P-labeled bands 4.1 a and 4.1 b and two-dimensional peptide mapping analysis of 125I-labeled bands 4.1 a and 4.1 b clearly demonstrated that the two proteins are sequence-related phosphoproteins. Band 4.1 purified by standard techniques (Tyler, J. M., Hargreaves, W. R., and Branton, D. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 5192-5196) contains bands 4.1 a and 4.1 b. Bands 4.1 a and 4.1 b bind to spectrin heterodimers in solution. We conclude that the erythrocyte skeletal proteins bands 4.1 a and 4.1 b are sequence-related phosphoproteins, both capable of binding spectrin."
https://openalex.org/W1563976911,"Two glycolipid fractions were separated by high performance liquid chromatography from human erythrocyte membranes and which were reactive with antibodies to globo-N-tetraosylceramide (globoside). The reactivity to the antibody was abolished by treatment with endo-beta-galactosidase of Escherichia freundii which specifically hydrolyzes lacto-N-glycosyl series glycolipids, but does not hydrolyze globo series glycolipids. One of the fractions was isolated by repeated high performance liquid chromatography, and its structure was determined by direct probe mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and by degradation with exo- and endoglycosidases as follows: GalNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4GLcNAc beta 1 leads to 3 Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1ceramide. The carbohydrate structure was identical with the asialo core of (IV3NeuAc2 leads to 3GalNAcLcnOs4Cer) (Watanabe, K., and Hakomori, S. (1979) Biochemistry 14,5502-5504), but the ceramide moiety of this glycolipid was characterized by having C22 and C24 fatty acids in a striking contrast to that G3-ganglioside was characterized by the predominance of C14 fatty acid. Since globoside was previously identified as blood group P antigen (Marcus, D. M., Kundu, S. K., and Suzuki, A. (1981) Semin. Hematol. 18, 63-71), and both globoside and this glycolipid possess the common terminal structure GalNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal, this glycolipid may represent the second blood group P antigen belonging to the lacto series."
https://openalex.org/W1580534777,"A rapidly metabolized membrane protein from Spirodela, with an apparent molecular weight of 32,000, has been implicated in allosterically regulating electron transport and mediating diuron herbicide sensitivity in the chloroplast (Mattoo, A. K., Pick, U., Hoffman-Falk, H., and Edelman, M. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 1572-1576). Rapid synthesis of a 32,000-dalton plastid membrane protein is demonstrated for several diverse angiosperms and the alga, Chlamydomonas. Comparative partial proteolytic mapping of the polypeptide showed similar patterns for all species tested. In some cases, a 33,500-dalton precursor polypeptide was identified which also displayed interspecific structural homologies. Lastly, in situ analysis of the surface-exposed 32,000-dalton membrane protein yielded a common trypsinization pattern for the organisms studied. These findings point toward a broad distribution and phylogenetic similarity of the 32,000-dalton thylakoid protein of the chloroplast at levels of precursor maturation, membrane orientation, and primary structure."

https://openalex.org/W1803143888,"Yellow butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase are greened by a mixture of coenzyme A plus elemental sulfur. The resultant stable complex contains an identical ligand with that present in native green butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and has the same broad absorption band centered at 710 nm. Evidence is presented that the greening ligand is a CoA persulfide, possibly a mimic of the substrate carbanion thought to be generated early in the normal catalytic cycle. Variation in the position of the long wavelength band on replacement of FAD by a series of analogs of differing oxidation-reduction potential is consistent with a charge-transfer complex between a persulfide as the donor and oxidized flavin as the acceptor. The possible physiological and metabolic significance is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1591086707,"It was shown previously that four immunochemically identical forms of phenobarbital-induced hepatic cytochrome P-450 exist in unique combinations which characterize different strains and colonies of rats (Vlasuk, G. P., Ghrayeb, J., Ryan, D. E., Reik, L., Thomas, P. E., Levin, W., and Walz, F. G., Jr. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 789-798). One colony of Long-Evans rats exhibited only cytochromes P-450bLE and P-450e among these immunorelated enzymes; whereas, one colony of Holtzman rats was characterized by cytochromes P-450bH and P-450e. After phenobarbital treatment, hepatic poly(A)+-mRNA was isolated from these groups of rats and translated in vitro. The 35S-labeled products were immunoisolated with antibody to cytochrome P-450bLE and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that the products synthesized in vitro correspond exactly to the two particular forms of the enzyme that characterize liver microsomes from each of these groups of rats. It is concluded that different structural genes encode these immunorelated forms of cytochrome P-450 and that significant post-translational processing of their polypeptide products does not occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1504378394,"We have determined the complete amino acid sequence (182 residues) of the beta chain of favin, the glucose-binding lectin from fava beans (Vicia faba), and have established that the carbohydrate moiety is attached to Asn 168. Together with the sequence of the alpha chain previously reported (Hemperly, J. J., Hopp, T. P., Becker, J. W., and Cunningham, B. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6803-6810), these data complete the analysis of the primary structure of the lectin. We have also examined minor polypeptides that appear in all preparations of favin. Two lower molecular weight species (Mr = 9,500-11,600) appear to be fragments of the beta chain resulting from cleavage following Asn 76, whereas six high molecular weight forms (Mr = 25,000 or greater) appear to include aggregates of the beta chain and possibly some alternative products of chain processing."
https://openalex.org/W1503731071,"The detailed structures of the three asparagine-linked carbohydrate units of ovine lutropin subunits alpha and beta (oLH-alpha and oLH-beta) have been determined by carrying out the structural analysis on the three glycopeptides alpha GP-1, alpha GP-2, and beta GP-3, and the oligosaccharide obtained by alkaline sodium borohydride treatment of oLH and the individual subunits. Based on the results of methylation, periodate oxidation, deamination, acetolysis, and enzymatic studies with exoglycosidases, the following structure is proposed for the carbohydrate units of oLH. Methylation studies indicated that the 3 N-acetylglucosaminyl residues were substituted at 1-, 1,4-, and 1,4,6-positions. Two of the three mannosyl residues were 1,2-linked and 3rd mannosyl residue was 1,3,6-linked. Fucose and galactose were terminally located and N-acetylgalactosamine was substituted at C-4. Periodate oxidation studies were consistent with the methylation data. The isolation of (formula, see text) 2,5-anhydromannose by the deamination of the oLH oligosaccharide established the branched structure for the mannosyl residues as well as the linkage of the trimannose unit to N-acetylglucosamine. The nonreducing terminal position of N-acetylgalactosamine was indicated by the formation of N-acetylgalactosaminyl glyceraldehyde on Smith degradation of oLH. The presence of a substituent on N-acetylgalactosamine was established by the isolation of X-2,5-anhydrotalitol from the deamination products of oLH oligosaccharide. X was found to be an acid-labile substituent and was identified as a sulfate ester. Last but not least, since oLH oligosaccharide, obtained by hydrolysis of the hormone with NaOH + NaBH4, contained N-acetylglucosaminitol at the reducing end, the carbohydrate must be linked to the protein through N-acetylglucosamine."

https://openalex.org/W1548643016,"The activity of branched-chain alpha-keto acid (BCKA) dehydrogenase was increased after preincubation of liver and muscle mitochondria of control rats. Preincubation depleted mitochondrial ATP. Addition of ATP prevented the activation of BCKA dehydrogenase as well as reversed the activity of a fully activated enzyme to normal. Inhibition of phosphatase blocked the activation of BCKA dehydrogenase. There was a small or no increase in BCKA dehydrogenase activity when mitochondria from tissues of fasted, diabetic, and clofibrate-treated rats were preincubated. In fasted and diabetic rats, ATP was either less effective or failed to reverse the increased dehydrogenase activity in preincubated mitochondria. The concentration of ATP in liver and muscle mitochondria of diabetic rats was approximately one-half that of the control rats. We conclude that (a) in the fed state approximately 30-40% of BCKA dehydrogenase exists in the active form. The enzyme can be fully activated by preincubation of mitochondria which causes the depletion of ATP. Phosphatase is necessary for this activation. (b) In fasted, diabetic, and clofibrate-treated rats, approximately 70-100% of the enzyme exists in the active form which may be related to the mitochondrial depletion of ATP in vivo, and (c) while ATP can reverse the activation in control rats, it fails to do so in diabetic rats suggesting that other metabolic alterations may be involved in the regulation of BCKA dehydrogenase in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1603349246,"An assay was developed to detect the component which recognizes the methylated 5'-terminus of messenger RNA (cap) during initiation of translation. Globin mRNA translation in a reticulocyte cell-free system was partially inhibited with cap analogues, and protein fractions were added to the system in an attempt to reverse inhibition. Such an activity was detected in the 500 mM KCl extract of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes. The activity (cap analogue inhibition reversal) was purified 800-fold by precipitation with ammonium sulfate saturation, batchwise chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, centrifugation on sucrose gradients containing 100 and 500 mM KCl, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose. At some stages multiple peaks of activity were detected. Electrophoretic analysis of the final preparation revealed a single polypeptide of 24,000 daltons, making it likely that it is the same as the cap-binding protein detected by Sonenberg et al. (Sonenberg, N., Morgan, M. A., Merrick, W. C., and Shatkin, A. J. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 4843-4847), using a cross-linking assay. Direct binding of purified fractions of cap analog inhibition reversal factor to capped oligonucleotides of the form m7Gppp(Np)6-8G[32P]Cp could be demonstrated by both gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and nitrocellulose membrane filtration. Binding was stimulated by MgCl2 and nucleoside triphosphates. An approximate association constant between oligonucleotide and protein of 3 X 10(8) M-1 was obtained."

Lett. 18, 343-350) has been confirmed by chemical derivatization coupled to spectrofluorometric, spectrophotometric, and chromatographic analysis. Chlorophyllide (E458F674) and its demetallated analog were converted by catalytic hydrogenation into mesochlorophyllide a and mesopheophorbide a. Furthermore, methyl chlorophyllide (E458F674) was converted by partial hydrogenation into a mixture of monovinyl chlorophyllide a isomers and the latter into mesochlorophyllide a by further hydrogenation. On the other hand, chemical oxidation of methyl chlorophyllide (E458F674) converted it into methyl divinyl protochlorophyllide. Chlorophyllide (E458F674) was detected in several plant species and is proposed to be an important intermediate of the chlorophyll a biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1573105189,"During the concomitant reduction of [15N]nitrite and 14NO, the denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri produced considerable amounts of isotopically mixed N2O (14,15N2O) but did not isotopically intermix the nitrite and NO pools (Garber, E. A. E., and Hollocher, T. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5459-5465). It was determined that the mass spectrometric abundance of 14N15NO was about equal to that of 15N14NO in 14,15N2O by examination of the abundances of 14NO+, 15NO+, and 15N2+ that arose from the fragmentation of N2O+ species in the mass spectrometer. This positional isotopic equivalence requires that N2O arose from [15N]nitrite and 14NO by a process in which loss of oxygen occurred with equal probability from 15N and 14N precursors and suggests that at some point the precursors were identical if monomeric or effectively symmetrical if dimeric. One pathway, which is consistent with the available data and for which there is chemical precedence, is the reduction of nitrite and NO to nitroxyl (NOH or HNO), dimerization of free nitroxyl to a dinitrogen intermediate of short half-life, and dehydration of this intermediate to form N2O."
https://openalex.org/W1483490566,"Abstract The transport system for inorganic anions has been investigated in hepatocytes and hepatoma tissue culture cells. Sulfate transport in hepatocytes is temperature sensitive and occurs against an electrochemical gradient. Uptake was shown to occur by a sodium-dependent and a sodium-independent route with Km values of 2.3 and 33 mM and Vmax values of 2.1 and 10 nmol/mg of protein/min, respectively. An analysis of the sodium dependency indicates a Hill coefficient of 1.05 suggesting an equimolar stoichiometry for sodium and sulfate transport. The transport of sulfate was decreased by metabolic and sodium transport inhibitors. Bicarbonate was shown to effect the transport of sulfate, where uptake was accelerated by intracellular bicarbonate and competitively inhibited by extracellular bicarbonate. In addition, sulfate efflux was stimulated by extracellular bicarbonate. These results suggested that bicarbonate is a substrate for the sulfate transport system and can accelerate uptake and efflux by an anion exchange mechanism. Inhibition of bicarbonate uptake by extracellular sulfate and by the anion transport inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate demonstrates that bicarbonate does not enter the cell exclusively by CO2 diffusion but can be transported in part as an anionic species. These results are consistent with its role in the sulfate-bicarbonate exchange system. This inorganic anion transport system was shown to be inhibited by approximately 80% in hepatoma tissue culture cells where altered sodium dependency, Km, and Vmax values reflect possible alterations in the structure and/or membrane content of the carrier."

https://openalex.org/W1486221995,"Binding of NADH and NADPH to NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase from pig heart (which contains three types of subunits of similar molecular weight in the ratio 2:1:1) was studied by use of the enhancement of nucleotide fluorescence. NADH and NADPH bind independently and, for both reduced nucleotides, 0.5 binding sites/average subunit or two binding sites for every four subunits were detected. Binding of NADH is unaffected by metal ion, isocitrate, or NAD+. ADP is also not competitive with NADH binding but reduces the strength of binding 3-fold. In contrast, ATP (KI = 9 microM ATP4-) appears to be competitive with NADH. Evidence for an NADH site with higher dissociation constant (KD greater than 200 microM) than that obtained from the fluorescence measurements (KD = 2.8 microM at pH 6.1) is indicated by competition of NADH with [14C]NAD+ binding. NADPH binding is enhanced by the presence of manganese. The metal dependence is consistent with NADPH (KD = 8.1 microM at pH 6) binding to the same site as Mn-NADPH2- (KD = 0.9 microM). Dissociation constants for both species increase with increasing pH in the range 6-8. NADPH binding is competitively inhibited by ADP, ATP, ADP-ribose, and isocitrate. This inhibition of NADPH binding is probably indirect since measurements of [14C]ADP in the presence and absence of NADPH showed little inhibition of binding by NADPH concentrations sufficient to saturate the fluorescent site. These studies extent the number of ligands for isocitrate dehydrogenase for which there are fewer binding sites than there are subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1535107175,"Rat gastric mucosa segments incorporate [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate into glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins. After 6-h incubation, the order of radioactivity incorporated from both precursors was glycoproteins greater than heparan sulfate greater than chondroitin sulfate. Pulse-chase studies indicate that much of the tissue-bound radioactivity was extruded into the medium by the 6th hour of incubation. The glycoprotein fraction was electrophoretically polydisperse and its subfractions exhibited a wide range of 3H/35S. Mild acid hydrolysis of the glycoprotein fraction afforded sulfated hexosamine fractions which migrated like N-acetylhexosamine mono- and disulfates by paper chromatography and by paper electrophoresis and exhibited 3H/35S which was in accord with the presence of mono- and disulfated compounds. The ratio of the monosulfated to the disulfated species was about 7 to 1. In separate studies, both of these compounds were found in the glycoprotein fraction elaborated into the medium, the glycoprotein from the combined tissue plus medium, and in the sulfated oligosaccharide isolated from the latter by reductive alkaline cleavage. Subsequent acid hydrolysis and paper chromatographic examination of the sugars liberated from each of these compounds revealed the presence of glucosamine as the principal amino sugar. The results of a periodate oxidation study of the N-acetylhexosamine monosulfate were in accord with N-acetylhexosamine 6-sulfate being the principal compound. About 20% of the 3H in the N-acetylhexosamine monosulfate and 10% of the 3H in the disulfated compound were found associated with galactosamine. Separate incorporation studies with [35S] sulfate and [3H]glucose not only confirmed the presence of N-acetylhexosamine mono- and disulfates in the glycoprotein fraction but also demonstrated the presence of galactose monosulfate therein."
https://openalex.org/W1597064737,"We investigated the role of ATP in the assembly of microtubules. Tubulin, prepared by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, was nearly devoid of nucleoside diphosphokinase activity. ATP induced assembly in such preparations for a single assembly/disassembly cycle; then further assembly could not be induced by ATP unless the system was supplemented with additional GTP. This suggests that the E-site must contain GTP for polymerization and ATP interacts at a different site on tubulin. Although tubulin can be assembled into microtubules in 1.0 mM GTP, the inclusion of 0.2 mM ATP along with the GTP increases the rate and extent of assembly. The enhancement increased with increasing ATP concentrations. The inclusion of 0.2 mM ATP reduced the critical concentration for tubulin assembly from 1.5 to 0.9 mg/ml. Analysis of assembly rate versus protein concentration suggested that ATP also affects nucleation. Aggregates of tubulin rings formed by warming tubulin in the presence of 1.0 mM ATP and 5.0 mM Mg2+ were capable of initiating assembly in a solution of tubulin which was not able to polymerize. Furthermore, the extent of microtubule formation was dependent on the concentration of aggregated rings added to the solution. We propose that ATP interacts with tubulin at a binding site that is distinct from the N- and E-sites that bind GTP. A function of ATP binding is to stimulate the formation of tubulin rings as nucleation centers for polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W1544375953,"An improved procedure for the purification of bovine heart mitochondrial pyridine dinucleotide transhydrogenase is described. The enzyme is purified over 100-fold from submitochondrial particles with a 47.4% yield and a specific activity of 62.3 mumol/min/mg. Heart submitochondrial particle membranes were washed with 2 M NaCl to remove peripheral proteins. This was followed by a 1.5% Triton X-100 extraction of the membranes. The extract was then applied to an affinity column of NAD immobilized to agarose and the enzyme eluted with NADH. This step yielded homogeneous enzyme when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The preparation, when reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes, coupled proton uptake by the vesicles to the reduction of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide by NADPH. The polarity characteristics of transhydrogenase were evaluated by the phase separation technique of Bordier (Bordier, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1604-1607); 24% of the enzyme partitioned into the aqueous phase and 76% partitioned into the detergent phase. The amino acid composition was determined and polarity index was calculated to be 40%. These data indicate that the enzyme has hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1544562329,"DNA polymerase alpha was purified from a chick embryo extract by ammonium sulfate fractionation and successive column chromatographies. The final preparation had a specific enzyme activity of 39,000 units/mg of protein with activated calf thymus DNA as a template.primer. Electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel showed that the preparation contained two proteins, one of which was associated with DNA polymerase activity. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the electrophoretically pure enzyme gave two clusters of polypeptide bands. One was composed of 3-4 polypeptides with similar electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to Mr = 130,000-155,000, and the other consisted of four distinct polypeptide bands corresponding to Mr = 59,000, 56,000, 54,000, and 51,000. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping analysis of these polypeptides after 125I-iodination indicated that the structures of all four Mr = 51,000-59,000 polypeptides were very similar. In addition, polypeptides in the Mr = 145,000-155,000 region had almost identical structure with those in the Mr = 130,000-140,000 region. No significant structural homology was observed between the high molecular weight polypeptides and low molecular weight polypeptides. These findings indicate that the four polypeptides of Mr = 51,000-59,000 are generated by minor modification(s) of a single polypeptide. Similarly, the heterogeneity of the high molecular weight polypeptides is brought about by minor modification(s). Thus, chick embryo DNA polymerase alpha is basically composed of two kinds of subunit polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1578319257,"Photoactivatable, iodinated glycopeptides bearing oligosaccharides of defined structure have been synthesized for use as lectin binding site-specific agents. Two such glycopeptides have been examined utilizing concanavalin A, RCAI (Ricinus communis agglutinin), RCAII (R. communis toxin), and the Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin from human and rat hepatocytes. Covalent incorporation upon photoactivation only occurs with a glycopeptide which is specifically bound by the lectin and is inhibited only by appropriate haptenic monosaccharides. The efficiency of covalent coupling is on the order of 2%. Half-maximal covalent incorporation occurs at a concentration of photoactivatable glycopeptide which corresponds to the previously determined association constant for lectin binding in each case. Covalent incorporation of glycopeptide is accompanied by a decrease in the relative mobility of the lectin upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis equivalent to that expected for addition of an oligosaccharide moiety. The high degree of specificity and the relatively high affinity of these photoactivatable glycopeptides makes them promising agents for the examination of lectins such as the Gal/GalNAc-specific receptor present on mammalian hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1533509663,"Binding of CO to the hemoglobin of Tunnus thynnus has been studied by kinetic and static methods in the range pH 6.75-8.0 and at temperatures between 1.5-40 degrees C. The results may be described in terms of the two-state model of cooperativity (Monod. J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J. P. (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118) extended to include chain differences. The rate constants for CO binding to alpha and beta chains in the R state, at 20 degrees C, were 8.4 and 1.9 microM-1 s-1 with associated apparent activation energies of 3.5 and 10.5 kcal mol-1. Dissociation from the R state was monophasic with a rate constant, at 20 degrees C, of 0.016 s-1 and Ea of 26.4 kcal mol-1. The difference spectrum for binding of CO to the alpha chain in the T state is displaced 2 nm to the red as compared to the spectra associated with CO binding to the beta chain in the T state and to both chains in the R state. The proportion of T state hemoglobin present at different fractional saturations can thus be measured and compared with the results predicted from the model. When the temperature is raised, the value of L decreases greatly with an enthalpy of +80 kcal mol-1. The effects of the change in L override the decrease in intrinsic CO affinity of T. thynnus hemoglobin in the R and T states and result in a reverse temperature dependence of CO equilibria compared to mammalian hemoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W1554766122,"A retinoic acid epoxidase is present in rat kidney homogenates. It is found in the particulate fraction, and is dependent on ATP, NADPH, and oxygen. It is stimulated by Fe2+ and inhibited by Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, EDTA, and N,N'-diphenyl-para-phenylenediamine. Its properties are closest to those of microsomal lipid peroxidases previously studied. Epoxidase activity is not affected by the rat's vitamin A status, nor is it inducible by retinoic acid. In N,N'-diphenyl-para-phenylenediamine-feeding experiments, it was shown that blocking epoxidation in vivo does not inhibit the function of retinoic acid. It is concluded that retinoic acid epoxidation is not required for retinoic acid function."
https://openalex.org/W1588405730,"Concentrative uptake of pyridoxal by human erythrocytes has been investigated using a rapid mixing technique with 3H-labeled pyridoxal. A nonsaturable, initial influx of [3H]pyridoxal into the erythrocyte indicated passive diffusion. Since pyridoxal will form Schiff bases reversibly with amino acids, the possibility of binding to intracellular proteins was examined. Exposure of erythrocytes to pyridoxal followed by NaBH4 reduction, resulted in a stable pyridoxyl-protein complex. The binding site for pyridoxal was found to be on the alpha chain of oxyhemoglobin, as determined by ion exchange chromatography and amino acid analysis. Separation of the tryptic peptides from the [3H]pyridoxyl-alpha chain on Dowex 50 and analysis of the [3H] pyridoxal peptide showed that the binding site of pyridoxal was the NH2-terminal valine. Pyridoxal was also found to bind to the alpha chain of nonoxygenated hemoglobin. The rate of pyridoxyl-hemoglobin formation in a cell-free system provided additional evidence in support of the suggestion that concentrative uptake of pyridoxal by human erythrocytes is due to intracellular binding of pyridoxal to hemoglobin. Pyridoxal phosphate and glucose, which also bind to the NH2-terminal valine, did not reduce the accumulation of pyridoxal in the erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1596897424,"Two protein kinases (MPK1 and MPK2) were isolated from bovine heart mitochondria. After the solubilization of submitochondrial particles with cholate, these protein kinases were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sepharose 6B gel filtration, and affinity chromatography on phosvitin-Sepharose. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the final preparation of MPK1 contained two major polypeptide bands (40,000 and 36,000 daltons). MPK2 contained one major polypeptide of 34,000 daltons. Under nondenaturing conditions, the molecular weights of MPK1 and MPK2 were estimated to be approximately 250,000 and 70,000-90,000, respectively. MPK1 had a pH optimum at 9.0 and MPK2 at 7.5. Both enzymes required Mg2+ for activity and responded poorly to Mn2+ or Ca2+. Both had similar apparent Km values for ATP and were not affected by either cyclic AMP or Ca2+-calmodulin. MKP1 phosphorylated threonine residues and MPK2 serine residues of casein. With beta casein as substrate, MPK1 was more active than MPK2, whereas with alpha casein, MPK2 was more active than MPK1."
https://openalex.org/W1648709547,"Interactions of substrate (cholesterol), product (pregnenolone), and electron donor (adrenodoxin) with adrenal mitochondrial cytochrome P-450scc are strongly interdependent. The binding data are indicative of cooperative binding of three ligands (H+, cholesterol, and adrenodoxin) to cytochrome P-450scc. Cholesterol binding in 0.3% Tween 20 is enhanced by decreased pH in a manner quantitatively consistent with preferential binding to protonated cytochrome (Kd = 5 microM) as compared to deprotonated cytochrome (Kd congruent to 85 microM). Protonation of fully low spin P-450scc in the absence of cholesterol exhibits a pK = 6.5 and occurs without change of spin state (less than 5% high spin). Cholesterol binding increases the affinity for protonation (pK = 7.9). Adrenodoxin binding in absence of cholesterol is unaffected by protonation but is activated, in a temperature-dependent manner, by cholesterol (6-fold at 35 degrees C). The spin states of the respective complexes are: adrenodoxin-P-450 (15% high), cholesterol-P-450 (80% high) and ternary complex (95% high). The selective binding of substrate (cholesterol) to one of two low spin states of uncomplexed P-450scc, interconvertible by protonation, differs markedly from substrate binding to cytochrome P-450cam (Sligar, S. G., and Gunsalus, I. C. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 2290-2296). Pregnenolone binds competitively with cholesterol while reverting the spin state to a low spin complex. Kd for pregnenolone in absence of cholesterol (17 microM at 25 degrees C) is independent of pH but is competitively increased by adrenodoxin. Evidence is presented for an additional weak pregnenolone complex (Kd = 170 microM) in which both adrenodoxin and cholesterol are retained."
https://openalex.org/W1559623486,"Previously we showed that smooth microsomes from a variety of tissues effectively cleaved, sequestered, and glycosylated nascent chains of secretory proteins. To further characterize the role of smooth membranes in the biosynthesis of secretory polypeptides, rat liver smooth microsomes were separated into smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi fractions. Membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum cleaved the signal peptide of pre-placental lactogen, attached the high mannose core to the alpha subunit of chorionic gonadotropin, and sequestered the processed proteins. None of these processing steps were performed by Golgi membranes. However, processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and the coincident addition of terminal sugars was performed by Golgi but not by smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The properties of this post-translational reaction are very similar to those described for the reactions in vivo. These observations demonstrate that the enzymes for co-translational (pre-protein processing) and posttranslational (oligosaccharide maturation) processing events are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, respectively. This functional differentiation of Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membranes is an important feature of the secretory process in eukaryotic cells. Restriction of the recognition and transport of nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum establishes the polarity necessary for the ordered sequence of post-translational steps involved in the synthesis and maturation of secretory proteins."

The enzyme has been partially purified by affinity chromatography on CDP-hexanolamine agarose. Of the glycoprotein substrates examined, it utilizes the Gal beta 1 goes to 3GlcNAc sequence found on the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of prothrombin as its preferred acceptor substrate, and thus has been tentatively designated a Gal beta 1 goes to 3GlcNAc alpha 2 goes to 3 sialyltransferase. The partially purified enzyme has an acceptor specificity distinct from other purified mammalian sialyltransferases which synthesize the NeuAc alpha 2 goes to 3Gal beta 1 goes to 3 GalNAc and NeuAc alpha 2 goes to 6 GalNAc sequences common to oligosaccharides O-linked to threonine or serine and the NeuAc alpha 2 goes to 6Gal beta 1 goes to 4GlcNAc sequence found on oligosaccharides N-linked to asparagine."
https://openalex.org/W1497330482,"Lamins A and B, the two most abundant proteins in the nuclear envelope fraction, can each be converted into disulfide cross-linked homotypic oligomers by oxidation of intrinsic disulfide bonds. The cross-linked polymers of lamin A include dimers, trimers, tetramers, and larger polymers. Those that enter acrylamide gels migrate as expected for their molecular weights. Lamin B has yielded predominantly two oligomers and the number of monomers in these oligomers has been controversial. In the present study, it is demonstrated that migration of the lamin B oligomers is sensitive to the electrophoretic conditions; thus, the oligomers have appeared to be two forms of dimer or two forms of trimer, depending upon conditions. In the present study, a third, smaller oligomer of lamin B has been detected. Because there are three oligomers of lamin B, it is possible that these are a dimer, a trimer, and a tetramer. Support for this model has been obtained by analysis of cross-linked fragments from a mild trypsin digestion of cross-linked lamina proteins. This procedure yields 62,000-, 46,000-, and 30,000-dalton fragments of lamin B. Each fragment also occurs as three homotypic oligomers. The largest oligomer, which appears to be a tetramer, is obtained in high yield under brief, mild cross-linking conditions in several cell types. These results suggest that lamin B occurs as a tetramer in the nuclear envelope."
https://openalex.org/W1514205644,"The motional properties of all-trans-1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene embedded in the microsomal membranes and in extracted lipid liposomes from bovine adrenal cortex are studied by fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements. The results demonstrate the existence of a nonvanishing value of the anisotropy (r infinity) in both systems. The r infinity values are significantly higher in the total membranes than in the protein-depleted liposomes, following the trend of the steady state anisotropy values previously reported (Gallay, J., Vincent, M., de Paillerets, C., Rogard, M., and Alfsen, A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1235-1241). This indicates that the depolarizing rotations of the probe are more restricted in the presence of proteins. No detectable effect of proteins on the reorientational correlation time can be observed. The temperature dependence of r infinity is not similar in both systems. In the complete membranes, a sharp decrease of r infinity value takes place between 27 and 32 degrees C, corresponding to 1/3 of the total curve of r infinity versus temperature is translated to lower temperatures. Thermal dependence of the reorientational correlation time is essentially the same in lipids and in complete membranes with an activation energy of 5 kcal mol-1. The results suggest that proteins play an essential role in organizing the deepest lipid region in the microsomal membranes from bovine adrenal cortex."

M. and Oldfield, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1432-1446). The results, together with those obtained on suitable diamagnetic derivatives, permit partial determination of the static organization of the heme, and the results obtained are in good agreement with those obtained using x-ray crystallography (Takano, T. (1977( J. Mol. Biol. 110, 537-568). We show that resonances near the paramagnetic iron center are subject to extremely large (approximately 500 ppm) hyperfine shifts, which distort the otherwise symmetric 2H spectra. Temperature dependence studies are required to analyze these shifts, which are an order of magnitude larger than those seen in solution NMR spectroscopy. The overall results suggest that 2H solid state NMR spectroscopy of magnetically ordered paramagnetic protein microcrystals may be a useful method for determination of heme organization in systems that for one reason or another are unsuitable for analysis using x-ray diffraction methods."
https://openalex.org/W1663665741,"We examined the mechanism of ribonucleotide pool changes in methotrexate-treated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in culture. In exponentially growing cells, methotrexate inhibited ATP and GTP formation and stimulated UTP and CTP formation by the de novo pathways. Over the following 4 h, ATP and GTP decreased and UTP and CTP increased. During this period RNA synthesis rates decreased by 30 to 40%. Inhibitors of nucleolar RNA synthesis (actinomycin D, doxorubicin, or cycloheximide), but not of DNA synthesis (cytosine arabinoside), prevented ATP and GTP depletion. These results suggest that ATP and GTP were depleted in methotrexate-treated cells because the shift-down of RNA synthesis occurred more slowly than the inhibition of ATP and GTP supply. UTP and CTP pools increased because of increased de novo synthesis and because of decreased consumption in RNA synthesis. Ribonucleoside triphosphates were increased and their syntheses by de novo pathways were inhibited in cells treated with RNA synthesis inhibitors. ATP decreased slightly and GTP remained unchanged in growth-arrested cells treated with methotrexate. In growth-arrested cells, de novo purine nucleotide synthesis was inhibited less and RNA synthesis rates were lower than in growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1576794609,"3-O-Methyl-D-glucose-resistant mutants were selected from Chinese hamster ovary cells after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate. A mutant, MegR24, was isolated which was significantly more resistant than the parent to 3-O-methylglucose. Uptake of 50 microM D-glucose by metabolizing MegR24 cells was 2- to 3-fold higher than the parental cells in the absence or presence of 100 mM 3-O-methylglucose. A study of transport of D-[3H]glucose in ATP-depleted cells indicated an apparent Km for D-glucose transport that was 3-fold lower for the mutant (2.7 +/- 0.3 mM) than for the parent (8.9 +/- 1.0 mM). The apparent Km for transport of 3-O-methylglucose by the mutant (10.9 +/- 2.4 mM) was almost 2-fold lower than that of the parent (21.4 +/- 4.7 mM). The Vmax values for transport of D-glucose or 3-O-methylglucose by the mutant and parental cell lines were not significantly different. The MegR24 mutant also exhibited enhanced countertransport of D-[3H]glucose following preloading of ATP-depleted cells with 100 mM 3-O-methylglucose. Simple diffusion of hexoses as measured by L-glucose uptake was not altered in the mutant. These results suggest that the MegR24 hexose carrier has an increased affinity for transport of hexoses and that the resistance to the cytotoxic effects of 3-O-methylglucose exhibited by MegR24 is due to its ability to transport D-glucose 2- to 3-fold more efficiently than the parental strain."
https://openalex.org/W1516451377,"A number of N-substituted ethanolamine derivatives have been found to interact productively with ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, an adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) requiring enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of vicinal amino alcohols to oxo compounds. Inhibition, inactivation, cleavage of AdoCbl, and exchange of tritium out of [5'-3H]AdoCbl were all observed, the effects varying from analog to analog. The most striking effects were seen with azetidin-2-ol and pyrrolidin-3-ol, two aliphatic heterocycles composed of ethanolamine in which the nitrogen is tied back to the carbinol carbon by methylene bridges containing one and two carbon atoms, respectively. Incubation of azetidinol with the enzyme.AdoCbl complex resulted in extensive inactivation of the enzyme accompanied by cleavage of the cofactor; exchange of 3H from [5'-3H]AdoCbl into a nonbasic compound was also seen. Pyrrolidinol interacted with the enzyme.AdoCbl complex in a substrate-like way, causing exchange of 3H from labeled cofactor into a basic compound (perhaps the pyrrolidinol itself) together with a slight amount of C-Co bond cleavage. The interaction of the enzyme.AdoCbl complex with pyrrolidinol suggests that productively bound substrate is associated with the active site in such a way that the dihedral angle between the nitrogen and the oxygen is about 120 degrees, a configuration which maximizes bond-bond repulsions between the substituents on the adjacent carbon atoms."
