https://openalex.org/W2480678377,"Proteasome abundance is crucial for cell survival, but how cells maintain adequate amounts of proteasome is unclear; an analysis in yeast identifies TORC1 and Mpk1 as central components of a pathway regulating proteasome homeostasis through the coordinated regulation of regulatory particle assembly chaperones and proteasome subunits—this pathway is evolutionarily conserved with mTOR and ERK5 regulating proteasome abundance in mammals. The proteasome is the cell's protein degradation machinery. It is composed of a core particle and two regulatory particles. Chaperone proteins known as RACs mediate the assembly of the regulatory particles, and under stressful conditions in yeast, an additional chaperone called Adc17 helps to generate more proteasomes. A long-standing question has been how stress leads to increased Adc17 levels. Adrien Rousseau and Anne Bertolotti report that an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway controls proteasome homeostasis in yeast and mammals. Specifically, they find that in an adaptive response to stress, the TORC1 protein in yeast (mTOR in mammals) is inhibited. Consequently, the downstream signalling molecule — the enzyme Mpk1 in yeast or Erk5 in mammals — ensures increased supplies of not just RACs, but also proteasome subunits. The proteasome is essential for the selective degradation of most cellular proteins, but how cells maintain adequate amounts of proteasome is unclear. Here we show that there is an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway controlling proteasome homeostasis. Central to this pathway is TORC1, the inhibition of which induced all known yeast 19S regulatory particle assembly-chaperones (RACs), as well as proteasome subunits. Downstream of TORC1 inhibition, the yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase, Mpk1, acts to increase the supply of RACs and proteasome subunits under challenging conditions in order to maintain proteasomal degradation and cell viability. This adaptive pathway was evolutionarily conserved, with mTOR and ERK5 controlling the levels of the four mammalian RACs and proteasome abundance. Thus, the central growth and stress controllers, TORC1 and Mpk1/ERK5, endow cells with a rapid and vital adaptive response to adjust proteasome abundance in response to the rising needs of cells. Enhancing this pathway may be a useful therapeutic approach for diseases resulting from impaired proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2489594338,"In contrast to the well-characterized effects of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) derived fromeicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), little is known about themetabolic fate of the intermediary long-chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). In this double blind crossover study, shifts in circulating levels of n-3 and n-6 PUFA-derived bioactive lipid mediators were quantified by an unbiased liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry lipidomic approach. Plasma was obtainedfrom humansubjects before andafter 7 d of supplementationwith pure n-3DPA, n-3 EPA or placebo (olive oil). DPA supplementation increased the SPM resolvin D5n-3DPA (RvD5n-3DPA) and maresin (MaR)-1, the DHA vicinal diol 19, 20-dihydroxy-DPA and n-6 PUFA derived 15-keto-PG E2 (15-keto-PGE2). EPA supplementation had no effect on any plasma DPA or DHA derived mediators, but markedly elevated monohydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acids (HEPEs), including the e-series resolvin (RvE) precursor 18-HEPE; effects not observed with DPA supplementation. These data show that dietary n-3 DPA and EPA have highly divergent effects on human lipid mediator profile, with no overlap in PUFA metabolites formed. The recently uncovered biologic activity of n-3 DPA docosanoids and their marked modulation by dietary DPA intake reveals a unique and specific role of n-3 DPA in human physiology.—Markworth, J.

https://openalex.org/W2497447644,"Background Expression of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is typically evaluated through invasive biopsies; however, recent advances in the identification of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may be a less invasive method to assay tumor cells for these purposes. These liquid biopsies rely on accurate identification of CTCs from the diverse populations in the blood, where some tumor cells share characteristics with normal blood cells. While many blood cells can be excluded by their high expression of CD45, neutrophils and other immature myeloid subsets have low to absent expression of CD45 and also express PD-L1. Furthermore, cytokeratin is typically used to identify CTCs, but neutrophils may stain non-specifically for intracellular antibodies, including cytokeratin, thus preventing accurate evaluation of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. This holds even greater significance when evaluating PD-L1 in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) positive and EpCAM negative CTCs (as in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)). Methods To evaluate the impact of CTC misidentification on PD-L1 evaluation, we utilized CD11b to identify myeloid cells. CTCs were isolated from patients with metastatic NSCLC using EpCAM, MUC1 or Vimentin capture antibodies and exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP) technology. Results Large populations of CD11b+CD45lo cells were identified in buffy coats and stained non-specifically for intracellular antibodies including cytokeratin. The amount of CD11b+ cells misidentified as CTCs varied among patients; accounting for 33–100% of traditionally identified CTCs. Cells captured with vimentin had a higher frequency of CD11b+ cells at 41%, compared to 20% and 18% with MUC1 or EpCAM, respectively. Cells misidentified as CTCs ultimately skewed PD-L1 expression to varying degrees across patient samples. Conclusions Interfering myeloid populations can be differentiated from true CTCs with additional staining criteria, thus improving the specificity of CTC identification and the accuracy of biomarker evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2492528640,"Transcranial focused ultrasound technology used to transiently open the blood-brain barrier, is capable of stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis; however, it is not yet known what aspects of the treatment are necessary for enhanced neurogenesis to occur. The present study set out to determine whether the opening of blood-brain barrier, the specific pressure amplitudes of focused ultrasound, and/or the intravenous administration of microbubbles (phospholipid microspheres) are necessary for the enhancement of neurogenesis. Specifically, mice were exposed to burst (10ms, 1Hz burst repetition frequency) focused ultrasound at the frequency of 1.68MHz and with 0.39, 0.78, 1.56 and 3.0MPa pressure amplitudes. These treatments were also conducted with or without microbubbles, at 0.39 + 0.78MPa or 1.56 + 3.0MPa, respectively. Only focused ultrasound at the ~0.78 MPa pressure amplitude with microbubbles promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and was associated with an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability. These results suggest that focused ultrasound -mediated neurogenesis is dependent upon the opening of the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2477114761,"The moringa tree Moringa oleifera is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree cultivated across the lowland dry tropics worldwide for its nutritious leaves. Despite its nutritious reputation, there has been no systematic survey of the variation in leaf nutritional quality across M. oleifera grown worldwide, or of the other species of the genus. To guide informed use of moringa, we surveyed protein, macro-, and micro- nutrients across 67 common garden samples of 12 Moringa taxa, including 23 samples of M. oleifera. Moringa oleifera, M. concanensis, M. stenopetala, an M. concanensis X oleifera hybrid, and M. longituba were highest in protein, with M. ruspoliana having the highest calcium levels. A protein-dry leaf mass tradeoff may preclude certain breeding possibilities, e.g. maximally high protein with large leaflets. These findings identify clear priorities and limitations for improved moringa varieties with traits such as high protein, calcium, or ease of preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2493736035,"The elevated level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau and phosphorylated Tau181 (p-Tau181) proteins are well established hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Elevated level of p-Tau181 can differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative disease. However, the expression level of these proteins in serum of AD patient is not well set up. This study sought to evaluate the level of Tau and p-Tau181 in serum of AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients for an alternative approach to establish protein-based markers by convenient way. Blood samples were collected from 39 AD patients, 37 MCI patients and 37 elderly individuals as controls. The levels of Tau and p-Tau181 in the serum of the different groups were measured by label free real time Surface Plasmon Resonance technology by using specific antibodies, and were further confirmed by the conventional western blot method. An appropriate statistical analysis, including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), was performed. The concentrations of serum Tau and p-Tau181 were significantly higher (p<0.00001) in AD (Tau; 47.49±9.00ng/μL, p-Tau181; 0.161±0.04 ng/μL) compared to MCI (Tau; 39.26±7.78 ng/μL, p-Tau181; 0.135±0.02 ng/μL) and were further higher compared to elderly controls (Tau; 34.92±6.58 ng/μL, p-Tau181; 0.122±0.01 ng/ μL). A significant (p<0.0001) downhill correlation was found between Tau as well as p-Tau181 levels with HMSE and MoCA score. This study for the first time reports the concentration of Tau and p-Tau181 in serum of AD and MCI patients. The cutoff values of Tau and p-Tau181 of AD and MCI patients with sensitivity and specificity reveal that serum level of these proteins can be used as a predictive marker for AD and MCI."
https://openalex.org/W2484346411,"Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is an incurable human disease characterized by the misfolding, aggregation, and systemic deposition of amyloid composed of immunoglobulin light chains (LC). This work describes our studies on potential mechanisms of AL cytotoxicity. We have studied the internalization of AL soluble proteins and amyloid fibrils into human AC16 cardiomyocytes by using real time live cell image analysis. Our results show how external amyloid aggregates rapidly surround the cells and act as a recruitment point for soluble protein, triggering the amyloid fibril elongation. Soluble protein and external aggregates are internalized into AC16 cells via macropinocytosis. AL amyloid fibrils are shown to be highly cytotoxic at low concentrations. Additionally, caspase assays revealed soluble protein induces apoptosis, demonstrating different cytotoxic mechanisms between soluble protein and amyloid aggregates. This study emphasizes the complex immunoglobulin light chain-cell interactions that result in fibril internalization, protein recruitment, and cytotoxicity that may occur in AL amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2483107220,"The current subgenus Drosophila (the traditional immigrans-tripunctata radiation) includes major elements of temperate drosophilid faunas in the northern hemisphere. Despite previous molecular phylogenetic analyses, the phylogeny of the subgenus Drosophila has not fully been resolved: the resulting trees have more or less varied in topology. One possible factor for such ambiguous results is taxon-sampling that has been biased towards New World species in previous studies. In this study, taxon sampling was balanced between Old and New World species, and phylogenetic relationships among 45 ingroup species selected from ten core species groups of the subgenus Drosophila were analyzed using nucleotide sequences of three nuclear and two mitochondrial genes. Based on the resulting phylogenetic tree, ancestral distributions and divergence times were estimated for each clade to test Throckmorton's hypothesis that there was a primary, early-Oligocene disjunction of tropical faunas and a subsequent mid-Miocene disjunction of temperate faunas between the Old and the New Worlds that occurred in parallel in separate lineages of the Drosophilidae. Our results substantially support Throckmorton's hypothesis of ancestral migrations via the Bering Land Bridge mainly from the Old to the New World, and subsequent vicariant divergence of descendants between the two Worlds occurred in parallel among different lineages of the subgenus Drosophila. However, our results also indicate that these events took place multiple times over a wider time range than Throckmorton proposed, from the late Oligocene to the Pliocene."
https://openalex.org/W2504620656,"Over the past decades much research focused on the biosynthesis of the plant hormone jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). While many details about its biosynthetic pathway as well about its physiological function are established nowadays, knowledge about its catabolic fate is still scarce. Only recently, the hormonal inactivation mechanisms became a stronger research focus. Two major pathways have been proposed to inactivate JA-Ile: i) The cleavage of the jasmonyl-residue from the isoleucine moiety, a reaction that is catalyzed by specific amido-hydrolases, or ii), the sequential oxidation of the ω-end of the pentenyl side-chain. This reaction is catalyzed by specific members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) subfamily CYP94: CYP94B1, CYP94B3 and CYP94C1. In the present study, we further investigated the oxidative fate of JA-Ile by expanding the analysis on Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, lacking only one (cyp94b1, cyp94b2, cyp94b3, cyp94c1), two (cyp94b1xcyp94b2, cyp94b1xcyp94b3, cyp94b2xcyp94b3), three (cyp94b1xcyp94b2xcyp94b3) or even four (cyp94b1xcyp94b2xcyp94b3xcyp94c1) CYP94 functionalities. The results obtained in the present study show that CYP94B1, CYP94B2, CYP94B3 and CYP94C1 are responsible for catalyzing the sequential ω-oxidation of JA-Ile in a semi-redundant manner. While CYP94B-enzymes preferentially hydroxylate JA-Ile to 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile, CYP94C1 catalyzes primarily the subsequent oxidation, yielding 12-carboxy-JA-Ile. In addition, data obtained from investigating the triple and quadruple mutants let us hypothesize that a direct oxidation of unconjugated JA to 12-hydroxy-JA is possible in planta. Using a non-targeted metabolite fingerprinting analysis, we identified unconjugated 12-carboxy-JA as novel jasmonate derivative in floral tissues. Using the same approach, we could show that deletion of CYP94-genes might not only affect JA-homeostasis but also other signaling pathways. Deletion of CYP94B1, for example, led to accumulation of metabolites that may be characteristic for plant stress responses like systemic acquired resistance. Evaluation of the in vivo function of the different CYP94-enzymes on the JA-sensitivity demonstrated that particularly CYP94B-enzymes might play an essential role for JA-response, whereas CYP94C1 might only be of minor importance."
https://openalex.org/W2493045078,"Rotavirus (RV) has been shown to infect and stimulate secretion of serotonin from human enterochromaffin (EC) cells and to infect EC cells in the small intestine of mice. It remains to identify which intracellularly expressed viral protein(s) is responsible for this novel property and to further establish the clinical role of serotonin in RV infection. First, we found that siRNA specifically silencing NSP4 (siRNANSP4) significantly attenuated secretion of serotonin from Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) infected EC tumor cells compared to siRNAVP4, siRNAVP6 and siRNAVP7. Second, intracellular calcium mobilization and diarrhoeal capacity from virulent and avirulent porcine viruses correlated with the capacity to release serotonin from EC tumor cells. Third, following administration of serotonin, all (10/10) infants, but no (0/8) adult mice, responded with diarrhoea. Finally, blocking of serotonin receptors using Ondansetron significantly attenuated murine RV (strain EDIM) diarrhoea in infant mice (2.9 vs 4.5 days). Ondansetron-treated mice (n = 11) had significantly (p < 0.05) less diarrhoea, lower diarrhoea severity score and lower total diarrhoea output as compared to mock-treated mice (n = 9). Similarly, Ondansetron-treated mice had better weight gain than mock-treated animals (p < 0.05). A most surprising finding was that the serotonin receptor antagonist significantly (p < 0.05) also attenuated total viral shedding. In summary, we show that intracellularly expressed NSP4 stimulates release of serotonin from human EC tumor cells and that serotonin participates in RV diarrhoea, which can be attenuated by Ondansetron."
https://openalex.org/W2496677922,"Presently, an incomplete mechanistic understanding of tropical reef macroalgae photosynthesis and calcification restricts predictions of how these important autotrophs will respond to global change. Therefore, we investigated the mechanistic link between inorganic carbon uptake pathways, photosynthesis and calcification in a tropical crustose coralline alga (CCA) using microsensors. We measured pH, oxygen (O2), and calcium (Ca2+) dynamics and fluxes at the thallus surface under ambient (8.1) and low (7.8) seawater pH (pHSW) and across a range of irradiances. Acetazolamide (AZ) was used to inhibit extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CAext), which mediates hydrolysis of HCO3-, and 4,4′ diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulphonate (DIDS) that blocks direct HCO3- uptake by anion exchange transport. Both inhibited photosynthesis, suggesting both diffusive uptake of CO2 via HCO3- hydrolysis to CO2 and direct HCO3- ion transport are important in this CCA. Surface pH was raised approximately 0.3 units at saturating irradiance, but less when CAext was inhibited. Surface pH was lower at pHSW 7.8 than pHSW 8.1 in the dark, but not in the light. The Ca2+ fluxes were large, complex and temporally variable, but revealed net Ca2+ uptake under all conditions. The temporal variability in Ca2+ dynamics was potentially related to localized dissolution during epithallial cell sloughing, a strategy of CCA to remove epiphytes. Simultaneous Ca2+ and pH dynamics suggest the presence of Ca2+/H+ exchange. Rapid light-induced H+ surface dynamics that continued after inhibition of photosynthesis revealed the presence of a light-mediated, but photosynthesis-independent, proton pump. Thus, the study indicates metabolic control of surface pH can occur in CCA through photosynthesis and light-inducible H+ pumps. Our results suggest that complex light-induced ion pumps play an important role in biological processes related to inorganic carbon uptake and calcification in CCA."
https://openalex.org/W2479878722,"Background Liquid biopsy has been proposed to be a promising noninvasive tool to obtain information on tumor progression. Through a clinical observation of a case series of 6 consecutive patients, we aim to determine the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for monitoring the tumor burden during the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Materials and Methods We used capture sequencing of 545 genes to identify somatic alternations in primary tumor tissues of the six CRC patients who underwent radical surgery and in 23 plasma samples collected at serial time points. We compared the mutation patterns and variant allele frequencies (VAFs) between the matched tissue and the plasma samples and evaluated the potential advantage of using ctDNA as a better tumor load indicator to detect disease relapse over carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 19–9 and imaging studies. Results We identified low-frequency mutations with a mean VAF of 0.88% (corresponding to a mean tumor burden of 0.20ng/mL) in the preoperative plasmas of four patients with locally advanced CRC and a subset of mutations shared by their primary tumors. The tumor loads appeared a sudden decrease upon surgery or other adjuvant treatments and then generally maintained at low levels (0.092ng/mL) until disease recurred. ctDNA increased by 13-fold when disease relapsed in one patient while the CEA and CA 19–9 levels remained normal. In this patient, all six somatic mutations identified in the preoperative plasma were detected in the recrudescent plasma again, with five mutations showing allele fraction increase. Conclusions We described a multi-time-point profile of ctDNA of CRC patients during the course of comprehensive treatment and observed a correlation of ctDNA level with the clinically evaluated tumor progression. This demonstrated a new strategy by analyzing the heterogeneous ctDNA to evaluate and monitor the tumor burden in the treatment and follow-up of CRC patients, with potentially better potency than conventional biomarkers."

Participants aged ≥ 70 years were at increased risk of functional decline based on a score ≥ 2 points on the Identification of Seniors at Risk- Primary Care, ISAR-PC. Participants in the intervention group received a systematic comprehensive geriatric assessment, and individually tailored multifactorial interventions coordinated by a trained community-care registered nurse (CCRN) with multiple follow-up home visits. The primary outcome was the participant's disability as measured by the modified Katz activities of daily living (ADL) index score (range 0-15) at one year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, hospitalization, and mortality.At baseline, the median age was 82.7 years (IQR 77.0-87.1), the median modified Katz-ADL index score was 2 (IQR 1-5) points in the intervention group and 3 (IQR 1-5) points in the control group. The follow-up rate was 76.8% (n = 1753) after one year and was similar in both trial groups. The adjusted intervention effect on disability was -0.07 (95% confidence interval -0.22 to 0.07; p = 0.33). No intervention effects were found for the secondary outcomes.We found no evidence that a one-year individualized multifactorial intervention program with nurse-led care coordination was better than the current primary care in community-living older people at increased risk of functional decline in The Netherlands.Netherlands Trial Register NTR2653."

Row-crop production in Iowa accounts for 75% of the arable acres, with corn, Zea mays, representing the majority of hectares planted. To date, there has been no description of the insect pollinator community found within Iowa cornfields. We report a field study to determine the optimal sampling methodology to characterize the community of insect pollinators within cornfields. During 2012 and 2013, 3,616 insect pollinators representing 51 species were captured using bee bowls, and 945 individuals representing 10 species were captured using sticky cards. We examined the effects of trap type, height, and bowl color on the described community. Bee bowls captured a more abundant and species rich community than sticky cards with all species captured on sticky cards also present in bee bowls. Traps deployed at the height of the tassels describe a more abundant and species rich community of pollinators than traps at ear height (2x as many individuals) or ground height (4x as many individuals). Blue bowls captured more bees than white (2.75x as many individuals) or yellow bowls (3.5x as many individuals); and yellow bowls captured more flies than white (2x as many individuals) or blue (2.3x as many individuals). To provide the most complete description of the community of insect pollinators using cornfields as a resource, we suggest sampling-using bee bowls at the height of the tassels using all three bee bowl colors."

An evaluation of the system is thus needed to ascertain the surveillance provides a precise description of the current situation in the country. The evaluation should assess stakeholders’ perceptions and expectations about the system due to the fact that the acceptability has an influence on the levels of sensitivity and timeliness of the surveillance system. The objective of the study was to assess the acceptability of the bTB surveillance in Belgium, using participatory tools and the OASIS flash tool (‘analysis tool for surveillance systems’). Methods For the participatory process, focus group discussions and individual interviews were implemented with representatives involved with the system, both from cattle and wildlife part of the surveillance. Three main tools were used: (i) relational diagrams associated with smileys, (ii) flow diagrams associated with proportional piling, and (iii) impact diagrams associated with proportional piling. A total of six criteria were assessed, among which five were scored on a scale from -1 to +1. For the OASIS flash tool, one full day meeting with representatives from stakeholders involved with the surveillance was organised. A total of 19 criteria linked to acceptability were scored on a scale from 0 to 3. Results and Conclusion Both methods highlighted a medium acceptability of the bTB surveillance. The main elements having a negative influence were the consequences of official notification of a bTB suspect case in a farm, the low remuneration paid to private veterinarians for execution of intradermal tuberculin tests and the practical difficulties about the containment of the animals. Based on the two evaluation processes, relevant recommendations to improve the surveillance were made. Based on the comparison between the two evaluation processes, the added value of the participatory approach was highlighted."
https://openalex.org/W2482167689,"Debridement, the removal of diseased, nonviable tissue, is critical for clinicians to readily assess wound status and prepare the wound bed for advanced therapeutics or downstream active healing. Removing necrotic slough and eschar through surgical or mechanical methods is less specific and may be painful for patients. Enzymatic debridement agents, such as Clostridial collagenase, selectively and painlessly degrade devitalized tissue. In addition to its debriding activities, highly-purified Clostridial collagenase actively promotes healing, and our past studies reveal that extracellular matrices digested with this enzyme yield peptides that activate cellular migratory, proliferative and angiogenic responses to injury in vitro, and promote wound closure in vivo. Intriguingly, while collagenase Santyl® ointment, a sterile preparation containing Clostridial collagenases and other non-specific proteases, is a well-accepted enzymatic debridement agent, its role as an active healing entity has never been established. Based on our previous studies of pure Clostridial collagenase, we now ask whether the mixture of enzymes contained within Santyl® produces matrix-derived peptides that promote cellular injury responses in vitro and stimulate wound closure in vivo. Here, we identify novel collagen fragments, along with collagen-associated peptides derived from thrombospondin-1, multimerin-1, fibronectin, TGFβ-induced protein ig-h3 and tenascin-C, generated from Santyl® collagenase-digested human dermal capillary endothelial and fibroblastic matrices, which increase cell proliferation and angiogenic remodeling in vitro by 50-100% over controls. Using an established model of impaired healing, we further demonstrate a specific dose of collagenase from Santyl® ointment, as well as the newly-identified and chemically-synthesized ECM-derived peptides significantly increase wound re-epithelialization by 60-100% over saline-treated controls. These results not only confirm and extend our earlier studies using purified collagenase- and matrix-derived peptides to stimulate healing in vitro and in vivo, but these Santyl®-generated, matrix-derived peptides may also represent exciting new opportunities for creating advanced wound healing therapies that are enabled by enzymatic debridement and potentially go beyond debridement."

Consistent with this, independent molecular dynamics simulations with alchemical free energy perturbation calculations predicted selective propofol binding to interfacial sites, with higher affinities for α/β than γ-containing interfaces. The simulations indicated hydrogen bonding is a key component leading to propofol-selective binding within GABAA receptor subunit interfaces, with stable hydrogen bonds observed between propofol and α/β cavity residues but not γ cavity residues. We confirmed this by introducing a hydrogen bond-null propofol analogue as a protecting ligand for targeted-ABPP and observed a lack of GABAA receptor subunit protection.

https://openalex.org/W2475871624,"Nitrogen (N) is a major nutrient needed to attain optimal grain yield (GY) in all environments. Nitrogen fertilisers represent a significant production cost, in both monetary and environmental terms. Developing genotypes capable of taking up N early during development while limiting biomass production after establishment and showing high N-use efficiency (NUE) would be economically beneficial. Genetic variation in NUE has been shown previously. Here we describe the genetic characterisation of NUE and identify genetic loci underlying N response under different N fertiliser regimes in a bread wheat population of doubled-haploid lines derived from a cross between two Australian genotypes (RAC875 × Kukri) bred for a similar production environment. NUE field trials were carried out at four sites in South Australia and two in Western Australia across three seasons. There was genotype-by-environment-by-treatment interaction across the sites and also good transgressive segregation for yield under different N supply in the population. We detected some significant Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with NUE and N response at different rates of N application across the sites and years. It was also possible to identify lines showing positive N response based on the rankings of their Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs) within a trial. Dissecting the complexity of the N effect on yield through QTL analysis is a key step towards elucidating the molecular and physiological basis of NUE in wheat."

Seven and eight chromosomal bins were located on 7PS and 7PL, respectively. The above-mentioned translocation and deletion lines each contained different, yet overlapping 7P chromosomal fragments, covering the entire A. cristatum 7P chromosome. Three translocation lines (7PT-13, 7PT-14 and 7PT-17) and three deletion lines (del-1, del-2 and del-3), which contained the common chromosomal bins 7PS1-3, displayed higher thousand-grain weigh than Fukuho, suggesting that potential genes conferring high thousand-grain weigh might be located on these chromosomal bins. Therefore, wheat-A. cristatum 7P translocation lines with elite traits will be useful as novel germplasms for wheat genetic improvement."

Previously, we and other groups reported that the α5 helix of Gαi1, especially the hydrophobic interactions in this region, plays a key role during nucleotide release and G protein activation. To further investigate the effect of this hydrophobic core, we disrupted it in Gαi1 by inserting 4 alanine amino acids into the α5 helix between residues Gln333 and Phe334 (Ins4A). This extends the length of the α5 helix without disturbing the β6-α5 loop interactions. This mutant has high basal nucleotide exchange activity yet no receptor-mediated activation of nucleotide exchange. By using structural approaches, we show that this mutant loses critical hydrophobic interactions, leading to significant rearrangements of side chain residues His57, Phe189, Phe191, and Phe336; it also disturbs the rotation of the α5 helix and the π-π interaction between His57 and Phe189. In addition, the insertion mutant abolishes G protein release from the activated receptor after nucleotide binding. Our biochemical and computational data indicate that the interactions between α5, α1, and β2-β3 are not only vital for GDP release during G protein activation, but they are also necessary for proper GTP binding (or GDP rebinding).

They were enrolled under the following criteria: breast lesions larger than 1 cm in diameter which 1) were suspicious for malignancy on mammography or ultrasound (US), 2) were pathologically confirmed to be breast cancer with US-guided core-needle biopsy (CNB) 3) underwent 3 Tesla MRI with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), and 4) had an attainable immunohistochemistry profile from CNB. We acquired spectral data by HR-MAS MRS with CNB specimens and expressed the data as relative metabolite concentrations. We compared the metabolites with the signal enhancement ratio (SER), maximum standardized FDG uptake value (SUV max), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and histopathologic prognostic factors for correlation. We calculated Spearman correlations and performed a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to further classify patient groups into subgroups to find correlation differences between HR-MAS spectroscopic values and conventional imaging parameters.In a multivariate analysis, the PLS-DA models built with HR-MAS MRS metabolic profiles showed visible discrimination between high and low SER, SUV, and ADC. In luminal subtype breast cancer, compared to all cases, high SER, ADV, and SUV were more closely clustered by visual assessment. Multiple metabolites were correlated with SER and SUV in all cases. Multiple metabolites showed correlations with SER and SUV in the ER positive, HER2 negative, and Ki-67 negative groups.High levels of PC, choline, and glycine acquired from HR-MAS MRS using CNB specimens were noted in the high SER group via DCE MRI and the high SUV group via PET-CT, with significant correlations between choline and SER and between PC and SUV. Further studies should investigate whether HR-MAS MRS using CNB specimens can provide similar or more prognostic information than conventional quantitative imaging parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2483417426,"The impact of obesity and dyslipidemia on cardiovascular health in adolescents and young adults with diabetes is incompletely understood. This study evaluated the effects of these co-morbidities on markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in young patients with the disease.The study investigated sets of inflammatory, endothelial, and adipocyte biomarkers in 79 patients with type 1 diabetes, 55 patients with type 2 diabetes, and 47 controls.Mean (±SD) age was 20±6 y (median = 17, range = 12-31). Patients with diabetes had higher levels of cytoadhesive molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, p<0.001), adiponectin (p<0.001), and haptoglobin (p = 0.023). Their heart rate variability assessment revealed lower standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals and lower total power (p≤0.019), reflecting autonomous nervous dysfunction. Hemoglobin A1c >8.0% (estimated average blood glucose >10 mmol/L) was associated with higher adiponectin (p<0.001) and obesity was associated with lower adiponectin (p<0.001); thus, obesity damped the effect of hyperglycemia on adiponectin. Obesity was associated with higher sICAM-1 (p≤0.015), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), p<0.001. Similarly, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <1.02 mmol/L was associated with higher sICAM-1, TNFα, IL-6, and hsCRP (p≤0.009) and lower adiponectin (p<0.001). Adiponectin correlated negatively with the inflammatory biomarkers in patients with diabetes.Subclinical inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are common among young patients with diabetes. Poor diabetes control is associated with higher adiponectin. Obesity and dyslipidemia are associated with lower adiponectin and higher inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers. Intuitively, these predictors of cardiovascular disease are amenable to proper glycemic control, nutritional choices, and regular exercise."

Expression of peripheral blood PD-1+ CD4+ T cells and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells were compared between these 4 groups. Then, 28-day survival of the SS and SS+T2DM patients was assessed, and the expression of PD-1 on T cells was also compared between survivors and non-survivors.Percentages of PD-1+ CD4+ T cells and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells were higher in the T2DM group than in the healthy control group, and were highest in the SS and SS+T2DM groups. However, the expression of PD-1 on T cells and the mortality showed no significant difference between the SS and SS+T2DM groups. The expression of PD-1 on T cells was higher in non-survivors than survivors, but within the survivor group or non-survivor group, no difference can be detected between those with T2DM and those without T2DM.The expression of PD-1 on T cells was increased in both T2DM and severe septic patients, but combining T2DM did not cause a further increase on the PD-1 expression in patients with severe sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2486722724,"Concentrations of glycine (Gly) in embryo culture media are often lower (~0.1 mM) than those in oviductal or uterine fluids (≥1.2 mM). The objective of this study was to determine direct and osmolarity-dependent effects of physiological concentrations of Gly on blastocyst formation and hatching, cell allocation to the trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM), and metabolic activity of bovine embryos. In experiment 1, zygotes were cultured with 100 or 120 mM NaCl and 0 or 1 mM Gly for the first 72 h of culture. Blastocyst formation and hatching were improved (P<0.05) when embryos were cultured with 100 compared to 120 mM NaCl. Inclusion of 1 mM Gly improved (P<0.05) blastocyst formation compared to 0 mM Gly, but this effect was only significant (P<0.05) for embryos cultured with 120 mM NaCl, suggesting bovine embryos can utilize Gly as an osmolyte. In experiment 2, embryos were cultured with 0.1, 1.1, 2.1, or 4.1 mM Gly (100 mM NaCl) for the final 96 h of culture. Blastocyst development was not affected (P>0.05) by Gly, but hatching (0.1 mM Gly, 18.2%) was improved (P<0.05) when embryos were cultured with 1.1 (31.4%) or 2.1 (29.4%) mM Gly. Blastocyst, TE, and ICM cell numbers were not affected (P>0.05) by Gly in either experiment. Blastocysts produced alanine, glutamine, pyruvate, and urea and consumed aspartate, but this metabolic profile was not affected (P>0.05) by Gly. In conclusion, Gly (1.0 mM) improves the development of both early and late stage embryos, but beneficial effects are more pronounced for early embryos exposed to elevated osmolarity."
https://openalex.org/W2502889967,"Aim Lately, the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging, Lasègue sign and classic neurological signs have been considered not accurate enough to distinguish the radicular from non-radicular low back with leg pain (LBLP) and a calculation of the symptomatic side muscle volume has been indicated as a probable valuable marker. However, only the multifidus muscle volume has been calculated so far. The main objective of the study was to verify whether LBLP subjects presented symptomatic side pelvic muscle atrophy compared to healthy volunteers. The second aim was to assess the inter-rater reliability of 3-D manual method for segmenting and measuring the volume of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and piriformis muscles in both LBLP patients and healthy subjects. Method Two independent raters analyzed MR images of LBLP and healthy subjects towards muscle volume of four pelvic muscles, i.e. the piriformis, gluteus minimus, gluteus medius and gluteus maximus. For both sides, the MR images of the muscles without adipose tissue infiltration were manually segmented in 3-D medical images. Results Symptomatic muscle atrophy was confirmed in only over 50% of LBLP subjects (gluteus maximus (p<0.001), gluteus minimus (p<0.01) and piriformis (p<0.05)). The ICC values indicated that the inter-rater reproducibility was greater than 0.90 for all measurements (LBLP and healthy subjects), except for the measurement of the right gluteus medius muscle in LBLP patients, which was equal to 0.848. Conclusion More than 50% of LBLP subjects presented symptomatic gluteus maximus, gluteus minimus and piriformis muscle atrophy. 3-D manual segmentation reliably measured muscle volume in all the measured pelvic muscles in both healthy and LBLP subjects. To answer the question of what kind of muscle atrophy is indicative of radicular or non-radicular pain further studies are required."
https://openalex.org/W2506572451,"BF211 is a synthetic molecule derived from bufalin (BF). The apoptosis-inducing effect of BF211 was stronger than that of BF while the acute toxicity of BF211 was much lower than that of BF. BF211 exhibited promising concentration-dependent anti-cancer effects in nude mice inoculated with A549 cells in vivo. The growth of A549 tumor xenografts was almost totally blocked by treatment with BF211 at 6 mg/kg. Notably, BF and BF211 exhibited differences in their binding affinity and kinetics to recombinant proteins of the α subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase. Furthermore, there was a difference in the effects of BF or BF211 on inhibiting the activity of porcine cortex Na+/K+-ATPase and in their time-dependent effects on intracellular Ca2+ levels in A549 cells. The time-dependent effects of BF or BF211 on the activation of Src, which was mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase signalosome, in A549 cells were also different. Both BF and BF211 could induce apoptosis-related cascades, such as activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) in A549 cells, in a concentration-dependent manner; however, the effects of BF211 on apoptosis-related cascades was stronger than that of BF. The results of the present study supported the importance of binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase α subunits in the mechanism of cardiac steroids and also suggested the possibility of developing new cardiac steroids with a stronger anti-cancer activity and lower toxicity as new anti-cancer agents."

Our findings reveal a direct physical link between two important regulators of mitotic progression and demonstrate the critical role of the NuMA-Astrin interaction for accurate cell division. Mitosis is the essential process through which chromosomes are accurately segregated into two daughter cells (1Compton D.A. Spindle assembly in animal cells.Annu. Rev.

Chromosome segregation is mediated by a complex called the mitotic spindle that pulls the sister chromatids apart and moves a complete set of chromosomes to each pole of the cell, where they are packaged into daughter nuclei (1Compton D.A.

Cytol. 2004; 238: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The sister chromatids are active participants in spindle assembly and function. Each chromatid carries a kinetochore, a multiprotein complex that attaches the chromatid to MTs connected to a spindle pole. Kinetochores are responsible for maintaining attachment to growing and shrinking microtubules, resulting in chromosome movements that lead to alignment during metaphase and segregation during anaphase. A proper kinetochore-microtubule association is one in which each sister kinetochore is appropriately attached to a microtubule bundle associated with an opposite spindle pole (6Tanaka T.U.

Several important non-motor proteins bind to the plus ends of MTs and control plus end dynamics or link the plus end to other cellular structures. Another important group of microtubule-regulatory proteins stabilizes and cross-links microtubule minus ends to form focused spindle poles, often with the assistance of motor proteins that travel along MTs in the direction of the minus ends. Complicating the understanding of these functions is that many of these proteins cooperate or interact with each other in some activities (13Manning A.L. Compton D.A.

Although previous studies indicate that NuMA is essential for spindle assembly and mitotic progression, the precise molecular mechanisms remain less well characterized. We carried out a new search for proteins that interact with NuMA using yeast two-hybrid assays. We report here the identification of the spindle- and kinetochore-associated protein Astrin as a novel interactor of NuMA. By using yeast two-hybrid assays, biochemistry, and immunocytochemistry, we found that NuMA directly interacts with Astrin in the mitotic spindle. This interaction is critical for the assembly and stabilization of the mitotic spindle and alignment of chromosomes in mammalian cells. To identify new interacting proteins for NuMA, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening using the NuMA C-terminal tail fragment (amino acids 1717–2101) as the bait. Our two-hybrid screen proved to be successful by the isolation of several previously identified NuMA-interacting proteins, including protein 4.1 and LGN (data not shown). Among the positive clones sequenced, we focused on one clone that encodes the C-terminal region of Astrin. The interaction between NuMA and Astrin was verified by β-gal assay using yeast co-transformed with a NuMA bait vector and Astrin prey plasmid. To further verify the specificity of the interaction between NuMA and Astrin in yeast, we switched the bait and prey vectors by subcloning NuMA in the prey vector and Astrin in the bait vector. The β-gal activities remained positive after vector swapping (data not shown). To confirm the interactions between NuMA and Astrin observed in our yeast two-hybrid assay, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was carried out in COS7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, NuMA bound to full-length and the C terminus of Astrin, suggesting that Astrin and NuMA could form a cognate complex in mammalian cells. To test whether NuMA binds directly to Astrin, we performed a pulldown assay using purified recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-Astrin901–1193 could efficiently pull down His-NuMA1858–2101. The GST protein, used as a control, did not bind His-NuMA1858–2101 in this experiment. These results suggest that the interaction between Astrin and NuMA is direct. To determine whether endogenous NuMA and Astrin can form a complex, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-NuMA antibody. We could reproducibly detect a portion of Astrin in the NuMA immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). To further examine the binding of Astrin to NuMA, the binding domains in these two proteins were mapped using both yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. A series of bait vectors (pGBKT7) and prey vectors (pVP16) containing NuMA or Astrin fragments were constructed and co-transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190. Yeasts grew on Trp/Leu dropout plates were subjected to a β-gal assay. Our data revealed that the C-terminal region of Astrin, comprising amino acids 901–1193, is sufficient to bind NuMA (Fig. 1D). The Astrin-interacting region in NuMA was mapped to amino acids 1878–2101 containing the C-terminal microtubule and LGN binding domains (Fig. 1E). The mapped interacting regions were then tested in mammalian cells using a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. In support of the conclusion from the yeast system, our co-immunoprecipitation experiment showed the similar results (Fig. 1F). Given the interaction between NuMA and Astrin established above, we sought to examine their spatiotemporal distribution profiles and interrelationship during the cell cycle. Astrin is an MT-associated protein. It colocalized with MTs around centrosomes in prophase and localized to spindle MTs throughout prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. From late prometaphase to anaphase, another pool of Astrin was localized at kinetochores (33Mack G.J. Compton D.A.

The mitotic-spindle-associated protein astrin is essential for progression through mitosis.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4053-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To visualize and localize the interaction of NuMA and Astrin, double indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed. GFP-tagged NuMA and RFP-tagged Astrin were co-transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). In interphase, Astrin was diffused in the cytoplasm, whereas NuMA localized in the nucleus. As the nuclear envelope disassembled in early mitosis, Astrin co-localized with NuMA at the mitotic spindle. During metaphase and anaphase, Astrin and NuMA accumulated in the spindle pole region (Fig. 2A). A similar localization pattern was observed for stably expressed GFP-NuMA and endogenous Astrin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Fig. 2B). The spatial vicinity provides the physical foundation for the functional relationship between NuMA and Astrin. To assess the functional relevance of the interaction between Astrin and NuMA, specific siRNA was used to effectively deplete endogenous Astrin. The diminution of the Astrin signal on immunoblots and staining in cells verified efficient Astrin knockdown (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with observations from a previous study (34Gruber J. Harborth J. Schnabel J. Weber K. Hatzfeld M. The mitotic-spindle-associated protein astrin is essential for progression through mitosis.J.

Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the depletion of Astrin resulted in an increase of the mitotic index, suggesting mitotic arrest (Fig. 3C). Staining of MTs showed that the depletion of Astrin resulted in the formation of less focused spindle poles and the occurrence of multipolar spindles. (Fig. 3, A and D). Spindle disruption was accompanied by a chromosome alignment defect, as reported previously (Fig. 3, D–F) (34Gruber J. Harborth J. Schnabel J. Weber K. Hatzfeld M.

The astrin-kinastrin/SKAP complex localizes to microtubule plus ends and facilitates chromosome alignment.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are similar to those of NuMA-depleted cells (20Haren L. Gnadt N. Wright M. Merdes A. NuMA is required for proper spindle assembly and chromosome alignment in prometaphase.BMC Res. Notes. 2009; 2: 64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also examined the effect of repressing Astrin on the localization of NuMA to the spindle. In cells in which Astrin had been suppressed, the intensity of NuMA at spindle poles decreased, and more NuMA localized along spindle MTs (Fig. 3, D and G). Our data suggest that, except for its well studied role at kinetochores, Astrin is also required for the accumulation of NuMA to spindle poles, which is important for efficient spindle pole organization and chromosome alignment. Although Astrin is proposed to be an MT-associated protein, it only localizes to spindle MTs during mitosis and is diffuse in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (33Mack G.J. Compton D.A.

NuMA is a well known microtubule binding protein (22Du Q. Taylor L. Compton D.A. Macara I.G.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Haren L. Merdes A. Direct binding of NuMA to tubulin is mediated by a novel sequence motif in the tail domain that bundles and stabilizes microtubules.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Astrin binding region of NuMA contains its microtubule binding domain, raising the possibility that NuMA may link Astrin to MTs. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected different fragments of NuMA and Astrin into COS7 cells. Consistent with our previous observation (22Du Q. Taylor L. Compton D.A. Macara I.G. LGN blocks the ability of NuMA to bind and stabilize microtubules: a mechanism for mitotic spindle assembly regulation.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the fragments of NuMA-C (amino acids 1818–2101, 1818-C) associated with MTs when ectopically expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 4A). However, the association with MTs was never seen when either the C terminus of Astrin (amino acids 901–1193, 901-C) or the N terminus of Astrin (amino acids 1–608) was expressed alone or with a vector control (Fig. 4, B and D). Interestingly, GFP-Astrin901–1193 (901-C), the NuMA-binding fragment, but not GFP-Astrin1–608, was recruited to MTs when co-expressed with RFP-NuMA1818-C (1818–2101) (Fig. 4, C and D). To prove the specificity of this effect, we also co-expressed a truncated fragment of NuMA (amino acids 1818–2060), which contains the microtubule binding domain but could not interact with Astrin, as shown by our co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid results (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 4, E and F, NuMA1818–2060 itself could bind MTs but failed to bring Astrin to the MTs, indicating that the MTs recruitment of Astrin relies on its interaction with NuMA. Our results suggest that NuMA could be one of the important linker proteins to assist Astrin localization to MTs. To examine the function of the NuMA and Astrin interaction in mitosis, we tested whether NuMA is required for the localization of Astrin on the spindle poles. A previously published siRNA was used to knock down endogenous NuMA (20Haren L. Gnadt N. Wright M. Merdes A. NuMA is required for proper spindle assembly and chromosome alignment in prometaphase.BMC Res. Notes. 2009; 2: 64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W.

Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells.Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar), and Western blotting analysis of total extracts from HeLa cells showed that treatment with NuMA siRNA oligonucleotide for 72 h led to efficient depletion of NuMA protein. Immunostaining also confirmed the knockdown efficiency (Fig. 5, A, B, and D). Consistent with previous observations (20Haren L. Gnadt N. Wright M. Merdes A. NuMA is required for proper spindle assembly and chromosome alignment in prometaphase.BMC Res. Notes. 2009; 2: 64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), NuMA depletion induced mitotic abnormalities, including disorganized spindle structures and improper chromosome alignment (Fig. 5, A and C). We then compared the localization of Astrin in control and NuMA knockdown cells. Remarkably, the spindle pole association of Astrin was decreased in NuMA-depleted cells (Fig. 5, C and E). To further confirm the role of NuMA in the localization of Astrin during mitosis, we perturbed NuMA function using the NuMA-binding protein LGN. By virtue of competitive binding between MTs and LGN for NuMA, LGN acts as a negative regulator of NuMA function in the spindle (16Kisurina-Evgenieva O. Mack G. Du Q. Macara I. Khodjakov A. Compton D.A. Multiple mechanisms regulate NuMA dynamics at spindle poles.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6391-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Du Q. Stukenberg P.T. Macara I.G.

Dynein/dynactin regulate metaphase spindle length by targeting depolymerizing activities to spindle poles.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In control HeLa cells, endogenous NuMA is associated predominantly with the spindle poles during metaphase. However, in cells that express Venus-tagged LGN1–481, NuMA was aberrantly organized into round spots at the centrosomes (Fig. 6A), which were often seen to be displaced from the splayed spindle MTs (Fig. 6B). Similar to the NuMA siRNA knockdown results, Astrin was dispersed and no longer localized to the spindle poles in Venus-LGN-expressing cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Our co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that both GFP-tagged Astrin and Venus-tagged LGN1–481 were able to associate with HA-tagged NuMA. However, when GFP-tagged Astrin and Venus-tagged LGN1–481 were co-expressed, the association of Astrin with NuMA was decreased (Fig. 6E), suggesting that LGN1–481 competes with Astrin for NuMA binding. These data corroborate our siRNA depletion results, supporting the idea that NuMA contributes to the spindle pole localization of Astrin. Previous work has shown that the spindle pole localization of NuMA is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, the minus end-directed motor protein (18Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. A complex of NuMA and cytoplasmic dynein is essential for mitotic spindle assembly.Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 40Merdes A. Heald R.

The requirement of NuMA for the spindle pole localization of Astrin led us to speculate that dynein may also regulate the transport of Astrin in intact cells. To test this hypothesis, we perturbed dynein function using a dynein heavy chain (DYNC1H1)-specific shRNA knockdown approach (32Zheng Z. Wan Q. Liu J. Zhu H. Chu X. Du Q.

Methods A rat model of SINFH was constructed via injection of the lentiviral vector pLV-shRNA-miR-145. Pathological observation was performed via tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, and serum OPG levels were detected by ELISA. The mRNA expression levels of miR-145, OPG, RANK and RANKL in THP-1 cells were assessed by RT-PCR, and the protein expression levels of OPG, RANK and RANKL were assessed by western blotting. Results The expression of miR-145 in the lentivirus-mediated miR-145 group was significantly up-regulated compared with that in the control and normal groups (both P < 0.01). Serum OPG levels were decreased in SINFH rats compared with control and normal rats. The mRNA and protein expression levels of OPG in THP-1 cells decreased after transfection (all P < 0.05). By contrast, the mRNA and protein expression levels of RANK and RANKL in THP-1 cells increased after transfection (all P < 0.05). After transfection of 293T cells with an miR-145 overexpression vector, miR-145 expression in 293T cells increased significantly, while OPG mRNA and protein expression decreased significantly (all P < 0.05). Conclusion MiR-145 plays a role in the occurrence of SINFH by targeting the OPG/RANK/RANKL signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2480934332,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by gamma-secretase to simultaneously generate amyloid beta (Aβ) and APP Intracellular Domain (AICD) peptides. Aβ plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis but recent studies suggest that amyloid-independent mechanisms also contribute to the disease. We previously showed that AICD transgenic mice (AICD-Tg) exhibit AD-like features such as tau pathology, aberrant neuronal activity, memory deficits and neurodegeneration in an age-dependent manner. Since AD is a tauopathy and tau has been shown to mediate Aβ–induced toxicity, we examined the role of tau in AICD-induced pathological features. We report that ablating endogenous tau protects AICD-Tg mice from deficits in adult neurogenesis, seizure severity, short-term memory deficits and neurodegeneration. Deletion of tau restored abnormal phosphorylation of NMDA receptors, which is likely to underlie hyperexcitability and associated excitotoxicity in AICD-Tg mice. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type human tau aggravated receptor phosphorylation, impaired adult neurogenesis, memory deficits and neurodegeneration. Our findings show that tau is essential for mediating the deleterious effects of AICD. Since tau also mediates Aβ-induced toxic effects, our findings suggest that tau is a common downstream factor in both amyloid-dependent and–independent pathogenic mechanisms and therefore could be a more effective drug target for therapeutic intervention in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2490230887,"Kinesin-1, -2, -5, and -7 generate processive hand-over-hand 8-nm steps to transport intracellular cargoes toward the microtubule plus end. This processive motility requires gating mechanisms to coordinate the mechanochemical cycles of the two motor heads to sustain the processive run. A key structural element believed to regulate the degree of processivity is the neck-linker, a short peptide of 12–18 residues, which connects the motor domain to its coiled-coil stalk. Although a shorter neck-linker has been correlated with longer run lengths, the structural data to support this hypothesis have been lacking. To test this hypothesis, seven kinesin structures were determined by x-ray crystallography. Each included the neck-linker motif, followed by helix α7 that constitutes the start of the coiled-coil stalk. In the majority of the structures, the neck-linker length differed from predictions because helix α7, which initiates the coiled-coil, started earlier in the sequence than predicted. A further examination of structures in the Protein Data Bank reveals that there is a great disparity between the predicted and observed starting residues. This suggests that an accurate prediction of the start of a coiled-coil is currently difficult to achieve. These results are significant because they now exclude simple comparisons between members of the kinesin superfamily and add a further layer of complexity when interpreting the results of mutagenesis or protein fusion. They also re-emphasize the need to consider factors beyond the kinesin neck-linker motif when attempting to understand how inter-head communication is tuned to achieve the degree of processivity required for cellular function.

The coiled-coil was the first quaternary structural arrangement described and has been predicted to occur in ∼3% of all proteins (1Crick F.H.

The evolution and structure prediction of coiled coils across all genomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 403: 480-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This apparently simple motif shows considerable structural variation, but because of the characteristic distribution of hydrophobic and polar residues, it can be detected readily through sequence analysis (3Delorenzi M.

Coiled-coils play diverse functional roles, but in many cases, they serve as oligomerization domains. Under these circumstances, the exact length or starting point of the coiled-coil is structurally and functionally important. Unfortunately, this parameter is not well defined or uniformly predicted by any computational algorithm. The precise starting point of the coiled-coil is particularly important in the kinesin and myosin family of molecular motors, where the dimerization module coordinates the activities of individual motor domains on separate polypeptide chains. Typically, in these motor families, there is a flexible section of the polypeptide that connects the motor to the dimerization module. The length of this connecting unit plays a critical role in processive molecular motors and is especially important for many members of the kinesin superfamily in which this domain is known as the neck-linker. Kinesin motor proteins are classified into 15 different kinesin families, which share a structurally conserved kinesin motor domain (6Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Tanaka Y. Niwa S.

Part of the classification is dictated by the location of their motor domains. N-terminally located motors comprise the majority of kinesin families. The exceptions are the kinesin-14A and -14B families that contain C-terminal motors and the kinesin-13 family in which the motor domain is located in the middle of the polypeptide (6Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Tanaka Y. Niwa S. Kinesin superfamily motor proteins and intracellular transport.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 682-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). This study is focused on N-terminal kinesins, which are composed of an N-terminal motor domain connected to a long α-helical region that dimerizes into a coiled-coil stalk that ends with a C-terminal cargo domain that may interact with other partner proteins or substrates. The N-terminal motor domain is responsible for ATP turnover coupled to force production. This group of motors is typically dimeric and shows processive movement along microtubules tracks. The ability of the N-terminal kinesin family to remain on the microtubule lattice is critical to their function. Dimeric N-terminal kinesins employ an asymmetric hand-over-hand stepping motion to move processively along a microtubule as they hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 1) (18Hackney D.D.

A general outline of the hydrolytic cycle begins arbitrarily in an ATP waiting state, where the leading head without nucleotide is strongly bound to a microtubule, whereas the lagging head is bound to ADP, but only weakly associated with a microtubule (Fig. 1, E1) (18Hackney D.D.

To proceed with stepping, the leading head binds ATP, and the dimer undergoes a structural transition transmitted through the neck-linker motif, a 12–18-amino acid flexible peptide that connects the motor domain to the coiled-coil stalk (Fig. 1, E2) (24Rice S.

This structural transition, designated neck-linker docking, shifts the lagging unbound head forward 16 nm to the next microtubule-binding site toward the microtubule plus end (Fig. 1, E3) (24Rice S.

A. 2015; 112: E6606-E6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Subsequently, ADP is released from this new leading head resulting in both heads bound to the microtubule (Fig. 1, E4 and E5) (27Mickolajczyk K.J. Deffenbaugh N.C. Arroyo J.O. Andrecka J. Kukura P.

A. 2015; 112: E7186-E7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When both heads are bound to the microtubule, the neck-linker domains are oriented in opposite directions (28Hoenger A. Sack S. Thormählen M. Marx A. Müller J. Gross H. Mandelkow E.

Nucleotide-induced conformations in the neck region of dimeric kinesin.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1518-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The neck-linker of the leading nucleotide-free head is oriented backward, inhibiting ATP binding and hydrolysis by the front head until the rear head detaches from the microtubule (Fig. 1, E6) (30Dogan M.Y. Can S. Cleary F.B. Purde V. Yildiz A. Kinesin's front head is gated by the backward orientation of its neck linker.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 1967-1973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The neck-linker of the lagging ATP-bound head remains docked onto the catalytic core and directed forward. ATP hydrolysis on the microtubule-bound lagging head results in another structural rearrangement that leads to phosphate release. Thereby, the lagging head transitions into a weakly bound ADP state and detaches from the microtubule, thus starting the cycle anew (Fig. 1, E7). During the stepping cycle, each motor domain must remain out-of-phase with the other. If both motor domains enter an unbound state at the same time, the processive run ends. The run length indicates the distance a motor steps along the microtubule before dissociation and gives a measure of processivity. Each kinesin family member has different average run lengths ranging from <0.2 μm, as in Eg5, to 2.1 μm, as in conventional kinesin-1, although this is construct-dependent for kinesin-1 and can range from 1.3 to 2.1 μm (25Shastry S.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Despite the structural conservation between different kinesin motors, there are clear kinetic differences between the families. One domain hypothesized to contribute to processivity is the kinesin neck-linker, a small flexible peptide consisting of 12–18 amino acids (33Romberg L. Pierce D.W. Vale R.D.

Controlling kinesin by reversible disulfide cross-linking: identifying the motility-producing conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The neck-linker connects each motor domain to the coiled-coil stalk where the junction between these two entities has been assumed to occur at the same position in the sequence as that observed in kinesin-1 (36Hariharan V. Hancock W.O. Insights into the mechanical properties of the kinesin neck linker domain from sequence analysis and molecular dynamics simulations.Cell Mol. Bioeng. 2009; 2: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The neck-linker itself undergoes a series of structural transitions as outlined in the kinesin mechanochemical cycle. It is hypothesized that longer neck-linkers increase the diffusional search area and therefore could slow down stepping, allowing time for the forward head to release from the microtubule (37Andreasson J.O. Milic B. Chen G.-Y. Guydosh N.R. Hancock W.O. Block S.M. Examining kinesin processivity within a general gating framework.Elife. 2015; 4: e07403Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently, alterations in neck-linker length were shown to affect the kinetic cycle (38Isojima H. Iino R. Niitani Y. Noji H. Tomishige M. Direct observation of intermediate states during the stepping motion of kinesin-1.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Increasing neck-linker length resulted in increased rear head binding, and decreasing neck-linker length resulted in slower release of ADP from the unbound head. Both effects result in slowing the productive kinetic cycle (38Isojima H. Iino R. Niitani Y. Noji H. Tomishige M. Direct observation of intermediate states during the stepping motion of kinesin-1.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because the neck-linker is involved in connecting the motor domain and coiled-coil stalk, changes in the length of the neck-linker are expected to alter communication between the two motor heads. Given that the overall size of the kinesin motor domain is similar across all families and that they bind to microtubules in a similar manner, it is surprising that the predicted length of the neck-linker between families shows considerable variation even though within each family the neck-linker/α7 sequences are almost completely conserved (36Hariharan V. Hancock W.O. Insights into the mechanical properties of the kinesin neck linker domain from sequence analysis and molecular dynamics simulations.Cell Mol. Bioeng. 2009; 2: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is especially puzzling because a multitude of studies show increasing the neck-linker for a given kinesin by even one residue results in decreases in run length and processivity (25Shastry S.

This conundrum is particularly evident in members of the kinesin-2 family, KIF3AB and KIF3AC, which are unique in forming a heterodimeric motor.

Both KIF3AB and KIF3AC are highly processive motors (46Guzik-Lendrum S. Rank K.C. Bensel B.M. Taylor K.C. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P. Kinesin-2 KIF3AC and KIF3AB can drive long-range transport along microtubules.Biophys. J. 2015; 109: 1472-1482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Yet their neck-linker is predicted to be three residues longer than conventional kinesin, which would suggest that these motors should not be so processive (36Hariharan V. Hancock W.O. Insights into the mechanical properties of the kinesin neck linker domain from sequence analysis and molecular dynamics simulations.Cell Mol. Bioeng. 2009; 2: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). KIF3AB and KIF3AC have identical neck-linker lengths and nearly identical neck-linker sequences, differing only at Thr-380 in KIF3C, which is an alanine in KIF3A and KIF3B. Both motors are processive; KIF3AB and KIF3AC have run lengths of 1.6 and 1.2 μm, respectively (37Andreasson J.O. Milic B. Chen G.-Y. Guydosh N.R. Hancock W.O. Block S.M.

However, the kinetic parameters vary significantly between the two motors (46Guzik-Lendrum S. Rank K.C. Bensel B.M. Taylor K.C. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P.

Fast or slow, either head can start the processive run of kinesin-2 KIF3AC.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 4407-4416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homodimeric species KIF3AA, KIF3BB, and KIF3CC also exhibit vastly different processivity parameters. KIF3AA and KIF3BB are highly processive, but KIF3CC travels at only 7.5 nm/s with an average run length of just 0.6 μm, which suggests that the neck-linker is not the only determinant of processivity (46Guzik-Lendrum S. Rank K.C. Bensel B.M. Taylor K.C. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P. Kinesin-2 KIF3AC and KIF3AB can drive long-range transport along microtubules.Biophys.

These observations prompted an investigation of the true length of the neck-linker in the best studied classes of N-terminal kinesin families. The original estimates of the neck-linker length made the assumption that the coiled-coil would begin on a hydrophobic residue that lie in either the a or d position of the coiled-coil heptad repeat (36Hariharan V. Hancock W.O. Insights into the mechanical properties of the kinesin neck linker domain from sequence analysis and molecular dynamics simulations.Cell Mol. Bioeng. 2009; 2: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the predictions of the first residue to adopt a helical conformation in any coiled-coil are ambiguous, even though the body of a coiled-coil is well indicated by current software (3Delorenzi M. Speed T. An HMM model for coiled-coil domains and a comparison with PSSM-based predictions.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 4Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Prediction software recognizes the heptad repeat in a coiled-coil domain. However, because the beginning and end of sequences may not follow that pattern, there is insufficient information to make accurate predictions of the start or of the end of a native coiled-coil. Given the considerable variation in the amino acid sequence of neck-linkers and associated coiled-coils, this raises the question whether the true length of the neck-linker has been accurately identified across the kinesin superfamily with the original assumption described above. There is only one structure for a dimeric N-terminal kinesin, rat kinesin-1 (3KIN) because dimeric kinesins are difficult to crystallize (14Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormählen M. Schönbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. The crystal structure of dimeric kinesin and implications for microtubule-dependent motility.Cell. 1997; 91: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The 3KIN structure provided the first picture of the true α7 start and neck-linker length in the context of a dimeric motor. Most kinesin motor structures are monomeric, allowing the neck-linker to adopt varying conformations that may not reflect that experienced by the dimeric motor in vivo. For example, in the structure of the kinesin-2 KIF3B (3B6U) the neck-linker includes a cis-proline; therefore, this structure is unlikely to reflect the native neck-linker conformation. This study is directed toward providing an experimental foundation for determining the start site for the coiled-coil and by inference the length of the neck-linker. We determined the structures of the neck-linker and α7 helix from the following four different kinesin families: kinesin-1, -2, -5, and -7. Kinesin-1 is the canonical N-terminal processive kinesin motor. Kinesin-2 family members, KIF3A and KIF3C, are involved in long range transport and neuronal repair (11Gumy L.F. Chew D.J. Tortosa E.

To preserve maqui as a genetic resource it is essential to study its genetic diversity. However, the complete genome is unknown and only a few gene sequences are available in databases. Simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers, which are neutral, co-dominant, reproducible and highly variable, are desirable to support genetic studies in maqui populations. By means of identification and characterization of microsatellite loci from a maqui genotype, using 454 sequencing technology, we develop a set of SSR for this species. Obtaining a total of 165,043 shotgun genome sequences, with an average read length of 387 bases, we covered 64 Mb of the maqui genome. Reads were assembled into 4,832 contigs, while 98,546 reads remained as singletons, generating a total of 103,378 consensus genomic sequences. A total of 24,494 SSR maqui markers were identified. Of them, 15,950 SSR maqui markers were classified as perfects. The most common SSR motifs were dinucleotide (31%), followed by tetranucleotide (26%) and trinucleotide motifs (24%). The motif AG/CT (28.4%) was the most abundant, while the motif AC (89 bp) was the largest. Eleven polymorphic SSRs were selected and used to analyze a population of 40 maqui genotypes. Polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.117 to 0.82, with an average of 0.58. Non-significant groups were observed in the maqui population, showing a panmictic genetic structure. In addition, we also predicted 11150 putative genes and 3 microRNAs (miRNAs) in maqui sequences. This results, including partial sequences of genes, some miRNAs and SSR markers from high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) of maqui genomic DNA, constitute the first platform to undertake genetic and molecular studies of this important species."
https://openalex.org/W2491223194,"Background We previously reported that stable rotors were observed in in-silico human atrial fibrillation (AF) models, and were well represented by dominant frequency (DF). We explored the spatiotemporal stability of DF sites in 3D-AF models imported from patient CT images of the left atrium (LA). Methods We integrated 3-D CT images of the LA obtained from ten patients with persistent AF (male 80%, 61.8 ± 13.5 years old) into an in-silico AF model. After induction, we obtained 6 seconds of AF simulation data for DF analyses in 30 second intervals (T1–T9). The LA was divided into ten sections. Spatiotemporal changes and variations in the temporal consistency of DF were evaluated at each section of the LA. The high DF area was defined as the area with the highest 10% DF. Results 1. There was no spatial consistency in the high DF distribution at each LA section during T1–T9 except in one patient (p = 0.027). 2. Coefficients of variation for the high DF area were highly different among the ten LA sections (p < 0.001), and they were significantly higher in the four pulmonary vein (PV) areas, the LA appendage, and the peri-mitral area than in the other LA sections (p < 0.001). 3. When we conducted virtual ablation of 10%, 15%, and 20% of the highest DF areas (n = 270 cases), AF was changed to atrial tachycardia (AT) or terminated at a rate of 40%, 57%, and 76%, respectively. Conclusions Spatiotemporal consistency of the DF area was observed in 10% of AF patients, and high DF areas were temporally variable. Virtual ablation of DF is moderately effective in AF termination and AF changing into AT."
https://openalex.org/W2494326178,"Migratory movements and alteration of host communities through livestock production are examples of ecological processes that may have consequences on wildlife pathogens. We studied the effect of co-grazing of cattle and wild elk, and of elk migratory behaviour on the occurrence of the giant liver fluke, Fascioloides magna, in elk. Migratory elk and elk herds with a higher proportion of migratory individuals were significantly less likely to be infected with F. magna. This may indicate a decreased risk of infection for migratory individuals, known as the “migratory escape” hypothesis. Elk herds overlapping with higher cattle densities also had a lower prevalence of this parasite, even after adjustment for landscape and climate variables known to influence its life cycle. Serological evidence suggests that even in low-prevalence areas, F. magna is circulating in both elk and cattle. Cattle are “dead-end” hosts for F. magna, and this may, therefore, indicate a dilution effect where cattle and elk are co-grazing. Migratory behaviour and host community composition have significant effects on the dynamics of this wildlife parasite; emphasizing the potential impacts of decisions regarding the management of migratory corridors and livestock-wildlife interface."
https://openalex.org/W2501158699,"This study investigated the effect of biodegradable Mg and Mg alloys on selected properties of MC3T3-E1 cells elicited by direct cell/material interaction. The chemical composition and morphology of the surface of Mg and Mg based alloys (Mg2Ag and Mg10Gd) were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX, following corrosion in cell culture medium for 1, 2, 3 and 8 days. The most pronounced difference in surface morphology, namely crystal formation, was observed when Pure Mg and Mg2Ag were immersed in cell medium for 8 days, and was associated with an increase in atomic % of oxygen and a decrease of surface calcium and phosphorous. Crystal formation on the surface of Mg10Gd was, in contrast, negligible at all time points. Time-dependent changes in oxygen, calcium and phosphorous surface content were furthermore not observed for Mg10Gd. MC3T3-E1 cell viability was reduced by culture on the surfaces of corroded Mg, Mg2Ag and Mg10Gd in a corrosion time-independent manner. Cells did not survive when cultured on 3 day pre-corroded Pure Mg and Mg2Ag, indicating crystal formation to be particular detrimental in this regard. Cell viability was not affected when cells were cultured on non-corroded Mg and Mg alloys for up to 12 days. These results suggest that corrosion associated changes in surface morphology and chemical composition significantly hamper cell viability and, thus, that non-corroded surfaces are more conducive to cell survival. An analysis of the differentiation potential of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on non-corroded samples based on measurement of Collagen I and Runx2 expression, revealed a down-regulation of these markers within the first 6 days following cell seeding on all samples, despite persistent survival and proliferation. Cells cultured on Mg10Gd, however, exhibited a pronounced upregulation of collagen I and Runx2 between days 8 and 12, indicating an enhancement of osteointegration by this alloy that could be valuable for in vivo orthopedic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2502655077,"Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type-1 (HPS-1) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in HPS1 which result in reduced expression of the HPS-1 protein, defective lysosome-related organelle (LRO) transport and absence of platelet delta granules. Patients with HPS-1 exhibit oculocutaneous albinism, colitis, bleeding and pulmonary fibrosis postulated to result from a dysregulated immune response. The effect of the HPS1 mutation on human mast cells (HuMCs) is unknown. Since HuMC granules classify as LROs along with platelet granules and melanosomes, we set out to determine if HPS-1 cutaneous and CD34+ culture-derived HuMCs have distinct granular and cellular characteristics. Cutaneous and cultured CD34+-derived HuMCs from HPS-1 patients were compared with normal cutaneous and control HuMCs, respectively, for any morphological and functional differences. One cytokine-independent HPS-1 culture was expanded, cloned, designated the HP proMastocyte (HPM) cell line and characterized. HPS-1 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alveolar interstitium showed numerous HuMCs; HPS-1 dermal mast cells exhibited abnormal granules when compared to healthy controls. HPS-1 HuMCs showed increased CD63, CD203c and reduced mediator release following FcɛRI aggregation when compared with normal HuMCs. HPM cells also had the duplication defect, expressed FcɛRI and intracytoplasmic proteases and exhibited less mediator release following FcɛRI aggregation. HPM cells constitutively released IL-6, which was elevated in patients' serum, in addition to IL-8, fibronectin-1 (FN-1) and galectin-3 (LGALS3). Transduction with HPS1 rescued the abnormal HPM morphology, cytokine and matrix secretion. Microarray analysis of HPS-1 HuMCs and non-transduced HPM cells confirmed upregulation of differentially expressed genes involved in fibrogenesis and degranulation. Cultured HPS-1 HuMCs appear activated as evidenced by surface activation marker expression, a decrease in mediator content and impaired releasibility. The near-normalization of constitutive cytokine and matrix release following rescue by HPS1 transduction of HPM cells suggests that HPS-1 HuMCs may contribute to pulmonary fibrosis and constitute a target for therapeutic intervention."

Analysis of truncation mutants revealed that the hydrophobic residues in the Ylf amino termini were required for localization of each protein to the membranes of host cells. Central and carboxy terminal coiled coil domains were found to mediate binding of YlfA and YlfB to themselves and to each other. In vivo, a ΔylfA ΔylfB double mutant strain of L. pneumophila was shown to be defective in establishing a vacuole that supports bacterial replication. This phenotype was subsequently correlated with a decrease in the association of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles with vacuoles containing ΔylfA ΔylfB mutant bacteria. These data suggest that the Ylf proteins are membrane-associated effectors that enhance remodeling of the L. pneumophila -containing vacuole by promoting association and possibly fusion of ER-derived membrane vesicles with the bacterial compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2467882038,"A geographically isolated set of southern localities of the formerly monotypic goby genus Eucyclogobius is known to be reciprocally monophyletic and substantially divergent in mitochondrial sequence and nuclear microsatellite-based phylogenies relative to populations to the north along the California coast. To clarify taxonomic and conservation status, we conducted a suite of analyses on a comprehensive set of morphological counts and measures from across the range of Eucyclogobius and describe the southern populations as a new species, the Southern Tidewater Goby, Eucyclogobius kristinae, now separate from the Northern Tidewater Goby Eucyclogobius newberryi (Girard 1856). In addition to molecular distinction, adults of E. kristinae are diagnosed by: 1) loss of the anterior supratemporal lateral-line canals resulting in higher neuromast counts, 2) lower pectoral and branched caudal ray counts, and 3) sets of measurements identified via discriminant analysis. These differences suggest ecological distinction of the two species. Previous studies estimated lineage separation at 2–4 million years ago, and mitochondrial sequence divergence exceeds that of other recognized fish species. Fish from Santa Monica Artesian Springs (Los Angeles County) northward belong to E. newberryi; those from Aliso Creek (Orange County) southward constitute E. kristinae. The lagoonal habitat of Eucyclogobius has been diminished or degraded, leading to special conservation status at state and federal levels beginning in 1980. Habitat of the newly described species has been impacted by a range of anthropogenic activities, including the conversion of closing lagoons to open tidal systems in the name of restoration. In the last 30 years, E. kristinae has only been observed in nine intermittently occupied lagoonal systems in northern San Diego County; it currently persists in only three sites. Thus, the new species is in imminent danger of extinction and will require ongoing active management."
https://openalex.org/W2501805464,"Deletion of the Habp2 gene encoding Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) increases liver fibrosis in mice. A single nucleotide polymorphism (G534E) in HABP2 leads to lower enzymatic activity and is associated with enhanced liver fibrosis in humans. Liver fibrosis is associated with a decrease in FSAP expression but, to date, nothing is known about how this might be regulated. Primary mouse hepatocytes or the hepatocyte cell line, AML12, were treated with different factors, and expression of FSAP was determined. Of the various regulatory factors tested, only transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) demonstrated a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of FSAP expression at the mRNA and protein level. The TGF-β-Type I receptor (ALK-5) antagonist SB431542 and Smad2 siRNA, but neither SIS3, which inhibits SMAD3, nor siRNA against Smad3 could block this effect. Various regions of the HABP2 promoter region were cloned into reporter constructs, and the promoter activity was determined. Accordingly, the promoter activity, which could phenocopy changes in Habp2 mRNA in response to TGF-β, was found to be located in the 177-bp region upstream of the transcription start site, and this region did not contain any SMAD binding sites. Mutation analysis of the promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to identify an important role for the ATF3 binding element. Thus, TGF-β is the most likely mediator responsible for the decrease in FSAP expression in liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2480135427,"Migrants usually exhibit similar or better health outcomes than native-born populations despite facing socioeconomic disadvantages and barriers to healthcare use; this is known as the “migrant paradox.” The migrant paradox among children is highly complex. This study explores whether the migrant paradox exists in the health of internal migrant children in China and the role of schools in reducing children’s health disparities, using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Participants were 1,641 student and parent pairs from Grades 4, 5, and 6 of eight primary schools in Beijing. The following school types were included: state schools with migrant children comprising over 70% of total children (SMS), private schools with migrant children comprising over 70% (PMS), and state schools with permanent resident children comprising over 70% (SRS). Children were divided into Groups A, B, C or D by the type of school they attended (A and B were drawn from SRSs, C was from SMSs, and D was from PMSs) and whether they were in the migrant population (B, C, and D were, but A was not). Related information was collected through medical examination and questionnaires completed by parents and children. Prevalence of caries, overweight and obesity, poor vision, and self-reported incidence of colds and diarrhea in the previous month were explored as health outcomes. The results partially demonstrated the existence of the migrant paradox and verified the role of schools in lowering health disparities among children; there are theoretical and practical implications for improving the health of migrant children."
https://openalex.org/W2490029308,"Considering the roles of protein complexes in many biological processes in the cell, detection of protein complexes from available protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is a key challenge in the post genome era. Despite high dynamicity of cellular systems and dynamic interaction between proteins in a cell, most computational methods have focused on static networks which cannot represent the inherent dynamicity of protein interactions. Recently, some researchers try to exploit the dynamicity of PPI networks by constructing a set of dynamic PPI subnetworks correspondent to each time-point (column) in a gene expression data. However, many genes can participate in multiple biological processes and cellular processes are not necessarily related to every sample, but they might be relevant only for a subset of samples. So, it is more interesting to explore each subnetwork based on a subset of genes and conditions (i.e., biclusters) in a gene expression data. Here, we present a new method, called BiCAMWI to employ dynamicity in detecting protein complexes. The preprocessing phase of the proposed method is based on a novel genetic algorithm that extracts some sets of genes that are co-regulated under some conditions from input gene expression data. Each extracted gene set is called bicluster. In the detection phase of the proposed method, then, based on the biclusters, some dynamic PPI subnetworks are extracted from input static PPI network. Protein complexes are identified by applying a detection method on each dynamic PPI subnetwork and aggregating the results. Experimental results confirm that BiCAMWI effectively models the dynamicity inherent in static PPI networks and achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods. So, we suggest BiCAMWI as a more reliable method for protein complex detection."
https://openalex.org/W2491845211,"Body size is a complex character associated to several fitness related traits that vary within and between species as a consequence of environmental and genetic factors. Latitudinal and altitudinal clines for different morphological traits have been described in several species of Drosophila and previous work identified genomic regions associated with such variation in D. melanogaster. However, the genetic factors that orchestrate morphological variation have been barely studied. Here, our main objective was to investigate genetic variation for different morphological traits associated to the second chromosome in natural populations of D. melanogaster along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in Argentina. Our results revealed weak clinal signals and a strong population effect on morphological variation. Moreover, most pairwise comparisons between populations were significant. Our study also showed important within-population genetic variation, which must be associated to the second chromosome, as the lines are otherwise genetically identical. Next, we examined the contribution of different candidate genes to natural variation for these traits. We performed quantitative complementation tests using a battery of lines bearing mutated alleles at candidate genes located in the second chromosome and six second chromosome substitution lines derived from natural populations which exhibited divergent phenotypes. Results of complementation tests revealed that natural variation at all candidate genes studied, invected, Fasciclin 3, toucan, Reticulon-like1, jing and CG14478, affects the studied characters, suggesting that they are Quantitative Trait Genes for morphological traits. Finally, the phenotypic patterns observed suggest that different alleles of each gene might contribute to natural variation for morphological traits. However, non-additive effects cannot be ruled out, as wild-derived strains differ at myriads of second chromosome loci that may interact epistatically with mutant alleles."
https://openalex.org/W2496075260,"Background Syphilis is prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. Syphilis partner notification (PN) programs targeting MSM has been considered as one of effective strategies to prevention and control of the infection in the population. We examined willingness and preferences for PN among MSM to measure feasibility and optimize uptake. Methods Participation in a syphilis PN program was measured using a factorial survey from both the perspective of the index patient and the partner. Respondents were recruited from April-July 2011 using convenience sampling at two sites—a MSM sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and a MSM community based organization (CBO). Respondents first evaluated three factorial survey vignettes to measure probability of participation and then an anonymous sociodemographic questionnaire. A two-level mixed linear model was fitted for the factorial survey analysis. Results In 372 respondents with mean age (± SD) 28.5 (± 6.0) years, most were single (82.0%) and closeted gays (66.7%). The Internet was the most frequent place to search for sex. Few (31.2%) had legal names for casual partners, but most had instant messenger (86.5%) and mobile phone numbers (77.7%). The mean probability of participation in a syphilis PN program was 64.5% (± 32.4%) for index patients and 63.7% (± 32.6%) for partners. Referral of the partner to a private clinic or MSM CBO for follow-up decreased participation compared to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or public STD clinic. Conclusions Enhanced PN services may be feasible among MSM in South China. Internet and mobile phone PN may contact partners untraceable by traditional PN. Referral of partners to the local CDC or public STD clinic may maximize PN participation."
https://openalex.org/W2503306220,"In the present studies, we focused on substrate specificity of tocopherol cyclase, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the tocopherols and plastochromanol-8, the main plant lipid antioxidants, with special emphasis on the preference for tocopherols and plastochromanol-8 precursors, taking advantage of the recombinant enzyme originating from Arabidopsis thaliana and isolated plastoglobules, thylakoids and various model systems like micelles and thylakoids. Plastoglobules and triacylglycerol micelles were the most efficient reaction environment for the cyclase. In various investigated systems, synthesis of γ-tocopherol proceeded considerably faster than that of plastochromanol-8, probably mainly due to different localization of the corresponding substrates in the analyzed lipid structures. Moreover, our study was complemented by bioinformatics analysis of the phylogenetic relations of the cyclases and sequence motifs, crucial for the enzyme activity, were proposed. The analysis revealed also a group of tocopherol cyclase-like proteins in a number of heterotrophic bacterial species, with a conserved region common with photosynthetic organisms, that might be engaged in the catalytic activity of both groups of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2487558344,"Although genotype-by-environment interaction has long been used to unveil the genetic variation that affects Darwinian fitness, the mechanisms underlying the interaction usually remain unknown. Genetic variation at the dimeric glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucoisomerase (Pgi) has been observed to interact with temperature to explain the variation in the individual performance of the butterfly Melitaea cinxia. At relatively high temperature, individuals with Pgi-non-f genotypes generally surpass those with Pgi-f genotypes, while the opposite applies at relatively low temperature. In this study, we did protein structure predictions and BlastP homology searches with the aim to understand the structural basis for this temperature-dependent difference in the performance of M. cinxia. Our results show that, at amino acid (AA) site 372, one of the two sites that distinguish Pgi-f (the translated polypeptide of the Pgi-f allele) from Pgi-non-f (the translated polypeptide of the Pgi-non-f allele), the Pgi-non-f-related residue strengthens an electrostatic attraction between a pair of residues (Glu373-Lys472) that are from different monomers, compared to the Pgi-f-related residue. Further, BlastP searches of animal protein sequences reveal a dramatic excess of electrostatically attractive combinations of the residues at the Pgi AA sites equivalent to sites 373 and 472 in M. cinxia. This suggests that factors enhancing the inter-monomer interaction between these two sites, and therefore helping the tight association of two Pgi monomers, are favourable. Our homology-modelling results also show that, at the second AA site that distinguishes Pgi-f from Pgi-non-f in M. cinxia, the Pgi-non-f-related residue is more entropy-favourable (leading to higher structural stability) than the Pgi-f-related residue. To sum up, this study suggests a higher structural stability of the protein products of the Pgi-non-f genotypes than those of the Pgi-f genotypes, which may explain why individuals carrying Pgi-non-f genotypes outperform those carrying Pgi-f genotypes at stressful high temerature."
https://openalex.org/W2476821941,"Background Tools using local HIV data to help jurisdictions estimate future demand for medical and support services are needed. We present an interactive prevalence projection model using data obtainable from jurisdictional HIV surveillance and publically available data. Methods Using viral load data from Georgia’s enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System, state level death rates for people living with HIV and the general population, and published estimates for HIV transmission rates, we developed a model for projecting future HIV prevalence. Keeping death rates and HIV transmission rates for undiagnosed, in care/viral load >200, in care/viral load<200, and out of care (no viral load for 12 months) constant, we describe results from simulations with varying inputs projecting HIV incidence and prevalence from 2014 to 2024. Results In this model, maintaining Georgia’s 2014 rates for diagnosis, transitions in care, viral suppression (VS), and mortality by sub-group through 2020, resulted in 85% diagnosed, 59% in care, and 44% VS among diagnosed (85%/58%/44%) with a total of 67 815 PLWH, 33 953 in care, and more than 1000 new cases per year by 2020. Neither doubling the diagnosis rate nor tripling rates of re-engaging out of care PLWH into care alone were adequate to reach 90/90/80 by 2020. We demonstrate a multicomponent scenario that achieved NHAS goals and resulted in 63 989 PLWH, 57 546 in care, and continued annual prevalence increase through 2024. Conclusions Jurisdictions can use this HIV prevalence prediction tool, accessible at https://dph.georgia.gov/hiv-prevalence-projections to assess local capacity to meet future HIV care and social services needs. In this model, achieving 90/90/80 by 2020 in Georgia slowed but did not reverse increases in HIV prevalence, and the number of HIV-infected persons needing care and support services more than doubled. Improving the HIV care infrastructure is imperative."
https://openalex.org/W2481305067,"For rapid screening and quantification of an antisera antibody, a nanometer bithiophene-based conductive biolinker can enhanced signal performance and can be used to verify the interaction of an anti-IFN-γ antibody with an IFN-γ protein. The experimental measurements take a generic approach which takes advantage of the functionality of thiophene-based linkers for biosensors. Effects associated with using bithiophene as a biolinker for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy are examined in this paper. By using an atomic force microscope (AFM), it was observed that the morphology of the bithiophene modified gold sensor surface became smoother than the original gold surface. We compared the response and concentration of the anti-IFN-γ antibody on a bithiophene-coated and dextran-coated biochip as well as on different thickness-modified surfaces under SPR relevant conditions. The results indicate that a response to IFN-γ molecules immobilized on a sensor using a bithiophene biolinker improved more than 8-fold when compared to that of a sensor using a dextran biolinker. Furthermore, the regeneration ability of the sensor surface shows good repeatability as only less than a 1% decrease was found after repeating the experimental work over 6 cycles. The characteristics provided us with a good platform for rapid screening, real-time monitoring and quantitative concentration of the autoimmune antibody activities."
https://openalex.org/W2496109349,"High-throughput cloning efforts produce large numbers of sequences that need to be aligned, edited, compared with reference sequences, and organized as files and selected clones. Different pieces of software are typically required to perform each of these tasks. We have designed a single piece of software, CATO, the Clone Alignment Tool, that allows a user to align, evaluate, edit, and select clone sequences based on comparisons to reference sequences. The input and output are designed to be compatible with standard data formats, and thus suitable for integration into a clone processing pipeline. CATO provides both sequence alignment and visualizations to facilitate the analysis of cloning experiments. The alignment algorithm matches each of the relevant candidate sequences against each reference sequence. The visualization portion displays three levels of matching: 1) a top-level summary of the top candidate sequences aligned to each reference sequence, 2) a focused alignment view with the nucleotides of matched sequences displayed against one reference sequence, and 3) a pair-wise alignment of a single reference and candidate sequence pair. Users can select the minimum matching criteria for valid clones, edit or swap reference sequences, and export the results to a summary file as part of the high-throughput cloning workflow."
https://openalex.org/W2498876668,"This study describes a new approach in the screening for loss-of-gene mutants in Heavy Ion Bombardment (HIB) mutant populations of genetically complex organisms such as hexaploid bread wheat using multiplexed single-color (SYBR Green) melt curve analyses. The assay was set up for three target genes to test its validity and applicability. For each gene, three genome-specific primer pairs (one for each genome) with distinct melt curves were developed and multiplexed. This allowed screening for ""single null mutants"" (plants with the target gene deleted in one of the three genomes) for all three genomes in a single reaction. The first two genes (α-Amylase 3 and Epsilon Cyclase) were used to test the approach as HIB null lines for all three genomes were already available for these. The third assay was successfully applied to identify new single null lines of the target gene α-Amylase 2 in an in-house HIB wheat collection. The use of SYBR Green greatly reduced the time and/or cost investment compared to other techniques and the approach proved highly suitable for high-throughput applications."
