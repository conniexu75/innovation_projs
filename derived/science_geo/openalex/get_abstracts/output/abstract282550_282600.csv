https://openalex.org/W1988011643,"Euglossine bees may return to a nest from as far away as 23 kilometers in a tropical rain forest. These bees apparently forage long distances and visit the same plants repeatedly along a feeding route. They probably promote outcrossing among tropical plants with low population density; therefore, they may permit the existence of plant species whose densities have been forced very low by such things as competition and predators on seeds and seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W2020877782,"Isoleucine, one of several amino acids isolated from a suite of welldated deep-sea cores, shows a progressive increase in the degree of racemization with the age of the sediment. Amino acids in sediments show an initial rate of racemization almost an order of magnitude faster than the rate observed for free amino acids at a comparable pH and temperature. The observed kinetics depend on a variety of diagenetic processes, but it appears that the ratio of alloisoleucine to isoleucine is a reliable indicator of age for samples less than 400,000 years old; for older samples the results are more ambiguous. Isoleucine is racemic in samples older than about 15 x 10(6) years."

https://openalex.org/W2037580436,"Etch-decoration reveals that the rate of removal of carbon atoms exposed at monolayer steps on graphite surfaces is very different from the rate of removal, under identical conditions, at multilayer steps. At 1113 degrees K and a pressure of 1.33 newtons per square meter of oxygen, the rate of oxidation (along the layer planes) is less by a factor of nearly 100 than that at multilayer steps."
https://openalex.org/W2024596586,"Although our study was conducted in only one physical science discipline, and although most of the individual tests did not yield statistically significant differences, the data consistently yielded a trend in the direction of the existence of discrimination against women in academia. This leads us to the tentative conclusion that when two equally qualified applicants are being considered for an academic position, a male would be chosen over a female. However, a woman with clearly superior qualifications, in competition with an average man, is likely to be recognized. The bias seems to hold especially for higher-quality schools, in departments with younger and newer chairmen, and for chairmen from schools located in the eastern and western parts of the country."
https://openalex.org/W2095431310,Several taxa of abundant cutinized trilete spores from earliest Silurian shale in New York predate by almost an entire period vascular land plant megafossils. Paleoecological evidence suggests that these spores may represent vascular land or semiaquatic plants but a bryophytic origin cannot be precluded on the basis of spore characters. An algal origin is considered unlikely.

https://openalex.org/W2079181576,"Dual mechanisms of absorption of rubidium were demonstrated in a nonvacuolate unicellular alga, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, in both the light and the dark. The two mechanisms were sensitive to metabolic inhibitors. At high concentrations rubidium enhanced the respiration of Chlorella cells. The findings support the conclusion that the mechanisms of rubidium absorption in both the low and high concentration ranges are active processes and reside in the plasmalemma."
https://openalex.org/W1972452468,"The ESCA spectra of ""polywater"" show that this anomalous, high-density, viscous, nonvolatile material contains high concentrations of sodium, potassium, sulfate, chloride, nitrate, borates, silicates, and carbon-oxygen compounds with trace amounts of other impurities but very little water. On the basis of this evidence, in conjunction with reported spectroscopic and analytical experiments, it is very unlikely that a polymerized form of water has been discovered."
https://openalex.org/W1978554658,"A unique late Quaternary lacustrine deposit has been discovered recently on the Missouri Coteau of North Dakota. A diverse, extremely well-preserved biota of more than 160 species has been recovered primarily from an organic mud deposited about 9500 years before the present. The lacustrine body shallowed gradually as the climate became drier."
https://openalex.org/W2083684861,"The determination of the crystal structure of muirite, Ba(10)(Ca,Mn,Ti)(4)Si(8)O(24)(Cl,OH,O)(12) . 4H(2)O, revealed the presence of discrete cyclic silicate anions, (Si(8)O(24))(16-), formed by the condensation of eight silicate tetrahedra. This first reported occurrence of eight-membered rings is of particular interest, because rings with eight tetrahedra are reported to be energetically less stable than rings with six tetrahedra, which have been found in many minerals."
https://openalex.org/W2022764584,The Tethyan larger foraminiferal genus Orbitolina has been found in the easternmost part of the western North Atlantic continental shelf at 46°30′N. All other known occurrences of the genus in North America are south of 33°N. The species is Orbitolina conoidea Gras; its abundance in a grain-supported limestone indicates a tropical neritic environment and precludes the influence of Arctic waters in the Flemish Cap region in Early or Middle Cretaceous times.
https://openalex.org/W2068229390,"Exposure of diapausing second-instar larvae of Choristoneura fumiferana to continuous light at 21 degrees C, after only 6 weeks' storage at 0 degrees C, induces emergence of larvae that will not emerge in photoperiods of 15 or 18 hours. Following the normal storage period (20 weeks) there is no such effect. Complete dark or 12-hour photoperiods inhibit emergence after storage periods of all lengths."

https://openalex.org/W1988463253,"Recent advances in radar theory have given rise to a straightforward method of sonar signal design. The method involves computer maximization of a signal-to-interference ratio. The procedure has been used to derive sonar signals that can accurately measure target velocity. When two dolphins were placed in a situation conducive to the utilization of such signals, their waveforms were similar to those that had been theoretically derived."

https://openalex.org/W1981098694,"A discussion is presented of transient or short-lived natural satellites of the earth, which result from meteorites that only graze our atmosphere. Preliminary calculations show that only about 0.2 percent of the total number of the porous, stony meteorites which strike the earth will result in natural satellites. It is noted that such satellites also would be difficult to detect observationally."

Gerasimov's The Face Finder [173, 712 (1971)], the misspelling of Julius Koliman's name is erroneously attributed to a bibliography (1962) by W. M. Krogman. The error occurs in a different authority's work. Kollmann established methods (1898) for building on a skull a face recognizably correct."
