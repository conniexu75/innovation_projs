https://openalex.org/W1989209853,"Termites may emit large quantities of methane, carbon dioxide, and molecular hydrogen into the atmosphere. Global annual emissions calculated from laboratory measurements could reach 1.5 x 10(14) grams of methane and 5 x 10(16) grams of carbon dioxide. As much as 2 x 10(14) grams of molecular hydrogen may also be produced. Field measurements of methane emissions from two termite nests in Guatemala corroborated the laboratory results. The largest emissions should occur in tropical areas disturbed by human activities."
https://openalex.org/W2065939318,"The concentrations of tin and methyltin species in rivers, an estuary, and the surface and deep ocean generally are less than 50 picomoles of tin per liter. Estuarine profiles and river concentrations suggest that the dissolved riverine input of tin is only a minor source of this element to the oceans. Oceanic concentrations of inorganic tin decrease both with distance from land and with increasing depth from the surface, an indication of atmospheric transport to the surface ocean. Most of the contemporaneous eolian influx of tin to the oceans is anthropogenic. The vertical structure oftin concentrations in the northwestern Atlantic can be explained in terms of a model based on eolian input, advective processes, and removal of tin by particulate scavenging."
https://openalex.org/W2043403425,"Ices such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane are now known to be pervasive constituents of the solar system and probably of the interstellar medium as well. Many of these ices and ice-covered surfaces are exposed to bombardment by the energetic ions of space. Laboratory experiments have been carried out to study the effects of such bombardment. Surprisingly efficient erosion of ice layers is associated with electronic excitation of the ices by the ions. These results are a challenge to an understanding of the physical processes involved and have implications for a number of astrophysical problems of current interest."
https://openalex.org/W1981305802,"Unlike other known species of crickets, Amphiacusta maya in Central America mates in groups. Experimentally silenced males experience reduced mating success, not owing to decreased receptivity by females, but owing to increased time spent fighting with other males that persistently interrupt silent courtships. Thus, the data indicate that ""courtship"" chirping functions as a warning to other males, rather than as a signal to females."
