https://openalex.org/W2060697620,"Mycoplasma-like bodies with helical filaments were seen by phase contrast microscopy in juice expressed from tissues of plants infected with corn stunt agent. Each filament is bounded by a ""unit membrane"" and no cell wall, sheath, envelope, or second membrane has yet been discerned by electron microscopy. The association of these filaments with development of disease, their occurrence in phloem cells as seen by both freeze-etching and thin-section electron microscopy, the diagnosis of infection based on their presence in plants without symptoms, and their absence in noninfected corn are consistent with the hypothesis that these unusual filaments are formed by the mycoplasma-like organism presumed to be the corn stunt agent."

Roosa during the lunar flyback on 7 Fehruary 1971 to obtain information on heat flow and convection in gases and liquids in an environment of less than 10-(6)g gravity. Flow observations and thermal data have shown that: (i) there are, as expected, convective motions caused by surface tension gradients in a plane liquid layer with a free upper surface; (ii) heat flow in enclosed liquids and gases occurs mainly by diffusive heat conduction; and (iii) some convective processes, whose characteristics are not fully known, add to the heat transfer."

When the duration of the sample stimulus was varied to maintain constant performance, compound stimuli required more time than single elements."

https://openalex.org/W2003268669,"The space programs of the United States and Soviet Union have been bound together for nearly two decades through rivalry, competition, and, most recently, cooperation. The scientific consequences of these space activities have been to revolutionize the study of the solar system, to open the high-energy (x-ray, gamma ray, and cosmic ray) window to astrophysical observation, and to significantly influence the study of Earth itself, especially its atmosphere. Nevertheless, scientific research in itself never has been the principal justification for space expenditures."
