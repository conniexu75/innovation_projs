https://openalex.org/W1978122040,"Classical thermodynamic descriptions of surfaces treat surface orientation as a thermodynamic degree of freedom and thus allow for the possibility of reversible changes in surface morphology as a function of temperature or impurity concentration. The existence of these transitions has been confirmed experimentally. Advances in surface diffraction and imaging techniques now make it possible to characterize such transitions quantitatively in terms of the atomic structure, and particularly in terms of the behavior of steps on surfaces. Statistical mechanical models can be used to analyze the observations to determine the fundamental energetic parameters governing the observed thermodynamic behavior."

A combination of field, stable isotope, and volatile content data for the Catalina Schist indicates kilometer-scale transport of large amounts of water-rich fluid with uniform oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions. The fluids were liberated in devolatilizing, relatively low-temperature (400 degrees to 600 degrees C) parts of the subduction zone, primarily by chlorite-breakdown reactions. An evaluation of pertinent phase equilibria indicates that chlorite in mafic and sedimentary rocks and melange may stabilize a large volatile component to great depths (perhaps >100 kilometers), depending on the thermal structure of the subduction zone. This evidence for deep volatile subduction and large-scale flow of slab-derived, water-rich fluids lends credence to models that invoke fluid addition to sites of arc magma genesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995188385,"Results from in situ x-ray diffraction experiments with a DIA-type cubic anvil apparatus (SAM 85) reveal that MgSiO(3) perovskite transforms from the orthorhombic Pbnm symmetry to another perovskite-type structure above 600 kelvin (K) at pressures of 7.3 gigapascals; the apparent volume increase across the transition is 0.7%. Unit-cell volume increased linearly with temperature, both below (1.44 x 10(-5) K(-1)) and above (1.55 x 10(-5) K(-1)) the transition. These results indicate that the physical properties measured on the Pbnm phase should be used with great caution because they may not be applicable to the earth's lower mantle. A density analysis based on the new data yields an iron content of 10.4 weight percent for a pyrolite composition under conditions corresponding to the lower mantle. All current equation-of-state data are compatible with constant chemical composition in the upper and lower mantle; thus, these data imply that a chemically layered mantle is unnecessary, and whole-mantle convection is possible."
https://openalex.org/W1970269530,"The State Family Planning Commission of China has conducted two large-scale fertility surveys, in 1982 and 1988, covering sample households containing 1 million and 2 million persons, respectively. These surveys obtained lifetime histories, including age at first marriage and at each birth for female members of the households from ages 15 to 67 in the first survey and from 15 to 57 in the second. The data provide detailed information on the extraordinary decline in the rate of childbearing in China (by 60% from 1970 to 1980). Because rising age at marriage played a significant role in this decline, the effect of changes in the pattern of entry into marriage on childbearing since 1980 was examined. There was a sharp increase in overall fertility (the total fertility rate) from 1980 to 1982; after falling to slightly below the 1980 level in 1985, the rate rose in 1985 and 1986 to well above that of 1980. A major factor in this arrested and partially reversed decline was a boom in marriage that followed a relaxation in 1980 of locally administered restrictions on marriage before the officially designated desirable age. In fact, the total fertility rate of married women (summed over duration of marriage rather than age) averaged much lower in the mid-1980s than in 1980. The summary rate of bearing second children increased markedly in the 1980s when calculated by age of women, but declined when calculated by duration of marriage, given the inflated number of recently married women."

https://openalex.org/W2000593353,"A spectrum of comet Austin (1988 c(1)) has been obtained from 910 to 1180 A. Three bright emission lines were detected, including a forbidden oxygen line (1128 A), which are attributable to radiative pumping of neutral oxygen by solar Lyman beta. The relative strengths of the observed features should prove to be a useful diagnostic of the physical conditions and radiation fields in cometary comae. In addition, the absence of strong spectral features from highly volatile species such as He, Ar, or N(2) can be used to place constraints on the thermal environment under which the comet was formed and has been processed."

https://openalex.org/W2079812119,"Would a major conflagration in Kuwait's oil fields trigger a climate catastrophe akin to the 'nuclear winter' that got so much attention in the 1980s This question prompted a variety of opinions. The British Meteorological Office and researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory concluded that the effect of smoke from major oil fires in Kuwait on global temperatures is likely to be small; however, the obscuration of sunlight might significantly reduce surface temperatures locally. Michael MacCracken, leader of the researchers at Livermore, predicts that the worst plausible oil fires in the Gulf would produce a cloud of pollution about as severe as that found on a bad day at the Los Angeles airport. The results of some mathematical modeling by the Livermore research group are reported."

There is an intellectual unity of aim and procedure in all science ; but to discuss this with any clarity requires definition of terms. Men have long tried to fix science within a rigid definition, and have not agreed. Much unnecessary and unhelpful debate about the scientific standing of the social disciplines has been based on uncertain and divergent premises as to what constitutes science. To Francis Bacon science was unbiased observation of nature and inductive reasoning to generalizations. This was a good start. Some positivists have wished to limit science to ob-"
