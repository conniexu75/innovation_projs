https://openalex.org/W2034257461,"Background Low Birth Weight (LBW) is one of the major risk factor for death in early life. However, little is known about predictors of LBW in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure the incidence and determinants of LBW in a rural population of Ethiopia. Methods An observational cohort study on pregnant women was conducted from December 2009 to November 2010. During the study period 1295 live birth were registered and the weights of 956 children were measured within 24 hours after birth. Socio-demographic, economic, maternal and organizational factors were considered as a predicators of LBW, defined as birth weight below 2500g. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data, odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Result The incidence of LBW was 28.3%. It is significantly associated with poverty [OR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.42, 3.05], maternal Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) less than 23 cm [OR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.19], not attending ANC [OR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.28], mother’s experience of physical violence during pregnancy [OR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.48], and longer time to walk to health facility [OR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.40]. Conclusion and Recommendation The incidence of LBW was high in Kersa. Babies born to women who were poor, undernourished, experienced physical violence during pregnancy and who had poor access to health services were more likely to be LBW in this part of the country. In this largely poor community where ANC coverage is low, to reduce the incidence of LBW, it is essential to improve access for maternal health care. The involvement of husbands and the community at large to seek collective action on LBW is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2068223658,"We conducted a tuberculosis (TB) prevalence survey and evaluated the screening methods used in our survey, to assess if screening in TB prevalence surveys could be simplified, and to assess the accuracy of screening algorithms that may be applicable for active case finding.All participants with a positive screen on either a symptom questionnaire, chest radiography (CXR) and/or sputum smear microscopy submitted sputum for culture. HIV status was obtained from prevalent cases. We estimated the accuracy of modified screening strategies with bacteriologically confirmed TB as the gold standard, and compared these with other survey reports. We also assessed whether sequential rather than parallel application of symptom, CXR and HIV screening would substantially reduce the number of participants requiring CXR and/or sputum culture.Presence of any abnormality on CXR had 94% (95%CI 88-98) sensitivity (92% in HIV-infected and 100% in HIV-uninfected) and 73% (95%CI 68-77) specificity. Symptom screening combinations had significantly lower sensitivity than CXR except for 'any TB symptom' which had 90% (95%CI 84-95) sensitivity (96% in HIV-infected and 82% in HIV-uninfected) and 32% (95%CI 30-34) specificity. Smear microscopy did not yield additional suspects, thus the combined symptom/CXR screen applied in the survey had 100% (95%CI 97-100) sensitivity. Specificity was 65% (95%CI 61-68). Sequential application of first a symptom screen for 'any symptom', followed by CXR-evaluation and different suspect criteria depending on HIV status would result in the largest reduction of the need for CXR and sputum culture, approximately 36%, but would underestimate prevalence by 11%.CXR screening alone had higher accuracy compared to symptom screening alone. Combined CXR and symptom screening had the highest sensitivity and remains important for suspect identification in TB prevalence surveys in settings where bacteriological sputum examination of all participants is not feasible."
https://openalex.org/W1973829155,"Adenovirus assembly concludes with proteolytic processing of several capsid and core proteins. Immature virions containing precursor proteins lack infectivity because they cannot properly uncoat, becoming trapped in early endosomes. Structural studies have shown that precursors increase the network of interactions maintaining virion integrity. Using different biophysical techniques to analyze capsid disruption in vitro, we show that immature virions are more stable than the mature ones under a variety of stress conditions and that maturation primes adenovirus for highly cooperative DNA release. Cryoelectron tomography reveals that under mildly acidic conditions mimicking the early endosome, mature virions release pentons and peripheral core contents. At higher stress levels, both mature and immature capsids crack open. The virus core is completely released from cracked capsids in mature virions, but it remains connected to shell fragments in the immature particle. The extra stability of immature adenovirus does not equate with greater rigidity, because in nanoindentation assays immature virions exhibit greater elasticity than the mature particles. Our results have implications for the role of proteolytic maturation in adenovirus assembly and uncoating. Precursor proteins favor assembly by establishing stable interactions with the appropriate curvature and preventing premature ejection of contents by tightly sealing the capsid vertices. Upon maturation, core organization is looser, particularly at the periphery, and interactions preserving capsid curvature are weakened. The capsid becomes brittle, and pentons are more easily released. Based on these results, we hypothesize that changes in core compaction during maturation may increase capsid internal pressure to trigger proper uncoating of adenovirus."
https://openalex.org/W2011658585,"Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and TRP vanilloid 1 (V1) perceive noxious temperatures and chemical stimuli and are involved in pain sensation in mammals. Thus, these two channels provide a model for understanding how different genes with similar biological roles may influence the function of one another during the course of evolution. However, the temperature sensitivity of TRPA1 in ancestral vertebrates and its evolutionary path are unknown as its temperature sensitivities vary among different vertebrate species. To elucidate the functional evolution of TRPA1, TRPA1s of the western clawed (WC) frogs and green anole lizards were characterized. WC frog TRPA1 was activated by heat and noxious chemicals that activate mammalian TRPA1. These stimuli also activated native sensory neurons and elicited nocifensive behaviors in WC frogs. Similar to mammals, TRPA1 was functionally co-expressed with TRPV1, another heat- and chemical-sensitive nociceptive receptor, in native sensory neurons of the WC frog. Green anole TRPA1 was also activated by heat and noxious chemical stimulation. These results suggest that TRPA1 was likely a noxious heat and chemical receptor and co-expressed with TRPV1 in the nociceptive sensory neurons of ancestral vertebrates. Conservation of TRPV1 heat sensitivity throughout vertebrate evolution could have changed functional constraints on TRPA1 and influenced the functional evolution of TRPA1 regarding temperature sensitivity, whereas conserving its noxious chemical sensitivity. In addition, our results also demonstrated that two mammalian TRPA1 inhibitors elicited different effect on the TRPA1s of WC frogs and green anoles, which can be utilized to clarify the structural bases for inhibition of TRPA1.

https://openalex.org/W2030104259,"Purpose To evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of steep cornea/keratoconus in the adult Chinese population. Methods The population-based Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals with a mean age of 64.6±9.8 years (range: 50–93 years). A detailed ophthalmic examination was performed including optical low-coherence reflectometry. Steep cornea/keratoconus were defined as an anterior corneal refractive power exceeding 48 diopters. Results Mean refractive power of the cornea was 43.16±1.45 diopters (range: 36.51 to 48.46 diopters; flattest meridian) and 43.98±1.52 diopters (range: 37.00 to 52.88 diopters; steepest meridian). A steep cornea/keratoconus defined as corneal refractive power of ≥48 diopters and ≥49 diopters was detected in 27 subjects (prevalence rate: 0.9±0.2%) and 6 (0.2± 0.1%) subjects, respectively. Presence of steep cornea/keratoconus was associated with shorter axial length (P<0.001), smaller interpupillary distance (P = 0.038), lower best corrected visual acuity (P = 0.021), higher cylindrical refractive error (P<0.001) and more myopic refractive error (P<0.001). It was not significantly associated with gender, body height, psychic depression, cognitive function, blood concentrations of glucose, lipids, creatinine and C-reactive protein, blood pressure and quality of life score, nor with intraocular pressure, dry eye feeling, and lens thickness. Conclusions A steep cornea/keratoconus defined as corneal refractive power of 48+ diopters has a prevalence of 0.9±0.2% among Chinese aged 50 years and above. Its prevalence was significantly associated with the ocular parameters of shorter axial length, smaller interpupillary distance, higher cylindrical and myopic refractive error and lower best corrected visual acuity, however, with none of the systemic parameters tested."
https://openalex.org/W2003948157,"Mutations in the parkin gene are currently thought to be the most common cause of recessive familial Parkinsonism. Parkin functions as an E3 ligase to regulate protein turnover, and its function in mitochondrial quality control has been reported recently. Overexpression of parkin has been found to prevent neuronal degeneration under various conditions both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse model in which expression of wild type parkin was driven by neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. We reported that both young and old parkin transgenic mice exhibited less reduction of striatal TH protein and number of TH positive neurons in the substantia nigra induced by 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1,2,3,6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), compared to wild type littermates. MPTP-induced mitochondrial impairment in the substantia nigra was improved in young parkin transgenic mice. Decreased striatal α-synuclein was demonstrated in old parkin transgenic mice. These results provide reliable evidence from the transgenic mouse model for parkin that overexpression of parkin may attenuate dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by MPTP through protection of mitochondria and reduction of α-synuclein in the nigrostriatal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1969790866,"In response to genotoxic stress, the p53 tumor suppressor induces target genes for cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Although p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in all human cancers, it is only mutated in about 20% of breast cancers. 70% of all breast cancer cases are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and express ERα. ER-positive breast cancer generally indicates good patient prognosis and treatment responsiveness with antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen. However, ER-positive breast cancer patients can experience loss or a reduction in ERα, which is associated with aggressive tumor growth, increased invasiveness, poor prognosis, and loss of p53 function. Consistent with this, we found that p53 is a target gene of ERα. Specifically, we found that knockdown of ERα decreases expression of p53 and its downstream targets, MDM2 and p21. In addition, we found that ERα activates p53 transcription via binding to estrogen response element half-sites within the p53 promoter. Moreover, we found that loss of ERα desensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of ERα sensitizes, breast cancer cells to DNA damage-induced growth suppression in a p53-dependent manner. Altogether, this study provides an insight into a feedback loop between ERα and p53 and a biological role of p53 in the DNA damage response in ER-positive breast cancers.

https://openalex.org/W1982276380,"While DNA repair has been implicated in CAG·CTG repeat expansion, its role in the GAA·TTC expansion of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is less clear. We have developed a human cellular model that recapitulates the DNA repeat expansion found in FRDA patient tissues. In this model, GAA·TTC repeats expand incrementally and continuously. We have previously shown that the expansion rate is linked to transcription within the repeats. Our working hypothesis is that structures formed within the GAA·TTC repeat during transcription attract DNA repair enzymes that then facilitate the expansion process. MutSβ, a heterodimer of MSH2 and MSH3, is known to have a role in CAG·CTG repeat expansion. We now show that shRNA knockdown of either MSH2 or MSH3 slowed GAA·TTC expansion in our system. We further characterized the role of MutSβ in GAA·TTC expansion using a functional assay in primary FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts. These fibroblasts have no known propensity for instability in their native state. Ectopic expression of MSH2 and MSH3 induced GAA·TTC repeat expansion in the native FXN gene. MSH2 is central to mismatch repair and its absence or reduction causes a predisposition to cancer. Thus, despite its essential role in GAA·TTC expansion, MSH2 is not an attractive therapeutic target. The absence or reduction of MSH3 is not strongly associated with cancer predisposition. Accordingly, MSH3 has been suggested as a therapeutic target for CAG·CTG repeat expansion disorders. Our results suggest that MSH3 may also serve as a therapeutic target to slow the expansion of GAA·TTC repeats in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1997536246,"Massive phytoplankton blooms, like the recurrent Phaeocystis proliferation observed every year in the Eastern English Channel (EEC), have a significant influence on the overall planktonic community structure and their food web dynamics. As well as being an important area for local fisheries, the EEC is an ideal ecosystem for work on microbial diversity. This is because, although its environmental context is relatively complex, it is reasonably well understood due to several years of monitoring and morphological observations of its planktonic organisms. The objective of our study was to better understand the under-explored microbial eukaryotic diversity relative to the Phaeocystis bloom.The community structure of microplankton (diatoms, haptophytes, ciliates and dinoflagellates) was studied through morphological observations and tag pyrosequencing. During the annual Phaeocystis spring bloom, the phytoplankton biomass increased by 34-fold, while the microzooplankton biomass showed a 4-fold increase, representing on average about 4.6% of the biomass of their phytoplankton prey. Tag pyrosequencing unveiled an extensive diversity of Gymnodiniaceae, with G. spirale and G. fusiformis representing the most abundant reads. An extended diversity of Phaeocystales, with partial 18S rDNA genes sequence identity as low as 85% was found, with taxa corresponding to P. globosa, but also to unknown Phaeocystaceae.Morphological analyses and pyrosequencing were generally in accordance with capturing frequency shifts of abundant taxa. Tag pyrosequencing allowed highlighting the maintenance of microplankton diversity during the Phaeocystis bloom and the increase of the taxa presenting low number of reads (minor taxa) along with the dominant ones in response to biotic and/or abiotic changing conditions. Although molecular approaches have enhanced our perception on diversity, it has come to light that the challenge of modelling and predicting ecological change requires the use of different complementary approaches, to link taxonomic data with the functional roles of microbes in biogeochemical cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2141410829,"Based on the identification of residues that determine receptor selectivity of arrestins and the analysis of the evolution in the arrestin family, we introduced 10 mutations of ""receptor discriminator"" residues in arrestin-3. The recruitment of these mutants to M2 muscarinic (M2R), D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) dopamine, and β(2)-adrenergic receptors (β(2)AR) was assessed using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assays in cells. Seven of 10 mutations differentially affected arrestin-3 binding to individual receptors. D260K and Q262P reduced the binding to β(2)AR, much more than to other receptors. The combination D260K/Q262P virtually eliminated β(2)AR binding while preserving the interactions with M2R, D1R, and D2R. Conversely, Y239T enhanced arrestin-3 binding to β(2)AR and reduced the binding to M2R, D1R, and D2R, whereas Q256Y selectively reduced recruitment to D2R. The Y239T/Q256Y combination virtually eliminated the binding to D2R and reduced the binding to β(2)AR and M2R, yielding a mutant with high selectivity for D1R. Eleven of 12 mutations significantly changed the binding to light-activated phosphorhodopsin. Thus, manipulation of key residues on the receptor-binding surface modifies receptor preference, enabling the construction of non-visual arrestins specific for particular receptor subtypes. These findings pave the way to the construction of signaling-biased arrestins targeting the receptor of choice for research or therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2022992670,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a noncytopathic human hepadnavirus that causes acute, chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As the clinical utility of current therapies is limited, new anti-HBV agents and sources for such agents are still highly sought after. Here, we report that Mucroporin-M1, a scorpion venom-derived peptide, reduces the amount of extracellular HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA productions of HepG2.2.15 cells in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits HBV capsid DNA, HBV intracellular RNA replication intermediates and the HBV Core protein in the cytoplasm of HepG2.2.15 cells. Using a mouse model of HBV infection, we found that HBV replication was significantly inhibited by intravenous injection of the Mucroporin-M1 peptide. This inhibitory activity was due to a reduction in HBV promoter activity caused by a decrease in the binding of HNF4α to the precore/core promoter region. Furthermore, we confirmed that Mucroporin-M1 could selectively activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and lead to the down-regulation of HNF4α expression, which explains the decreased binding of HNF4α to the HBV promoter. Moreover, when the protein phosphorylation activity of the MAPK pathway was inhibited, both HNF4α expression and HBV replication recovered. Finally, we proved that treatment with the Mucroporin-M1 peptide increased phosphorylation of the MAPK proteins in HBV-harboring mice. These results implicate Mucroporin-M1 peptide can activate the MAPK pathway and then reduce the expression of HNF4α, resulting in the inhibition of HBV replication in vitro and in vivo. Our work also opens new doors to discovering novel anti-HBV agents or sources."
https://openalex.org/W1998039234,"Although the MDM2-p53 interaction has been well documented, MDM2 overexpression is observed in human cancers with little or no functional p53, suggesting that mdm2 expression is regulated by mechanisms independent of p53. Dysregulation of NFAT signaling is associated with malignant transformation and cancer development and progression. In this study, we demonstrate that the human mdm2 P2 promoter contains a consensus binding site for the NFAT1 transcription factor. NFAT1 directly binds the mdm2 P2 promoter in vitro and in vivo, resulting in the up-regulation of mdm2 transcription. Enforced expression of NFAT1 results in an elevated MDM2 protein level and reduces p53 activation and function in response to DNA damage. Both NFAT1 and MDM2 are highly expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, compared with adjacent normal liver tissues. There is a positive correlation between the NFAT1 and MDM2 levels in tumor tissues. The novel function of NFAT1 in the control of MDM2 expression provides a basis for future investigations of the role of NFAT1 in cancer development, progression, and therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2015637592,"Forest ecosystems where periodical tree bark harvesting is a major economic activity may be particularly vulnerable to disturbances such as fire, since debarking usually reduces tree vigour and protection against external agents. In this paper we asked how cork oak Quercus suber trees respond after wildfires and, in particular, how bark harvesting affects post-fire tree survival and resprouting. We gathered data from 22 wildfires (4585 trees) that occurred in three southern European countries (Portugal, Spain and France), covering a wide range of conditions characteristic of Q. suber ecosystems. Post-fire tree responses (tree mortality, stem mortality and crown resprouting) were examined in relation to management and ecological factors using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results showed that bark thickness and bark harvesting are major factors affecting resistance of Q. suber to fire. Fire vulnerability was higher for trees with thin bark (young or recently debarked individuals) and decreased with increasing bark thickness until cork was 3-4 cm thick. This bark thickness corresponds to the moment when exploited trees are debarked again, meaning that exploited trees are vulnerable to fire during a longer period. Exploited trees were also more likely to be top-killed than unexploited trees, even for the same bark thickness. Additionally, vulnerability to fire increased with burn severity and with tree diameter, and was higher in trees burned in early summer or located in drier south-facing aspects. We provided tree response models useful to help estimating the impact of fire and to support management decisions. The results suggested that an appropriate management of surface fuels and changes in the bark harvesting regime (e.g. debarking coexisting trees in different years or increasing the harvesting cycle) would decrease vulnerability to fire and contribute to the conservation of cork oak ecosystems."

It belongs to the cytidine deaminase family. Recent studies have shown that A3G significantly inhibits microRNA (miRNA)-mediated repression of translation. However, the mechanism underlying this action must be clarified. In this report, we have demonstrated that A3G counteracts miRNA-mediated repression of translation by inhibiting the interaction between moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein and Argonaute-2 (AGO2), causing either abnormal assembly or abnormal maturation of miRNA-inducing silencing complex (miRISC). Through a series of MOV10 deletions, we found that A3G binds to a domain at the C terminus in MOV10, where it competitively inhibits the binding of AGO2 to that same domain.

https://openalex.org/W2006998245,"Chaos should occur often in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) which have been widely described by nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations, if their dimensions are no less than 3. It is therefore puzzling that chaos has never been reported in GRNs in nature and is also extremely rare in models of GRNs. On the other hand, the topic of motifs has attracted great attention in studying biological networks, and network motifs are suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out some key functions in the network. In this paper, chaotic motifs (subnetworks with chaos) in GRNs are systematically investigated. The conclusion is that: (i) chaos can only appear through competitions between different oscillatory modes with rivaling intensities. Conditions required for chaotic GRNs are found to be very strict, which make chaotic GRNs extremely rare. (ii) Chaotic motifs are explored as the simplest few-node structures capable of producing chaos, and serve as the intrinsic source of chaos of random few-node GRNs. Several optimal motifs causing chaos with atypically high probability are figured out. (iii) Moreover, we discovered that a number of special oscillators can never produce chaos. These structures bring some advantages on rhythmic functions and may help us understand the robustness of diverse biological rhythms. (iv) The methods of dominant phase-advanced driving (DPAD) and DPAD time fraction are proposed to quantitatively identify chaotic motifs and to explain the origin of chaotic behaviors in GRNs."
https://openalex.org/W1984902916,"Background In mouse models, natural killer (NK) cells have been shown to exert anti-fibrotic activity via killing of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Chemokines and chemokine receptors critically modulate hepatic recruitment of NK cells. In hepatitis C, the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and its ligands have been shown to be associated with stage of fibrosis suggesting a role of these chemokines in HCV associated liver damage by yet incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we analyzed phenotype and function of CXCR3 expressing NK cells in chronic hepatitis C. Methods Circulating NK cells from HCV-infected patients (n = 57) and healthy controls (n = 27) were analyzed with respect to CXCR3 and co-expression of different maturation markers. Degranulation and interferon-γ secretion of CXCR3(+) and CXCR3(−) NK cell subsets were studied after co-incubation with primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSC). In addition, intra-hepatic frequency of CXCR3(+) NK cells was correlated with stage of liver fibrosis (n = 15). Results We show that distinct NK cell subsets can be distinguished based on CXCR3 surface expression. In healthy controls CXCR3(+)CD56Bright NK cells displayed strongest activity against HSC. Chronic hepatitis C was associated with a significantly increased frequency of CXCR3(+)CD56Bright NK cells which showed impaired degranulation and impaired IFN-γ secretion in response to HSC. Of note, we observed intra-hepatic accumulation of this NK cell subset in advanced stages of liver fibrosis. Conclusion We show that distinct NK cell subsets can be distinguished based on CXCR3 surface expression. Intra-hepatic accumulation of the functionally impaired CXCR3(+)CD56Bright NK cell subset might be involved in HCV-induced liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2084227839,"The PRL (phosphatase of regenerating liver) phosphatases are implicated in the control of cell proliferation and invasion. Aberrant PRL expression is associated with progression and metastasis of multiple cancers. However, the specific in vivo function of the PRLs remains elusive. Here we show that deletion of PRL2, the most ubiquitously expressed PRL family member, leads to impaired placental development and retarded growth at both embryonic and adult stages. Ablation of PRL2 inactivates Akt and blocks glycogen cell proliferation, resulting in reduced spongiotrophoblast and decidual layers in the placenta. These structural defects cause placental hypotrophy and insufficiency, leading to fetal growth retardation. We demonstrate that the tumor suppressor PTEN is elevated in PRL2-deficient placenta. Biochemical analyses indicate that PRL2 promotes Akt activation by down-regulating PTEN through the proteasome pathway. This study provides the first evidence that PRL2 is required for extra-embryonic development and associates the oncogenic properties of PRL2 with its ability to negatively regulate PTEN, thereby activating the PI3K-Akt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2024369641,"The translation of non-stop mRNA (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. In eubacteria, the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes from non-stop mRNA in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. During rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. Escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the ArfA peptide. The E. coli arfA message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by RNase III to produce a non-stop transcript. Therefore, ArfA levels are controlled by tmRNA through ssrA-peptide tagging and proteolysis. Here, we examine whether ArfA homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by RNase III and tmRNA. We searched 431 arfA coding sequences for mRNA secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in their 3′-coding regions. The arfA hairpins from Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio fischeri, and Pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by RNase III as predicted, whereas the hairpin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mRNA. Each ArfA homologue is ssrA-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type E. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmRNA. Together, these findings show that ArfA synthesis from non-stop mRNA is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. This strategy ensures that ArfA homologues are only deployed when the tmRNA system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes. The translation of non-stop mRNA (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. In eubacteria, the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes from non-stop mRNA in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. During rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. Escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the ArfA peptide. The E. coli arfA message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by RNase III to produce a non-stop transcript. Therefore, ArfA levels are controlled by tmRNA through ssrA-peptide tagging and proteolysis. Here, we examine whether ArfA homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by RNase III and tmRNA. We searched 431 arfA coding sequences for mRNA secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in their 3′-coding regions. The arfA hairpins from Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio fischeri, and Pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by RNase III as predicted, whereas the hairpin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mRNA. Each ArfA homologue is ssrA-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type E. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmRNA. Together, these findings show that ArfA synthesis from non-stop mRNA is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. This strategy ensures that ArfA homologues are only deployed when the tmRNA system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2002893170,"We here identify protein kinase D1 (PKD1) as a major regulator of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of cancer cells controlled via the transcription factor Snail1. Using FRET, we demonstrate that PKD1, but not PKD2, efficiently interacts with Snail1 in nuclei. PKD1 phosphorylates Snail1 at Ser-11. There was no change in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Snail1 using wild type Snail1 and Ser-11 phosphosite mutants in different tumor cells. Regardless of its phosphorylation status or following co-expression of constitutively active PKD, Snail1 was predominantly localized to cell nuclei. We also identify a novel mechanism of PKD1-mediated regulation of Snail1 transcriptional activity in tumor cells. The interaction of the co-repressors histone deacetylases 1 and 2 as well as lysyl oxidase-like protein 3 with Snail1 was impaired when Snail1 was not phosphorylated at Ser-11, which led to reduced Snail1-associated histone deacetylase activity. Additionally, lysyl oxidase-like protein 3 expression was up-regulated by ectopic PKD1 expression, implying a synergistic regulation of Snail1-driven transcription. Ectopic expression of PKD1 also up-regulated proliferation markers such as Cyclin D1 and Ajuba. Accordingly, Snail1 and its phosphorylation at Ser-11 were required and sufficient to control PKD1-mediated anchorage-independent growth and anchorage-dependent proliferation of different tumor cells. In conclusion, our data show that PKD1 is crucial to support growth of tumor cells via Snail1."

P4-ATPases form heteromeric complexes with Cdc50 proteins. Studies of the enzymatic properties of purified P4-ATPase·Cdc50 complexes showed that catalytic activity depends on direct and specific interactions between Cdc50 subunit and transporter, whereas in vivo interaction assays suggested that the binding affinity for each other fluctuates during the transport reaction cycle. The structural determinants that govern this dynamic association remain to be established. Using domain swapping, site-directed, and random mutagenesis approaches, we here show that residues throughout the subunit contribute to forming the heterodimer. Moreover, we find that a precise conformation of the large ectodomain of Cdc50 proteins is crucial for the specificity and functionality to transporter/subunit interactions. We also identified two highly conserved disulfide bridges in the Cdc50 ectodomain. Functional analysis of cysteine mutants that disrupt these disulfide bridges revealed an inverse relationship between subunit binding and P4-ATPase-catalyzed phospholipid transport.

https://openalex.org/W2025559428,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with excessive cell death causing selective loss of dopaminergic neurons. Dysfunction of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is associated with the pathophysiology of PD. Mutations in Parkin which impair its E3-ligase activity play a major role in the pathogenesis of inherited PD. ARTS (Sept4_i2) is a mitochondrial protein, which initiates caspase activation upstream of cytochrome c release in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Here we show that Parkin serves as an E3-ubiquitin ligase to restrict the levels of ARTS through UPS-mediated degradation. Though Parkin binds equally to ARTS and Sept4_i1 (H5/PNUTL2), the non-apoptotic splice variant of Sept4, Parkin ubiquitinates and degrades only ARTS. Thus, the effect of Parkin on ARTS is specific and probably related to its pro-apoptotic function. High levels of ARTS are sufficient to promote apoptosis in cultured neuronal cells, and rat brains treated with 6-OHDA reveal high levels of ARTS. However, over-expression of Parkin can protect cells from ARTS-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Parkin loss-of-function experiments reveal that reduction of Parkin causes increased levels of ARTS and apoptosis. We propose that in brain cells in which the E3-ligase activity of Parkin is compromised, ARTS levels increase and facilitate apoptosis. Thus, ARTS is a novel substrate of Parkin. These observations link Parkin directly to a pro-apoptotic protein and reveal a novel connection between Parkin, apoptosis, and PD."
https://openalex.org/W2028999289,"Superficial mycoses caused by dermatophyte fungi are among the most common infections worldwide, yet treatment is restricted by limited effective drugs available, drug toxicity, and emergence of drug resistance. The stilbene fluorescent brightener calcofluor white (CFW) inhibits fungi by binding chitin in the cell wall, disrupting cell wall integrity, and thus entails a different mechanism of inhibition than currently available antifungal drugs. To identify novel therapeutic options for the treatment of skin infections, we compared the sensitivity of representative strains of the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans to CFW and a panel of fluorescent brighteners and phytoalexin compounds. We identified the structurally related stilbene fluorescent brighteners 71, 85, 113 and 134 as fungicidal to both T. rubrum and C. albicans to a similar degree as CFW, and the stilbene phytoalexins pinosylvan monomethyl ether and pterostilbene inhibited to a lesser degree, allowing us to develop a structure-activity relationship for fungal inhibition. Given the abilities of CFW to absorb UV365 nm and bind specifically to fungal cell walls, we tested whether CFW combined with UV365 nm irradiation would be synergistic to fungi and provide a novel photodynamic treatment option. However, while both treatments individually were cytocidal, UV365 nm irradiation reduced sensitivity to CFW, which we attribute to CFW photoinactivation. We also tested combination treatments of CFW with other fungal inhibitors and identified synergistic interactions between CFW and some ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors in C. albicans. Therefore, our studies identify novel fungal inhibitors and drug interactions, offering promise for combination topical treatment regimes for superficial mycoses."

The disease is caused by abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the gene encoding huntingtin, but how mutant huntingtin leads to early cognitive deficits in HD is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Ube3a, which is implicated in synaptic plasticity and involved in the clearance of misfolded polyglutamine protein, is strongly recruited to the mutant huntingtin nuclear aggregates, resulting in significant loss of its functional pool in different regions of HD mouse brain. Interestingly, Arc, one of the substrates of Ube3a linked with synaptic plasticity, is also associated with nuclear aggregates, although its synaptic level is increased in the hippocampus and cortex of HD mouse brain. Different regions of HD mouse brain also exhibit decreased levels of AMPA receptors and various pre- and postsynaptic proteins, which could be due to the partial loss of function of Ube3a. Transient expression of mutant huntingtin in mouse primary cortical neurons further demonstrates recruitment of Ube3a into mutant huntingtin aggregates, increased accumulation of Arc, and decreased numbers of GluR1 puncta in the neuronal processes. Altogether, our results suggest that the loss of function of Ube3a might be associated with the synaptic abnormalities observed in HD.

https://openalex.org/W1984934999,"Increasing evidence shows that the cancer microenvironment affects both tumorigenesis and the response of cancer to drug treatment. Therefore in vitro models that selectively reflect characteristics of the in vivo environment are greatly needed. Current methods allow us to screen the effect of extrinsic parameters such as matrix composition and to model the complex and three-dimensional (3D) cancer environment. However, 3D models that reflect characteristics of the in vivo environment are typically too complex and do not allow the separation of discrete extrinsic parameters.In this study we used a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel-based microwell array to model breast cancer cell behavior in multilayer cell clusters that allows a rigorous control of the environment. The innovative array fabrication enables different matrix proteins to be integrated into the bottom surface of microwells. Thereby, extrinsic parameters including dimensionality, type of matrix coating and the extent of cell-cell adhesion could be independently studied. Our results suggest that cell to matrix interactions and increased cell-cell adhesion, at high cell density, induce independent effects on the response to Taxol in multilayer breast cancer cell clusters. In addition, comparing the levels of apoptosis and proliferation revealed that drug resistance mediated by cell-cell adhesion can be related to altered cell cycle regulation. Conversely, the matrix-dependent response to Taxol did not correlate with proliferation changes suggesting that cell death inhibition may be responsible for this effect.The application of the PEG hydrogel platform provided novel insight into the independent role of extrinsic parameters controlling drug response. The presented platform may not only become a useful tool for basic research related to the role of the cancer microenvironment but could also serve as a complementary platform for in vitro drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2068004121,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common form of scoliosis and usually affects young girls. Studies mostly describe the differences between scoliotic and non-scoliotic girls and focus primarily on a single set of parameters derived from spinal and pelvis morphology, posture or standing imbalance. No study addressed all these three biomechanical aspects simultaneously in pre-braced AIS girls of different scoliosis severity but with similar curve type and their interaction with scoliosis progression. The first objective of this study was to test if there are differences in these parameters between pre-braced AIS girls with a right thoracic scoliosis of moderate (less than 27°) and severe (more than 27°) deformity. The second objective was to identify which of these parameters are related to the Cobb angle progression either individually or in combination of thereof. Forty-five scoliotic girls, randomly selected by an orthopedic surgeon from the hospital scoliosis clinic, participated in this study. Parameters related to pelvis morphology, pelvis orientation, trunk posture and quiet standing balance were measured. Generally moderate pre-brace idiopathic scoliosis patients displayed lower values than the severe group characterized by a Cobb angle greater than 27°. Only pelvis morphology and trunk posture were statistically different between the groups while pelvis orientation and standing imbalance were similar in both groups. Statistically significant Pearson coefficients of correlation between individual parameters and Cobb angle ranged between 0.32 and 0.53. Collectively trunk posture, pelvis morphology and standing balance parameters are correlated with Cobb angle at 0.82. The results suggest that spinal deformity progression is not only a question of trunk morphology distortion by itself but is also related to pelvis asymmetrical bone growth and standing neuromuscular imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W2036872904,"Previously, we showed that insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), independent of IGF-1, reduces pathological angiogenesis in a mouse model of the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). The current study evaluates novel endothelium-dependent functions of IGFBP-3 including blood retinal barrier (BRB) integrity and vasorelaxation. To evaluate vascular barrier function, either plasmid expressing IGFBP-3 under the regulation of an endothelial-specific promoter or a control plasmid was injected into the vitreous humor of mouse pups (P1) and compared to the non-injected eyes of the same pups undergoing standard OIR protocol. Prior to sacrifice, the mice were given an injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). IGFBP-3 plasmid-injected eyes displayed near-normal vessel morphology and enhanced vascular barrier function. Further, in vitro IGFBP-3 protects retinal endothelial cells from VEGF-induced loss of junctional integrity by antagonizing the dissociation of the junctional complexes. To assess the vasodilatory effects of IGFBP-3, rat posterior cerebral arteries were examined in vitro. Intraluminal IGFBP-3 decreased both pressure- and serotonin-induced constrictions by stimulating nitric oxide (NO) release that were blocked by L-NAME or scavenger receptor-B1 neutralizing antibody (SRB1-Ab). Both wild-type and IGF-1-nonbinding mutant IGFBP-3 (IGFBP-3NB) stimulated eNOS activity/NO release to a similar extent in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). NO release was neither associated with an increase in intracellular calcium nor decreased by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) blockade; however, dephosphorylation of eNOS-Thr(495) was observed. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and Akt-Ser(473) phosphorylation were both increased by IGFBP-3 and selectively blocked by the SRB1-Ab or PI3K blocker LY294002. In conclusion, IGFBP-3 mediates protective effects on BRB integrity and mediates robust NO release to stimulate vasorelaxation via activation of SRB1. This response is IGF-1- and calcium-independent, but requires PI3K/Akt activation, suggesting that IGFBP-3 has novel protective effects on retinal and systemic vasculature and may be a therapeutic candidate for ocular complications such as diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2042023942,"Protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) is a novel PKC that plays a key role in T lymphocyte activation. To understand how PKCθ is regulated in T cells, we investigated the properties of its N-terminal C2 domain that functions as an autoinhibitory domain. Our measurements show that a Tyr(P)-containing peptide derived from CDCP1 binds the C2 domain of PKCθ with high affinity and activates the enzyme activity of the intact protein. The Tyr(P) peptide also binds the C2 domain of PKCδ tightly, but no enzyme activation was observed with PKCδ. Mutations of PKCθ-C2 residues involved in Tyr(P) binding abrogated the enzyme activation and association of PKCθ with Tyr-phosphorylated full-length CDCP1 and severely inhibited the T cell receptor/CD28-mediated activation of a PKCθ-dependent reporter gene in T cells. Collectively, these studies establish the C2 domain of PKCθ as a Tyr(P)-binding domain and suggest that the domain may play a major role in PKCθ activation via its Tyr(P) binding."
https://openalex.org/W2053927562,"An integrated microdevice for measuring proton-dependent membrane activity at the surface of Xenopus laevis oocytes is presented. By establishing a stable contact between the oocyte vitelline membrane and an ion-sensitive field-effect (ISFET) sensor inside a microperfusion channel, changes in surface pH that are hypothesized to result from facilitated proton lateral diffusion along the membrane were detected. The solute diffusion barrier created between the sensor and the active membrane area allowed detection of surface proton concentration free from interference of solutes in bulk solution. The proposed sensor mechanism was verified by heterologously expressing membrane transport proteins and recording changes in surface pH during application of the specific substrates. Experiments conducted on two families of phosphate-sodium cotransporters (SLC20 & SLC34) demonstrated that it is possible to detect phosphate transport for both electrogenic and electroneutral isoforms and distinguish between transport of different phosphate species. Furthermore, the transport activity of the proton/amino acid cotransporter PAT1 assayed using conventional whole cell electrophysiology correlated well with changes in surface pH, confirming the ability of the system to detect activity proportional to expression level."

In India, Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) focuses on indicator start of treatment within 7 days of diagnosis for patients with sputum smear-positive PTB for monitoring DOTS implementation. Objectives To determine length of time between diagnosis and initiation of treatment and factors associated with delays of more than 7 days in smear-positive pulmonary TB. Methods Using existing programme records such as the TB Register, treatment cards, and the laboratory register, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients with smear-positive pulmonary TB registered from July-September 2010 in two districts in India. A random sample of patients with pulmonary TB who experienced treatment delay of more than 7 days was interviewed using structured questionnaire. Results 2027 of 3411 patients registered with pulmonary TB were smear-positive. 711(35%) patients had >7 days between diagnosis and treatment and 262(13%) had delays >15 days. Mean duration between TB diagnosis and treatment initiation was 8 days (range = 0–128 days). Odds of treatment delay >7 days was 1.8 times more likely among those who had been previously treated (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–2.3) and 1.6 (95% CI 1.3–1.8) times more likely among those diagnosed in health facilities without microscopy centers. The main factors associated with a delay >7 days were: patient reluctance to start a re-treatment regimen, patients seeking second opinions, delay in transportation of drugs to the DOT centers and delay in initial home visits. To conclude, treatment delay >7 days was associated with a number of factors that included history of previous treatment and absence of TB diagnostic services in the local health facility. Decentralized diagnostic facilities and improved referral procedures may reduce such treatment delays."
https://openalex.org/W1997365059,"The Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) belongs to the cold-shock domain protein superfamily, one of the most evolutionarily conserved nucleic acid-binding proteins currently known. YB-1 performs a wide variety of cellular functions, including transcriptional and translational regulation, DNA repair, drug resistance, and stress responses to extracellular signals. Inasmuch as the level of YB-1 drastically increases in tumor cells, this protein is considered to be one of the most indicative markers of malignant tumors. Here, we present evidence that ΔNp63α, the predominant p63 protein isoform in squamous epithelia and YB-1, can physically interact. Into the nucleus, ΔNp63α and YB-1 cooperate in PI3KCA gene promoter activation. Moreover, ΔNp63α promotes YB-1 nuclear accumulation thereby reducing the amount of YB-1 bound to its target transcripts such as that encoding the SNAIL1 protein. Accordingly, ΔNp63α enforced expression was associated with a reduction of the level of SNAIL1, a potent inducer of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, ΔNp63α depletion causes morphological change and enhanced formation of actin stress fibers in squamous cancer cells. Mechanistic studies indicate that ΔNp63α affects cell movement and can reverse the increase of cell motility induced by YB-1 overexpression. These data thus suggest that ΔNp63α provides inhibitory signals for cell motility. Deficiency of ΔNp63α gene expression promotes cell mobilization, at least partially, through a YB-1-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2029828913,"Background Corals, like many other marine invertebrates, lack a mature allorecognition system in early life history stages. Indeed, in early ontogeny, when corals acquire and establish associations with various surface microbiota and dinoflagellate endosymbionts, they do not efficiently distinguish between closely and distantly related individuals from the same population. However, very little is known about the molecular components that underpin allorecognition and immunity responses or how they change through early ontogeny in corals. Methodology/Principal Findings Patterns in the expression of four putative immune response genes (apextrin, complement C3, and two CELIII type lectin genes) were examined in juvenile colonies of Acropora millepora throughout a six-month post-settlement period using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Expression of a CELIII type lectin gene peaked in the fourth month for most of the coral juveniles sampled and was significantly higher at this time than at any other sampling time during the six months following settlement. The timing of this increase in expression levels of putative immune response genes may be linked to allorecognition maturation which occurs around this time in A.millepora. Alternatively, the increase may represent a response to immune challenges, such as would be involved in the recognition of symbionts (such as Symbiodinium spp. or bacteria) during winnowing processes as symbioses are fine-tuned. Conclusions/Significance Our data, although preliminary, are consistent with the hypothesis that lectins may play an important role in the maturation of allorecognition responses in corals. The co-expression of lectins with apextrin during development of coral juveniles also raises the possibility that these proteins, which are components of innate immunity in other invertebrates, may influence the innate immune systems of corals through a common pathway or system. However, further studies investigating the expression of these genes in alloimmune-challenged corals are needed to further clarify emerging evidence of a complex innate immunity system in corals."

We previously further showed that an exogenous global regulator IrrE (derived from the extreme radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans) can be tailored to confer Escherichia coli (E. coli) with significantly enhanced tolerances to different stresses. In this work, based on comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the representative strains E1 and E0, harboring the ethanol-tolerant IrrE mutant E1 and the ethanol-intolerant wild type IrrE, respectively, we found that the transcriptome and proteome of E. coli were extensively rewired by the tailored IrrE protein. Overall, 1196 genes (or approximately 27% of E. coli genes) were significantly altered at the transcriptomic level, including notably genes in the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide (NO) pathway, and genes for non-coding RNAs. The proteomic profile revealed significant up- or downregulation of several proteins associated with syntheses of the cell membrane and cell wall. Analyses of the intracellular NO level and cell growth under reduced temperature supported a close correlation between NO and ethanol tolerance, and also suggests a role for membrane fluidity. The significantly different omic profiles of strain E1 indicate that IrrE functions as a global regulator in E. coli, and that IrrE may be evolved for other cellular tolerances. In this sense, it will provide synthetic biology with a practical and evolvable regulatory ""part"" that operates at a higher level of complexity than local regulators. This work also suggests a possibility of introducing and engineering other exogenous global regulators to rewire the genomes of microorganism cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059528808,"The Campylobacter jejuni capsule is important for colonization and virulence in various infection models. In most strains, the capsule includes a modified heptose whose biological role and biosynthetic pathway are unknown. To decipher the biosynthesis pathway for the 6-deoxy-D-altro-heptose of strain 81-176, we previously showed that the 4,6-dehydratase WcbK and the reductase WcaG generated GDP-6-deoxy-D-manno-heptose, but the C3 epimerase necessary to form GDP-6-deoxy-D-altro-heptose was not identified. Herein, we characterized the putative C3/C5 epimerase Cjj1430 and C3/C5 epimerase/C4 reductase Cjj1427 from the capsular cluster. We demonstrate that GDP-6-deoxy-D-altro-heptose biosynthesis is more complex than anticipated and requires the sequential action of WcbK, Cjj1430, and Cjj1427. We show that Cjj1430 serves as C3 epimerase devoid of C5 epimerization activity and that Cjj1427 has no epimerization activity and only serves as a reductase to produce GDP-6-deoxy-D-altro-heptose. Cjj1430 and Cjj1427 are the only members of the C3/C5 epimerases and C3/C5 epimerase/C4 reductase families shown to have activity on a heptose substrate and to exhibit only one of their two to three potential activities, respectively. Furthermore, we show that although the reductase WcaG is not part of the main pathway, its presence and its product affect the outcome of the pathway in a complex regulatory loop involving Cjj1427. This work provides the grounds for the elucidation of similar pathways found in other C. jejuni strains and other pathogens. It provides new molecular tools for the synthesis of carbohydrate antigens useful for vaccination and for the screening of enzymatic inhibitors that may have antibacterial effects."
https://openalex.org/W2082264836,"Examination of the response of the retinal proteome to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and to the pharmacological normalization of IOP is crucial, in order to develop drugs with neuroptorective potential. We used a hereditary rat model of ocular hypertension to lower IOP with travaprost and dorzolamide applied topically on the eye surface, and examine changes of the retinal proteome. Our data demonstrate that elevated IOP causes alterations in the retinal protein profile, in particular in high-mobility-group-protein B1 (HMGB1), calmodulin, heat-shock-protein (HSP) 70 and carbonic anhydrase II expression. The changes of the retinal proteome by dorzolamide or travoprost are different and independent of the IOP lowering effect. This fact suggests that the eye drops exert a direct IOP-independent effect on retinal metabolism. Further investigations are required to elucidate the potential neuroprotective mechanisms signaled through changes of HMGB1, calmodulin, HSP70 and carbonic anhydrase II expression in glaucoma. The data may facilitate development of eye drops that exert neuroprotection through direct pharmacological effect."
https://openalex.org/W2154840078,"To systematically identify novel gene functions essential for osteogenesis and skeletal mineralization, we performed a forward genetic mutagenesis screen in zebrafish and isolated a mutant that showed delayed skeletal mineralization. Analysis of the mutant phenotype in an osterix:nuclear-GFP transgenic background demonstrated that mutants contain osterix-expressing osteoblasts comparable to wild-type embryos. Positional cloning revealed a premature stop mutation in the macrophage-stimulating protein (msp) gene, predicted to result in a biologically inactive protein. Analysis of the embryonic expression pattern for the receptor for Msp, Ron, shows specific expression in the corpuscles of Stannius, a teleost-specific organ that produces stanniocalcin, a pivotal hormone in fish calcium homeostasis. Knockdown of Ron resulted in identical phenotypes as observed in msp mutants. Msp mutant embryos could be rescued by excess calcium. Consistent with a role for Msp/Ron in calcium homeostasis, calcium-regulating factors, such as pth1, pth2, stc1l, and trpv5/6 were significantly affected in msp mutant larvae. While Msp and Ron have previously been shown to play a critical role in a wide variety of biological processes, we introduce here the Msp/Ron signaling axis as a previously unappreciated player in calcium homeostasis and embryonic skeletal mineralization."

The longleaf pine savanna of the southeastern United States is a threatened and diverse system where seedling recruitment success and understory species richness levels are regulated by the availability of moist microsites. We hypothesized that the dominant bunch grass species (Aristida stricta Michx.) would facilitate moist seedling microsites through shading, but that the effect would depend on stress gradients. Here, we examined the environmental properties modified by the presence of wiregrass and tested the importance of increased shade as a potential facilitative mechanism promoting seedling recruitment across spatial and temporal stress gradients. We showed that environmental gradients, season, and experimental water manipulation influence seedling success. Environmental properties were modified by wiregrass proximity in a manner that could facilitate seedling success, but we showed that shade alone does not provide a facilitative benefit to seedlings in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1980284897,"Mechanisms that regulate proliferation and expansion of human hematopoietic stem/multipotent progenitor cells (HSC/MPPs) are targets of intensive investigations. Several cell intrinsic factors and signaling pathways have been implicated in the proliferation and differentiation of human HSC/MPPs. Nevertheless, expansion of human HSC/MPPs for clinical application remains a critical challenge. VentX is a human homeobox transcription factor that was recently identified as an anti-proliferation and pro-differentiation factor in human hematopoietic cells. Here, we report that VentX expression is up-regulated during ontogenesis of human hematopoietic cells. Strikingly, suppression of VentX expression led to significant expansion of HSC/MPPs ex vivo and a 20-fold increase in engraftment potential in the NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ2(null) mouse model. VentX suppression helped preserve the HSC/MPP pools and promote clonogenicity of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Mechanistically, we show that VentX regulates critical cell cycle regulators and Wnt downstream genes previously implicated in HSC/MPP proliferation and expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2030855232,"Background Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE) are responsible for substantial mortality, morbidity, and impaired health-related quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlates of in-hospital deaths among hospitalizations with a diagnosis of PE in the United States. Methods By using data from the 2001−2008 National Hospital Discharge Survey, we assessed the correlates of in-hospital deaths among 14,721 hospitalizations with a diagnosis of PE and among subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, days of hospital stay, type of admission, cancer, pneumonia, and fractures. We produced adjusted rate ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals using log-linear multivariate regression models. Results Regardless of the listing position of diagnostic codes, we observed an increased likelihood of in-hospital death in subgroups of hospitalizations with ages 50 years and older (aRR = 1.82−8.48), less than 7 days of hospital stay (aRR = 1.43−1.57), cancer (aRR = 2.10−2.28), pneumonia (aRR = 1.79−2.20), or fractures (aRR = 2.18) (except for first-listed PE), when compared to the reference groups with ages 1−49 years, 7 days or more of hospital stay, without cancer, pneumonia, or fractures while adjusting for covariates. In addition, we observed an increased likelihood of in-hospital death for first-listed PE in hospitalizations of women, when compared to those of men (aRR = 1.45). Conclusions The results of this study provide support for identifying, developing, and implementing effective, evidence-based clinical assessment and management strategies to reduce PE-related morbidity and mortality among hospitalized PE patients who may have concurrent health conditions including cancer, pneumonia, and fractures."

In addition, the Notch pathway plays an important role in controlling tumorigenesis. However, the role of RBPJ, a transcription factor in the Notch pathway, in the development of tumors is largely unknown. In this study, we focused on the role of RBPJ in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Our data showed that Notch pathway genes were upregulated and activated in human RMS cell lines and patient samples. Inhibition of the Notch pathway by a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) decreased the in vitro proliferation of RMS cells. Knockdown of RBPJ expression by RNAi inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of RMS cells and the growth of xenografts in vivo. Additionally, overexpression of RBPJ promoted the anchorage-independent growth of RMS cells. Further, we revealed that RBPJ regulated the cell cycle in RMS xenograft tumors and decreased proliferation. Our findings suggest that RBPJ regulates the RMS growth, and that the inhibition of RBPJ may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with RMS."
https://openalex.org/W2081151265,"As variance from standard phospholipids of eubacteria and eukaryotes, archaebacterial diether phospholipids contain branched alcohol chains (phytanol) linked to glycerol exclusively with ether bonds. Giant vesicles (GVs) constituted of different species of archaebacterial diether phospholipids and glycolipids (archaeosomes) were prepared by electroformation and observed under a phase contrast and/or fluorescence microscope. Archaebacterial lipids and different mixtures of archaebacterial and standard lipids formed GVs which were analysed for size, yield and ability to adhere to each other due to the mediating effects of certain plasma proteins. GVs constituted of different proportions of archaeal or standard phosphatidylcholine were compared. In nonarchaebacterial GVs (in form of multilamellar lipid vesicles, MLVs) the main transition was detected at Tm = 34. 2°C with an enthalpy of ΔH = 0.68 kcal/mol, whereas in archaebacterial GVs (MLVs) we did not observe the main phase transition in the range between 10 and 70°C. GVs constituted of archaebacterial lipids were subject to attractive interaction mediated by beta 2 glycoprotein I and by heparin. The adhesion constant of beta 2 glycoprotein I – mediated adhesion determined from adhesion angle between adhered GVs was in the range of 10−8 J/m2. In the course of protein mediated adhesion, lateral segregation of the membrane components and presence of thin tubular membranous structures were observed. The ability of archaebacterial diether lipids to combine with standard lipids in bilayers and their compatibility with adhesion-mediating molecules offer further evidence that archaebacterial lipids are appropriate for the design of drug carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2093748574,"Background Women with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) at cervical cancer screening are currently referred for further diagnostic work up despite 80% having no precancerous lesion. The primary purpose of this study is to measure the test characteristics of 3q26 chromosome gain (3q26 gain) as a host marker of carcinogenesis in women with LSIL. A negative triage test may allow these women to be followed by cytology alone without immediate referral to colposcopy. Methods and Findings A historical prospective study was designed to measure 3q26 gain from the archived liquid cytology specimens diagnosed as LSIL among women attending colposcopy between 2007 and 2009. 3q26 gain was assessed on the index liquid sample; and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were measured at immediate triage and at 6–16 months after colposcopic biopsy. The sensitivity of 3q26 gain measured at immediate triage from automated and manually reviewed tests in 65 non-pregnant unique women was 70% (95% CI: 35, 93) with a NPV of 89% (95% CI: 78, 96). The sensitivity and NPV increased to 80% (95% CI: 28, 99) and 98% (95% CI: 87, 100), respectively, when only the automated method of detecting 3q26 gain was used. Conclusions 3q26 gain demonstrates high sensitivity and NPV as a negative triage test for women with LSIL, allowing possible guideline changes to routine surveillance instead of immediate colposcopy. Prospective studies are ongoing to establish the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 3q26 gain for LSIL over time."

Cell motility is driven by assembling actin as polymerizing actin drives cell protrusions in a process closely involving a host of other actin-binding proteins, notably the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, which nucleates actin and forms branched filamentous structures. The Arp2/3 complex preferentially binds specific actin networks at the cell leading edge and forms branched filamentous structures, which drive cell protrusions, but the exact regulatory mechanism behind this process is not well understood. Here we show using in vitro imaging and binding assays that a fragment of the actin-binding protein caldesmon added to polymerizing actin increases the Arp2/3-mediated branching activity, whereas it has no effect on branch formation when binding to aged actin filaments. Because this caldesmon effect is shown to be independent of nucleotide hydrolysis and phosphate release from actin, our results suggest a mechanism by which caldesmon maintains newly polymerized actin in a distinct state that has a higher affinity for the Arp2/3 complex. Our data show that this new state does not affect the level of cooperativity of binding by Arp2/3 complex or its distribution on actin.

This presents a novel regulatory mechanism by which caldesmon, and potentially other actin-binding proteins, regulates the interactions of actin with its binding partners. The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that regulates numerous important cellular events (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cellular motility driven by assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). A plethora of actin-binding proteins participates in this dynamic process, among which several modulate the stability of actin filaments and their interaction with myosin motors by binding along the sides of actin filaments, thereby controlling actin cytoskeleton assembly and dynamics (2Bretscher A.

We found that CaD or its C-terminal actin-binding fragment, when present before, but not after, the structural transition, inhibits the maturation process and arrests the filament at the pretransitional state (9Huang R.

New aspects of the spontaneous polymerization of actin in the presence of salts.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but because the “immature” (or “nascent”) state is transient and not well characterized, its significance remains controversial. CaD-stabilized nascent actin filaments had a rather long lifetime on the order of hours and could therefore be subjected to further characterization. These filaments appeared irregular and rough when imaged with negative staining electron microscopy (10Collins A. Huang R. Jensen M.H. Moore J.R. Lehman W. Wang C.L. Structural studies on maturing actin filaments.BioArchitecture. 2011; 1: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The unusual morphology raised the possibility that nascent actin filaments might bind certain accessory proteins more easily and thus be more amenable to remodeling. In this work, we tested this possibility and found that the CaD-bound actin filaments had a higher affinity for the Arp2/3 complex and exhibited a higher branching activity if CaD was added during actin polymerization. If, however, CaD was added to prepolymerized (“mature”) filaments, no effect on Arp2/3-induced branching was observed, suggesting that only the CaD-stabilized nascent actin filament had an increased affinity for the Arp2/3 complex. The Arp2/3 complex exhibited little or no cooperativity when binding to either nascent or mature filaments. There also appeared to be no particular regions on the mother filaments that the Arp2/3 complex preferred to bind, suggesting that these filaments do not have internal structural heterogeneity. These results are discussed as a novel nucleotide-independent regulatory mechanism in which the state of the actin regulates the affinity for Arp2/3 complex and in which CaD acts as an age marker able to extend the lifetime of the nascent actin state by binding to newly polymerized actin filaments.

His6-tagged D3D4 was purified using a similar procedure as for H32K.

In the first step, Alexa Fluor 488 actin was polymerized at 1.5 μm in 25 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol either with or without phosphorylated H32K (pH32K) at a 1:3 molar ratio to actin for 3 h to ensure attainment of steady-state conditions. Filaments prepared in the absence of the CaD fragment were used for control experiments. In the second step, a sample was prepared immediately before imaging by mixing rhodamine G-actin (final concentration 500 nm), Arp2/3 complex (final concentration 300 nm), Alexa Fluor 488 actin drawn from the prepolymerized stock (final concentration 15 nm), and additional pH32K to maintain a constant CaD:actin molar ratio of 1:3. The constituents were mixed in an actin polymerization buffer, identical to the buffer previously used in total internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy (10Collins A. Huang R. Jensen M.H. Moore J.R. Lehman W. Wang C.L. Structural studies on maturing actin filaments.BioArchitecture. 2011; 1: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The sample was then immediately loaded into a flow chamber, which was assembled and incubated with bovine serum albumin, as was done previously for total internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy (10Collins A. Huang R. Jensen M.H. Moore J.R. Lehman W. Wang C.L. Structural studies on maturing actin filaments.BioArchitecture. 2011; 1: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Controls were performed in which Arp2/3 complex or pH32K was absent or in which pH32K was added before imaging but not during the prepolymerization of the Alexa Fluor 488 actin. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope, a 100×/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, a 488 nm argon ion laser, and a 543 nm helium neon laser, captured at random locations on the flow cell surface within 11 min of sample mixing. Analysis was performed using ImageJ software (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). Contrast was enhanced by 0.4%, and a Gaussian filter with σ = 0.025 μm was applied to the original images to reduce noise. Rhodamine-actin growing on Alexa Fluor 488 actin was counted as branching under the criteria that: (a) it formed a 70 ± 10° angle with the Alexa Fluor 488 actin (22Amann K.J. Pollard T.D.

In addition to the density of branching, the distribution of branches (their relative separations, distances to mother filament ends, and the number of branches on each mother filament) was also noted. Bundled actin was omitted from all analyses. The observed numbers of branches and mother filament length distributions from fluorescence microscopy imaging were fed into a custom-written MATLAB Monte Carlo simulation (MathWorks, Natick MA). To establish the distributions of branches for random Arp2/3 binding, the program randomly placed branches on the filaments and recorded the resulting distributions corresponding to each particular distribution of mother filament lengths. A total of 280 branches and 613 separate mother filaments were measured and input into the simulation for pH32K-stabilized nascent actin, whereas 276 branches and 985 filaments were measured and input for plain actin. The simulation was repeated until the distributions converged, which occurred after 100,000 iterations. To determine the binding of the Arp2/3 complex to actin filaments by co-sedimentation assays, varying amounts of Arp2/3 complex were incubated with rabbit skeletal actin filaments (1.5 μm) polymerized with pH32K (0.5 μm) or the phospho-mimicking mutant, D3D4 (0.5 μm), added at either the beginning (t = 0 min) or the end (t = 240 min) of polymerization. The mixtures were centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet fractions were reacted with monoclonal anti-Arp2 antibody (Sigma) followed by reaction with IRDye800-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from donkey (Rockland Immunochemicals). To investigate the dynamic properties of actin filaments before and after maturation as well as their interaction with Arp2/3 complex, we have visualized actin filament assembly using fluorescently labeled actin of two different colors similarly to previous studies (20Ichetovkin I. Grant W. Condeelis J. Cofilin produces newly polymerized actin filaments that are preferred for dendritic nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 79-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 21Amann K.J. Pollard T.D. The Arp2/3 complex nucleates actin filament branches from the sides of pre-existing filaments.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), except that CaD was added to interfere with the maturation process. An Erk-phosphorylated CaD fragment pH32K was used for this purpose. The use of phosphorylated H32K minimized the problem of actin bundling, which is promoted by unphosphorylated CaD (24Arias M.P. Pacaud M. Macrophage caldesmon is an actin-bundling protein.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12974-12982Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For direct imaging of actin assembly in the presence of Arp2/3 complex, rabbit skeletal actin, labeled with the green fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488, was first polymerized either with or without pH32K at a 1:3 molar ratio to actin for 3 h to ensure attainment of steady-state conditions. Immediately before imaging, a fraction of this prepolymerized actin was mixed with rhodamine G-actin, Arp2/3 complex, and additional pH32K (to maintain a constant CaD:actin molar ratio of 1:3). Samples without pH32K added at this stage were used as a control. The mixture was then loaded into a flow chamber for imaging. Two-color fluorescence confocal microscopy imaging of actin assembly was carried out while rhodamine-actin was assembling (Fig. 1) until the field of view became too crowded with polymerized actin, which generally occurred about 10 min after sample mixing. To quantify the effects of pH32K on Arp2/3 complex-mediated branching, rhodamine-actin (red) branches originating from prepolymerized Alexa Fluor 488 actin mother filaments (green) were counted. Although considerable branching off of newly polymerized red mother filaments was also observed (20Ichetovkin I. Grant W. Condeelis J. Cofilin produces newly polymerized actin filaments that are preferred for dendritic nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 79-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we only considered branching on prepolymerized green F-actin, as the lengths of these were constant during the experiment and as we could control their age and interaction with pH32K during the prepolymerization step. The level of branching was quantified as the number of red branches per unit length of green filaments polymerized either in the presence or in the absence of pH32K. As compared with the branching activity in the absence of pH32K, we observed a 2-fold increase in dendritic branching density on Alexa Fluor 488 actin filaments prepolymerized in the presence of pH32K (Fig. 2). However, when pH32K was instead added right before imaging at a ratio of 1:3 to Alexa Fluor 488 actin filaments prepolymerized in the absence of pH32K, the level of branching was indistinguishable from the CaD-free control.FIGURE 2Actin polymerized with pH32K showed increased branching induced by Arp2/3 complex under fluorescence microscopy.

Zhang Q. Janmey P.A. Thomas D.D. Cooperativity in F-actin: binding of gelsolin at the barbed end affects structure and dynamics of the whole filament.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 756-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that actin polymerized with pH32K more readily forms Arp2/3-induced branches (Fig. 2), the branching density alone is insufficient to determine whether the increased branching arose from a change in affinity only or from a change in cooperativity of the Arp2/3 complex binding to actin. If the degree of cooperativity was altered, we would expect to see a difference in the distribution of branches on the Alexa Fluor 488 actin, evident either as clusters of branches on the Alexa Fluor 488 actin or as a few Alexa Fluor 488 actin filaments with a high density of branches, thus increasing the overall average branching density. To determine whether the additional branch formation resulted from changes in cooperative binding, we compared the cooperativity of branching activity between pH32K-stabilized nascent actin filaments and actin alone in two ways. First, we counted the number of branches per filament to see whether a few filaments with many branches were responsible for the increased branching density observed when actin was polymerized with pH32K. Most mother filaments with branches had only one branch, whereas fewer filaments had multiple branches per filament (Fig. 3). Furthermore, polymerizing actin with pH32K had no discernible effect on this distribution, suggesting that the increased branching density did not originate from a few filaments with a disproportionally high number of branches. Because the exact distributions depended on the length distributions of mother filaments in each experiment, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation to generate the distribution of Arp2/3-induced branches representing random, noncooperative binding of the Arp2/3 complex. As noted in Fig. 3, the observed distributions hardly differed from this random distribution, suggesting that Arp2/3 complex exhibits little cooperativity in binding to actin both with and without pH32K present. Secondly, we quantified the distance between adjacent Arp2/3 branches to look for clusters of branches (Fig. 4). As above, the observed distributions were compared with a simulation-generated random distribution, each of which was specific to the particular filament lengths observed. Because a polymer in dynamic equilibrium, such as actin, tends to have an exponential length distribution with more short filaments and fewer long ones, the simulated random distribution is not even across all mother filament lengths. This disproportionate abundance of shorter filaments in turn makes randomly placed branch points more likely to be more closely spaced, explaining the asymmetric shape of the simulated data in Fig. 4. Importantly, when comparing the simulated and measured distributions, no marked differences were evident, suggesting that neither the actin polymerized with pH32K nor the plain pH32K-free actin produces more regions with closely spaced branches than would be expected from a random distribution. Taken together, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 indicate that although pH32K-stabilized nascent actin has a higher density of branches (Fig. 2), it induces no marked differences in the distribution of branches. Thus, the increased branching was not the result of a CaD-induced alteration in binding cooperativity, but rather a uniform increase in the affinity of Arp2/3 complex for actin. We also compared the relative locations of branches to their mother filament barbed end. As noted for Fig. 4, the simulated random distribution is skewed toward shorter distances due to the uneven length of actin mother filaments. We observed little difference in the distribution of branches along the mother filament as compared with a simulated random distribution of branches for both pH32K-stabilized nascent actin and mature actin filaments (Fig. 5). This was expected as all mother filaments were either fully nascent or mature and thus had no internal heterogeneity. Although the barbed end of growing actin consists of an ATP-actin or ADP-Pi-actin cap, which has been noted to exhibit a higher affinity for the Arp2/3 complex (20Ichetovkin I. Grant W. Condeelis J. Cofilin produces newly polymerized actin filaments that are preferred for dendritic nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 79-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), our mother filaments had no such structural asymmetry and thus did not preferentially form branches along certain regions of the mother filament. It has been reported previously that the Arp2/3 complex preferentially nucleates dendritic branching on newly polymerized actin filaments (20Ichetovkin I. Grant W. Condeelis J. Cofilin produces newly polymerized actin filaments that are preferred for dendritic nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 79-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our observations here demonstrated that CaD added to polymerizing actin preserves the nascent properties of the aged actin filament and maintains its higher affinity for the Arp2/3 complex. Because the state of the actin-bound nucleotide often serves as an aging marker of the filament as actin hydrolyzes ATP to ADP during polymerization with subsequent release of inorganic phosphate, it was thought that the nucleotide state affects the affinity of Arp2/3 complex for actin and results in preferred branching on nascent filaments. However, in our experiments, the increased branching occurs on actin filaments aged on a time scale significantly longer than that of phosphate release from actin (30Carlier M.F. Measurement of Pi dissociation from actin filaments following ATP hydrolysis using a linked enzyme assay.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As has previously been shown, the effect induced by CaD does not involve ATP hydrolysis or phosphate release (9Huang R. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Differential effects of caldesmon on the intermediate conformational states of polymerizing actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), meaning that virtually all Alexa Fluor 488 actin during the imaging assay was already in the ADP state. Interestingly, a transient post-phosphate release intermediate conformation of actin prior to mature ADP-F-actin formation has been detected before (12Bryan K.E. Rubenstein P.A. An intermediate form of ADP-F-actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1696-1703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); such a conformation may be stabilized by CaD. These results suggest that the observed increase of the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branching by pH32K is associated with a mechanism independent of the hydrolysis of actin-bound ATP. To validate the differential affinities of the Arp2/3 complex for the nascent and mature actin filaments, we performed binding studies by co-sedimentation assays. Because the amounts of Arp2/3 used in these experiments were relatively small, quantification was done by immunoblotting. Actin filaments polymerized in the presence or absence of H32K were first incubated with the Arp2/3 complex and were ultracentrifuged; Arp2/3 in the pellet was then allowed to react with anti-Arp2 after serial dilutions. We found that the level of Arp2/3 co-sedimented with actin filaments polymerized in the presence of H32K was higher than that bound to CaD-free F-actin (Fig. 6, inset), indicating stronger binding of Arp2/3 to the H32K-stabilized nascent actin filaments than to the mature CaD-free filaments. These results also established the appropriate concentration ranges for both the Arp2/3 complex and anti-Arp2, in which a linear relationship between the immunoreactivity and the Arp2/3 concentration could be obtained. We then used these concentration ranges in the binding study of Arp2/3 to actin filaments. The immunoreactivity of filament-bound Arp2/3 with anti-Arp2 was further calibrated against a known amount of the Arp2/3 complex. Because Arp2/3-mediated actin branching requires an excess of actin from which to form new branches, it was not feasible to saturate actin with Arp2/3 complex; thus, we did not attempt to determine the actual binding constant. Nevertheless, the amount of Arp2/3 co-sedimented with the H32K-stabilized nascent filaments was consistently higher than that with the H32K-bound mature filaments, indicating that the Arp2/3 complex indeed has a higher affinity for nascent actin filaments than for mature filaments (Fig. 6), in agreement with our direct imaging experiments (Fig. 2). We have also tested a phospho-mimicking mutant of H32K, D3D4, in which the two Ser residues for Erk-mediated phosphorylation are replaced by Asp. Binding of the Arp2/3 complex to the D3D4-stabilized nascent filaments was also stronger than the D3D4-bound mature filaments. In fact, the amount of the Arp2/3 complex co-sedimented with the nascent filament stabilized by D3D4 was 10-fold higher than that with the H32K-bound filaments. This is consistent with the notion that CaD, but not phosphorylated CaD, competes with Arp2/3 for actin binding (31Yamakita Y. Oosawa F. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. Caldesmon inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17937-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It also agrees with the fact that in cells, it is the phosphorylated form of CaD that is present at the leading edge and encounters dynamic actin filaments and the Arp2/3 complex. Besides competing with Arp2/3 for actin binding (31Yamakita Y. Oosawa F. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. Caldesmon inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17937-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), unphosphorylated CaD is also known to bundle actin filaments (24Arias M.P. Pacaud M. Macrophage caldesmon is an actin-bundling protein.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12974-12982Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To check the effect of actin bundling, we have performed low speed centrifugation prior to ultracentrifugation; we found that both pellet fractions contained H32K with similar ratios between H32K and actin, and the differences in the Arp2/3 complex also persisted in both bundled and unbundled actin filaments (data not shown). We therefore ruled out the possibility that CaD-induced bundling of mature F-actin might exclude Arp2/3 binding. Several structural transitions besides that related to the nucleotide state are known for polymerizing actin, which in turn could modulate the affinity of actin-binding proteins for actin. For example, FRET measurements have revealed that individual actin monomers within a filament alternate on a time scale of seconds between structural states that are discernible by myosin (32Kozuka J. Yokota H. Arai Y. Ishii Y. Yanagida T. Dynamic polymorphism of single actin molecules in the actin filament.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); electron microscopy has also shown distinct structural states existing within F-actin (33Egelman E.H. Orlova A. Allostery, cooperativity, and different structural states in F-actin.J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notably, CaD has been found to attenuate pyrene fluorescence enhancement of polymerizing actin without altering the rates of elongation and to prolong the early stage rough appearance of actin filaments under negative staining electron microscopy (9Huang R. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Differential effects of caldesmon on the intermediate conformational states of polymerizing actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Collins A. Huang R. Jensen M.H. Moore J.R. Lehman W. Wang C.L. Structural studies on maturing actin filaments.BioArchitecture. 2011; 1: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because these effects were not seen when CaD was added to aged filaments, it was argued that they correspond to a conformational transition of F-actin occurring naturally during polymerization (9Huang R. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Differential effects of caldesmon on the intermediate conformational states of polymerizing actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It was further suggested that CaD blocks this transition, thus keeping the actin filament in the nascent state. The time scale of this maturation process agrees with the time scale over which we observed the increased branching activity when actin is polymerized with pH32K, supporting the idea that the nascent state of actin filaments stabilized by CaD causes increased dendritic branching by the Arp2/3 complex. Moreover, the maturation process appears to be irreversible (9Huang R. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Differential effects of caldesmon on the intermediate conformational states of polymerizing actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with our observation that pH32K failed to increase dendritic branching by the Arp2/3 complex when added to aged, prepolymerized filaments. Although we do not know of any Arp2/3 interaction sites on CaD, the increased branching could reflect either a direct increase in affinity of the Arp2/3 complex for nascent F-actin or, conversely, an indirect increase in affinity through a nascent actin-induced stabilization of CaD in an alternative Arp2/3 complex binding conformation. Because the in vitro dissociation rate of actin branches by the Arp2/3 complex is too long for any appreciable dissociation to occur during our experiments (34Goley E.D. Welch M.D. The ARP2/3 complex: an actin nucleator comes of age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the increased affinity of Arp2/3 complex for pH32K-decorated nascent actin filaments reflects an increased association rate rather than a decreased dissociation rate. That CaD promotes Arp2/3-mediated branching when present during actin polymerization presents a novel mechanism by which actin assembly and actin interactions with actin-binding proteins can be regulated. The stronger tendency of the Arp2/3 complex to initiate branches from nascent actin filaments than from mature filaments also provides an explanation for the lower than expected binding constant determined by in vitro studies that used actin filaments in the mature state (35Gournier H. Goley E.D. Niederstrasser H. Trinh T. Welch M.D. Reconstitution of human Arp2/3 complex reveals critical roles of individual subunits in complex structure and activity.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1041-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When cells are stimulated to migrate, CaD is phosphorylated and translocated from the cytosol to the cell periphery (36Kordowska J. Hetrick T. Adam L.P. Wang C.L. Phosphorylated l-caldesmon is involved in disassembly of actin stress fibers and postmitotic spreading.Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), including regions of membrane ruffling at the leading edge (37Bretscher A. Lynch W. Identification and localization of immunoreactive forms of caldesmon in smooth and nonmuscle cells: a comparison with the distributions of tropomyosin and α-actinin.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), where the Arp2/3 complex is abundant. The proximity of phosphorylated CaD to high amounts of newly polymerized actin may allow CaD to maintain actin filaments in a state that binds the Arp2/3 complex more readily. Our findings also have a more general implication for actin-binding protein regulation. The state of the actin filament itself could be a determining factor of the affinity of actin-binding proteins for actin. A number of actin-binding proteins (e.g. cofilin) are thought to target actin depending on its nucleotide state (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cellular motility driven by assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). Our work demonstrates that at least one additional mechanism besides the state of the nucleotide on actin should be considered as a filament-aging marker for actin targeting by its partner proteins.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tend to have weak individual effects but, in combination, they have stronger predictive value. Adipokine pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis. We used a candidate pathway approach to investigate 29 functional SNPs in key genes from relevant adipokine pathways in a sample of 1006 men eligible for prostate biopsy. We used stepwise multivariate logistic regression and bootstrapping to develop a multilocus genetic risk score by weighting each risk SNP empirically based on its association with disease. Seven common functional polymorphisms were associated with overall and high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason≥7), whereas three variants were associated with high metastatic-risk prostate cancer (PSA≥20 ng/mL and/or Gleason≥8). The addition of genetic variants to age and PSA improved the predictive accuracy for overall and high-grade prostate cancer, using either the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (P<0.02), the net reclassification improvement (P<0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (P<0.001) measures. These results suggest that functional polymorphisms in adipokine pathways may act individually and cumulatively to affect risk and severity of prostate cancer, supporting the influence of adipokine pathways in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Use of such adipokine multilocus genetic risk score can enhance the predictive value of PSA and age in estimating absolute risk, which supports further evaluation of its clinical significance."

https://openalex.org/W1965893519,"The repression of genes in regions of heterochromatin is known as transcriptional silencing. It occurs in a wide range of organisms and can have importance in adaptation to the environment, developmental changes and disease. The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used for many years to study transcriptional silencing, but until recently no study has been made in relation to ploidy. The aim of this work was to compare transcriptional silencing in haploids and diploids at both telomeres and the hidden mating-type (HM) loci. Transcriptional silencing was assayed, by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) media or by flow cytometry, on strains where a telomere or HM locus was marked. RNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR to confirm that effects were transcriptional. 5-FOA assays and flow cytometry were consistent with transcriptional silencing at telomeres and at HML being reduced as ploidy increases which agreed with conclusions in previous publications. However, QRT-PCR revealed that transcriptional silencing was unaffected by ploidy and thus protein levels were increasing independently of RNA levels. At telomere XI left (XI-L), changes in protein level were strongly influenced by mating-type, whereas at HML mating-type had much less influence. The post-transcriptional effects seen in this study, illustrate the often ignored need to measure RNA levels when assaying transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
