https://openalex.org/W2091517552,"A long-range MYC enhancer is duplicated in human T-ALL and is required for T cell development and NOTCH1-induced leukemogenesis. Efforts to identify and annotate cancer driver genetic lesions have been focused primarily on the analysis of protein-coding genes; however, most genetic abnormalities found in human cancer are located in intergenic regions. Here we identify a new long range–acting MYC enhancer controlled by NOTCH1 that is targeted by recurrent chromosomal duplications in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Together these results identify N-Me as a long-range oncogenic enhancer implicated directly in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and highlight the importance of the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory axis in T cell transformation and as a therapeutic target in T-ALL."

https://openalex.org/W2058144592,Diminished regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle occurs during adulthood. We identified a reduction in the intrinsic capacity of mouse adult satellite cells to contribute to muscle regeneration and repopulation of the niche. Gene expression analysis identified higher expression of JAK-STAT signaling targets in 3-week [corrected] 18-month-old mice [corrected]. Knockdown of Jak2 or Stat3 significantly stimulated symmetric satellite stem cell divisions on cultured myofibers. Genetic knockdown of Jak2 or Stat3 expression in prospectively isolated satellite cells markedly enhanced their ability to repopulate the satellite cell niche after transplantation into regenerating tibialis anterior muscle. Pharmacological inhibition of Jak2 and Stat3 activity similarly stimulated symmetric expansion of satellite cells in vitro and their engraftment in vivo. Intramuscular injection of these drugs resulted in a marked enhancement of muscle repair and force generation after cardiotoxin injury. Together these results reveal age-related intrinsic properties that functionally distinguish satellite cells and suggest a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of muscle-wasting diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2047018308,"In two new reports, STAT3 signaling is shown to be increased in adult muscle satellite cells, and its inhibition improves muscle regeneration. The progressive loss of muscle regenerative capacity with age or disease results in part from a decline in the number and function of satellite cells, the direct cellular contributors to muscle repair1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. However, little is known about the molecular effectors underlying satellite cell impairment and depletion. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), are associated with both age-related and muscle-wasting conditions12,13,14,15. The levels of STAT3, a downstream effector of IL-6, are also elevated with muscle wasting16,17, and STAT3 has been implicated in the regulation of self-renewal and stem cell fate in several tissues18,19,20,21. Here we show that IL-6–activated Stat3 signaling regulates satellite cell behavior, promoting myogenic lineage progression through myogenic differentiation 1 (Myod1) regulation. Conditional ablation of Stat3 in Pax7-expressing satellite cells resulted in their increased expansion during regeneration, but compromised myogenic differentiation prevented the contribution of these cells to regenerating myofibers. In contrast, transient Stat3 inhibition promoted satellite cell expansion and enhanced tissue repair in both aged and dystrophic muscle. The effects of STAT3 inhibition on cell fate and proliferation were conserved in human myoblasts. The results of this study indicate that pharmacological manipulation of STAT3 activity can be used to counteract the functional exhaustion of satellite cells in pathological conditions, thereby maintaining the endogenous regenerative response and ameliorating muscle-wasting diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1998410565,"Background The p value obtained from a significance test provides no information about the magnitude or importance of the underlying phenomenon. Therefore, additional reporting of effect size is often recommended. Effect sizes are theoretically independent from sample size. Yet this may not hold true empirically: non-independence could indicate publication bias. Methods We investigate whether effect size is independent from sample size in psychological research. We randomly sampled 1,000 psychological articles from all areas of psychological research. We extracted p values, effect sizes, and sample sizes of all empirical papers, and calculated the correlation between effect size and sample size, and investigated the distribution of p values. Results We found a negative correlation of r = −.45 [95% CI: −.53; −.35] between effect size and sample size. In addition, we found an inordinately high number of p values just passing the boundary of significance. Additional data showed that neither implicit nor explicit power analysis could account for this pattern of findings. Conclusion The negative correlation between effect size and samples size, and the biased distribution of p values indicate pervasive publication bias in the entire field of psychology."
https://openalex.org/W1977419289,"In this study, the authors describe the subset of activity-regulated enhancers that modulate transcription in cultured neurons and that participate in the regulation of synaptic maturation. In addition, they demonstrate Fos binding to these enhancers is essential for this activity-dependent regulation of transcription. Experience-dependent gene transcription is required for nervous system development and function. However, the DNA regulatory elements that control this program of gene expression are not well defined. Here we characterize the enhancers that function across the genome to mediate activity-dependent transcription in mouse cortical neurons. We find that the subset of enhancers enriched for monomethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me1) and binding of the transcriptional coactivator CREBBP (also called CBP) that shows increased acetylation of histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27ac) after membrane depolarization of cortical neurons functions to regulate activity-dependent transcription. A subset of these enhancers appears to require binding of FOS, which was previously thought to bind primarily to promoters. These findings suggest that FOS functions at enhancers to control activity-dependent gene programs that are critical for nervous system function and provide a resource of functional cis-regulatory elements that may give insight into the genetic variants that contribute to brain development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2078902726,"Crystallographic analysis depicting the interaction of the kinase inhibitor SCH772984 with ERK1/2 reveals a unique binding pocket distinct from off-targets such as haspin and is associated with slow binding kinetics and prolonged inhibitory activity. Activation of the ERK pathway is a hallmark of cancer, and targeting of upstream signaling partners led to the development of approved drugs. Recently, SCH772984 has been shown to be a selective and potent ERK1/2 inhibitor. Here we report the structural mechanism for its remarkable selectivity. In ERK1/2, SCH772984 induces a so-far-unknown binding pocket that accommodates the piperazine-phenyl-pyrimidine decoration. This new binding pocket was created by an inactive conformation of the phosphate-binding loop and an outward tilt of helix αC. In contrast, structure determination of SCH772984 with the off-target haspin and JNK1 revealed two canonical but distinct type I binding modes. Notably, the new binding mode with ERK1/2 was associated with slow binding kinetics in vitro as well as in cell-based assay systems. The described binding mode of SCH772984 with ERK1/2 enables the design of a new type of specific kinase inhibitors with prolonged on-target activity."
https://openalex.org/W2033029602,"Apigenin is a non-toxic natural flavonoid that is abundantly present in common fruits and vegetables. It has been reported that apigenin has various beneficial health effects such as anti-inflammation and chemoprevention. Multiple studies have shown that inflammation is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis, diabetes, sepsis, various liver diseases, and other metabolic diseases. Although it has been long realized that apigenin has anti-inflammatory activities, the underlying functional mechanisms are still not fully understood.In the present study, we examined the effect of apigenin on LPS-induced inflammatory response and further elucidated the potential underlying mechanisms in human THP-1-induced macrophages and mouse J774A.1 macrophages. By using the PrimePCR array, we were able to identify the major target genes regulated by apigenin in LPS-mediated immune response. The results indicated that apigenin significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α through modulating multiple intracellular signaling pathways in macrophages. Apigenin inhibited LPS-induced IL-1β production by inhibiting caspase-1 activation through the disruption of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Apigenin also prevented LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-1β production by reducing the mRNA stability via inhibiting ERK1/2 activation. In addition, apigenin significantly inhibited TNF-α and IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB.Apigenin Inhibits LPS-induced Inflammatory Response through multiple mechanisms in macrophages. These results provided important scientific evidences for the potential application of apigenin as a therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases."

Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the prevailing current reprogramming method affecting the quality of the resulting pluripotent cells. Several parameters have been shown to affect the quality of iPSCs, such as factor stoichiometry (Carey et al., 2011Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Hanna J.H. Faddah D.A. Buganim Y. Kim J. Ganz K. Steine E.J. Cassady J.P. Creyghton M.P. et al.Reprogramming factor stoichiometry influences the epigenetic state and biological properties of induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 588-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), culture condition, and supplements used to derive the cells (Chen et al., 2011Chen J. Liu J. Chen Y. Yang J. Chen J. Liu H. Zhao X. Mo K. Song H. Guo L. et al.Rational optimization of reprogramming culture conditions for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells with ultra-high efficiency and fast kinetics.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For example, by comparing two genetically defined transgenic systems to identify parameters affecting reprogramming, it has been shown that high levels of Oct4 and Klf4, together with low levels of Sox2 and Myc, are favorable with respect to the quality of the iPSCs even though a much lower reprogramming efficiency was observed when compared to high levels of Sox2 and Myc and low levels of Oct4 and Klf4 (Carey et al., 2011Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Hanna J.H. Faddah D.A. Buganim Y. Kim J. Ganz K. Steine E.J. Cassady J.P.

Also, derivation of iPSCs in the absence of serum but in the presence of vitamin C improved the quality of the cells and generated tetraploid complementation-competent iPSCs even when a suboptimal factor stoichiometry was used to induce pluripotency (Esteban and Pei, 2012Esteban M.A. Pei D. Vitamin C improves the quality of somatic cell reprogramming.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 366-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Stadtfeld et al., 2012Stadtfeld M. Apostolou E. Ferrari F. Choi J. Walsh R.M. Chen T. Ooi S.S. Kim S.Y. Bestor T.H. Shioda T. et al.Ascorbic acid prevents loss of Dlk1-Dio3 imprinting and facilitates generation of all-iPS cell mice from terminally differentiated B cells.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 (S1–S2): 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In summary, the available data suggest that factor stoichiometry, as well as specific culture conditions, affect the quality of iPSCs. Here, we show that the quality of iPSCs is dramatically affected by the specific choice of reprogramming factors. Reprogramming by Sall4, Nanog, Esrrb, and Lin28 (SNEL) generated a very low number of iPSC colonies, the majority of which were of high quality as defined by their capacity to produce healthy “all-iPSC” mice, as determined by 4n complementation, the most stringent test for pluripotency. In stark contrast, OSKM produced a large number of iPSC colonies, the majority of which, using the same assay, exhibited low developmental potential. Removing Myc from the cocktail (OSK) yielded a higher number of high-quality iPSCs, indicating that the present of Myc in the reprogramming factors combination has a negative effect on iPSC quality. Surprisingly, a combination of Oct4, Sox2, Sall4, Nanog, and Esrrb (OSSNE), although lacking potent oncogenes like Myc and Lin28, yielded the highest number of poor quality iPSCs, suggesting that the interplay between the reprogramming factors plays a critical role in the reprogramming process as well. To shed light on the elements that dictate successful reprogramming events, we performed a large number of genomic and epigenomic analyses. While whole genome transcriptional profile, methylome analysis, establishment of superenhancers, or single-cell analysis of key master regulator transcript number and global aneuploidy did not distinguish between poor- and high-quality iPSCs, aberrant expression of 1,765 genes, trisomy of chromosome 8, and abnormal H2A.X deposition were frequently observed in poor-quality iPSCs that were derived by OSKM or OSK. Our results demonstrate that the selection of the reprogramming factor combination is an important determinant for retaining genomic integrity, appropriate transcriptional resetting, and functional pluripotency of iPSCs. Recently, using two complementary single-cell technologies, we have demonstrated that the reprogramming process involves a late hierarchical/deterministic phase that starts with the activation of the Sox2 locus and continues with a series of gene activation events that lead to a stable and transgene-independent pluripotency state (Figure 1A) (Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y.

Order from chaos: single cell reprogramming in two phases.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 445-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a combination of key factors derived from this later phase would reprogram cells in a more controlled manner and potentially would then uniformly yield iPSCs of high quality. We focused mainly on one specific combination of factors, Sall4, Nanog, Esrrb, and Lin28 (SNEL), because we wished to avoid ectopic expression of the key master regulators Oct4 and Sox2. We hypothesized that exogenous expression of strong key master regulators such as Oct4 and Sox2, without their endogenous regulators present in ESCs or during nuclear transfer-mediated reprogramming in the oocyte, might yield aberrant activation of various loci in the somatic cell genome that interfere with normal reprogramming events as is apparent in partially reprogrammed cells (Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y.

Sall4 and Esrrb were chosen based on a Bayesian network analysis prediction that they could activate the endogenous Oct4 and Sox2 genes, respectively. We selected Lin28 because it has been shown to act as a global mRNA regulator (Cho et al., 2012Cho J. Chang H. Kwon S.C. Kim B. Kim Y. Choe J. Ha M. Kim Y.K. Kim V.N.

Nanog-GFP or Oct4-GFP mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were introduced with doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviruses encoding for the SNEL reprogramming factors and cultured until the formation of iPSC colonies. The efficiency of the reprogramming process was very low, producing one to five colonies per 1 × 105 plated cells with a latency that ranged between 14–60 days. In total, we isolated ten SNEL-iPSC colonies (six from Nanog-GFP and four from Oct4-GFP MEFs). The resulting iPSC colonies expressed a bright GFP signal from both the Oct4 and the Nanog locus and showed upregulation of key pluripotency markers such as Sox2, endogenous Sall4, Utf1, and endogenous Esrrb, as assessed by immunostaining (Figure 1B). A comparable mRNA level to OSKM-iPSCs and several ESC lines of Dppa2, Dppa3, endogenous Lin28, and Rex1 was noted as well by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1C). When injected into NOD/SCID mice, the cells formed well-differentiated teratomas with structures from all three germ layers (representative images can be seen in Figure 1D). The potential of SNEL-iPSCs to generate chimeras was tested by injecting cells from all ten clones into host blastocysts that were subsequently transferred into pseudopregnant recipient females. All lines gave rise to chimeras, with 8/10 (80%) generating high-grade chimeras (50%–95%) as assessed by coat color (Figures S1A and S1B available online). Germline transmission was noted in all five tested lines (Figures S1A and S1C). Chimeric mice from one of the iPSC clones (Oct4-GFP SNEL#2) suffered from an eye problem and one adult mouse developed a tumor. However, these isolated events might be explained by leaky expression of Esrrb and Lin28, which have been linked to similar phenotypes (Audo et al., 2012Audo I. Bujakowska K.M. Léveillard T.

All other chimeras generated from independent clones grew to old age without any obvious evidence of tumorigenicity (Figure S1C). To stringently compare the developmental potential of SNEL and OSKM-derived iPSCs, we performed 4n complementation assay. Utilizing identical infection and culture conditions as used for the derivation of the SNEL-iPSCs, ten iPSC lines were derived by infection of MEFs with OSKM lentiviruses all of which expressed high levels of GFP and pluripotency markers (6/10 of the colonies are presented in Figure 1C). Cells from the ten SNEL-iPSC and ten OSKM-iPSC lines were injected into 4n blastocysts and transferred into pseudopregnant recipient females. The SNEL-iPSCs produced approximately five times as many live 4n pups with the majority surviving postnatally (p = 3.46 × 10−12 by χ2 test) (Figures 2A and 2B ; Table S1) as compared to OKSM-iPSCs. Out of a total of 1,495 OSKM-iPSC-injected blastocysts, only 21 (1.4%) were delivered, 11 (0.7%) of which sustained normal breathing and were foster nursed. In contrast, out of 2,138 blastocysts injected with SNEL iPSCs, 149 (7%) survived to birth, 109 (5%) of which were breathing normally and were fostered nursed (Table S1). In total, ∼40% of the OSKM-iPSC lines gave rise to live pups, compared to 80% of the SNEL-iPSC lines. In general, the adult “all-SNEL-iPSC” mice were healthy and fertile (Figures 2B and S2C), although some mice exhibited some phenotypes that are purely related to leaky expression of Lin28, such as long tail and ears and flattened nose as described in (Zhu et al., 2010Zhu H.

To exploit the maximum potential of the cells and determine whether the developmental differences between these two types of iPSCs would be further exacerbated, we cultured the 20 iPSC lines in 2i medium (LIF, GSK3β, and Mek 1/2 inhibitors containing medium) for two passages and then injected each line into 60 4n blastocysts. The percentage of live-born pups in the SNEL combination was significantly higher, reaching 23%–25% in some SNEL-iPSC lines (Table 1 and Figures S2A and S2B). From a total of 600 OSKM-iPSC-injected blastocysts only 13 (2.1%) were delivered, eight (1.7%) of which sustained normal breathing and were foster nursed. In contrast, out of 600 blastocysts injected with SNEL-iPSCs, 64 (10.7%) survived to birth, 51 (8.5%) of which were breathing normally and were fostered nursed (Table 1). Germline transmission was noted in all examined lines. Simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) analysis for ten randomly selected 4n embryos (PCR-based assay for two loci) confirmed that the embryos were solely derived from the injected iPSCs (Figure 2C). Our data suggest that reprogramming with SNEL, in contrast to reprogramming using OSKM under the same conditions, produces high-quality iPSCs at high rates as assessed by the most stringent test of 4n complementation.Table 1Generation of “All-iPSC” Mice Produced by Various Combinations of Reprogramming FactorsCell LineInjected EmbryosRecipient FemalesImplantation SitesDead Fetuses and PupsaNumber of fetuses found dead in utero and pups found dead at the time of Caesarean section or immediately following natural birth.

To determine whether overexpression of Myc is the cause for the high number of poor quality OSKM-iPSC colonies, we derived ten OSK-iPSC colonies under identical conditions and assessed their quality by 4n complementation. Indeed, a larger number of colonies (8/10 in OSK-iPSC colonies compared to 4/10 in OSKM-iPSC colonies) passed the 4n complementation test. However, a significantly lower number of pups were delivered per line (30 live pups, 5%) in colonies derived from OSK compared to colonies derived from SNEL (64 live pups, 10.7%). These results indicate that Myc is partially responsible for the high number of poor quality colonies in the OSKM combination but suggest that other parameters influence the quality, as well. We then sought to determine whether potent oncogenes are the main reason for the generation of poor quality iPSCs. To test this hypothesis, we isolated 6 colonies, generated by ectopic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Sall4, Nanog, and Esrrb (OSSNE) but without the potent oncogenes Myc and Lin28. Surprisingly, OSSNE combination yielded the highest number of poor quality iPSCs (five live pups, 1.3%), suggesting that the interplay between the reprogramming factors is a crucial element during the reprogramming process. To reveal a gene expression signature associated with developmental competence, we selected the following groups of iPSC lines for microarray analysis: (1) “poor quality” iPSCs: this group included the three OSKM-iPSC lines Nanog-GFP OSKM#2, Oct4-GFP OSKM#2, and KH2 OSKM (Stadtfeld et al., 2010Stadtfeld M.

Cancer-associated KNSTRN mutations, most notably those encoding p.Ser24Phe, disrupt chromatid cohesion in normal cells, occur in SCC precursors, correlate with increased aneuploidy in primary tumors and enhance tumorigenesis in vivo. These findings suggest a role for KNSTRN mutagenesis in SCC development."
https://openalex.org/W2091364606,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are perhaps the most toxic of all DNA lesions, with defects in the DNA-damage response to DSBs being associated with various human diseases. Although it is known that DSB repair pathways are tightly regulated by ubiquitylation, we do not yet have a comprehensive understanding of how deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) function in DSB responses. Here, by carrying out a multidimensional screening strategy for human DUBs, we identify several with hitherto unknown links to DSB repair, the G2/M DNA-damage checkpoint and genome-integrity maintenance. Phylogenetic analyses reveal functional clustering within certain DUB subgroups, suggesting evolutionally conserved functions and/or related modes of action. Furthermore, we establish that the DUB UCHL5 regulates DSB resection and repair by homologous recombination through protecting its interactor, NFRKB, from degradation. Collectively, our findings extend the list of DUBs promoting the maintenance of genome integrity, and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets for cancer. Systematic characterization of deubiquitylating enzymes in the DNA-damage response identifies UCHL5 as promoting DNA-end resection."
https://openalex.org/W2066235091,"Mitochondrial DNA deletions are prominent in human genetic disorders, cancer, and aging. It is thought that stalling of the mitochondrial replication machinery during DNA synthesis is a prominent source of mitochondrial genome instability; however, the precise molecular determinants of defective mitochondrial replication are not well understood. In this work, we performed a computational analysis of the human mitochondrial genome using the ""Pattern Finder"" G-quadruplex (G4) predictor algorithm to assess whether G4-forming sequences reside in close proximity (within 20 base pairs) to known mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints. We then used this information to map G4P sequences with deletions characteristic of representative mitochondrial genetic disorders and also those identified in various cancers and aging. Circular dichroism and UV spectral analysis demonstrated that mitochondrial G-rich sequences near deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplex DNA structures. A biochemical analysis of purified recombinant human Twinkle protein (gene product of c10orf2) showed that the mitochondrial replicative helicase inefficiently unwinds well characterized intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA substrates, as well as a unimolecular G4 substrate derived from a mitochondrial sequence that nests a deletion breakpoint described in human renal cell carcinoma. Although G4 has been implicated in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, our current findings suggest that mitochondrial G-quadruplexes are also likely to be a source of instability for the mitochondrial genome by perturbing the normal progression of the mitochondrial replication machinery, including DNA unwinding by Twinkle helicase."
https://openalex.org/W2062791268,"Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis and an important cause of foodborne disease. Despite their public health significance, routine detection of HuNoV in community settings, or food and environmental samples, is limited, and there is a need to develop alternative HuNoV diagnostic reagents to complement existing ones. The purpose of this study was to select and characterize single-stranded (ss)DNA aptamers with binding affinity to HuNoV. The utility of these aptamers was demonstrated in their use for capture and detection of HuNoV in outbreak-derived fecal samples and a representative food matrix. SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) was used to isolate ssDNA aptamer sequences with broad reactivity to the prototype GII.2 HuNoV strain, Snow Mountain Virus (SMV). Four aptamer candidates (designated 19, 21, 25 and 26) were identified and screened for binding affinity to 14 different virus-like particles (VLPs) corresponding to various GI and GII HuNoV strains using an Enzyme-Linked Aptamer Sorbant Assay (ELASA). Collectively, aptamers 21 and 25 showed affinity to 13 of the 14 VLPs tested, with strongest binding to GII.2 (SMV) and GII.4 VLPs. Aptamer 25 was chosen for further study. Its binding affinity to SMV-VLPs was equivalent to that of a commercial antibody within a range of 1 to 5 µg/ml. Aptamer 25 also showed binding to representative HuNoV strains present in stool specimens obtained from naturally infected individuals. Lastly, an aptamer magnetic capture (AMC) method using aptamer 25 coupled with RT-qPCR was developed for recovery and detection of HuNoV in artificially contaminated lettuce. The capture efficiency of the AMC was 2.5–36% with an assay detection limit of 10 RNA copies per lettuce sample. These ssDNA aptamer candidates show promise as broadly reactive reagents for use in HuNoV capture and detection assays in various sample types."

Five populations of archaeological peach stones recovered from Zhejiang Province, China, document peach use and evolution beginning ca. 8000 BP. The majority of the archaeological sites from which the earliest peach stones have been recovered are from the Yangzi River valley, indicating that this is where early selection for favorable peach varieties likely took place. Furthermore, peach stone morphology through time is consistent with the hypothesis that an unknown wild P. persica was the ancestor of the cultivated peach. The oldest archaeological peach stones are from the Kuahuqiao (8000–7000 BP) and Tianluoshan (7000–6500 BP) sites and both stone samples segregate into two size groups, suggesting early selection of preferred types. The first peach stones in China most similar to modern cultivated forms are from the Liangzhu culture (ca. 5300 to 4300 BP), where the peach stones are significantly larger and more compressed than earlier stones. Similar peach stones are reported from Japan much earlier (6700–6400 BP). This large, compressed-stone peach was introduced to Japan and indicates a yet unidentified source population in China that was similar to the Liangzhu culture peach. This study proposes that the lower Yangzi River valley is a region, if not the region, of early peach selection and domestication and that the process began at least 7500 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W1980345684,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored neurotoxin-like receptor binding proteins, such as lynx modulators, are topologically positioned to exert pharmacological effects by binding to the extracellular portion of nAChRs. These actions are generally thought to proceed when both lynx and the nAChRs are on the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that lynx1 also exerts effects on α4β2 nAChRs within the endoplasmic reticulum. Lynx1 affects assembly of nascent α4 and β2 subunits and alters the stoichiometry of the receptor population that reaches the plasma membrane. Additionally, these data suggest that lynx1 shifts nAChR stoichiometry to low sensitivity (α4)3(β2)2 pentamers primarily through this interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum, rather than solely via direct modulation of activity on the plasma membrane. To our knowledge, these data represent the first test of the hypothesis that a lynx family member, or indeed any glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, could act within the cell to alter assembly of a multisubunit protein."

Here we show that the histone variant H2A.X is a functional marker that can distinguish the developmental potentials of mouse iPSC lines. We found that H2A.X is specifically targeted to and negatively regulates extraembryonic lineage gene expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and prevents trophectoderm lineage differentiation. ESC-specific H2A.X deposition patterns are faithfully recapitulated in iPSCs that support the development of “all-iPS” animals via tetraploid complementation, the most stringent test available of iPSC quality. In contrast, iPSCs that fail to support all-iPS embryonic development show aberrant H2A.X deposition, upregulation of extraembryonic lineage genes, and a predisposition to extraembryonic differentiation. Thus, our work has highlighted an epigenetic mechanism for maintaining cell lineage commitment in ESCs and iPSCs that can be used to distinguish the quality of iPSC lines."
https://openalex.org/W2066680692,"IFNβ is a common therapeutic option to treat multiple sclerosis. It is unique among the family of type I IFNs in that it binds to the interferon receptors with high affinity, conferring exceptional biological properties. We have previously reported the generation of an interferon superagonist (dubbed YNSα8) that is built on the backbone of a low affinity IFNα but modified to exhibit higher receptor affinity than even for IFNβ. Here, YNSα8 was fused with a 600-residue hydrophilic, unstructured N-terminal polypeptide chain comprising proline, alanine, and serine (PAS) to prolong its plasma half-life via ""PASylation."" PAS-YNSα8 exhibited a 10-fold increased half-life in both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assays in a transgenic mouse model harboring the human receptors, notably without any detectable loss in biological potency or bioavailability. This long-lived superagonist conferred significantly improved protection from MOG35-55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared with IFNβ, despite being injected with a 4-fold less frequency and at an overall 16-fold lower dosage. These data were corroborated by FACS measurements showing a decrease of CD11b(+)/CD45(hi) myeloid lineage cells detectable in the CNS, as well as a decrease in IBA(+) cells in spinal cord sections determined by immunohistochemistry for PAS-YNSα8-treated animals. Importantly, PAS-YNSα8 did not induce antibodies upon repeated administration, and its biological efficacy remained unchanged after 21 days of treatment. A striking correlation between increased levels of CD274 (PD-L1) transcripts from spleen-derived CD4(+) cells and improved clinical response to autoimmune encephalomyelitis was observed, indicating that, at least in this mouse model of multiple sclerosis, CD274 may serve as a biomarker to predict the effectiveness of IFN therapy to treat this complex disease."
https://openalex.org/W1970420299,"Protein S-nitrosylation, the covalent binding of nitric oxide (NO) to protein cysteine residues, is one of the main mechanisms of NO signaling in plant and animal cells. Using a combination of the biotin switch assay and label-free LC-MS/MS analysis, we revealed the S-nitroso-proteome of the woody model plant Populus x canescens. Under normal conditions, constitutively S-nitrosylated proteins in poplar leaves and calli comprise all aspects of primary and secondary metabolism. Acute ozone fumigation was applied to elicit ROS-mediated changes of the S-nitroso-proteome. This treatment changed the total nitrite and nitrosothiol contents of poplar leaves and affected the homeostasis of 32 S-nitrosylated proteins. Multivariate data analysis revealed that ozone exposure negatively affected the S-nitrosylation status of leaf proteins: 23 proteins were de-nitrosylated and 9 proteins had increased S-nitrosylation content compared to the control. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 2 (log2[ozone/control] = −3.6) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (−3.4), key enzymes catalyzing important steps in the phenylpropanoid and subsequent lignin biosynthetic pathways, respectively, were de-nitrosylated upon ozone stress. Measuring the in vivo and in vitro phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity indicated that the increase of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity in response to acute ozone is partly regulated by de-nitrosylation, which might favor a higher metabolic flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway within minutes after ozone exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2084445633,"Background Recent meta-analyses concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis is not warranted in low-risk laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, most trials in the meta-analyses had a relatively small sample size and were statistically underpowered. In addition, many of the trials mentioned potential cost savings owing to the elimination of prophylactic antibiotics. However, no trial has statistically estimated the cost effectiveness. To evaluate the results of meta-analyses, we conducted a randomized controlled trial on the role of prophylactic antibiotics in low-risk laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an adequate sample size. Methods From March 2007 to May 2013, at the Department of Surgery, Kansai Medical University, patients who were scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to one of two arms: those who were and were not administered prophylactic antibiotics. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative infections and secondary endpoints were postoperative hospital stay and medical costs. Findings During the study period, 518 patients were assigned to the Antibiotics group and 519 to the No antibiotics group. Occurrences of surgical site infections, distant infections and overall infections were significantly lower in the Antibiotics group than in the No antibiotics group (0.8 vs. 3.7%, p = 0.001, OR: 0.205 (95%CI: 0.069 to 0.606); 0.4 vs. 3.1%, p = 0.0004, OR: 0.122 (95%CI: 0.028 to 0.533); 1.2 vs. 6.7%; p<0.0001, OR: 0.162 (95%CI: 0.068 to 0.389), respectively). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the Antibiotics group (mean, SD: 3.69±1.56 vs. 4.07±3.00; p = 0.01) and the postoperative medical costs were significantly lower in the Antibiotics group (mean, SD: $766±341 vs. 832±670; p = 0.047). Multivariable analysis showed that independent risk factors for postoperative infectious complications were no prophylactic antibiotics (p<0.0001) and age 65 or older (p = 0.006). Conclusions Perioperative administration of prophylactic antibiotics should be recommended in laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent postoperative infectious complications and to reduce medical costs.

https://openalex.org/W2053188339,"DNA in the human Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) capsid is packaged to a tight density. This leads to tens of atmospheres of internal pressure responsible for the delivery of the herpes genome into the cell nucleus. In this study we show that, despite its liquid crystalline state inside the capsid, the DNA is fluid-like, which facilitates its ejection into the cell nucleus during infection. We found that the sliding friction between closely packaged DNA strands, caused by interstrand repulsive interactions, is reduced by the ionic environment of epithelial cells and neurons susceptible to herpes infection. However, variations in the ionic conditions corresponding to neuronal activity can restrict DNA mobility in the capsid, making it more solid-like. This can inhibit intranuclear DNA release and interfere with viral replication. In addition, the temperature of the human host (37 °C) induces a disordering transition of the encapsidated herpes genome, which reduces interstrand interactions and provides genome mobility required for infection."
https://openalex.org/W1987427597,"All peripheral membrane proteins must negotiate unique constraints intrinsic to the biological interface of lipid bilayers and the cytosol. Phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) isozymes hydrolyze the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to propagate diverse intracellular responses that underlie the physiological action of many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. PLC-β isozymes are autoinhibited, and several proteins, including Gαq, Gβγ, and Rac1, directly engage distinct regions of these phospholipases to release autoinhibition. To understand this process, we used a novel, soluble analog of PIP2 that increases in fluorescence upon cleavage to monitor phospholipase activity in real time in the absence of membranes or detergents. High concentrations of Gαq or Gβ1γ2 did not activate purified PLC-β3 under these conditions despite their robust capacity to activate PLC-β3 at membranes. In addition, mutants of PLC-β3 with crippled autoinhibition dramatically accelerated the hydrolysis of PIP2 in membranes without an equivalent acceleration in the hydrolysis of the soluble analog.

We demonstrate that the host cell focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was necessary for the invasion by the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia caviae. Bacterial adhesion triggered the transient recruitment of FAK to the plasma membrane to mediate a Cdc42- and Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly. FAK recruitment was via binding to a domain within the virulence factor TarP that mimicked the LD2 motif of the FAK binding partner paxillin. Importantly, bacterial two-hybrid and quantitative imaging assays revealed a similar level of interaction between paxillin-LD2 and TarP-LD. The conserved leucine residues within the L(D/E)XLLXXL motif were essential to the recruitment of FAK, Cdc42, p34(Arc), and actin to the plasma membrane. In the absence of FAK, TarP-LD-mediated F-actin assembly was reduced, highlighting the functional relevance of this interaction. Together, the data indicate that a prokaryotic version of the paxillin LD2 domain targets the FAK signaling pathway, with TarP representing the first example of an LD-containing Type III virulence effector."
https://openalex.org/W2038759777,"The information of the Gene Ontology annotation is helpful in the explanation of life science phenomena, and can provide great support for the research of the biomedical field. The use of the Gene Ontology is gradually affecting the way people store and understand bioinformatic data. To facilitate the prediction of gene functions with the aid of text mining methods and existing resources, we transform it into a multi-label top-down classification problem and develop a method that uses the hierarchical relationships in the Gene Ontology structure to relieve the quantitative imbalance of positive and negative training samples. Meanwhile the method enhances the discriminating ability of classifiers by retaining and highlighting the key training samples. Additionally, the top-down classifier based on a tree structure takes the relationship of target classes into consideration and thus solves the incompatibility between the classification results and the Gene Ontology structure. Our experiment on the Gene Ontology annotation corpus achieves an F-value performance of 50.7% (precision: 52.7% recall: 48.9%). The experimental results demonstrate that when the size of training set is small, it can be expanded via topological propagation of associated documents between the parent and child nodes in the tree structure. The top-down classification model applies to the set of texts in an ontology structure or with a hierarchical relationship."

Previously, we described a novel protein, catabolite control protein E (CcpE) that functions as a regulator of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Here we demonstrate that CcpE also regulates virulence determinant biosynthesis and pathogenesis. Specifically, deletion of ccpE in S. aureus strain Newman revealed that CcpE affects transcription of virulence factors such as capA, the first gene in the capsule biosynthetic operon; hla, encoding α-toxin; and psmα, encoding the phenol-soluble modulin cluster α. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CcpE binds to the hla promoter. Mice challenged with S. aureus strain Newman or its isogenic ΔccpE derivative revealed increased disease severity in the ΔccpE mutant using two animal models; an acute lung infection model and a skin infection model. Complementation of the mutant with the ccpE wild-type allele restored all phenotypes, demonstrating that CcpE is negative regulator of virulence in S. aureus.

To reduce the cost of PLA, the search for cheap raw materials and low-cost process for lactic acid production is highly desired. In this study, the final titer of produced L-lactic acid reached a concentration of 185 g·L−1 with a volumetric productivity of 1.93 g·L−1·h−1 by using sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate as the sole carbon source simultaneously with cottonseed meal as cheap nitrogen sources under the open fed-batch fermentation process. Furthermore, a lactic acid yield of 0.99 g per g of total reducing sugars was obtained, which is very close to the theoretical value (1.0 g g−1). No D-isomer of lactic acid was detected in the broth, and thereafter resulted in an optical purity of 100%, which exceeds the requirement of lactate polymerization process. To our knowledge, this is the best performance of fermentation on polymer-grade L-lactic acid production totally using lignocellulosic sources. The high levels of optically pure l-lactic acid produced, combined with the ease of handling and low costs associated with the open fermentation strategy, indicated the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. P38 could be an excellent candidate strain with great industrial potential for polymer-grade L-lactic acid production from various cellulosic biomasses."
https://openalex.org/W2083676602,"We have found that the large intracellular loop of the γ2 GABAA receptor (R) subunit (γ2IL) interacts with RNF34 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), as shown by yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pulldown assays. In brain extracts, RNF34 co-immunoprecipitates with assembled GABAARs. In co-transfected HEK293 cells, RNF34 reduces the expression of the γ2 GABAAR subunit by increasing the ratio of ubiquitinated/nonubiquitinated γ2. Mutating several lysines of the γ2IL into arginines makes the γ2 subunit resistant to RNF34-induced degradation. RNF34 also reduces the expression of the γ2 subunit when α1 and β3 subunits are co-assembled with γ2. This effect is partially reversed by leupeptin or MG132, indicating that both the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways are involved. Immunofluorescence of cultured hippocampal neurons shows that RNF34 forms clusters and that a subset of these clusters is associated with GABAergic synapses. This association is also observed in the intact rat brain by electron microscopy immunocytochemistry. RNF34 is not expressed until the 2nd postnatal week of rat brain development, being highly expressed in some interneurons. Overexpression of RNF34 in hippocampal neurons decreases the density of γ2 GABAAR clusters and the number of GABAergic contacts that these neurons receive. Knocking down endogenous RNF34 with shRNA leads to increased γ2 GABAAR cluster density and GABAergic innervation. The results indicate that RNF34 regulates postsynaptic γ2-GABAAR clustering and GABAergic synaptic innervation by interacting with and ubiquitinating the γ2-GABAAR subunit promoting GABAAR degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2009411354,"While predetermined débitage technologies are recognized beginning with the middle Acheulian, the Middle Paleolithic is usually associated with a sharp increase in their use. A study of scraper-blank technology from three Yabrudian assemblages retrieved from the early part of the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex of Tabun Cave (ca. 415–320 kyr) demonstrates a calculated and preplanned production, even if it does not show the same complexity and elaboration as in the Levallois technology. These scraper dominated assemblages show an organization of production based on an intensive use of predetermination blank technology already in place at the end of the Lower Paleolithic of the Levant. These results provide a novel perspective on the differences and similarities between the Lower and Middle Paleolithic industries. We suggest that there was a change in the paradigm in the way hominins exploited stone tools: in many Middle Paleolithic assemblages the potential of the stone tools for hafting was a central feature, in the Lower Paleolithic ergonometric considerations of manual prehension were central to the design of blanks and tools."
https://openalex.org/W2155088550,"CO and NO are small toxic gaseous molecules that play pivotal roles in biology as gasotransmitters. During bacterial infection, NO, produced by the host via the inducible NO synthase, exerts critical antibacterial effects while CO, generated by heme oxygenases, enhances phagocytosis of macrophages. In Escherichia coli, other bacteria and fungi, the flavohemoglobin Hmp is the most important detoxification mechanism converting NO and O2 to the ion nitrate (NO3(-)). The protoheme of Hmp binds not only O2 and NO, but also CO so that this ligand is expected to be an inhibitor of NO detoxification in vivo and in vitro. CORM-3 (Ru(CO)(3)Cl(glycinate)) is a metal carbonyl compound extensively used and recently shown to have potent antibacterial properties. In this study, attenuation of the NO resistance of E. coli by CORM-3 is demonstrated in vivo. However, polarographic measurements showed that CO gas, but not CORM-3, produced inhibition of the NO detoxification activity of Hmp in vitro. Nevertheless, CO release from CORM-3 in the presence of soluble cellular compounds is demonstrated by formation of carboxy-Hmp. We show that the inability of CORM-3 to inhibit the activity of purified Hmp is due to slow release of CO in protein solutions alone i.e. when sodium dithionite, widely used in previous studies of CO release from CORM-3, is excluded. Finally, we measure intracellular CO released from CORM-3 by following the formation of carboxy-Hmp in respiring cells. CORM-3 is a tool to explore the concerted effects of CO and NO in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1984254994,"In the purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, many protein complexes congregate within the membrane to form operational photosynthetic units consisting of arrays of light-harvesting LH2 complexes and monomeric and dimeric reaction center (RC)-light-harvesting 1 (LH1)-PufX ""core"" complexes. Each half of a dimer complex consists of a RC surrounded by 14 LH1 αβ subunits, with two bacteriochlorophylls (Bchls) sandwiched between each αβ pair of transmembrane helices. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the assembly of single molecules of the RC-LH1-PufX complex using membranes prepared from LH2-minus mutants. When the RC and PufX components were also absent, AFM revealed a series of LH1 variants where the repeating α(1)β(1)(Bchl)2 units had formed rings of variable size, ellipses, and spirals and also arcs that could be assembly products. The spiral complexes occur when the LH1 ring has failed to close, and short arcs are suggestive of prematurely terminated LH1 complex assembly. In the absence of RCs, we occasionally observed captive proteins enclosed by the LH1 ring. When production of LH1 units was restricted by lowering the relative levels of the cognate pufBA transcript, we imaged a mixture of complete RC-LH1 core complexes, empty LH1 rings, and isolated RCs, leading us to conclude that once a RC associates with the first α1β1(Bchl)2 subunit, cooperative associations between subsequent subunits and the RC tend to drive LH1 ring assembly to completion."
https://openalex.org/W2034977898,"Symbioses with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium form the foundation of tropical coral reef communities. Symbiodinium photosynthesis fuels the growth of an array of marine invertebrates, including cnidarians such as scleractinian corals and octocorals (e.g., gorgonian and soft corals). Studies examining the symbioses between Caribbean gorgonian corals and Symbiodinium are sparse, even though gorgonian corals blanket the landscape of Caribbean coral reefs. The objective of this study was to compare photosynthetic characteristics of Symbiodinium in four common Caribbean gorgonian species: Pterogorgia anceps, Eunicea tourneforti, Pseudoplexaura porosa, and Pseudoplexaura wagenaari. Symbiodinium associated with these four species exhibited differences in Symbiodinium density, chlorophyll a per cell, light absorption by chlorophyll a, and rates of photosynthetic oxygen production. The two Pseudoplexaura species had higher Symbiodinium densities and chlorophyll a per Symbiodinium cell but lower chlorophyll a specific absorption compared to P. anceps and E. tourneforti. Consequently, P. porosa and P. wagenaari had the highest average photosynthetic rates per cm2 but the lowest average photosynthetic rates per Symbiodinium cell or chlorophyll a. With the exception of Symbiodinium from E. tourneforti, isolated Symbiodinium did not photosynthesize at the same rate as Symbiodinium in hospite. Differences in Symbiodinium photosynthetic performance could not be attributed to Symbiodinium type. All P. anceps (n = 9) and P. wagenaari (n = 6) colonies, in addition to one E. tourneforti and three P. porosa colonies, associated with Symbiodinium type B1. The B1 Symbiodinium from these four gorgonian species did not cluster with lineages of B1 Symbiodinium from scleractinian corals. The remaining eight E. tourneforti colonies harbored Symbiodinium type B1L, while six P. porosa colonies harbored type B1i. Understanding the symbioses between gorgonian corals and Symbiodinium will aid in deciphering why gorgonian corals dominate many Caribbean reefs."

The binding of mature MSPαβ (disulfide-linked α- and β-chains) to RON ectodomain modulates receptor dimerization, followed by autophosphorylation of tyrosines in the cytoplasmic receptor kinase domains. Receptor recognition is mediated by binding of MSP β-chain (MSPβ) to the RON Sema. Here we report the structure of RON Sema-PSI-IPT1 (SPI1) domains in complex with MSPβ at 3.0 Å resolution. The MSPβ serine protease-like β-barrel uses the degenerate serine protease active site to recognize blades 2, 3, and 4 of the β-propeller fold of RON Sema. Despite the sequence homology between RON and MET receptor tyrosine kinase and between MSP and hepatocyte growth factor, it is well established that there is no cross-reactivity between the two receptor-ligand systems. Comparison of the structure of RON SPI1 in complex with MSPβ and that of MET receptor tyrosine kinase Sema-PSI in complex with hepatocyte growth factor β-chain reveals the receptor-ligand selectivity determinants. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies of the SPI1-MSPβ interaction confirm the formation of a 1:1 complex. SPI1 and MSPαβ also associate primarily as a 1:1 complex with a binding affinity similar to that of SPI1-MSPβ. In addition, the SPI1-MSPαβ ultracentrifuge studies reveal a low abundance 2:2 complex with ∼ 10-fold lower binding affinity compared with the 1:1 species. These results support the hypothesis that the α-chain of MSPαβ mediates RON dimerization."

However, the boundary age of 50 years old between early- and late-onset MG remains controversial, and each category contains further subtypes. We attempted to classify MG from a statistical perspective.We analyzed 640 consecutive MG patients using two-step cluster analysis with clinical variables and discrimination analysis, using onset age as a variable.Two-step cluster analyses categorized MG patients into the following five subtypes: ocular MG; MG with thymic hyperplasia (THMG); generalized anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-Ab)-negative MG; thymoma-associated MG; and generalized AChR-Ab-positive (SP) MG without thymic abnormalities. Among these 5 subtypes, THMG showed a distribution of onset age skewed toward a younger age (p<0.01), whereas ocular MG and SPMG without thymic abnormalities showed onset age skewed toward an older age (p<0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). The other 2 subtypes showed normal distributions. THMG appeared as the main component of early-onset MG, and ocular MG and SPMG without thymic abnormalities as the main components of late-onset MG. Discrimination analyses between THMG and ocular MG and/or SPMG without thymic abnormalities demonstrated a boundary age of 45 years old.From a statistical perspective, the boundary age between early- and late-onset MG is about 45 years old."

The knock-out mutant atvdac1 showed reduced seed set due to a large number of undeveloped ovules in siliques. Genetic analyses indicated that the mutation of AtVDAC1 affected female fertility and belonged to a sporophytic mutation.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which mycobacterial components suppress allergic diseases are not yet fully understood. Here we showed the inhibitory mechanisms for development of allergic airway inflammation by using highly purified recombinant Ag85B (rAg85B), which is one of the major protein antigens secreted from M. tuberculosis. Ag85B is thought to be a single immunogenic protein that can elicit a strong Th1-type immune response in hosts infected with mycobacteria, including individuals vaccinated with BCG. Administration of rAg85B showed a strong inhibitory effect on the development of allergic airway inflammation with induction of Th1-response and IL-17and IL-22 production. Both cytokines induced by rAg85B were involved in the induction of Th17-related cytokine-production innate immune cells in the lung. Administration of neutralizing antibodies to IL-17 or IL-22 in rAg85B-treated mice revealed that IL-17 induced the infiltration of neutrophils in BAL fluid and that allergen-induced bronchial eosinophilia was inhibited by IL-22. Furthermore, enhancement of the expression of genes associated with tissue homeostasis and wound healing was observed in bronchial tissues after rAg85B administration in a Th17-related cytokine dependent manner. The results of this study provide evidence for the potential usefulness of rAg85B as a novel approach for anti-allergic effect and tissue repair other than the role as a conventional TB vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2018704984,"To define the upstream and downstream signaling specificities of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), we have examined the ability of representative mGluR of group I, II, and III to be activated by endogenous amino acids and catalyze activation of G proteins coupled to phospholipase C (PLC), or activation of G(i/o) proteins coupled to the ion channel TRPC4β. Fluorescence-based assays have allowed us to observe interactions not previously reported or clearly identified. We have found that the specificity for endogenous amino acids is remarkably stringent. Even at millimolar levels, structurally similar compounds do not elicit significant activation. As reported previously, the clear exception is L-serine-O-phosphate (L-SOP), which strongly activates group III mGluR, especially mGluR4,-6,-8 but not group I or II mGluR. Whereas L-SOP cannot activate mGluR1 or mGluR2, it acts as a weak antagonist for mGluR1 and a potent antagonist for mGluR2, suggesting that co-recognition of L-glutamate and L-SOP arose early in evolution, and was followed later by divergence of group I and group II mGluR versus group III in l-SOP responses. mGluR7 has low affinity and efficacy for activation by both L-glutamate and L-SOP. Molecular docking studies suggested that residue 74 corresponding to lysine in mGluR4 and asparagine in mGluR7 might play a key role, and, indeed, mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that mutating this residue to lysine in mGluR7 enhances the potency of L-SOP. Experiments with pertussis toxin and dominant-negative Gα(i/o) proteins revealed that mGluR1 couples strongly to TRPC4β through Gα(i/o), in addition to coupling to PLC through Gα(q/11)."

Later identification of native flavodoxins that could support bNOS activity led to the development of a three-component reaction composed an E. coli-derived ferredoxin reductase, B. subtilis-derived flavodoxin YkuN (or YkuP), and Bacillus subtilis NOS (bsNOS) (13.Wang Z.Q.

NO production was also measured using the three-component system by Griess reaction and electron transfer between YkuN and bsNOS was measured using stop-flow spectrophotometry (13.Wang Z.Q.

Although bsNOS activity could be measured in a reconstituted system, the relevance of using a heterologous ferredoxin reductase was unknown. More importantly, despite the advances made thus far to characterize NO production by a bNOS, a simple and rigorous assay for purposes of screening inhibitors against a bNOS has yet to be established. To characterize and rapidly evaluate bNOS inhibitors for structure-based drug design, it was essential to first develop a robust enzyme assay. To carry this out, we first identified flavoproteins from B. subtilis that would support bsNOS activity. Because the flavodoxin YkuN was previously established as a redox partner for bsNOS (13.Wang Z.Q. Lawson R.J. Buddha M.R. Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Munro A.W. Stuehr D.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 2196-2202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that electron transfer rates to YkuN would be improved using a B. subtilis-derived reductase. In part because a blast search of the previously utilized E. coli ferredoxin/flavodoxin reductase (FLDR), for bsNOS activity, revealed no sequence homology to the B. subtilis proteome. This was not surprising because unlike the Gram-positive B. subtilis bacterium that have evolved the ability to produce NO, Gram-negative E. coli does not contain a bNOS and thus has not evolved redox partners to support bNOS activity. Therefore, identification of a native redox system that promotes electron transfer from NAD(P)H to bsNOS would likely improve the flux of electrons to bsNOS for activity measurements. Fortunately, a ferredoxin reductase from B. subtilis, YumC, has been previously identified and characterized (14.Seo D. Kamino K. Inoue K. Sakurai H. Purification and characterization of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase encoded by Bacillus subtilis yumC.Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15.Komori H. Seo D.

Crystal structure analysis of Bacillus subtilis ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductase and the structural basis for its substrate selectivity.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). YumC shares high sequence homology to thioredoxin reductase but lacks the di-cysteine motif (CXXC) essential for thioredoxin function (14.Seo D. Kamino K. Inoue K. Sakurai H. Purification and characterization of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase encoded by Bacillus subtilis yumC.Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, YumC also shares high sequence homology to another B. subtilis protein YcgT, a putative ferredoxin reductase, that is induced under nitrosative stress (16.Moore C.M. Nakano M.M. Wang T. Ye R.W. Helmann J.D. Response of Bacillus subtilis to nitric oxide and the nitrosating agent sodium nitroprusside.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4655-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17.Nakano M.M.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and regulated by the ferric uptake regulator (19.Ollinger J. Song K.B. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Helmann J.D. Role of the Fur regulon in iron transport in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Unlike YumC, characterization of YcgT as a ferredoxin reductase has yet to be reported. Because YumC has previously been characterized as a redox partner to iron-sulfur ferredoxins (20.Seo D. Okabe S. Yanase M. Kataoka K. Sakurai T. Studies of interaction of homo-dimeric ferredoxin-NAD(P)+ oxidoreductases of Bacillus subtilis and Rhodopseudomonas palustris, that are closely related to thioredoxin reductases in amino acid sequence, with ferredoxins and pyridine nucleotide coenzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we elected to evaluate YumC as a potential redox partner to the flavodoxin YkuN. To evaluate whether YumC and YkuN would support bsNOS activity, we report here several enzyme assays that confirm YumC to function as a native redox partner involved in bsNOS activity. Because substrate hydroxylation by bsNOS requires electron transfer and electron transfer between proteins is a distant dependent event (21.Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Electron tunneling through proteins.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2003; 36: 341-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), we anticipated that we could further improve bsNOS activity by engineering a bsNOS-YkuN chimera (bBiDomain), using a linker similar in length to mNOS. To this end, we found the chimera bBiDomain to support NO production at conditions in which the three-component reaction produced negligible amounts of NO. We also have used this new assay to screen a series of potential bNOS inhibitors and have solved the crystal structure of a select few. The yumC gene was PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis (ATCC 23857) using primers YumC-NdeI-F (5′-cgccatatgcgagaggatacaaaggtttatgatattacaattatag-3′) and YumC-XhoI-R (5′-cggctcgagttatttattttcaaaaagacttgttgagtgaagagg-3′). The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated into pET28a (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites to generate pJH085. The B. subitilis YkuN protein sequence was obtained from GenbankTM (22.Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessières P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R.

The complete genome sequence of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3126) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was then codon-optimized for E. coli expression, synthesized, and ligated into pET21a vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites by Genewiz to generate pJH060. The E. coli ferredoxin NADP+ reductase encoded plasmid was kindly provided by Dr Michael Waterman (University of Southern California) and subcloned into pET28a (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites to generate overexpression plasmid pJH063. A linker encoding the (GGGS)5 sequence, synthesized by Genewiz, was ligated into the BamH1 and SalI restriction sites of pET28a (Novagen) to generate the primary shuttle vector pJH045. DNA encoding bsNOS from (8.Holden J.K. Li H. Jing Q. Kang S. Richo J. Silverman R.B. Poulos T.L. Structural and biological studies on bacterial nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

YkuN DNA was also PCR amplified and ligated into pJH067 using the SalI and XhoI restriction sites to produce pJH070. YumC containing expression plasmid pJH085 was transformed into chemically competent BL21 DE3 (Invitrogen) E. coli and expressed as reported previously (14.Seo D. Kamino K. Inoue K. Sakurai H. Purification and characterization of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase encoded by Bacillus subtilis yumC.Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). YumC-containing cell pellets were resuspended and lysed by microfluidics in buffer containing 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 µm FAD, and 10 mm imidazole. Cell lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) column and washed with buffer containing 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 5 µm FAD, and 18 mm imidazole. YumC was then eluted off the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column using 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 5 µm FAD, and 200 mm imidazole. The eluted YumC was then diluted 10-fold into 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4) and loaded onto a Q Sepharose column that was pre-equilibrated in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4). The Q Sepharose column was washed with buffer containing 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4) and 10 mm NaCl. YumC was eluted with buffer contaiing 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4) and 200 mm NaCl. Protein was concentrated and further purified over an Superdex 75 column, using an AKTA FPLC (GE Life Sciences), in buffer containing 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4), 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 µm FAD. YumC purity was checked by SDS-PAGE gel analysis and concentration was calculated using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Expression of YkuN using plasmid pJH060 was followed as reported previously (23.Lawson R.J. von Wachenfeldt C. Haq I. Perkins J. Munro A.W. Expression and characterization of the two flavodoxin proteins of Bacillus subtilis, YkuN and YkuP: biophysical properties and interactions with cytochrome P450 BioI.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12390-12409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells containing YkuN were purified as described for YumC except purification buffers contained 5 µm FMN instead of FAD. FLDR expression plasmid pJH063 was transformed into chemically competent BL21 DE3 (Invitrogen) E. coli and plated on kanamycin containing LB agar plates. Starter cultures from individual colonies were grown for 8 h and used to inoculate 1 liter of LB media at 37 °C and shaken overnight at 200 rpm. The following morning cultures were induced at 25 °C with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 3 µm riboflavin, and shaking was lowered to 80 RPM. Bacterial cultures were harvested 24 h post-induction. FLDR was purified as described for YkuN. Expression and purification of bsNOS followed as reported previously (8.Holden J.K. Li H. Jing Q. Kang S. Richo J. Silverman R.B. Poulos T.L. Structural and biological studies on bacterial nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18127-18131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression of bBiDomain also followed the previous bsNOS expression protocol (8.Holden J.K. Li H. Jing Q. Kang S. Richo J. Silverman R.B. Poulos T.L. Structural and biological studies on bacterial nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 18127-18131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) except 3 µm riboflavin and 1 mm 5-aminolevulinic acid (Biosynth International, Inc.) were added at the time of induction to improve cofactor biosynthesis. The bBiDomain and bsNOS concentrations were determined from the 444-nm ferrous-CO complex absorption using a molar extinction coefficient of 76 mm−1 cm−1 (24.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Spectral characterization of brain and macrophage nitric oxide synthases: cytochrome P-450-like hemeproteins that contain a flavin semiquinone radical.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horse heart cytochrome c reduction assays were performed at room temperature and cytochrome c reduction was monitored at 550 nm using a Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer. The assays were carried out in 25 mm KPi (pH 7.4), 1 µm FMN, 1 µm FAD, 40 µm horse heart cytochrome c (Affymetrix USB), 5 nm YkuN, and varying amounts of either FLDR or YumC. Individual reactions were initiated with 100 µm NADPH and the steady-state oxidation of cytochrome c reduction was calculated as described previously using Δϵ550 = 21 mm−1 cm−1 (25.Martásek P. Miller R.T. Roman L.J. Shea T. Masters B.S. Assay of isoforms of Escherichia coli-expressed nitric oxide synthase.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 35 °C in a buffered solution composed of 25 mm KPi (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 units/ml SOD, 10 units/ml catalase, 5 µm FMN, 5 µm FAD, 50 µm H4B, and 200 µm NOHA. To the buffered solution, bsNOS, YkuN, and YumC were also added. Protein concentrations evaluated for NO-mediated nitrite production using a three-component reaction included 0.1 µm bsNOS, 0.1 µm YkuN, and 1 µm YumC. In addition, the three-component reaction was also evaluated with 1 µm bsNOS, 5 µm YkuN, and 5 µm YumC. Reactions were initiated by addition of NADPH at a final concentration of 400 µm and quenched by thermal denaturation at 100 °C for 10 min. Excess NADPH was consumed by adding 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 150 mm sodium pyruvate. Reactions were aliquoted to a 96-well microplate and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Griess reagents as described previously (26.Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. A rapid, simple spectrophotometric method for simultaneous detection of nitrate and nitrite.Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) with the exception that nitrate was not reduced to nitrite. Nitrite concentrations were determined from a standard curve of nitrite solutions based on absorbance at 548 nm. Reactions were carried out using the buffered solution reported for the three-component reaction. The bBiDomain reactions included 100 nm bBiDomain and either YumC or FLDR at 1 µm; except for reactions in which YumC concentrations were varied. For inhibition assays, inhibitors were added at 30 µm. Similar to the three-component reaction, bBiDomain reactions were initiated with NADPH at a final concentration of 400 µm, quenched by thermal denaturation, and analyzed by Griess reaction. Reactions were run analogous to bBiDomain activity assays except inhibitors were included at varying concentrations. Nitrite concentration was measured 4 min after NADPH addition by the Griess reaction. Percent activity was calculated based on the fraction of nitrite detected at a specific inhibitor concentration as compared with no inhibitor. To calculate the IC50, the data were fit to a curve using SigmaPlot (version 10.0, Systat Software, Inc.). IC50 was calculated from the line of best fit. Conversion of a low spin imidazole-bound species to a high spin species was monitored by the imidazole displacement assay as described previously for bsNOS (8.Holden J.K. Li H. Jing Q. Kang S. Richo J. Silverman R.B. Poulos T.L. Structural and biological studies on bacterial nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The same conditions for bsNOS were also used for bBiDomain. Additional imidazole displacement assays using bsNOS and YkuN were composed of 2 and 20 µm protein, respectively. An apparent spectral binding constant (KS,app) was calculated from a non-linear regression analysis using SigmaPlot (version 10.0, Systat Software, Inc.) and fit to Equation 1. A395−A430=Bmax⋅[I]KS,app+[I](Eq. 1) Assuming the KD of imidazole to be 384 µm (12.Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Sharma M. Pant K. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J.

Richo J. Silverman R.B. Poulos T.L. Structural and biological studies on bacterial nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Data were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (28.Battye T.G.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O. Powell H.R.

Scaling and assessment of data quality.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3753) Google Scholar). Protein and ligand were modeled in COOT (30.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13863) Google Scholar). A VP-ITC titration calorimeter instrument (GE Healthcare) was used to measure l-Arg binding to bsNOS. l-Arg was prepared in 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4), and protein samples were exchanged into 50 mm KPi (pH 7.4) using Superdex 75 (GE Life Sciences). All samples were degassed under vacuum at −30 mm Hg for ∼20 min. The sample cell was filled with 118.14 µm bsNOS, and the injection syringe contained 3.0 mm l-Arg. All experiments were performed in triplicate at 25 °C using 30 injections at a reference power of 10 µcal/sec, stirring speed of 307 rpm and a 240-s time delay between injections. The first injection volume was set at 3 µl, and the remaining 29 injections were set to 5 µl. Heat measured for each injection was integrated, and the data were fit to a one-to-one binding mode using Origin (version 7.0, OriginLab Corp.). Previous structural and biochemical analyses revealed YumC functions as a FAD-containing reductase (14.Seo D. Kamino K. Inoue K. Sakurai H. Purification and characterization of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase encoded by Bacillus subtilis yumC.Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15.Komori H. Seo D. Sakurai T. Higuchi Y. Crystal structure analysis of Bacillus subtilis ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductase and the structural basis for its substrate selectivity.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To compare the rates of electron transfer from either YumC or FLDR to the flavodoxin YkuN, we monitored cytochrome c reduction by YkuN because cytochrome c is easily reduced by FMN containing flavodoxins (32.Simondsen R.P. Weber P.C. Salemme F.R. Tollin G. Transient kinetics of electron transfer reactions of flavodoxin: ionic strength dependence of semiquinone oxidation by cytochrome c, ferricyanide, and ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and computer modeling of reaction complexes.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6366-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the rate of cytochrome c reduction is dependent on the concentration of either YumC or FLDR with YumC reaching saturation at ≈600 nm, whereas FLDR is unable to saturate YkuN. At saturation levels of YumC (≈600 nm), the rate of cytochrome c reduction is ∼20-fold faster than FLDR. This suggests that electron flux through YkuN is significantly improved when YumC is used as the reductase as compared with FLDR. The improved rates of electron transfer by YumC over FLDR also suggest that both YumC and YkuN function as native B. subtilis redox partners. This is also the first time YumC has been observed to reduce a flavodoxin. Because YumC now is established as a probable redox partner for multiple proteins in B. subtilis and is encoded by an essential gene (33.Kobayashi K. Ehrlich S.D. Albertini A. Amati G. Andersen K.K.

Based on previous experiments, bsNOS-mediated NO production requires YkuN and a flavodoxin reductase (13.Wang Z.Q. Lawson R.J. Buddha M.R. Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Munro A.W. Stuehr D.J. Ba"
https://openalex.org/W2033863992,"A previously uncharacterized protein with a carotenoid-binding function has been isolated and characterized from the gonad of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus. The main carotenoid bound to the protein was determined by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography to be 9′-cis-echinenone and hence this 15 kDa protein has been called an echinenone-binding protein (EBP). Purification of the EBP in quantity from the natural source proved to be challenging. However, analysis of EBP by mass spectrometry combined with information from the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome sequence and the recently published E. chloroticus transcriptome database, enabled recombinant expression of wild type EBP and also of a cysteine61 to serine mutant that had improved solubility characteristics. Circular dichroism data and ab initio structure prediction suggests that the EBP adopts a 10-stranded β-barrel fold consistent with that of fatty acid-binding proteins. Therefore, EBP may represent the first report of a fatty acid-binding protein in complex with a carotenoid."
https://openalex.org/W1986678380,"We investigated genetic variation and evolutionary history of closely related taxa of Picris subsect. Hieracioides with major focus on the widely distributed P. hieracioides and its closely related congeners, P. hispidissima, P. japonica, P. olympica, and P. nuristanica. Accessions from 140 sample sites of the investigated Picris taxa were analyzed on the infra- and the inter-specific level using nuclear (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region) and chloroplast (rpl32-trnL(UAG) region) DNA sequences. Genetic patterns of P. hieracioides, P. hispidissima, and P. olympica were shown to be incongruent and, in several cases, both plastid and nuclear alleles transcended borders of the taxa and genetic lineages. The widespread P. hieracioides was genetically highly variable and non-monophyletic across both markers, with allele groups having particular geographic distributions. Generally, all gene trees and networks displayed only a limited and statistically rather unsupported resolution among ingroup taxa causing their phylogenetic relationships to remain rather unresolved. More light on these intricate evolutionary relationships was cast by the Bayesian coalescent-based analysis, although some relationships were still left unresolved. A combination of suite of phylogenetic analyses revealed the ingroup taxa to represent a complex of genetically closely related and morphologically similar entities that have undergone a highly dynamic and recent evolution. This has been especially affected by the extensive and recurrent gene flow among and within the studied taxa and/or by the maintenance of ancestral variation. Paucity of phylogenetically informative signal further hampers the reconstruction of relationships on the infra- as well as on the inter-specific level. In the present study, we have demonstrated that a combination of various phylogenetic analyses of datasets with extremely complex and incongruent phylogenetic signal may shed more light on the interrelationships and evolutionary history of analysed species groups."
https://openalex.org/W2115833776,"We examined whether academic and professional bachelor students with dyslexia are able to compensate for their spelling deficits with metacognitive experience. Previous research suggested that students with dyslexia may suffer from a dual burden. Not only do they perform worse on spelling but in addition they are not as fully aware of their difficulties as their peers without dyslexia. According to some authors, this is the result of a worse feeling of confidence, which can be considered as a form of metacognition (metacognitive experience). We tried to isolate this metacognitive experience by asking 100 students with dyslexia and 100 matched control students to rate their feeling of confidence in a word spelling task and a proofreading task. Next, we used Signal Detection Analysis to disentangle the effects of proficiency and criterion setting. We found that students with dyslexia showed lower proficiencies but not suboptimal response biases. They were as good at deciding when they could be confident or not as their peers without dyslexia. They just had more cases in which their spelling was wrong. We conclude that the feeling of confidence in our students with dyslexia is as good as in their peers without dyslexia. These findings go against the Dual Burden theory (Krüger & Dunning, 1999), which assumes that people with a skills problem suffer twice as a result of insufficiently developed metacognitive competence. As a result, there is no gain to be expected from extra training of this metacognitive experience in higher education students with dyslexia."
https://openalex.org/W2099430939,"This psychophysics study investigated whether prior auditory conditioning influences how a sound interacts with visual perception. In the conditioning phase, subjects were presented with three pure tones ( = conditioned stimuli, CS) that were paired with positive, negative or neutral unconditioned stimuli. As unconditioned reinforcers we employed pictures (highly pleasant, unpleasant and neutral) or monetary outcomes (+50 euro cents, −50 cents, 0 cents). In the subsequent visual selective attention paradigm, subjects were presented with near-threshold Gabors displayed in their left or right hemifield. Critically, the Gabors were presented in synchrony with one of the conditioned sounds. Subjects discriminated whether the Gabors were presented in their left or right hemifields. Participants determined the location more accurately when the Gabors were presented in synchrony with positive relative to neutral sounds irrespective of reinforcer type. Thus, previously rewarded relative to neutral sounds increased the bottom-up salience of the visual Gabors. Our results are the first demonstration that prior auditory conditioning is a potent mechanism to modulate the effect of sounds on visual perception."

https://openalex.org/W2052243271,"ATP has dual roles in the reaction cycle of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. Upon binding to the Ca2E1 state, ATP phosphorylates the enzyme, and by binding to other conformational states in a non-phosphorylating modulatory mode ATP stimulates the dephosphorylation and other partial reaction steps of the cycle, thereby ensuring a high rate of Ca(2+) transport under physiological conditions. The present study elucidates the mechanism underlying the modulatory effect on dephosphorylation. In the intermediate states of dephosphorylation the A-domain residues Ser(186) and Asp(203) interact with Glu(439) (N-domain) and Arg(678) (P-domain), respectively. Single mutations to these residues abolish the stimulation of dephosphorylation by ATP. The double mutation swapping Asp(203) and Arg(678) rescues ATP stimulation, whereas this is not the case for the double mutation swapping Ser(186) and Glu(439). By taking advantage of the ability of wild type and mutant Ca(2+)-ATPases to form stable complexes with aluminum fluoride (E2·AlF) and beryllium fluoride (E2·BeF) as analogs of the E2·P phosphoryl transition state and E2P ground state, respectively, of the dephosphorylation reaction, the mutational effects on ATP binding to these intermediates are demonstrated. In the wild type Ca(2+)-ATPase, the ATP affinity of the E2·P phosphoryl transition state is higher than that of the E2P ground state, thus explaining the stimulation of dephosphorylation by nucleotide-induced transition state stabilization. We find that the Asp(203)-Arg(678) and Ser(186)-Glu(439) interdomain bonds are critical, because they tighten the interaction with ATP in the E2·P phosphoryl transition state. Moreover, ATP binding and the Ser(186)-Glu(439) bond are mutually exclusive in the E2P ground state."

The process of somatic reprogramming by defined factors occurs in a stepwise and inefficient manner (reviewed in Papp and Plath, 2013Papp B. Plath K. Cell. 2013; 152: 1324-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Further evidence has shown that the quality of iPSCs, which can be determined by tetraploid complementation in mice, varies substantially. As a result, finding reliable molecular markers that can be used for defining high-quality iPSCs is a prerequisite for further clinical applications in human. Previous studies have identified that the aberrant methylation of imprinted genes such as Dlk-Dio3 (Stadtfeld et al., 2010Stadtfeld M. Apostolou E. Akutsu H. Fukuda A. Follett P. Natesan S. Kono T. Shioda T. Hochedlinger K. Nature. 2010; 465: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and Zrsr1 (Chang et al., 2014Chang G. Gao S. Hou X. Xu Z. Liu Y. Kang L. Tao Y. Liu W. Huang B. Kou X. et al.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) might correlate with the reduced pluripotency in iPSCs; however, the reliability of tracking these characteristics is still under debate. Faithful reprogramming requires resetting not only DNA methylation, but the whole epigenetic landscape, including histone modifications and nucleosome positioning. However, as an important aspect of epigenetic remodeling, reassembling of histone variants is barely understood in iPSC induction (Banaszynski et al., 2010Banaszynski L.A. Allis C.D. Lewis P.W. Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 662-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In two studies published in this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Wu et al., 2014Wu T. Liu Y. Wen D. Tseng Z.

Porubsky D. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15 (this issue): 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar provide evidence showing that the deposition pattern of histone variant H2A.X is a functional epigenetic marker for defining iPSCs quality (Figure 1). Wu and colleagues first explored the new function of H2A.X in pluripotent stem cells (Wu et al., 2014Wu T. Liu Y. Wen D. Tseng Z. Tahmasian M. Zhong M. Rafii S. Stadtfeld M. Hochedlinger K. Xiao A. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15 (this issue): 281-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They performed native ChIP-seq with specific antibodies to analyze the genome-wide deposition pattern of H2A.X in ESCs and MEFs. Strikingly, they found that ESC-specific H2A.X deposition regions show strong correlations with the silenced extraembryonic genes targeted by Cdx2 in ESCs. They further compared the transcriptome changes using Cre-mediated H2A.X deletion from H2A.Xfloxed/floxed ESCs and found that H2A.X deficiency leads to upregulation of some extraembryonic genes, but not the pluripotency genes or germ layer markers. Moreover, the newly observed function in transcriptional repression was not related to genomic instability, though H2A.X KO leads to genome instability and deficient DNA damage responses (Celeste et al., 2002Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. et al.Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). H2A.X deposition seems to be critical in maintaining H3K9me3 level, but not H3K27me3, at extraembryonic gene enhancers. The authors also analyzed the H2A.X deposition pattern in iPSCs generated by a previously reported secondary iPSC system (Stadtfeld et al., 2012Stadtfeld M. Apostolou E. Ferrari F. Choi J. Walsh R.M. Chen T. Ooi S.S. Kim S.Y. Bestor T.H. Shioda T. et al.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 (S391–392): 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and determined the developmental potential of the secondary iPSCs by tetraploid complementation. Interestingly, the iPSC lines that were capable of tetraploid complementation (4N+) and the ones that failed (4N−) were classified into two distinct groups with an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of H2A.X deposition. Moreover, the 4N− iPSC lines possess a large number of genomic regions devoid of H2A.X deposition at a genome-wide level, although the overall protein levels were comparable (Figure 1). More strikingly, the expression of extraembryonic genes in 4N− iPSC lines was upregulated and H3K9me3 was decreased at the Cdx2-targeted sites of extraembryonic genes, which was the exact pattern in H2A.X-deficient ESCs. They further found that H2A.X deficiency primes ESCs and iPSCs toward extraembryonic lineage differentiation in culture or in developing embryos. Recent studies have reported that γ-H2A.X increased during reprogramming and DNA repair factors are required for iPSC induction (González et al., 2013González F. Georgieva D. Vanoli F. Shi Z.D. Stadtfeld M. Ludwig T. Jasin M. Huangfu D.W. Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, Wu et al. found that the depletion of H2A.X in the secondary iPSC system results in greatly reduced formation of Oct4+ colonies, which reveals that H2A.X plays a critical role during cellular reprogramming. Interestingly, Wu et al. also observed aberrant accumulation of H2A.X at the Dlk1-Dio3/Chr12qF1 locus in 4N− iPSC clones, which correlates with aberrant silencing and hypermethylation of these loci. Buganim and colleagues focused on the role of reprogramming factors in determining the quality of iPSCs. They based their work on the new combination of factors Sall4, Nanog, Esrrb, and Lin28 (SNEL), which reprograms with low efficiency compared to traditional Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) induction. In contrast to the OSKM combination, they found that SNEL can produce high-quality iPSCs at high rates as defined by their capacity to produce healthy “all-iPSC” mice (Figure 1). Interestingly, poor-quality colonies reduced when c-Myc was excluded as a reprogramming factor, which suggests that the interplay between the reprogramming factors is a crucial element in these processes. The iPSCs were classified into three categories based on the degree of chimera contribution and the health status of “all-iPSC” mice. Multiple analyses were performed to define the elements dictating fully reprogrammed iPSCs. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling, methylome analysis, establishment of superenhancers, single-cell analysis of key master regulators, and global aneuploidy analysis did not distinguish between poor- and high-quality iPSCs. An interesting finding is that aberrant expression of 1,765 genes, trisomy of chromosome 8, and abnormal H2A.X deposition were frequently observed in poor-quality iPSCs that were derived from OSKM or OSK. Unexpectedly, although both γ-H2A.X level and cell death reduced greatly in both OSK and SNEL induction, trisomy 8 could still be detected in OSK iPSCs. Meanwhile, the differences in H2A.X deposition patterns between the high-quality OSK-iPSC lines and the parental Oct4-GFP ESC line were still greater than those between SNEL-iPSCs and the same parental ESCs, which suggests that trisomy of chromosome 8 and aberrant H2A.X deposition are not only caused by the expression of c-Myc. A similar observation was also found in OSSNE induction. It seems that the combination of “strong” reprogramming factors, Oct4 and Sox2, may be responsible for the genomic and epigenetic errors in reprogramming. How the combination of reprogramming factors impacts genomic stability and epigenetic reconstruction requires further investigation. Of note, the quality of iPSCs can also be influenced by culture conditions. For example, the addition of Vitamin C (Stadtfeld et al., 2012Stadtfeld M. Apostolou E. Ferrari F. Choi J. Walsh R.M. Chen T. Ooi S.S. Kim S.Y. Bestor T.H. Shioda T. et al.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 (S391–392): 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) can improve the quality of cells, probably by facilitating epigenetic resetting. Replacement of Oct4 with Tet1 in reprogramming could also generate high-quality iPSCs without tumorigenesis observed in the resulting all-iPSC mice (Gao et al., 2013Gao Y. Chen J. Li K. Wu T. Huang B. Liu W. Kou X. Zhang Y. Huang H. Jiang Y. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 453-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). All these data suggest that faithful epigenetic reprogramming might be a key point in the determination of iPSCs quality. It could be extremely important to analyze the quality and the risk of tumorigeneity of iPSCs generated by different reprogramming factors or conditions. One interesting difference between the two studies is that Wu et al. observed only around 100 genes expressed differently between 4N+ and 4N− iPSCs using RNA-seq, whereas Buganim et al. identified a list of 1,765 genes expressed differently between poor- and high-quality iPSCs using microarray analysis. This difference might be due to different induction systems applied. Although different induction systems were used in these two studies, the deposition of H2A.X seems to be a robust “key marker” associated with pluripotency. Unlike aberrant methylation of imprinting genes, the deposition of H2A.X discussed here is measured in a genome-wide fashion and it is therefore important to set a proper threshold similar to that in Wu et al. It is also important to look for more important or respective regions to simplify the examination assay in further applications. In the end, considering the specific critical role of H2A.X in repressing extraembryonic lineage differentiation, it is important to investigate whether this marker can be applied for defining the quality of human iPSC lines.

https://openalex.org/W2040226460,"Fos-Tau-LacZ (FTL) transgenic mice are used to visualize the anatomical connectivity of neurons that express c-Fos, an immediate early gene, in response to activation. In contrast to typical c-Fos protein expression, which is localized to the nucleus of stimulated neurons, activation of the c-Fos gene results in beta galactosidase (β-gal) expression throughout the entire cytoplasm of activated cells in FTL mice; thereby making it possible to discern the morphology of c-Fos expressing cells. This can be an especially important tool in brain areas in which function may be related to cell morphology, such as the primary taste/viscerosensory brainstem nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS). Thus, to further characterize FTL activity in the brain, the current study quantified both β-gal enzymatic activity as well as c-Fos protein expression in the nTS under a variety of experimental conditions (no stimulation, no stimulation with prior overnight food and water restriction, monosodium glutamate taste stimulation, and monosodium glutamate taste stimulation with perfusion 5 h post stimulation). Contrary to previous research, we found that β-gal activity (both labeled cell bodies and overall number of labeled pixels) was unchanged across all experimental conditions. However, traditional c-Fos protein activity (both cell bodies and number of activated pixels) varied significantly across experimental conditions, with the greatest amount of c-Fos protein label found in the group that received monosodium glutamate taste stimulation. Interestingly, although many c-Fos positive cells were also β-gal positive in the taste stimulated group, some c-Fos protein labeled cells were not co-labeled with β-gal. Together, these data suggest that β-gal staining within the nTS reflects a stable population of β-gal- positive neurons whose pattern of expression is unaffected by experimental condition."
