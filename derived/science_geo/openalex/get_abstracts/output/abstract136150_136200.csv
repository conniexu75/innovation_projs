https://openalex.org/W1994088328,"Nerve growth is regulated by attractive and repulsive factors in the nervous system. Microscopic gradients of Collapsin-1/Semaphorin III/D (Sema III) and myelin-associated glycoprotein trigger repulsive turning responses by growth cones of cultured Xenopus spinal neurons; the repulsion can be converted to attraction by pharmacological activation of the guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate signaling pathways, respectively. Sema III also causes the collapse of cultured rat sensory growth cones, which can be inhibited by activation of the cGMP pathway. Thus cyclic nucleotides can regulate growth cone behaviors and may be targets for designing treatments to alleviate the inhibition of nerve regeneration by repulsive factors."

https://openalex.org/W2053407758,"A continuous record of atmospheric lead since 12,370 carbon-14 years before the present (14C yr BP) is preserved in a Swiss peat bog. Enhanced fluxes caused by climate changes reached their maxima 10, 590 (14)C yr BP (Younger Dryas) and 8230 (14)C yr BP. Soil erosion caused by forest clearing and agricultural tillage increased lead deposition after 5320 (14)C yr BP. Increasing lead/scandium and decreasing lead-206/lead-207 beginning 3000 (14)C yr BP indicate the beginning of lead pollution from mining and smelting, and anthropogenic sources have dominated lead emissions ever since. The greatest lead flux (15.7 milligrams per square meter per year in A.D. 1979) was 1570 times the natural, background value (0.01 milligram per square meter per year from 8030 to 5320 (14)C yr BP)."
https://openalex.org/W2038763999,"Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms known to have a circadian clock. A circadian clock gene cluster kaiABC was cloned from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. Nineteen clock mutations were mapped to the three kai genes. Promoter activities upstream of the kaiA and kaiB genes showed circadian rhythms of expression, and both kaiA and kaiBC messenger RNAs displayed circadian cycling. Inactivation of any single kai gene abolished these rhythms and reduced kaiBC-promoter activity. Continuous kaiC overexpression repressed the kaiBC promoter, whereas kaiA overexpression enhanced it. Temporal kaiC overexpression reset the phase of the rhythms. Thus, a negative feedback control of kaiC expression by KaiC generates a circadian oscillation in cyanobacteria, and KaiA sustains the oscillation by enhancing kaiC expression."

https://openalex.org/W2025484736,"Isolated, ventral brain lesions in humans occasionally produce specific impairments in the ability to use landmarks, particularly buildings, for way-finding. Using functional MRI, we tested the hypothesis that there exists a cortical region specialized for the perception of buildings. Across subjects, a region straddling the right lingual sulcus was identified that possessed the functional correlates predicted for a specialized building area. A series of experiments discounted several alternative explanations for the behavior of this site. These results are discussed in terms of their impact upon our understanding of the functional structure of visual processing, disorders of topographical disorientation, and the influence of environmental conditions upon neural organization."
https://openalex.org/W2043072647,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signals through a receptor complex composed of the Ret tyrosine kinase and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol- (GPI-) anchored cell surface coreceptor, either GDNF family receptor alpha1 (GFR alpha1) or GFR alpha2. To investigate the usage of these coreceptors for GDNF signaling in vivo, gene targeting was used to produce mice lacking the GFR alpha1 coreceptor. GFR alpha1-deficient mice demonstrate absence of enteric neurons and agenesis of the kidney, characteristics that are reminiscent of both GDNF- and Ret-deficient mice. Midbrain dopaminergic and motor neurons in GFR alpha1 null mice were normal. Minimal or no neuronal losses were observed in a number of peripheral ganglia examined, including the superior cervical and nodose, which are severely affected in both Ret- and GDNF-deficient mice. These results suggest that while stringent physiologic pairing exists between GFR alpha1 and GDNF in renal and enteric nervous system development, significant cross-talk between GDNF and other GFR alpha coreceptors must occur in other neuronal populations."

https://openalex.org/W1981364887,"Recruitment of the coactivator, CREB binding protein (CBP), by signal-regulated transcription factors, such as CREB [adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein], is critical for stimulation of gene expression. The mouse pituitary cell line AtT20 was used to show that the CBP recruitment step (CREB phosphorylation on serine-133) can be uncoupled from CREB/CBP–activated transcription. CBP was found to contain a signal-regulated transcriptional activation domain that is controlled by nuclear calcium and calcium/calmodulin–dependent (CaM) protein kinase IV and by cAMP. Cytoplasmic calcium signals that stimulate the Ras mitogen–activated protein kinase signaling cascade or expression of the activated form of Ras provided the CBP recruitment signal but did not increase CBP activity and failed to activate CREB- and CBP-mediated transcription. These results identify CBP as a signal-regulated transcriptional coactivator and define a regulatory role for nuclear calcium and cAMP in CBP-dependent gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2043377395,"Glutamate receptors mediate the majority of rapid excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) and play important roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development. Recently, protein-protein interactions with the C-terminal domain of glutamate receptor subunits have been shown to be involved in the modulation of receptor function and clustering at excitatory synapses. In this paper, we have found that the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), a protein involved in membrane fusion events, specifically interacts with the C terminus of the GluR2 and GluR4c subunits of AMPA receptors in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, intracellular perfusion of neurons with a synthetic peptide that competes with the interaction of NSF and AMPA receptor subunits rapidly decreases the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), suggesting that NSF regulates AMPA receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2001520037,"The number of vesicles contained in the readily releasable pool at excitatory hippocampal synapses has recently been identified as a major determinant of the strength of these synapses. Here, we show that the rate at which this pool refills following depletion is variable from neuron to neuron and can be increased by the accumulation of intracellular calcium during action potential–mediated activation of the synapses. The refilling rate nearly doubles during the first second of a high frequency train of action potentials and does not increase further with additional stimulation. During periods of rest, the rate relaxes back to its original value, with a time constant of about 10 s. Since this refilling rate helps set the strength of synapses during high frequency bursts of action potentials and is modulated by physiological signaling, it is an attractive candidate point of control in the storage and manipulation of information by the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2068612299,"The analysis, measurement, and management of species abundance is central to ecology and conservation biology, but it has proved difficult to find a single index that adequately reflects the commonness or rarity of species across a range of spatial scales. Here, a scale-independent measure of species abundance is developed, using presence-absence maps at varying spatial resolutions. By extrapolating such “scale-area” curves, species abundance can be estimated accurately even at scales finer than those used to parameterize the model, a task that had previously been deemed impossible in principle."
https://openalex.org/W1983738000,"Ca2+ influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates signal transduction pathways critical for many forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain. NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx also downregulates the gating of NMDA channels through a process called Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI). Recent studies have demonstrated that the calcium binding protein calmodulin directly interacts with NMDA receptors, suggesting that calmodulin may play a role in CDI. We report here that the mutation of a specific calmodulin binding site in the CO region of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor blocks CDI. Moreover, intracellular infusion of a calmodulin inhibitory peptide markedly reduces CDI of both recombinant and neuronal NMDA receptors. Furthermore, this inactivating effect of calmodulin can be prevented by coexpressing a region of the cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin2 known to interact with the CO region of NR1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to NR1 mediates CDI of the NMDA receptor and suggest that inactivation occurs via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent release of the receptor complex from the neuronal cytoskeleton."

https://openalex.org/W2044132227,"To obtain rapidly inducible and reversible expression of transgenes in the forebrain of the mouse, we have combined the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) system with the CaMKIIα promoter. We show that doxycycline induces maximal gene expression in neurons of the forebrain within 6 days and that this expression can be reversed by removal of doxycycline. Using calcineurin as a test transgene, we show that doxycycline-induced expression impairs both an intermediate form of LTP (I-LTP) in the hippocampus and the storage of spatial memory. The reversibility of the rtTA system in turn allowed us to examine the effects of the transgene on memory retrieval after normal storage had occurred. This examination suggests that retrieval requires some of the same molecular components required for storage."
https://openalex.org/W2063620761,"Cell lineage analyses suggest that cortical neuroblasts are capable of undertaking both radial and tangential modes of cell movement. However, it is unclear whether distinct progenitors are committed to generating neuroblasts that disperse exclusively in either radial or tangential directions. Using highly unbalanced mouse stem cell chimeras, we have identified certain progenitors that are committed to one mode of cell dispersion only. Radially dispersed neurons expressed glutamate, the neurochemical signature of excitatory pyramidal cells. In contrast, tangential progenitors gave rise to widely scattered neurons that are predominantly GABAergic. These results suggest lineage-based mechanisms for early specification of certain progenitors to distinct dispersion pathways and neuronal phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2040368827,"The neuronal SNARE complex is formed via the interaction of synaptobrevin with syntaxin and SNAP-25. Purified SNARE proteins assemble spontaneously, while disassembly requires the ATPase NSF. Cycles of assembly and disassembly have been proposed to drive lipid bilayer fusion. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested in vivo. We have isolated a Drosophila temperature-sensitive paralytic mutation in syntaxin that rapidly blocks synaptic transmission at nonpermissive temperatures. This paralytic mutation specifically and selectively decreases binding to synaptobrevin and abolishes assembly of the 7S SNARE complex. Temperature-sensitive paralytic mutations in NSF (comatose) also block synaptic transmission, but over a much slower time course and with the accumulation of syntaxin and SNARE complexes on synaptic vesicles. These results provide in vivo evidence that cycles of assembly and disassembly of SNARE complexes drive membrane trafficking at synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2004670058,"Neurotrophins are a family of soluble ligands that promote the survival and differentiation of peripheral and central neurons and regulate synaptic function. The two neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4), bind and activate a single high-affinity receptor, TrkB. Experiments in cell culture have revealed that an intact Shc adaptor binding site on TrkB and subsequent activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway are important for neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth. To elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the diverse effects of BDNF and NT4 in vivo, we have mutated in the mouse germline the Shc binding site in the trkB gene. This trkBshc mutation revealed distinctive responses to BDNF and NT4. While nearly all NT4-dependent sensory neurons were lost in trkBshc/shc mutant mice, BDNF-dependent neurons were only modestly affected. Activation of MAP kinases and in vitro survival of cultured trkBshc/shc neurons were reduced in response to both neurotrophins, with NT4 being less potent than BDNF, suggesting differential activation of TrkB by the two ligands. Moreover, while the Ras/MAPK pathway is required for in vitro differentiation of neuronal cells, trkBshc/shc mutant mice do not show any defects in BDNF-dependent differentiation of CNS neurons or in the function of sensory neurons that mediate innocuous touch."
https://openalex.org/W2103580807,"Spinal sensory ganglia have been shown to contain neuronal subpopulations with different functions and neurotrophin dependencies. Neurotrophins act, in large part, through Trk receptor tyrosine kinases: nerve growth factor (NGF) via TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) via TrkB, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) via TrkC. In the present paper, we use antibodies to TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC to characterize their expression patterns and to determine which subpopulations of cells are lost in mice lacking individual neurotrophins or Trk receptors. Despite previous reports of Trk receptor mRNAs in neural crest cells, we detect Trk receptor proteins only in neurons and not in neural crest cells or neuronal precursors. Comparisons of neonatal mice deficient in NT-3 or its cognate receptor TrkC have shown that there is a much greater deficiency in spinal sensory neurons in the former, suggesting that NT-3 may activate receptors in addition to TrkC. Using the same antibodies, we show that, during the major period of neurogenesis, NT-3 is required to maintain neurons that express TrkB in addition to those that express TrkC but is not essential for neurons expressing TrkA. Results also indicate that survival of cells expressing both receptors can be maintained by activation of either one alone. NT-3 can thus activate more than one Trk receptor in vivo, which when coexpressed are functionally redundant."
https://openalex.org/W2041475044,"Sensory experience during an early critical period guides the development of thalamocortical circuits in many cortical areas. This process has been hypothesized to involve long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses. Here, we show that thalamocortical synapses in rat barrel cortex can express LTD, and that LTD is most readily induced during a developmental period that is similar to the critical period for thalamocortical plasticity in vivo. Thalamocortical LTD is homosynaptic and dependent on activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The age-related decline of LTD is not due to changes in inhibition nor to changes in NMDA receptor voltage dependence. Minimal stimulation experiments indicate that, unlike thalamocortical LTP, thalamocortical LTD is not associated with a significant change in failure rate. The existence of LTD and its developmental time course suggest that LTD, like LTP, may contribute to the refinement of thalamocortical inputs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2064756990,"Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells of the cerebral cortex express receptors for the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and downregulate expression of the extracellular matrix protein Reelin during early postnatal development, coincident with the onset of cortical BDNF expression. During this period, mice lacking BDNF have elevated levels of Reelin in CR cells. Acute BDNF stimulation of cortical neuron cultures and overexpression of BDNF in the developing brain of transgenic mice prior to the onset of endogenous production causes a profound, dose-dependent reduction of Reelin expression in CR cells. In addition, overexpression of BDNF produces gaps and heterotopias in the marginal zone and disorganization and aggregation of cortical CR cells and induces several other malformations, including aberrant cortical lamination, similar to the phenotype of reeler mutant mice, which lack Reelin. These results demonstrate a role for BDNF on cortical CR cells and identify Reelin as a direct effector of this neurotrophin during brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2079415701,"We show that presentation of individual canary song syllables results in distinct expression patterns of the immediate-early gene ZENK in the caudomedial neostriatum (NCM) of adult canaries. Information on the spatial distribution and labeling of stained cells provides for a classification of ZENK patterns that (1) accords to the organization of stimuli into families, (2) preserves the stimuli intrafamily relationships, and (3) confers salience to natural over artificial stimuli, resulting in a nonclassical tonotopic map. Moreover, complex syllable maps cannot be reduced to any linear combinations of simple syllable maps. These properties arise from the collective response of NCM neurons to auditory stimuli, rather than from the behavior of single neurons. The syllabic representation described here may constitute an important step toward deciphering the rules of birdsong auditory representation."
https://openalex.org/W2119883995,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is thought to result from either increased transmitter release, heightened postsynaptic sensitivity, or a combination of the two. We have measured evoked glutamate release from Schaffer collateral/commissural fiber terminals in CA1 by recording synaptically activated glutamate transporter currents in hippocampal astrocytes located in stratum radiatum. Although several manipulations of release probability caused parallel changes in extracellular field potentials and synaptically activated transporter current amplitudes, induction of LTP failed to alter transporter-mediated responses, suggesting that LTP does not alter the amount of glutamate released upon synaptic stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1543193184,"HIRA maps to the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome critical region (DGCR) at 22q11 (refs 1,2) and encodes a WD40 repeat protein similar to yeast Hir1p and Hir2p. These transcriptional co-repressors regulate cell cycle-dependent histone gene transcription, possibly by remodelling local chromatin structure. We report an interaction between HIRA and the transcription factor Pax3. Pax3 haploinsufficiency results in the mouse splotch and human Waardenburg syndrome (WSI and WSIII) phenotypes. Mice homozygous for Pax3 mutations die in utero with a phenocopy of DGS, or neonatally with neural tube defects. HIRA was also found to interact with core histones. Thus, altered stoichiometry of complexes containing HIRA may be important for the development of structures affected in WS and DGS."
https://openalex.org/W2091931057,"Although much has been learned about the mechanisms underlying NMDA receptor–dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), considerable debate remains as to whether LTP is expressed as an increase in the synaptic release of glutamate or as an increase in the sensitivity of the postsynaptic glutamate receptors. We have directly measured changes in the synaptic release of glutamate by recording synaptically evoked glial glutamate transporter currents with whole-cell recording. Glial cell responses were very sensitive to manipulations known to change the release of glutamate yet remained constant during LTP. These results argue strongly for a postsynaptic expression mechanism for LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2149813111,"Axon guidance receptors modulate the growth cone cytoskeleton through signaling pathways that are not well understood. Here, we describe the C. elegans unc-115 gene, which encodes a candidate cytoskeletal linker protein that acts in axon guidance. unc-115 mutants have defects in a subset of axons, particularly as the affected axons change environments during outgrowth. The unc-115 gene encodes a putative actin-binding protein that is similar to the human actin-binding protein abLIM/limatin; it has a villin headpiece domain and three LIM domains that could mediate protein interactions. unc-115 is expressed in neurons during their development and is required cell-autonomously in certain neurons for normal axon guidance. We propose that UNC-115 modulates the growth cone actin cytoskeleton in response to signals received by growth cone receptors."

The complex thus constitutes a stable molecular single-source precursor to Zintl compounds and provides a potential low-temperature route to photoactive alkali metal antimonates.
