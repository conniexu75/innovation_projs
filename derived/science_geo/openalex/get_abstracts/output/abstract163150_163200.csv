https://openalex.org/W1875554126,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates angiogenesis by activating VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). The role of its homolog, placental growth factor (PlGF), remains unknown. Both VEGF and PlGF bind to VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), but it is unknown whether VEGFR-1, which exists as a soluble or a membrane-bound type, is an inert decoy or a signaling receptor for PlGF during angiogenesis. Here, we report that embryonic angiogenesis in mice was not affected by deficiency of PlGF (Pgf−/−). VEGF-B, another ligand of VEGFR-1, did not rescue development in Pgf−/− mice. However, loss of PlGF impaired angiogenesis, plasma extravasation and collateral growth during ischemia, inflammation, wound healing and cancer. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow rescued the impaired angiogenesis and collateral growth in Pgf−/− mice, indicating that PlGF might have contributed to vessel growth in the adult by mobilizing bone-marrow–derived cells. The synergism between PlGF and VEGF was specific, as PlGF deficiency impaired the response to VEGF, but not to bFGF or histamine. VEGFR-1 was activated by PlGF, given that anti-VEGFR-1 antibodies and a Src-kinase inhibitor blocked the endothelial response to PlGF or VEGF/PlGF. By upregulating PlGF and the signaling subtype of VEGFR-1, endothelial cells amplify their responsiveness to VEGF during the 'angiogenic switch' in many pathological disorders."

Collagenolysis is not required for stimulation of pro-MMP-2 activation, and denatured collagen does not elicit an MMP-2 activation response. Similarly, DOV13 cells bind to intact collagen utilizing both α2β1 and α3β1 integrins but interact poorly with collagenase-treated or thermally denatured collagen. Antibody-induced clustering of α3β1 strongly promotes activation of pro-MMP-2, whereas α2β1integrin clustering has only marginal effects. Membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP is present on the DOV13 cell surface as both an active 55-kDa TIMP-2-binding species and a stable catalytically inactive 43-kDa form. Integrin clustering stimulates cell surface expression of MT1-MMP and co-localization of the proteinase to aggregated integrin complexes. Furthermore, cell surface proteolysis of the 55-kDa MT1-MMP species occurs in the absence of active MMP-2, suggesting MT1-MMP autolysis. Cellular invasion of type I collagen matrices requires collagenase activity, is blocked by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and collagenase-resistant collagen, is unaffected by TIMP-1, and is accompanied by pro-MMP-2 activation. Together, these data indicate that integrin stimulation of MT1-MMP activity is a rate-limiting step for type I collagen invasion and provide a mechanism by which this activity can be down-regulated following collagen clearance.

Following trimeric complex formation, it is hypothesized that a neighboring MT1-MMP molecule that is not associated with TIMP-2 cleaves pro-MMP-2 at the Asn37–Leu38 peptide bond within the pro-domain (7Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intermediately processed MMP-2 (Leu38–MMP-2) undergoes further concentration-dependent autolytic cleavage(s) to generate mature enzymes that can be released into the soluble phase or remain surface-associated (8Atkinson S.J.

Although biological mechanisms of active MMP-2 release from the cell surface are not well characterized and dissociation kinetics provide little insight, cellular binding affinities may shift following pro-MMP-2 cleavage.Culturing a variety of cell types within a three-dimensional gel of type I collagen stimulates cellular activation of pro-MMP-2 (9Azzam H.S.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Although MT1-MMP is implicated in MMP-2 processing, regulation of cellular events that promote MMP processing are poorly understood. As cellular interaction with type I collagen is mediated largely through integrin receptors, it has been postulated that collagen stimulation occurs either directly or indirectly through integrin signaling (12Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 13Seltzer J.L. Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In support, we have previously demonstrated that culturing DOV13 ovarian cancer cells in a three-dimensional collagen gel elicits a strong pro-MMP-2 activation response that can be mimicked by clustering of β1 integrin receptors (12Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, pro-MMP-2 activation coincides with the processing of MT1-MMP into truncated 55- and 43-kDa forms on the cell surface. In this study, we utilize a variety of approaches to elucidate the biochemical requirements of type I collagen stimulation of MMP zymogen activation, characterize processed forms of MT1-MMP that are generated in this response, and examine the proteinase requirements for cellular invasion of type I collagen gels. Our findings illustrate a general mechanism by which cells may regulate cell surface-associated MMP activity via interactions with pericellular collagen matrix.DISCUSSIONMT1-MMP is a cell surface activator of pro-MMP-2 and has been implicated in collagen invasion and turnover (33Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H.

Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In this study, DOV13 ovarian cancer cells activate MT1-MMP as a consequence of culture in type I collagen gels and display MMP-dependent invasion of type I collagen, indicating that MMP activity is required for removal of collagen matrix constraints during invasion. However, migration over two-dimensional collagen is not impeded by MMP inhibitors. Although TIMP-1 does not interact with MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 specifically binds the proteinase, functioning in both inhibition and stabilization of the enzyme on the cell surface (26Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 32Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The ability of exogenous TIMP-2, in contrast to TIMP-1, to inhibit DOV13 collagen gel invasion implicates a cell surface proteolytic cascade initiated by MT1-MMP. This is further supported by data demonstrating that inhibition of MMP-2 cellular activation or collagen binding using rCD and rCBD (17Steffensen B. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20622-20628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), respectively, has no effect on collagen invasion. As the cellular events that govern the collagen-induced MMP-2/MT1-MMP response are unclear and technically difficult to assess in three-dimensional collagen gel systems, a variety of biochemical approaches were employed in this study to dissect the interplay between collagen-cell interactions and regulation of cell surface MMP activity.DOV13 cells bind type I collagen via α2β1and α3β1 integrins. Recognition of collagen by these integrins depends on retention of the triple helical conformation, as thermal gelation of collagen abrogates cellular adhesion. Collagenase-cleaved type I collagen produces ¾ and ¼ fragments that display a lower T m than intact fibrils (37Danielsen C.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Adhesion data in the current study demonstrate that the triple helical conformation of the collagen fragments is stabilized at low coating temperatures but is lost under physiological coating conditions (21Messent A.J. Tuckwell D.S. Knauper V. Humphries M.J. Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that pericellular type I collagenolysis will reduce α2β1 and α3β1 integrin-mediated cell-matrix contacts. By using a similar approach, the appearance of cryptic αVβ3 integrin-binding sites (RGD) in collagenase-generated collagen fragments was reported (21Messent A.J. Tuckwell D.S. Knauper V. Humphries M.J. Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, DOV13 cells adhere weakly to type I gelatin or ¾ and ¼ fragments, and aggregation of αVβ3 integrins on the surface of DOV13 cells does not elicit a cellular MMP processing response (12Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 20Moser T.L. Pizzo S.V. Bafetti L.M. Fishman D.A. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the exposure of cryptic αVβ3- or αVβ5-binding sites in collagenase-cleaved collagen may further influence MMP expression in a cell type-specific manner. In support of this observation, we have previously demonstrated that vitronectin-induced aggregation of melanoma cell αVβ3 integrins up-regulates MMP-2 expression (38Bafetti L.M. Young T.N. Itoh Y. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 143-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Relative to collagen gel penetration, DOV13 cells rapidly invade a gelatin matrix. Although pro-MMP-2 activation is not up-regulated over basal levels under these conditions, additional proteinases of other mechanistic classes can provide gelatinase activity (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 39Pineiro-Sanchez M.L. Goldstein L.A. Dodt J. Howard L. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7595-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Andreasen P.A Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that collagenase activity provided by MT1-MMP is critical to invasion of an intact collagen matrix. Subsequent clearance of resultant fragments can then proceed by activation of cell surface MMP-2 along with contributions from other cell surface proteinases including seprase (39Pineiro-Sanchez M.L. Goldstein L.A. Dodt J. Howard L. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7595-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the components of the plasminogen activator/plasmin system (40Andreasen P.A Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), which have been implicated in DOV13 cellular invasion of Matrigel (22Ellerbroek S.M. Hudson L.G. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Stimulation of pro-MMP-2 activation does not require collagenolysis, as collagenase-resistant collagen is as efficacious as wild type type I collagen at inducing pro-MMP-2 processing. However, thermal denaturation of either collagen abolishes the ability to enhance MMP activation, suggesting that α2β1 and/or α3β1 integrin binding to intact triple-helical collagen mediates the MMP activation response in DOV13 cells. By using subunit-specific antibodies to dissect integrin requirements for MMP processing, our data demonstrate that clustering of α3 integrins promotes a stronger cellular MMP processing response than α2 integrin aggregation. A potential role for α integrin-specific regulation has been demonstrated previously for type I collagen-induced cellular responses, including those involving MMP-1 expression (41Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 42Lichtner R.B. Howlett A.R. Lerch M. Xuan J.A. Brink J. Langton-Webster B. Schneider M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Administration of function blocking antibodies against either α integrin subunit reveals a role for both receptors during invasion. Although this study implicates the α3β1 heterodimer in mediating the MT1-MMP response, it is likely that both α2β1 and α3β1integrins provide a mechanical advantage to the migration component of invasion. Furthermore, it is unclear at this level of investigation whether α2β1 integrins are required for effective dispersal of α3β1 into focal adhesions (43Grenz H. Carbonetto S. Goodman S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 739-751PubMed Google Scholar, 44DiPersio C.M. Shah S. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, α3β1integrins have recently been hypothesized to play a major organizational role in the formation of invadopodia in response to cellular engagement of type I collagen (45Mueller S.C. Ghersi G. Akiyama S.K. Sang Q.X. Howard L. Pineiro-Sanchez M. Nakahara H. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24947-24952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As MT1-MMP also localizes to invadopodia (27Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 28Urena J.M. Merlos-Suarez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lehti K. Valtanen H. Wickstrom S. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15006-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it is possible that α3β1 clustering in DOV13 cells selectively initiates cellular events that mimic formation of invadopodial projections, which in turn regulate MT1-MMP activity. Moreover, our data demonstrate localization of MT1-MMP immunoreactivity to the periphery of clustered β1 integrins, indicating that MT1-MMP redistribution occurs during integrin clustering events. This observation, together with previous reports of MT1-MMP localization to integrin-rich cellular protrusions, suggests a cellular regulatory mechanism for MT1-MMP aggregation, thereby promoting effective pro-MMP-2 processing and efficient matrix degradation. As MT1-MMP can function as a collagenase (31D'Ortho M.P. Will H. Atkinson S. Butler G. Messent A. Gavrilovic J. Smith B. Timpl R. Zardi L. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and MT1-MMP null mice exhibit severe deficiencies in collagen remodeling (33Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), localization of the enzyme to cellular collagen receptors could clearly influence physiologic events such as collagen gel contraction, adhesion, and invasion. In addition, pro-MMP-2 bound to intact peri-cellular collagen may readily infiltrate the MT1-MMP activation pathway, resulting in a switch from a collagenase to a gelatinase environment as pro-MMP-2 activation and collagen triple helix denaturation ensues (17Steffensen B. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20622-20628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).It has recently been demonstrated that exogenous MT1-MMP overexpressed in a MMP-2 null background undergoes autolysis to a 43-kDa form, the rate of which is regulated by TIMP-2 (32Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Similarly, endogenously expressed MT1-MMP in DOV13 cells exists in two major forms of 55 and 43 kDa (12Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar). The current data indicate that the 55-kDa form of MT1-MMP is the active TIMP-2-binding species, whereas the 43-kDa form is an inactive autolysis product. This result is consistent with the amino-terminal sequences of similar MT1-MMP species obtained from overexpression systems, which demonstrate a loss of essential amino acids in the zinc-binding consensus sequence (30Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although catalytically inactive, the 43-kDa form of MT1-MMP is nevertheless retained on the cell surface. As this 43-kDa species contains the carboxyl-terminal domains necessary for invadopodial localization and enzyme aggregation, it is interesting to speculate that MT1-MMP-mediated proteolysis may be down-regulated through the dilution of active enzyme with truncated proteinase.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that as DOV13 cells interact with type I collagen, integrin receptors cluster on the cell surface, resulting in up-regulation of MT1-MMP and pro-MMP-2 processing, recruitment of MT1-MMP to sites of cell-matrix contact, MMP-2 surface association, and MT1-MMP-dependent collagen gel invasion. As a consequence of MT1-MMP collagenolysis, the resulting collagen cleavage products thermally denature, providing a substrate for a number of proteinases. In addition, MMP-2 is released from the cell surface to further advance matrix clearance through directed gelatinase activity on denatured collagen fragments. As α2β1 or α3β1integrin occupancy is reduced, collagen matrix stimulation of proteolysis is attenuated. Furthermore, MT1-MMP activity can be down-regulated by autolytic processing to a stable, inactive 43-kDa form that may functionally dilute productive enzyme-substrate interactions. Together, these data support an hypothesis wherein matrix status influences cell surface matrix-degrading potential to facilitate cellular functions including migration, invasion, and matrix remodeling. The MMP family is composed of at least 25 zinc-dependent extracellular endopeptidases whose activities are regulated predominantly by expression as inactive precursors, or zymogens (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Following trimeric complex formation, it is hypothesized that a neighboring MT1-MMP molecule that is not associated with TIMP-2 cleaves pro-MMP-2 at the Asn37–Leu38 peptide bond within the pro-domain (7Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intermediately processed MMP-2 (Leu38–MMP-2) undergoes further concentration-dependent autolytic cleavage(s) to generate mature enzymes that can be released into the soluble phase or remain surface-associated (8Atkinson S.J.

Although biological mechanisms of active MMP-2 release from the cell surface are not well characterized and dissociation kinetics provide little insight, cellular binding affinities may shift following pro-MMP-2 cleavage. Culturing a variety of cell types within a three-dimensional gel of type I collagen stimulates cellular activation of pro-MMP-2 (9Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W.

As cellular interaction with type I collagen is mediated largely through integrin receptors, it has been postulated that collagen stimulation occurs either directly or indirectly through integrin signaling (12Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 13Seltzer J.L. Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell.

In support, we have previously demonstrated that culturing DOV13 ovarian cancer cells in a three-dimensional collagen gel elicits a strong pro-MMP-2 activation response that can be mimicked by clustering of β1 integrin receptors (12Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, pro-MMP-2 activation coincides with the processing of MT1-MMP into truncated 55- and 43-kDa forms on the cell surface. In this study, we utilize a variety of approaches to elucidate the biochemical requirements of type I collagen stimulation of MMP zymogen activation, characterize processed forms of MT1-MMP that are generated in this response, and examine the proteinase requirements for cellular invasion of type I collagen gels. Our findings illustrate a general mechanism by which cells may regulate cell surface-associated MMP activity via interactions with pericellular collagen matrix. DISCUSSIONMT1-MMP is a cell surface activator of pro-MMP-2 and has been implicated in collagen invasion and turnover (33Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M.

In this study, DOV13 ovarian cancer cells activate MT1-MMP as a consequence of culture in type I collagen gels and display MMP-dependent invasion of type I collagen, indicating that MMP activity is required for removal of collagen matrix constraints during invasion. However, migration over two-dimensional collagen is not impeded by MMP inhibitors. Although TIMP-1 does not interact with MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 specifically binds the proteinase, functioning in both inhibition and stabilization of the enzyme on the cell surface (26Will H. Atkinson S.J.

The ability of exogenous TIMP-2, in contrast to TIMP-1, to inhibit DOV13 collagen gel invasion implicates a cell surface proteolytic cascade initiated by MT1-MMP. This is further supported by data demonstrating that inhibition of MMP-2 cellular activation or collagen binding using rCD and rCBD (17"

This gene, which we term human SMG-1 (hSMG-1), is orthologous to Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-1, a protein that functions in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). cDNA sequencing revealed that hSMG-1 encodes a protein of 3031 amino acids containing a conserved kinase domain, a C-terminal domain unique to the PIK-related kinases and an FKBP12-rapamycin binding-like domain similar to that found in the PIK-related kinase mTOR. Immunopurified FLAG-tagged hSMG-1 exhibits protein kinase activity as measured by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the generic PIK-related kinase substrate PHAS-1. hSMG-1 kinase activity is inhibited by high nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin (IC50 = 105 nm) but is not inhibited by a FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Mutation of conserved residues within the kinase domain of hSMG-1 abolishes both autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation, demonstrating that hSMG-1 exhibits intrinsic protein kinase activity. hSMG-1 phosphorylates purified hUpf1 protein, a phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in NMD, at sites that are also phosphorylated in whole cells. Based on these data, we conclude that hSMG-1 is the human orthologue to C. elegans SMG-1. Our data indicate that hSMG-1 may function in NMD by directly phosphorylating hUpf1 protein at physiologically relevant sites.AY014957 We have cloned and characterized a new member of the phosphatidylinositol kinase (PIK)-related kinase family.

Regions of homology between PI kinases and the protein kinase superfamily include the ATP-binding site and the catalytic/substrate-binding site (3Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). PIK-related kinases are distinct from PI kinases in that they are high molecular weight proteins that function as serine/threonine protein kinases, rather than lipid kinases (3Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). PIK-related kinases can be divided into three subgroups based on structural and functional similarities shared by certain family members. The ATM/ATR/RAD3 subgroup functions in DNA damage response pathways, and members contain regions called RAD3 homology domains (4Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R.

The targets of rapamycin or TORs (Saccharomyces cerevisiae TOR1 and TOR2 and human mTOR/FRAP/RAFT1/RAPT1) were originally identified as intracellular targets of the immunophilin-immunosuppressant complex FKBP12-rapamycin (6Sabatini D.M.

Finally, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) shares no sequence similarity to other PIK-related kinases, aside from the kinase domain. DNA-PK functions in the repair of programmed DNA breaks generated by meiotic and V(D)J recombination, and those generated by genotoxic insults (9Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H. Divecha N.

Recently, evidence has emerged for an essential PIK-related kinase in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD, or mRNA surveillance, is an evolutionarily conserved process by which mRNA species containing premature termination codons are preferentially degraded, thereby preventing accumulation of truncated proteins that might serve in a dominant negative or gain-of-function manner (11Maquat L.E.

NMD also functions to regulate the level of a number of normal mRNAs (19Lelivelt M.J. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Lew J.E.

NMD has been genetically analyzed in yeast and nematodes. Seven genes (SMG-1 to SMG-7) are involved in NMD in Caenorhabditis elegans (23Pulak R. Anderson P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1885-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). One of these genes,SMG-1 (ceSMG-1), is predicted by sequence to encode a PIK-related kinase (10Page M.F. Carr B. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Anderson P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5943-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of ceSMG-1 are lacking, and the protein has never been shown to have phosphotransferase activity. However, genetic evidence indicates that phosphorylation of SMG-2, an RNA helicase, is blocked inceSMG-1 mutants (10Page M.F. Carr B. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Anderson P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5943-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMG-2 and its human homologue, human Upf1 (hUpf1), contain multiple potential PIK-related kinase (S/T)-Q and (S/T)-P phosphorylation site motifs (24Pal M. Ishigaki Y. Nagy E. Maquat L.E. RNA ( N. Y. ). 2001; 7: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of hUpf1 is blocked by high concentrations of wortmannin (IC50 = 100 nm), consistent with the role of a PIK-related kinase (24Pal M. Ishigaki Y. Nagy E. Maquat L.E. RNA ( N. Y. ). 2001; 7: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Such observations suggest that ceSMG-1 is a PIK-related kinase that may phosphorylate SMG-2. However, direct phosphorylation of SMG-2 or hUpf1 protein by ceSMG-1 or an SMG-1-like kinase in mammalian cells has never been demonstrated. In the present report, we describe the cloning and characterization of the human orthologue to ceSMG-1, which we term humanSMG-1 (hSMG-1). hSMG-1 encodes a novel PIK-related kinase with significant homology to the TORs and ceSMG-1. Biochemical characterization of transiently expressed FLAG-tagged hSMG-1 protein indicates that it is a protein kinase that exhibits both autophosphorylation and substrate-specific phosphorylation. FLAG-hSMG-1 directly phosphorylates hUpf1 protein at sites phosphorylated in whole cells, indicating that hSMG-1 is a physiologically relevant hUpf1 protein kinase. 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNAends) was performed using K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia) Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) and gene-specific primers toward the 5′-end ofKIAA0421 (NCBI gi: 2887416; accession numberAB007881), a partial cDNA with significant sequence similarity to PIK-related kinases, to generate an additional 1000 base pairs of cDNA sequence. The remaining hSMG-1 cDNA sequence was obtained from a human prostate 5′-STRETCH (λ-gt10) cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) by PCR. The full-length cDNA sequence, derived from 12 overlapping clones, was verified by alignment of four independent full-length clones. Comparison of the sequence to the GenBankTM EST data base identified KIAA0220 (NCBI gi: 1504021; accession number D86974), which corresponds to amino acids 95–647 of the full-length hSMG-1 cDNA. The hSMG-1 coding sequence can be accessed via GenBankTM accession numberAY014957 (NCBI gi: 372334). FLAG-tagged, full-length hSMG-1 cDNA was generated by PCR amplification of three overlapping hSMG-1 fragments corresponding to nucleotides 1–2580 (fragment A), nucleotides 2531–6540 (fragment B), and nucleotides 6481–9096 (fragment C). The initiating methionine codon was mutated to glycine (ATG to GTG) to generate a 5′-FLAG-tagged cDNA. The A, B, and C fragments were cloned into pCR®-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen), and FLAG-tagged, full-length cDNA (pCMV-FLAG-hSMG-1) was assembled by directional cloning into the pCMV-TAG2B (Stratagene) and then subcloned into pCI-neo (Promega). Clones were verified by sequencing. Three kinase-deficient (KD) hSMG-1 cDNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis at nucleotide 5114 (GAC to GCC), or nucleotide 5171 (GAT to GAG or GAT to GCT) within motif I (KD1) and motif II (KD2 and -3) of the catalytic domain. All hSMG-1clones DNA were confirmed by sequencing. Sequence alignments were performed using the Vector NTI Suite II program (InforMax Inc.). Total cellular RNA from human HL60, K562, and HEK-293 cells was extracted using TRIzol®reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equal amounts (5 μg) of RNA was resolved in formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with one of several probes spanning hSMG-1 as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. The expression of hSMG-1 mRNA in the Human Tissue 12-Lane MTN® Blot and Human Cancer Cell Line MTN® Blot (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was assessed by Northern blot hybridization. β-Actin mRNA served as a control for RNA loading using human β-actin cDNA as probe (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.). Probes were32P-labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP and the Megaprimer DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX) against GST-hSMG-1 fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal 419 amino acids of hSMG-1. PCR product from a reaction using the following primers (5′-GAA GAA TTC ATT GCG ACA GTT CAG GAG AAG-3′ and 5′-CTG GCG GCC GCC TCA CAC CCA GGC TGT-3′) was cloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO (TOPO TA Cloning® Kit, Invitrogen). The PCR product was then cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-hSMG-1 was expressed in E. coli, and cell pellets from isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cultures were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (100 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5% Sarkosyl, 200 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) by sonication. Clarified cell lysates were supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, and GST-hSMG-1 was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Affinity-purified GST-hSMG-1 was resolved in 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE preparative gels, visualized with 0.1 mice-cold KCl, excised, recovered by electroelution, and used to immunize rabbits for polyclonal antibody production. Affinity-purified antibody was generated using purified GST-hSMG-1 resolved by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by staining with fast green. The area of nitrocellulose containing GST-hSMG-1 was excised, incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (1% BSA/PBST), and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-hSMG-1 serum in 1% BSA/PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was washed twice for 10 min in PBST, once in PBS alone, and antibody eluted into a minimal volume of 0.5 m acetic acid at pH 2.5 for 2 min. Eluted antibody was immediately neutralized by addition of 3 volumes of 1% BSA/PBS and dialyzed three times for 30 min against ice-cold PBS. Purified antibody was concentrated using a Centricon-10 (Amicon Inc.) and stored at −20 °C in PBS containing 10% glycerol. Immunoblot analysis of hSMG-1 was performed using a 1:10 dilution of affinity-purified antibody in 1% BSA/PBST. Total cell lysates from HEK-293 cells were separated in a 7.5% acrylamide Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBST for 1 h prior to incubation with affinity-purified hSMG-1 antibody for 2 h. Membrane was washed three times in PBST, incubated in a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) in 5% milk/PBST for 1 h, and washed two times in PBST and once in PBS. Chemiluminescent detection of antigen-antibody complexes was performed using SuperSignal® West Pico substrate (Pierce). Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells were maintained in suspension culture in Iscove's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (K562 cells) or 10% fetal calf serum (HL60 cells), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin as described previously (25Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Life technologies, Inc.), 10% bovine calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin. Subconfluent HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) with ∼1–3 μg of DNA/plate and harvested for analysis 48 h after transfection. FLAG-WT- or -KD-hSMG-1 was immunopurified from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells using anti-FLAG M2® conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). Briefly, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold 1× PBS, scraped, and transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm microcystin LR, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were homogenized using a 1.5-ml pestle followed by microcentrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Immunopurification was performed by incubating 800–1000 μg of clarified lysate with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2®-conjugated agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of each of the following buffers: lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 0.1% Tween 20, lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl supplemented with 1 mmDTT and 0.1% Tween 20, wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA), and kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 500 nm microcystin LR, and 1 mm DTT). FLAG-hUpf1 protein was immunopurified from HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with 1 μg of pCI-FLAG-hUpf-1 DNA (26Sun X. Perlick H.A. Dietz H.C. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein kinase assays were performed in kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 μg of recombinant PHAS-1 (Calbiochem) or immunopurified FLAG-hUpf1 protein, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were performed at 30 °C and terminated after 30 min by the addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Samples were analyzed in 4–20% acrylamide Tris-HCl (Bio-Rad) or NuPAGE 3–8% acrylamide Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Radioactivity was detected using an InstantImager (Packard) and autoradiography on X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For wortmannin treatment, immunopurified FLAG-hSMG-1 was incubated with the indicated amount of wortmannin or solvent (Me2SO) in a final volume of 30 μl at room temperature for 1 h, washed twice with kinase buffer, and the kinase assay performed as indicated above. For rapamycin treatment, immunopurified FLAG-hSMG-1 was incubated with 10 μm rapamycin or 100 μm FK506 in the presence or absence of 10 μg GST-FKBP12 in a final volume of 50 μl. After 1 h, beads were washed twice with kinase buffer, and kinase assay performed as indicated above. Immunoblot analysis of FLAG-tagged proteins was performed using anti-FLAG M2® monoclonal antibody peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) at a 1:1000 dilution in PBST followed by chemiluminescent detection. As a positive control for rapamycin inhibition, mTOR was immunopurified from HEK-293 cells using mTAb1 (27Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, 1000 μg of clarified cell lysate was incubated with 5 μg of mTAb1 antibody conjugated to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed as described above and treated with or without 10 μm rapamycin and 10 μg of FKBP12 for 1 h. After washing twice with kinase buffer, kinase activity was assessed using 1 μg of PHAS-1 as substrate as described above. Immunoblot analysis of immunopurified mTOR was performed using 1:1000 dilution of mTAb1 antibody in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBST for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in PBST, incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBST for 1 h, washed, and subjected to chemiluminescent detection. 32P-Labeled FLAG-hUpf-1 protein was obtained from HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with pCI-FLAG-hUpf-1 for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with DMEM without phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated with 100 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN Pharmaceuticals) in DMEM supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum for 12 h. Cells were harvested, lysed, and FLAG-hUpf1 protein immunopurified as described above. 32P-Labeled FLAG-hUpf1 protein phosphorylatedin vitro by immunopurified FLAG-hSMG-1 was generated as described above. Samples were analyzed in 3–8% acrylamide NuPAGE Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Radioactivity was visualized by InstantImager, and32P-labeled hUpf-1 protein was excised from the nitrocellulose, rinsed six times with dH2O, three times with 50 mm NH4HCO3, and digested overnight with 1 mg/ml trypsin in 100 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3. Fresh trypsin (1 mg/ml) was added after 18 h and digestion continued for an additional hour. Digests were lyophilized in a speed-vac, washed several times with dH2O, and relyophilized. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (28Hocevar B.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/acetic acid/dH2O; 50:156:1794), and chromatography was performed in isobutyric chromatography buffer (isobutyric acid/n-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/dH2O, 65:2:5:3:25). Radioactivity was visualized by InstantImager and autoradiography on X-Omat film. In a search for sequences with homology to ceSMG-1, we used the GenBankTM data base of ESTs to identify a partial cDNA, termed KIAA0421(NCBI gi: 2887416; accession number AB007881) with homology to PIK-related kinases (30Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Nakajima D. Seki N. Ohira M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Both 5′-RACE and PCR screening were used to clone the full-length hSMG-1 cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The starting methionine codon was identified using two criteria: 1) the presence of upstream in-frame stop codons in three independent clones and 2) a Kozak consensus context. The open reading frame is encoded by 9096 base pairs and predicts a protein of 3031 amino acids with a molecular mass of 340,674 daltons and a pI of 6.00. The full nucleotide and amino acid sequence of hSMG-1 can be accessed through GenBankTMaccession number AY014957 (NCBI gi: 372334). Interestingly, a fourth independent clone contained a unique sequence upstream of the designated start codon, which extended the open reading frame, suggesting that alternative splicing variant(s) of hSMG-1may exist. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence ofhSMG-1 with the protein data base revealed high sequence homology with the PIK-related kinase family of protein kinases, including 1) the ataxia telangiectasia gene product, ATM, and the related human ATR and yeast RAD3; 2) the targets of rapamycin (yeast TOR1, TOR 2, and the human homologue mTOR/FRAP/RAFT1/RAPT1); and 3) the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). hSMG-1 contains several highly conserved motifs found in all PIK-related kinases, including a conserved ATP-binding site (Lys1525), and motif I (D1705 XXXXN1710) and motif II (D1724 XX) sites within the catalytic domain (Fig. 1 C). In addition, hSMG-1 contains a short C-terminal region at amino acids 3001–3031 (termed FATC for FRAP, ATM, TRRAP atC-terminus), found in the majority of the PIK-related kinases (Fig. 1 A) (31Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 7: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Among the well characterized PIK-related kinases, hSMG-1 exhibits the highest sequence homology to the TORs, which extends beyond the kinase domain to the FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain (Fig. 1, A andB). Mutational analysis of the FRB domain of mTOR has defined it as the site of binding for rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of TOR (8Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Several residues within this domain are also required for mTOR kinase activity (8Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment indicates that hSMG-1 lacks a critical serine residue that is required for binding of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex to mTOR (Fig. 1 B) (32Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, the FRB domain of hSMG-1 retains a conserved tryptophan residue, which when mutated in mTOR abolishes kinase activity (Fig. 1 B) (8Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Conservation of this tryptophan residue suggests that it is important for hSMG-1 kinase activity. The overall structure of hSMG-1 differs from that of other PIK-related kinases, since the kinase domain is not located at the extreme C terminus (Fig. 1 A). Rather, a large region is located between the kinase domain and the FATC region that is 100% identical to LIP (lambda-interacting protein). LIP was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening as a protein that interacts with the zinc finger domain of PKCι/λ (33Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LIP cDNA was reported to be 2142 base pairs, coding for a protein of 713 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 79.7 kDa (NCBI gi: 5542015; accession numberU32581) (33Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that LIP forms part of hSMG-1 raised the possibility that LIP is a splicing variant of hSMG-1. However, our Northern and immunoblot analyses argue against this hypothesis (see below). In addition to homology to mTOR, hSMG-1 exhibits significant homology to ceSMG-1 in three major regions: an N-terminal ∼200-amino acid region of 44% similarity, a ∼1000-amino acid region in the middle of the coding sequence of 46% similarity that includes the FRB-like and kinase domains, and a C-terminal ∼88-amino acid region of 61% similarity encompassing the FATC domain (Fig. 1 A). Two additional regions of homology between ceSMG-1 and hSMG-1 (termed SMG-1 homology Domains 1 and 2: SD1 and SD2) have not previously been described in other PIK-related kinases and may constitute unique functional domains characteristic of ceSMG-1 and hSMG-1. To assess hSMG-1 expression, RNA blot hybridization was performed using total RNA from K562, HL60, and HEK-293 cells (Fig.2, A–C). hSMG-1 is expressed as an RNA of ∼11.6 kb in HL60 and K562 cells as determined using a probe spanning nucleotides 5937–6890 (probe 1) of hSMG-1 (Fig.2 A). This probe overlaps with the first 150 nucleotides of the reported LIP sequence, suggesting that the reported ∼7.5-kb LIP mRNA (33Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is not expressed in these cells. To confirm this observation, RNA blot hybridization was performed using a LIP-specific probe (probe 2, nucleotides 6741–7812) and a hSMG-1-specific probe (probe 3, nucleotides 3521–4654). Like probe 1, these two probes detect an ∼11.6-kb RNA in HL60, K562, and HEK-293 cells, but no smaller RNA(s) corresponding to LIP (Fig. 2, B andC). RNA blot hybridization of cancer cell lines and human tissues using probe 1 (Fig. 2, D and E) detected hSMG-1 RNA in each of the cancer cell lines with relatively low levels in lung carcinoma (A459) and melanoma (G361) cell lines. hSMG-1 RNA was also detected in the majority of human tissues at varying levels. Therefore, hSMG-1 RNA is widely expressed in multiple tissues and cell lines. Immunoblot analysis using an affinity-purified hSMG-1 antibody detected a single immunoreactive band in HEK-293 cells with an apparent molecular mass consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 340 kDa. Importantly, no lower molecular mass bands of ∼80 kDa consistent with LIP (33Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were detected. The antigen used to produce our hSMG-1 antibody consisted of the C-terminal region of the reported LIP cDNA. Therefore, it is likely that our antibody would detect LIP if it were expressed in these cells. We have also failed to detect LIP by immunoblot analysis in K562 and HL60 cells (data not shown). To assess hSMG-1 protein kinase activity, full-length wild-type (WT) and kinase-deficient (KD1) hSMG-1 were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins in HEK-293 cells. Cultures were transfected with empty vector (pCI-neo), pCI-FLAG-WT-hSMG-1, or pCI-FLAG-KD-hSMG-1 and FLAG-tagged protein immunopurified using anti-FLAG M2® beads. FLAG-hSMG-1 immunoprecipitates were assayed for autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of recombinant PHAS-1 in the presence of Mn2+ and [32P]ATP (Fig.3 B). PHAS-1 was chosen as substrate because it contains multiple (S/T)-Q and (S/T)-P phosphorylation motifs that serve as general phospho-acceptor sites for many PIK-related kinases, including mTOR, DNA-PK, and ATM (34Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-WT-hSMG-1 phosphorylates both itself and PHAS-1, whereas phosphorylation is not observed in immunopurified FLAG-KD-hSMG-1 above the background level observed in FLAG immunoprecipitate from cells transfected with pCI-neo. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of FLAG-WT-hSMG-1 and FLAG-KD1-hSMG-1 in the immunoprecipitates. Two other FLAG-KD-hSMG-1 variants (D1724A; KD2) and (D1724E, KD3) also lacked intrinsic kinase activity (data not shown). These single amino acid substitutions were selected because analogous changes abolish the protein kinase activity of other PIK-related kinases (35Wright J.A. Keegan K.S. Herendeen D.R. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F. Concannon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7445-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 36Bentley N.J. Holtzman D.A. Flaggs G. Keegan K.S. DeMaggio A. Ford J.C. Hoekstra M. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6641-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that hSMG-1 exhibits intrinsic protein kinase activity. Like other PIK-related kinases, hSMG-1 kinase activity exhibits a strong preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+(data not shown). An identifying feature of PIK-related kinases is sensitivity to wortmannin at high nanomolar concentrations (IC50∼50–500 nm) (34Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar, 37Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence J.C.J. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), but not at low nanomolar concentrations that inhibit PI3K (IC50 = 5 nm) (38Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Incubation of immunopurified FLAG-WT-hSMG-1 with increasing concentrations of wortmannin leads to dose-dependent inhibition of both autophosphorylation and PHAS-1 phosphorylation with an IC50 of 105 nm (Fig. 3, C andD). hSMG-1 is also inhibited by LY294002 at low micromolar concentrations comparable with LY294002 inhibition of PI3 kinase and other PIK-related kinases (data not shown) (37Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence J.C.J. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The finding that hSMG-1 contains an FRB-like domain was of interest, since to date the FRB domain has been a unique feature of the TORs (39Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 155: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis identified a critical serine residue within the FRB domain of mTOR (Ser2035) that is required for binding of FKBP12-rapamycin complex and mTOR kinase inhibition (8Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of hSMG-1, ceSMG-1, and mTOR indicate that hSMG-1 and ceSMG-1 lack this critical Ser residue (Fig. 1 B). To test whether hSMG-1 kinase activity is inhibited by rapamycin, immunopurified FLAG-WT-hSMG-1 was incubated with either rapamycin alone, rapamycin and FKBP12, FK506 alone, or FK506 and FKBP12 prior to assay for autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of PHAS-1 (Fig.3 E). hSMG-1 kinase activity was not affected by any of the combinations of rapamycin, FKBP12, or FK506. In contrast, mTOR exhibited the expected inhibition by FKBP12-rapamycin complex (27Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 40Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Treatment of pCI-FLAG-WT-hSMG-1 HEK-293 cell transfectants with rapamycin prior to isolation failed to inhibit immunopurified FLAG-hSMG-1 kinase activity (data not shown). Our structural and biochemical analyses demonstrate that hSMG-1 is abona fide PIK-related kinase. Like other PIK-related kinases, hSMG-1 is a high molecular weight protein with a conserved kinase domain closely related to that of the phosphatidylinositol-kinases. Like other PIK-related kinases, hSMG-1 phosphorylates itself and the generic PIK-related kinase substrate, PHAS-1. hSMG-1 kinase activity is inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 at concentrations that inhibit other PIK-related kinases. However, hSMG-1 does not exhibit sensitivity to rapamycin inhibition despite the presence of a FRB-like domain. The role of the FRB-like domain in hSMG-1 function remains to be determined. hUpf1, the human orthologue to C. elegans SMG-2 and the S. cerevisiae Upf1 protein, is an ATP-dependent helicase required for NMD in mammalian cells (10Page M.F. Carr B. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Anderson P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5943-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sun X. Perlick H.A. Dietz H.C. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10009-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 41Perlick H.A. Medghalchi S.M. Spencer F.A. Kendzior R.J. Dietz H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). hUpf1, like SMG-2, is a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation is inhibited by high concentrations of wortmannin (IC50 = 100 nm) (24Pal M. Ishigaki Y. Nagy E. Maquat L.E. RNA ( N. Y. ). 2001; 7: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These observations, and the fact that hUpf1 is rich in (S/T)-Q and (S/T)-P motifs that serve as phosphorylation sites for PIK-related kinases, suggest that a PIK-related kinase may mediate hUpf1 protein phosphorylation (24Pal M. Ishigaki Y. Nagy E. Maquat L.E. RNA ( N. Y. ). 2001; 7: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that phosphorylated SMG-2 is not detected in a ceSMG-1 mutant background (10Page M.F. Carr B. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Anderson P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5943-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These biochemical and genetic data suggest that hSMG-1 may be a physiologic hUpf1 protein kinase. To directly test this hypothesis, immunopurified FLAG-hUpf1 protein was used as a substrate for immunopurified FLAG-WT-hSMG-1 or FLAG-KD-hSMG-1 (Fig. 4 A). FLAG-WT-hSMG-1 directly phosphorylates hUpf1 protein in vitro, whereas FLAG-KD-hSMG-1 is incapable of doing so. To determine whether hSMG-1 phosphorylates physiologically relevant sites on hUpf1, the sites of hSMG-1-mediated phosphorylation were compared with those phosphorylated in whole cells. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with pCI-FLAG-hUpf1 and incubated with [32P]orthophosphate for 12 h, and 32P-labeled FLAG-hUpf1 was immunopurified. Comparative two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 4 B) demonstrates that hUpf1 phosphorylated by hSMG-1 contains two major phosphopeptides (Fig. 4B, in vitro, labeled 1 and 2). A similar phosphopeptide pattern consisting of two major phosphopeptides was observed with hUpf1 phosphorylated in whole cells (Fig. 4B, whole cells, labeled 1 and 2). Analysis of a mixture of these digests revealed that phosphopeptides 1 and 2 are identical. Thus, hSMG-1 phosphorylates hUpf1 at the same two major sites phosphorylated in whole cells. We conclude that hSMG-1 is a physiologically relevant hUPF1 kinase. The physiologic role of hSMG-1-mediated phosphorylation of hUpf1 is unknown. One possible role is to regulate hUpf1 function in NMD. We have been unable to generate direct evidence of a critical role for hSMG-1 in NMD, likely due to the low levels of KD-hSMG-1 expression that we can achieve in transiently transfected cells (data not shown). It is unclear whether this low level of expression is due to a cytotoxic effect of KD-hSMG-1. Future studies aim to directly assess the importance of hSMG-1 and hSMG-1-mediated phosphorylation of hUpf1 protein in NMD in human cells.

Here we studied whether one of these coactivators, AIB1 (amplified inbreast cancer 1), was rate-limiting for hormone-dependent growth of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We developed MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines in which the expression of AIB1 can be modulated by regulatable ribozymes directed against AIB1 mRNA. We found that depletion of endogenous AIB1 levels reduced steroid hormone signaling via the estrogen receptor α or progesterone receptor β on transiently transfected reporter templates. Down-regulation of AIB1 levels in MCF-7 cells did not affect estrogen-stimulated cell cycle progression but reduced estrogen-mediated inhibition of apoptosis and cell growth. Finally, upon reduction of endogenous AIB1 expression, estrogen-dependent colony formation in soft agar and tumor growth of MCF-7 cells in nude mice was decreased. From these findings we conclude that, despite the presence of different estrogen receptor coactivators in breast cancer cells, AIB1 exerts a rate-limiting role for hormone-dependent human breast tumor growth.

It has been shown that estrogens can directly cause proliferation of breast cancer cells (1Lippman M.E. Bolan G. Nature. 1975; 256: 592-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and that more than 70% of primary human breast cancers are ER-positive. The activity of the ER is modulated by a recently discovered class of specific corepressors and coactivators that inhibit or enhance the transcriptional activity of the ER as well as related nuclear hormone receptors (2McKenna N.J.

Chen J.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, some of the nuclear receptors are bound to corepressors such as SMRT and NCoR (5Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

Furthermore, AIB1 amplification correlates with estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity of primary breast tumors as well as with tumor size (16Bautista S. Valles H. Walker S.L. Anzick S.

In addition, it has been shown that AIB1 interacts with other transcription factors such as TEF (21Belandia B. Parker M.G. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1924-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that AIB1 overexpression is correlated with the absence of ER and PR but is positively correlated with the expression of p53 and HER2/neu, indicating that in a subset of breast tumors AIB1 might also be involved in signaling pathways other than for steroid hormones (24Bouras T. Southey M.C. Venter D.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 903-907PubMed Google Scholar). p/CIP, the mouse homolog of AIB1, is required for CBP-dependent transcriptional activation induced by interferon-γ and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (25Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Disruption of p/CIP results in a pleiotrophic phenotype including reduced female reproductive function and blunted mammary gland development in mice as well as in the production of endogenous estrogen (26Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition, p/CIP also seems to play a role for the expression of genes critical for somatic growth and in several growth hormone regulatory pathways (27Wang Z. Rose D.W. Hermanson O. Liu F. Herman T. Wu W. Szeto D. Gleiberman A. Krones A. Pratt K. Rosenfeld R. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13549-13554Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings led to the hypothesis that human AIB1 contributes to the development of breast cancer, but evidence that AIB1 directly affects breast cancer growth and development is still lacking.In this study, we investigated the function of AIB1 for breast cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor growth in mice. We selected the well characterized human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 for our studies, since it was shown earlier that these cells express high levels of AIB1 protein (13Suen C.-S. Berrodin T.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27645-27653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 18List, H.-J., Reiter, R., Singh, B., Wellstein, A., and Riegel, A. T. (2001) Breast Cancer Res. Treat., in press.Google Scholar). In addition, AIB1 interacts with the endogenous estrogen receptor in these cells (20Tikkanen M.K. Carter D.J. Harris A.M. Le H.M. Azorsa D. Meltzer P.S. Murdoch F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12536-12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), enabling us to investigate the role of AIB1 for estrogen-dependent growth. We now report that reduction of endogenous AIB1 levels in MCF-7 cells by ribozyme-targeting reveals a significant role of this coactivator for estrogen-dependent growth and apoptosis as well as for tumor growth in mice.DISCUSSIONThe discovery of specific coactivators and corepressors that modulate the transcriptional activity of the ER and the identification of ER cofactors that are amplified and overexpressed in breast tumors led to the hypothesis that some of these cofactors contribute directly to the development of breast cancer. Some of the best characterized nuclear receptor coactivators to date include CBP/p300 (37Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

Despite many similarities of these cofactors, which have been shown to bind to the same nuclear receptors and enhance the transcriptional activity of the same receptors in vitro, it is hard to predict their function in vivo. For example, CBP and p300 both enhance retinoic acid-mediated transcription in vitro (37Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

Yao T.-P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition, functional redundancy of nuclear receptor cofactors might compensate for the complete loss or reduced levels of one of these cofactors as exemplified by a study that showed that SRC-1 potentiates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α activity in vitro but still was not essential for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-regulated gene expression in vivo (44Qi C. Zhu Y. Pan J. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Subbarao V. Pulikuri S. Hashimoto T. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is therefore imperative to identify the function of these coactivators directly in a cellular context. So far, despite several reports (9Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M.

Treat. 1998; 48: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrating differential expression patterns of some of these coactivators in breast tumors and defining their interaction with various signaling molecules in vitro, the functional role for these cofactors in normal mammary gland development and for breast tumor development is unclear.In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that ribozyme-targeting of the nuclear cofactor AIB1 reduces estrogen-dependent proliferation and neoplastic growth of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Based on these data, we propose that AIB1 overexpression provides a selective advantage for tumor growth in mammary epithelium. This hypothesis is in concordance with the finding that AIB1 amplification in breast tumors correlates with ER and PR positivity and tumor size, as shown in a study based on 1,157 human breast tumors (16Bautista S. Valles H. Walker S.L. Anzick S. Zellinger R. Meltzer P. Theillet C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2925-2929PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that endogenously expressed human ERα and AIB1 interact in MCF-7 cells (20Tikkanen M.K. Carter D.J. Harris A.M. Le H.M. Azorsa D. Meltzer P.S. Murdoch F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12536-12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that AIB1 could be a rate-limiting factor for estrogen-mediated growth in breast tumor cells. Our results would also suggest that human AIB1 and its mouse homolog p/CIP might have similar functions in the development of mammary epithelium, since deletion of the p/CIP gene showed blunted mammary gland development in the mouse (26Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study showed that Taiman, theDrosophila homolog of AIB1, contributes to steroid hormone-mediated motility of Drosophila border cells but interestingly has no effect on the proliferation of these cells (46Bai J. Uehara Y. Montell D.J. Cell. 2001; 103: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These findings raise the question of whether there are fundamental differences in the function of these closely related coactivators based on species or tissue context or whether some of these effects might be compensated by functional redundancy of nuclear receptor coactivators.Previous studies of SRC-1 demonstrate that it is a coactivator of ER (7Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar); however, its role in breast cancer seems less pronounced, and our studies suggest that it is unable to compensate for a loss of AIB1 function. Consistent with this, gene disruption studies of SRC-1 in mice showed only relatively subtle defects in the development of estrogen-dependent tissues, which might be due to the compensatory up-regulation of the related coactivator TIF-2 but not of AIB1 (47Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition, the highest levels of SRC-1 were found in normal human breast tissue compared with lower levels in breast tumors (45Berns E.M. van Staveren I.L. Klijn J.G. Foekens J.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 48: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and in contrast to AIB1, SRC-1 expression did not correlate with ER status of these tumors (45Berns E.M. van Staveren I.L. Klijn J.G. Foekens J.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 48: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SRC-1 does not colocalize with the ER in rat mammary epithelium (48Shim W.S. DiRenzo J. DeCaprio J.A. Santen R.J. Brown M. Jeng M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13-208Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar); nor did it interact with the endogenous ER in MCF-7 cells (20Tikkanen M.K. Carter D.J. Harris A.M. Le H.M. Azorsa D. Meltzer P.S. Murdoch F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12536-12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Overall, our data and these previous observations indicate a lesser role for SRC-1 in human breast tumorigenesis.The gene targets of AIB1 in breast cancer are currently not known but may involve its interactions with a number of transcription factors including p53 (23Lee S.-K. Kim H.-J. Kim J.W. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1924-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), CBP (10Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30801-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as well as with several members of the nuclear receptor family. It is an interesting possibility that many of these interactions might not only be relevant for breast tumorigenesis but also for a variety of other cancers such as ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric cancer in which AIB1 is also amplified or overexpressed (9Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 14Ghadimi B.M.

Ribozyme targeting of AIB1 will be a valuable tool to explore this. Human breast tumorigenesis is promoted by enhanced activity of the estrogen receptor (ER)1pathway. It has been shown that estrogens can directly cause proliferation of breast cancer cells (1Lippman M.E. Bolan G. Nature. 1975; 256: 592-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and that more than 70% of primary human breast cancers are ER-positive. The activity of the ER is modulated by a recently discovered class of specific corepressors and coactivators that inhibit or enhance the transcriptional activity of the ER as well as related nuclear hormone receptors (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 3Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, some of the nuclear receptors are bound to corepressors such as SMRT and NCoR (5Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 6Hoerlein A.J. Naeaer A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soederstroem M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the corepressors are released, and nuclear receptor coactivators are recruited. This leads to the enhancement of transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor via interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes and members of the basal transcription machinery (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar,3Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the best characterized nuclear receptor coactivators belong to the p160/steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family. In humans, this family consists of SRC-1 (7Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J.

Studies of end-stage-failing hearts have shown that the disturbed calcium homeostasis is associated with alterations in the expression levels or the activity of key Ca2+-handling proteins, leading to abnormal excitation contraction coupling and diastolic as well as systolic dysfunction (3Hasenfuss G.

The activity of SERCA2a is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), a 52-amino acid, muscle-specific SR phosphoprotein (8Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ.

Dephosphorylated PLB inhibits the Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a, whereas the phosphorylated form of PLB dissociates from SERCA2a leading to increases in Ca2+ uptake rates and accelerated ventricular relaxation (11Luo W.

Cell Biochem. 1982; 46: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).The role of PLB in the regulation of basal contractility has been elucidated through the development of genetically engineered mouse models. Phospholamban ablation resulted in significant increases in cardiac contractile parameters, whereas overexpressing PLB was associated with depressed cardiac function (14Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S.

Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Actually, an inverse relationship between the ratio of PLB/SERCA2a and myocardial contractility was observed (16Koss K.L. Grupp I.L. Kranias E.G. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1997; 92: 17-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that any process that alters the relative levels of these proteins and/or the interaction between them may result in altered myocardial contractility. However, it is not currently known whether a primary defect in SR Ca2+ uptake, elicited by altered interactions between PLB and SERCA2a, may result in depressed cellular Ca2+homeostasis and drive the progressive deterioration of function leading to heart failure.Early studies evaluating the interaction between PLB and SERCA2a were directed toward the cytoplasmic domain (amino acid residues 1–30), which includes the phosphorylation sites in PLB (17Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jones L.R. Field L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11486-11488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the transmembrane interaction sites (amino acid residues 31–52) were shown to mediate the regulatory effects of PLB on SERCA2a affinity, with some mutations yielding increased inhibition, whereas others abolish the PLB inhibitory effects on SERCA2a in vitro (19Kimura Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Extension of these studies to in vivomodels indicated that overexpression of either L37A or I40A mutant PLB resulted in depressed cardiac myocyte Ca2+ kinetics and mechanical parameters associated with hypertrophy (22Zvaritch E. Backx P.H. Jirik F. Kimura Y. de Leon S. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Lester J.W. Kranias E.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14985-14991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Further support for the functional significance of the PLB transmembrane domain in mediating its regulatory effects on SERCA2a was provided by a recent study, in which a Val49 → Ala (V49A) mutant PLB was expressed in vivo, using recombinant adenoviruses. The V49A mutant acted dominantly to increase contractility in cardiac ventricular cells in the absence of catecholamines (23Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J. Kranias E.G. Giles W.R. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This study pointed out the importance of the PLB carboxyl terminus in mediating its interaction with SERCA2a and proposed that interfering with this interaction may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of dilated cardiomyopathy. To further elucidate the functional significance of the PLB Val49 residue in vivo, we generated a mutant, Val49 → Gly (V49G), which acts as a potent inhibitor of the Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a. Cardiac-specific overexpression of the V49G mutant PLB resulted in superinhibition of cardiac contractility and cardiac remodeling, which progressed to dilated cardiomyopathy and early mortality. Thus, enhanced inhibition of SERCA2a by PLB may serve as a prime candidate for driving the onset and progression of heart failure.DISCUSSIONThis is the first study to demonstrate that a mutation in PLB, which is associated with superinhibition of SERCA2a and contractile parameters, may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, overt heart failure, and early mortality, which are modified by gender. Previous studies in animal models or human with end stage heart failure showed that the increases in diastolic calcium and impaired relaxation were linked to inhibition of SR Ca2+ transport (3Hasenfuss G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 39: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 29Morgan J.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the depressed SR function was suggested to be secondary to insults arising from extracellular effectors and may act as a modifier for the progression of cardiac deterioration (30Chien K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not currently clear whether inhibition of SR Ca2+ transport is sufficient to cause heart failure or it is a contributing factor to cardiomyocyte dysfunction in the context of pre-existing heart disease. To better address the role of depressed SR Ca2+ transport activity in the onset and progression of heart failure, we generated a transgenic model harboring the V49G mutation in PLB, which we identified as a superinhibitor of SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity in vitro, and studied the cardiac phenotype over the life span of the mouse. Overexpression of this mutant PLB was associated with significant depression in SR Ca2+ uptake rates. The inhibited SR function resulted in impaired cardiac contractile parameters in isolated cardiomyocytes and intact mice at 3 months of age. In cardiomyocytes, the attenuated mechanical parameters reflected a significant prolongation in the rate of the Ca2+ signal decay (T80) without alteration in the peak amplitude of the Ca2+ transient. The lack of peak amplitude alteration may reflect increased Ca2+ influx through the L-type Ca2+ channels, whose density was increased in transgenic myocytes, indicating an important compensatory response in an attempt to normalize systolic Ca2+ levels in these cells. The V49G mutant myocytes also exhibited significantly slower ICa inactivation, despite increased Ca2+ influx through the L-type Ca2+ channels, suggesting that the SR Ca2+ release was diminished (26Masaki H. Sato Y. Luo W. Kranias E.G. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H606-H612PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sham J.S. Cleemann L. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Importantly, similar phenotypic alterations were exhibited in a second line (line 4), which expressed the same levels of mutant PLB, indicating that the inhibitory effect was due to transgene expression and not any possible insertional mutation.The mechanisms underlying the superinhibitory effects of V49G mutant PLB in vivo are not clear. However, this study together with a previous one, utilizing a V49A mutant (23Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J. Kranias E.G. Giles W.R. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), emphasize that the Val49 residue in PLB, which is highly conserved among species, is important for the PLB/SERCA2a interaction and changes in this region have profound effects on SR function and cardiac contractility. Thus, the V49G mutation, employed in this study, may influence the three-dimensional structure of PLB and enhance its interaction with SERCA2a. Importantly, the normal ratio (10:1) of pentamers to monomers was not altered by this mutation in PLB, further supporting that the superinhibitory effect of the mutant may be due to its conformational change. An enhanced association between PLB and SERCA2a would be consistent with the inability of isoproterenol to fully relieve the V49G mutant PLB superinhibitory effects, similar to previous findings with the N27A PLB mutant (24Zhai J. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Kimura Y. MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, the reduced contractility in L37A and I40A PLB mutant mice could be completely over come by isoproterenol stimulation (22Zvaritch E. Backx P.H. Jirik F. Kimura Y. de Leon S. Schmidt A.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14985-14991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).It is of interest that cardiac-specific overexpression of the PLB V49G mutant induced cardiac hypertrophy in an attempt to normalize cardiac function (32Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 33Grossman W. Am. J. Med. 1980; 69: 576-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), which was severely depressed in mutant hearts. However, the molecular mechanisms that link depressed SR Ca2+ cycling to reprogramming of gene expression in the PLB V49G hearts are not clear. Hypertrophy was associated with induction or re-expression of a fetal gene program, including ANF, β-myosin heavy chain, and α-skeletal actin in these hearts (34Feldman A.M. Weinberg E.O. Ray P.E. Lorell B.H. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The increases in the protein expression levels of the slow myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) isoform (35Bristow M.R. Lancet. 1998; 352 Suppl. 1: SI8-SI14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may also contribute to the observed attenuation of contraction and relaxation rates in the mutant PLB hearts. Interestingly, the hypertrophic remodeling, which provided an initial compensatory phase, progressed to cardiac failure and premature death in this model expressing the V49G PLB superinhibitor. Previous studies on the N27A (24Zhai J. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Kimura Y. MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and L37A and I40A (22Zvaritch E. Backx P.H. Jirik F. Kimura Y. de Leon S. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14985-14991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) PLB superinhibitors also showed severely depressed SR and cardiac function in vivo, which were associated with hypertrophy by 3 months of age. However, the hypertrophic phenotype of the N27A, L37A, and I40A mutant mice did not progress to overt heart failure, as observed with the V49G mutant. The apparent differences between these transgenic models may be due to the expression levels of the various PLB mutants in vivo, the age of the mice studied, and/or the time course of transition between the compensatory hypertrophic response and heart failure. In addition, there may be differences in activated intrinsic hypertrophic signaling pathways, triggered by SR dysfunction, which lead to different courses of myocyte maladaptation among these transgenic mice. However, the present findings and those in other models (22Zvaritch E. Backx P.H. Jirik F. Kimura Y. de Leon S. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Lester J.W. Kranias E.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Invest. 2000; 106: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) suggest that multiple pathways, including disturbed SR Ca2+ homeostasis, may operate in concert to induce a hypertrophic response leading to heart failure.Several studies have indicated that cardiovascular mortality is higher in males than in females, which frequently exhibit preserved cardiac performance, and suggested a gender-dependent influence on the onset and progression of heart failure (36Adams Jr., K.F. Sueta C.A. Gheorghiade M. O'Connor C.M. Schwartz T.A. Koch G.G. Uretsky B. Swedberg K. McKenna W. Soler-Soler J. Califf R.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1816-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we also observed an early mortality in males (6 months) compared with females (15 months) in our model with genetically induced SR Ca2+-handling defects. The striking survival benefit in females was not due to differences in their levels of PLB, compared with age-matched males. Therefore, we investigated gender-specific differences in cardiac function and in the progression to heart failure. Males and females were examined during compensatory hypertrophy and after the appearance of symptoms of heart failure, using echocardiography. LV-to-body mass was about 50% increased by 3 months of age, and cardiac function was significantly depressed in male PLB mutant mice. The remodeling process accelerated the progression to heart failure, characterized by significant chamber dilation and a decrease in the ratio of wall thickness to chamber diameter (h/r) by 6 months of age. However, the progression to failure was delayed in females (37Kadokami T. McTiernan C.F. Kubota T. Frye C.S. Feldman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), indicating that, despite a similar degree of LV hypertrophy between males and females, there were significant gender differences in the LV-adaptive response to pathological hypertrophy and depressed function, similar to recent studies in the TNF-α overexpression model and in a rat model of pressure overload hypertrophy (38Weinberg E.O. Thienelt C.D. Katz S.E. Bartunek J. Tajima M. Rohrbach S. Douglas P.S. Lorell B.H. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1999; 34: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The etiology of these differences is unclear but may be related to: (a) a reduced adaptive hypertrophic reserve in males (39Weinberg E.O. Lee M.A. Weigner M. Lindpaintner K. Bishop S.P. Benedict C.R. Ho K.K. Douglas P.S. Chafizadeh E. Lorell B.H. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); (b) the lower mitochondria respiratory and lysosomal enzyme activity in females (40Koenig H. Goldstone A. Lu C.Y. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); (c) a higher percentage of the V1 myosin isozyme, which is up-regulated by estrogen in females (41Schaible T.F. Malhotra A. Ciambrone G. Scheuer J. Circ. Res. 1984; 54: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); and (d) the intrinsic gender-specific differences in cardiac muscle physiology and biochemistry (42Buttrick P. Scheuer J. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1336-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, estrogen signaling through the adult myocyte estrogen receptor may contribute to gender differences in gene expression in pathological hypertrophy (43Grohe C. Kahlert S. Lobbert K. Stimpel M. Karas R.H. Vetter H. Neyses L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in humans with congenital aortic stenosis and cardiac hypertrophy, there appears to be an overcompensation of myocardial contraction early on (44Donner R. Carabello B.A. Black I. Spann J.F. Am. J. Cardiol. 1983; 51: 946-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which is similar to that described in mutant PLB females in this study.In summary, our findings point to a primary defect in SR function as an inducer of a phenotype that resembles human dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular remodeling. The enhanced inhibition of SERCA2a by the V49G mutant PLB, associated with depressed myocyte calcium homeostasis, resulted in a remodeling process, which involved interaction between all components of the myocardium leading to overt heart failure. Furthermore, gender significantly influenced the evolution of the early responses to LV remodeling, including the transition to heart failure in the mutant PLB model. Future studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these responses, using gene expression profiling and proteomics, may unveil specific molecules or pathways by which depressed SR function influences the onset of hypertrophy and the transition to dilated cardiomyopathy in this model. Cardiac hypertrophy and failure are highly complex disorders that arise as a result of a combination of mechanical, hemodynamic, hormonal, and pathological stimuli (1Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). In response to these effectors, the heart undergoes an adaptive response of compensatory hypertrophy (2Chien K.R.

The activity of SERCA2a is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), a 52-amino acid, muscle-specific SR phosphoprotein (8Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 10Tada M. Yabuki M.

Dephosphorylated PLB inhibits the Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a, whereas the phosphorylated form of PLB dissociates from SERCA2a leading to increases in Ca2+ uptake rates and accelerated ventricular relaxation (11Luo W.

Cell Biochem. 1982; 46: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The role of PLB in the regulation of basal contractility has been elucidated through the development of genetically engineered mouse models. Phospholamban ablation resulted in significant increases in cardiac contractile parameters, whereas overexpressing PLB was associated with depressed cardiac function (14Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Actually, an inverse relationship between the ratio of PLB/SERCA2a and myocardial contractility was observed (16Koss K.L. Grupp I.L. Kranias E.G. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1997; 92: 17-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that any process that alters the relative levels of these proteins and/or the interaction between them may result in altered myocardial contractility. However, it is not currently known whether a primary defect in SR Ca2+ uptake, elicited by altered interactions between PLB and SERCA2a, may result in depressed cellular Ca2+homeostasis and drive the progressive deterioration of function leading to heart failure. Early studies evaluating the interaction between PLB and SERCA2a were directed toward the cytoplasmic domain (amino acid residues 1–30), which includes the phosphorylation sites in PLB (17Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jones L.R. Field L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11486-11488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the transmembrane interaction sites (amino acid residues 31–52) were shown to mediate the regulatory effects of PLB on SERCA2a affinity, with some mutations yielding increased inhibition, whereas others abolish the PLB inhibitory effects on SERCA2a in vitro (19Kimura Y.

Extension of these studies to in vivomodels indicated that overexpression of either L37A or I40A mutant PLB resulted in depressed cardiac myocyte Ca2+ kinetics and mechanical parameters associated with hypertrophy (22Zvaritch E. Backx P.H. Jirik F. Kimura Y. de Leon S. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Lester J.W. Kranias E.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14985-14991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Further support for the functional significance of the PLB transmembrane domain in mediating its regulatory effects on SERCA2a was provided by a recent study, in which a Val49 → Ala (V49A) mutant PLB was expressed in vivo, using recombinant adenoviruses. The V49A mutant acted dominantly to increase contractility in cardiac ventricular cells in the absence of catecholamines (23Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K. Gu Y. Martone M.E.

This study pointed out the importance of the PLB carboxyl terminus in mediating its interaction with SERCA2a and proposed that interfering with this interaction may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of dilated cardiomyopathy. To further elucidate the functional significance of the PLB Val49 residue in vivo, we generated a mutant, Val49 → Gly (V49G), which acts as a potent inhibitor of the Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a. Cardiac-specific overexpression of the V49G mutant PLB resulted in superinhibition of cardiac con"

The lipopolysaccharides located in the outer leaflet of the OM confer to the bacteria a polar and negatively charged surface, restricting the cellular uptake of toxic organic molecules and detergents such as bile salts, the detergents in the gut. However, although the OM is an effective protective barrier against harmful environmental components, it also represents an additional obstacle for the uptake of nutrients, which can be circumvented in three ways. While small hydrophilic nutrients (<600 Da) enter the periplasm by simple diffusion through porins in a non-selective manner (1Schirmer T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), larger molecules are taken up by pores with an internal binding site for the ligand (such as LamB) in a stereospecific and selective manner (2Ehrmann M. Ehrle R. Hofmann E. Boos W. Schlosser A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and can subsequently enter the cytoplasm by a variety of transporters located in the inner membrane (3Buchanan S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A few nutrients, notably iron and vitamin B12, need to be taken up into the periplasm against their concentration gradients. For this purpose, a complex consisting of TonB, ExbB, and ExbD couples the inner membrane proton motive force (pmf) to the active transport of iron siderophores and vitamin B12 across the OM through specialized porins. Recently, crystal structures were solved for two TonB-dependent receptors, FepA and FhuA (4Buchanan S.K. Smith B.S. Venkatramani L. Xia D. Esser L. Palnitkar M. Chakraborty R. van der Helm D.

Like all other known porins, they are β-barrels, but unlike the other porin structures they have much larger interiors, which are almost completely obscured by a protein domain sitting inside the barrel (termed the “cork” or “hatch region”), which is encoded within the N-terminal segment of either protein. Iron uptake into bacteria is initiated by the binding of the iron·siderophore complex to the high affinity OM receptor. The dissociation constant is around 100–200 nm (7Newton S.M. Allen J.S. Cao Z. Qi Z. Jiang X. Sprencel C. Igo J.D. Foster S.B. Payne M.A. Klebba P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Nikaido H. Saier Jr., M.H.

Science. 1997; 276: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), later rationalized by three-dimensional structural models (4Buchanan S.K. Smith B.S. Venkatramani L. Xia D. Esser L.

Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), has shown that this event triggers conformational changes in the OM receptor. This might allow TonB to contact specific regions on the receptor. It appears that “energized” TonB is then able to deliver its energy to the receptor, resulting in ligand translocation into the periplasm (10Reynolds P.R. Mottur G.P. Bradbeer C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4313-4319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Wooldridge K.G. Morrissey J.A. Williams P.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ExbB·ExbD are implicated in the recycling of TonB, from its high affinity OM receptor association to a high affinity inner membrane association (12Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The structural changes in this whole process have remained almost completely unclear. TonB of Escherichia coli is a protein consisting of 239 amino acids. Homologs of TonB have been found in several Gram-negative species (14Larsen R.A. Myers P.S. Skare J.T. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus is in the cytoplasm; the protein is anchored in the inner membrane by its uncleaved N-terminal signal sequence (15Postle K. Skare J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11000-11007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Karlsson M. Hannavy K. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and most of the protein extends into the periplasm. The membrane anchor sequence contains a set of highly conserved residues located on one face of the α-helix (SHLS motif). The sequence SXXXH (where X is any amino acid) has been defined as the minimal structural requirement for the coupling of TonB to the electrochemical gradient of the inner membrane (17Larsen R.A. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8111-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of TonB contains a long central region with a high percentage of proline residues between residues 70 and 102 (17%), which is thought to confer to TonB the conformational rigidity and extended shape necessary to span the periplasm, and thereby to allow the C-terminal domain to contact the receptor embedded in the OM (18Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational studies have defined the last 48 residues as being essential to make contact with the OM receptor (19Larsen R.A. Foster-Hartnett D. McIntosh M.A. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3213-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TonB forms a complex in the inner membrane with ExbB and ExbD (13Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), two membrane proteins that could potentially act as proton translocators. ExbB is homologous to the protein MotA, and ExbD has a similar topology as MotB, both of which are thought to exploit the proton gradient to drive the bacterial flagellum. ExbB has been proposed to modulate the conformation of TonB (20Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), as well as mediate its recycling (12Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but it has remained an enigma as to what these structural changes might be. Cross-linking studies have suggested the regions through which TonB might interact with its partners in the inner membrane: The contact with ExbB is mediated by the signal anchor (20Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas the residues responsible for the interaction with ExbD are unknown (21Higgs P.I. Myers P.S. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TonB and its associated proteins ExbB·ExbD thus play the role of an energy-transducing complex, coupling the electrochemical proton gradient of the inner membrane to active import processes across the OM (13Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Braun V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The energy is provided by the proton motive force (10Reynolds P.R. Mottur G.P. Bradbeer C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4313-4319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hancock R.W. Braun V. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28391-28397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) studies, a recognition site has been suggested on the receptor, the TonB box, a hydrophobic stretch of seven amino acids, which is highly conserved in all the TonB-dependent OM receptors (31Postle K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 591-601PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study resulted in the proposal that the conformation rather than the sequence of the TonB box is important for the recognition process between TonB and the receptor (19Larsen R.A. Foster-Hartnett D. McIntosh M.A. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3213-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been hypothesized that other regions of both interacting partners are also involved (27Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, TonB dependence is maintained if the complete cork domain is deleted (32Braun M. Killmann H. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), including the TonB box. It follows that the recognition site cannot be limited to the TonB box. A number of phages and colicins have exploited the TonB·ExbB·ExbD system for gaining entry into bacteria (34Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar system, TolQRA, has also been described as allowing entry for other phages and colicins (34Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular function of the TolQRA system has remained enigmatic, and its deletion leads to a leaky phenotype (although no such effect is caused by the deletion of TonB·ExbB·ExbD). Nevertheless, both systems can partially complement each other (35Eick-Helmerich K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5117-5126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of TolA (36Lubkowski J. Hennecke F. Plückthun A. Wlodawer A. Structure. 1999; 7: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and we became interested in finding out whether any structural similarity might exist between the C-terminal domains of both TonB and TolA. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of TonB at 1.55-Å resolution and show that this protein exhibits a novel fold that is without homology to any known structures. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that the C-terminal domain of TonB forms a tightly intertwined dimer. The sequence encoding residues 155–239 of tonB from E. coli strain JM83 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into the plasmid pAT37 (based on pQE30 from Qiagen). pAT37 codes for protein D (gpD) from bacteriophage λ with an N-terminal His-tag, under control of the T5 promoter (37Forrer P. Jaussi R. Gene. 1998; 224: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The tonB gene was fused to the C terminus of gpD, with an enterokinase cleavage site engineered by the polymerase chain reaction in between the two proteins. Recombinant bovine enterokinase (purchased from Invitrogen) cleaves after the sequence Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys. The recombinant protein was expressed overnight at 30 °C in E. coli XL1-Blue, after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed with a French press and, after centrifugation, the gpD-TonB fusion protein remained in the soluble fraction. The undigested fusion was purified at pH 8.0, using the coupled IMAC-IEX (cation exchange) protocol (38Plückthun A. Krebber A. Krebber C. Horn U. Knüpfer U. Wenderoth R. Nieba L. Proba K. Riesenberg D. McCafferty J. Hoogenboom H.R. Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 203-252Google Scholar) on a BIOCAD-60 workstation. After dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, the cleavage reaction was performed at room temperature for 4 h, using 1 unit per mg of fusion of the recombinant bovine enterokinase (Invitrogen). The solution was then dialyzed against 50 mm Mes/Hepes/acetate buffer, pH 8.0. Removal of gpD and enterokinase was again achieved with the coupled IMAC-IEX (cation exchange) protocol, based on the different pI of TonB, gpD, and enterokinase. The C-terminal domain of TonB was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.5 and was concentrated to 15 mg/ml. Crystallization was performed by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C. Crystal screen I (Hampton Research) was used for the initial screening. Small, rod-shaped crystals were found under conditions 6, 19, 27, and 36. The final refined crystallization conditions were 28–30% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Tris buffer at pH 7.5, 50–100 mm CaCl2. After refinement of the conditions, crystals were grown to the size of 0.3–0.5 mm. When a crystal was picked up from a droplet, the diffraction pattern showed split spots or high mosaicity. To improve their quality, crystals were moved from the droplet to a well containing mother liquor and stored for more than 1 day. Such treatment both increased the resolution of diffraction and lowered the mosaicity. TonB crystals were found to belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with the unit cell parameters a = 63.78 Å, b = 86.34 Å, c = 26.56 Å. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules, and the V M value is 1.89 Å3/Da (solvent content 35%). The structure of TonB was solved by derivatization with Br− ions (39Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 40Dauter Z. Li M. Wlodawer A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To prepare a crystal for this procedure, it was soaked for 50 s in a solution containing 1.0m KBr in addition to the crystallization buffer. Subsequently, the crystal was picked up with a nylon loop (Hampton Research) and was flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream. All data sets were collected at 100 K using the ADSC Quantum 4 charge-coupled device detector on the synchrotron beamline X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY. The bromine fluorescence edge was scanned to determine the energy of the inflection, peak, and remote points. Three data sets were measured at 2.0-Å resolution to provide all information necessary for a multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiment. In addition, a data set extending to 1.55 Å was obtained for the purpose of structure refinement. Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), utilizing three data sets corresponding to the peak, inflection, and remote wavelengths, in the resolution range 10–2.5 Å. These sites were also confirmed with the program SHELXD (43Sheldrick G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 628-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The phases from SOLVE were modified and extended to 1.55 Å using the program DM (44Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program suite (45Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19825) Google Scholar), with the solvent content set at 25%. The mean figure of merit of the phase set was 0.608 for the 10–2.5 Å data after SOLVE, and 0.489 for 20–1.55 Å after DM (0.780 for 20–2.5 Å). The initial model was built using the automatic model-building option of the program ARP/wARP (46Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar) with the full-DM phase set as input. The model was rebuilt with the program O (47Jones T.A. Kieldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) using either electron density maps based on the combination of the MAD and model phases, or straight 2F o − F c maps. The combined phase set was obtained using SIGMAA in the CCP4 program package. After each cycle of rebuilding, the model was refined using SHELXL (48Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar) at the resolution range of 20 to 1.55 Å, without applying any non-crystallographic (NCS) restraints, as the latter prevented proper convergence. Eight full cycles of remodeling and refinement were performed, with the refinement of individual anisotropicB-factors for all atoms initiated in cycle six. In addition to protein atoms, 219 water molecules and four bromide ions have been added to the model. The R-value for all reflections between 20 and 1.55 Å is 16.0% (R free 23.0%). The geometrical properties of the model were assessed by the program PROCHECK (49Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the secondary structure elements were assigned by the program PROMOTIF (50Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M.

The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of TonB has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, and has been refined using SHELXL at 20–1.55 Å, yielding a model with lowR-factor and excellent stereochemistry. The refinement statistics and the indicators of model quality are listed in TableII. The electron density maps (both the combined map utilizing the phases of the MAD data and of the model, and the final 2F o − F c map) are generally of excellent quality (Fig. 1). However, both maps are poorly defined in the neighborhood of residues 194–201. In this region, B-factors of all atoms are relatively high, indicating extensive flexibility of the polypeptide chain. Some disorder is also present at both termini of each molecule. Residues that are not visible in the maps include the first ten N-terminal amino acids of our construct (residues 155–164), as well as the last one or two residues on the C terminus (residues 238 and 239 of molecule A, and 239 of molecule B). The electron density of the remaining parts of the protein is very well defined. The mean positional error in atomic coordinates as estimated by the Luzzati plot is 0.16 Å. All non-glycine and non-proline residues of the model lie either in the most favorable region or in the additionally allowed region of the Ramachandran plot.Table IIRefinement statistics for the final coordinates of the C-terminal domain of TonBResolution range20.0–1.55 ÅUnique reflections used20,365R cryst16.0%R free23.0% (5% test set)r.m.s. deviations from idealityBond lengths0.009 ÅAngles0.028 ÅNon-zero chiral volumes0.054 Å3Zero chiral volumes0.047 Å3Number of amino acid residues73 + 74Number of protein atoms578 + 586Number of heteroatoms4Number of solvent atoms219 Open table in a new tab The C-terminal domain of TonB is cylinder-shaped with the length of 65 Å, and the diameter of 25 Å, with two protein chains forming a single compact entity. Each chain is rich in β-strands (∼50% of the secondary structure) with much more limited extent (∼15%) of residues found in helical conformation (either α-helix or 310 helix). Each monomer contains three β-strands (strand S1, residues 169–182; S2, 188–194; and S3, 221–236) and one α-helix (residues 200–210 in molecule A, and 200–211 of molecule B). In addition, a short 310 helix includes residues 211–213 of molecule A. All six β-strands make a large antiparallel β-sheet. The β-strand S3 of each monomer is swapped between the monomers (Fig. 2). Four β-strands, S1 and S3 of both molecules, are located on one side, whereas the two short β-strands S2 and the helices are located on the other side (Fig. 3).Figure 3Stereo ribbon diagram of the C-terminal domain of TonB, showing the intertwined dimer. The color scheme is the same as in Fig. 2. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1IHR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The two monomers differ slightly from each other. At any refinement stage, application of non-crystallographic restraints between the two molecules resulted in significantly worse behavior than if such restraints were not utilized. The r.m.s. deviation between the Cα atoms of the two monomers is 0.42 Å, whereas the r.m.s. deviation between the side-chain atoms of the two monomers is 1.15 Å. In the case of the main chain of the protein, the largest differences are found at the N terminus. As judged by their high temperature factors, both termini are located in highly flexible regions of the structure. The difference between Cα positions of Ala-165, the first visible residue on the N terminus, exceeds 2 Å (residues preceding Ala-165 were not visible in either molecule). In the case of the side chains, several residues show significantly different values of the χ1 angle. These residues include Leu-170, Arg-171, Glu-173, Asn-200, Lys-219, and Lys-231. The only hydrophobic amino acid among them is Leu-170, and different orientation of its side chain leads to the presence of more hydrophobic contacts in molecule B. The other residues are all polar or charged, and all are solvent-exposed. The orientations of the Cγ atoms in the residues belonging to the β-sheet (Arg-171, Glu-173, Lys-231) closely coincide. For positively charged residues (Arg-171 and Lys-231 of both molecules) Cγ atoms point toward the N terminus of molecule A. The Cγ atoms of the negatively charged residue Glu-173 point toward the N terminus of molecule B. Asn-200 is located just after the highly flexible loop and is itself flexible, judged by its high B-factor. Lys-219 is located at the end of the molecule and is also flexible. The interactions between the two protein chains that form a single compact molecule of the C-terminal domain of TonB are unusually extensive. The dimeric interface area covers 41% of the surface of each monomer, thus the individual chains are unlikely to be able to exist independently and the protein becomes stable only as a dimer. The region of the β-sheet shows tight dimeric interactions, whereas the interactions on the opposite side of the molecule are not as close. Although the single antiparallel β-sheet present in the dimer is composed of strands originating from different molecules, the hydrogen bonding pattern is close to ideal. The loop between β-strand S2 and the α-helix is very flexible, as indicated by its highB-factor. The average B-factors of the main-chain atoms in this loop are 71 Å2 and 60 Å2 for molecules A and B, respectively, as compared with the respective averages for other areas of 20.6 Å2 and 21.7 Å2. Crystal packing in the vicinity of these loops is rather loose, resulting in the formation of clefts or channels on the molecular surface. The channels are made by residues 195–200 and 172–176 in both molecules, the former belonging to the loop, and the latter to the β-strand S1. The binding of a nutrient, such as vitamin B12 or an iron·siderophore complex, to the external face of an outer membrane receptor triggers a series of conformational changes: The N-terminally located TonB box, which is hidden within the barrel of the unliganded receptor, is made to project in an extended form into the periplasm and, thus, becomes freely accessible for interaction with the C-terminal domain of TonB (28Merianos H.J. Cadieux N. Lin C.H. Kadner R.J. Cafiso D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additionally, subtle structural changes of the receptor observed crystallographically, such as the upward translation of selected loops of the cork domain (also termed “hatch region”), may disrupt hydrophobic interactions between the so-called switch helix (residues 24–29 in FhuA) and the internal wall of the barrel, and the helix unfolds (6Locher K.P.

Since elevated levels of unesterified cholesterol are toxic to cells (1Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), intricate mechanisms have evolved to regulate both the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and the uptake and metabolism of dietary cholesterol (2Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is now clear that cells can also reduce cholesterol accumulation through an active efflux process (3Mendez A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1807-1821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the clearest demonstration of the importance of the active efflux pathway in regulating cholesterol homeostasis is Tangier disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by nearly absent levels of circulating high density lipoproteins and accumulation of cholesterol esters in peripheral tissues (4Assmann G. von Eckardstein A.

Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, Tangier fibroblasts have impaired cholesterol efflux in response to apolipoprotein stimulation while retaining their ability to promote cholesterol efflux by passive diffusion to whole lipoproteins and other artificial acceptors (6Francis G.A.

Conversely, overexpression of ABCA1 in cell culture systems stimulates the efflux of cholesterol to apolipoprotein A-I (14Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These findings tightly link ABCA1 function to the active efflux of cellular cholesterol. ABC transporters represent one of the largest gene families identified to date, with representation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (16Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). The ABC transporters are polytopic membrane proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to the movement of a variety of molecules, both small and large, across lipid bilayers. ABCA1 is a full ABC transporter, with one open reading frame encoding two six-transmembrane domains and two ATP binding cassettes. Like CFTR, the cystic fibrosis transporter, ABCA1 has a large central region rich in polar and charged residues similar to the CFTR regulatory domain, but it is unique in that this domain is interrupted by a stretch of highly hydrophobic amino acids (17Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). CFTR, like several other members of the ABC class, lacks an obvious signal sequence at its amino terminus, indicating that its first transmembrane domain probably performs the task of initially anchoring the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum during protein synthesis. The initial description of the mouse and human ABCA1 cDNAs suggested that a hydrophobic domain, located ∼600 amino acids from the amino terminus, would also serve this signal anchor function (17Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E.

Recent work, however, has uncovered an in-frame, upstream methionine that if used as the translation initiation start site would result in a 60-amino acid NH2-terminal extension of the protein (19Pullinger C.R. Hakamata H. Duchateau P.N. Eng C. Aouizerat B.E. Cho M.H. Fielding C.J. Kane J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Costet P. Luo Y.

A. 2000; 97: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This extension contains a potentially cleavable signal sequence with cleavage predicted to occur between amino acids 45 and 46 (19). Wang et al. have recently reported that this extension is important for efflux activity (15Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the role that the amino-terminal extension plays in the cell biology of ABCA1. We found that it was critical for stable expression of ABCA1, an observation that could not be accounted for solely by the more favorable context for translation initiation in which the upstream methionine resides. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acids in the extension appear to function as a topologically important signal anchor sequence whose cleavage is not required for efflux activity. The signal anchor sequence inserts transporter constructs into the endoplasmic reticular membrane with the NH2 terminus of the protein on the cytosolic face of the membrane. This orientation places the largest putative amino acid loop of the transporter in the exoplasmic space. It is within this loop, previously proposed to be an intracellular domain, that a large number of loss-of-function mutations in Tangier disease patients are clustered. Finally, we provide evidence that the signal anchor sequence is not cleaved from the transporter, permitting us to tag the amino terminus of the protein with GFP and to visualize the transporter's cellular localization by confocal fluorescent microscopy. These results establish the importance of the upstream 60 amino acids for protein expression and indicate that the putative signal anchor sequence contained within the extension does indeed function to correctly orient the transporter in the membrane. The orientation imposed by the use of this signal anchor sequence is different from that which has been proposed in previous models of ABCA1. Thus, our results necessitate a reconsideration of the transporter's membrane topology. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated suppliers: LipofectAMINE-2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.), Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen),N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs, MA). ABCA1 cDNAs were constructed by ligation of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments amplified from normal human fibroblast RNA. The resulting clones were sequenced in their entirety on both strands and found to be identical to previously published wild type human cDNA sequences except at four codons that have been reported to represent common human polymorphisms (G for A at 2649 (Met for Ile at amino acid 883), T for C at 4943 (Leu for Pro at amino acid 1648), A for G at 5921 (Lys for Arg at amino acid 1974), T for C at 6503 (Leu for Pro at amino acid 2168) (12Lawn R.M.

For purposes of comparison with the older literature on human ABCA1, 60 amino acids or 60 nucleotides must be subtracted from our sequence numbers in order to match designations taken from clones lacking the full first exon; the older numbering designation used a putative start site of translation at the codon beginning with nucleotide 121 (12Lawn R.M.

The nucleotide and amino acid numbering scheme used in this paper designates the upstream initiator methionine as the first amino acid, and the codon that encodes it represents nucleotide positions 1–3. Wild type ABCA1 cDNAs, starting at nucleotide position 1 or 115, were cloned into the expression plasmid, pcDNA1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Modifications in these clones were made using standard recombinant DNA methods in order to generate proteins with alterations in their NH2 and COOH termini. The proteins used in these studies are depicted in Fig. 1 A and are as follows: 1) full-length ABCA1 (wild type (WT) ABCA1), ABCA1 initiating at Met-1 and ending with amino acid 2261; 2) epitope-tagged ABCA1 (c1), full-length ABCA1 to which a 9-amino acid epitope tag (TETSQVAPA), derived from bovine rhodopsin, was added at the C terminus of the protein (this tag is recognized by the ID4 monoclonal antibody) (24Molday R.S.

For antibody production, DNA sequences representing amino acids 2071–2261 of ABCA1 were ligated into the pQE-30 NH2-6-histidine plasmid (Qiagen). All constructs were verified by restriction analysis with sequencing on both strands of regions that had been generated by polymerase chain reaction. COS-7 or HEK293 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE-2000 as recommended by the manufacturer in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with DNA-LipofectAMINE complexes formed in serum-free Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.). 24–48 h after transfection, cells were used in efflux assays or harvested for Western or Northern blotting as described below. The 6-His-tagged ABCA1 polypeptide was expressed in XL1-Blue bacteria and purified by denaturing Ni2+chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 1× PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, and probed with anti-ABCA1 sera (1:1000) in blocking buffer. Bound antibody was detected with an anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal; Pierce) followed by exposure to x-ray film, or alternatively, images were captured by digital photography (FluorChem Imaging System, Alpha Innotech Corp, San Leandro, CA). 36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with warm PBS and incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 min at 37 °C. [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label; ICN) was then added to a final concentration of 80 μCi/ml, and the cells were further incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C followed by a chase in complete media for 2.5 h. After labeling, cells were chilled on ice, washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer. For deglycosylation assays, immunoprecipitated proteins were heated for 10 min at 100 °C, brought to 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with 1500 units of N-glycosidase F for 1 h at 37 °C, as recommended by the manufacturer (New England BioLabs). After SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using a PhosphorImaging STORM860 system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Relative molecular weights of the c3 and c4 polypeptides were determined using an exponential equation (y = 270.069 * 10−1.029x, r 2 = 0.986) derived from a standard curve of unstained protein molecular weight markers (Sigma). Cells were scraped into PBS and collected by low speed centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and homogenized as described above. The suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The 15,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer using 10 strokes of the Dounce homogenizer with the loose fitting pestle. The 15,000 ×g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer as above. 0.7 ml of the 15,000 × g membrane suspension was applied to the top of a 10-ml linear 15–40% sucrose gradient formed on top of a 0.5-ml 70% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C in an SW41Ti rotor. Fractions were displaced from the bottom of tube with 70% sucrose, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were stored at −70 °C. Equal volumes from each fraction were analyzed by denaturing PAGE utilizing a Tris acetate-buffered 3–8% polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) under reducing conditions, according to the manufacturer's procedures. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted as described above. Aliquots from each fraction were taken to measure total protein, by the BCA method (Pierce), or free cholesterol (27Artiss J.D. Zak B. Microchem. J. 1980; 25: 535-542Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 293 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the GFP-ABCA1 construct or unfused GFP. 36 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 5 min. Mounted coverslips were analyzed on a Leica TCS SP confocal scanning laser microscope using a × 63 oil immersion lens. Images of 0.5-μm sections were captured using the Leica TCS-NT software package. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of human ABCA1 was generated using a 6-histidine fusion protein representing amino acids 2071–2261 as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1 B). The polypeptide proved to be immunogenic, inducing a high titer antisera that was specific for ABCA1 by three criteria. First, in normal human fibroblasts, it recognized a polypeptide running at ∼240–250 kDa that was inducible by cholesterol (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). Second, since ABCA1 is a member of a large family of homologous transporters, we tested the specificity of the antisera in fibroblasts taken from a patient with Tangier disease whose ABCA1 gene contains a homozygous frameshift mutation. This patient's deletion of two base pairs from exon 22 would result in termination of ABCA1 proximal to the sequences contained in the polypeptide used to generate the antisera (11Rust S. Rosier M. Funke H. Real J. Amoura Z. Piette J.C. Deleuze J.F. Brewer H.B. Duverger N. Denefle P. Assmann G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 21Santamarina-Fojo S.

Fredrickson D.S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As expected, a lysate of cultured fibroblasts from this patient (TD2, Fig. 1 C), loaded with cholesterol, showed no immunoreactivity for ABCA1. The expected ∼250-kDa protein was readily detected in lysates of fibroblasts taken from normal individuals (Nl) as well as from another patient with Tangier disease (TD1, Fig. 1 C) whose ABCA1 gene contains a point mutation that has previously been shown not to ablate protein expression (28Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Finally, in 293 cells transfected with full-length ABCA1, a band of the expected molecular weight was produced, while mock-transfected cells had no immunoreactive band (Fig.1 D). To investigate the importance of the putative first 60 amino acids of ABCA1, we constructed several cDNAs encoding proteins that either did or did not contain these residues (Fig. 1 A, c1 and c2, respectively). These cDNAs were C-terminally tagged with a rhodopsin epitope sequence, cloned into an expression vector, and then transfected into 293 cells. Expression of the constructs was first compared by radiolabeling cellular proteins followed by immunoprecipitation with the ID4 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the rhodopsin epitope (Fig.2 A). Compared with cells expressing the full-length construct (c1), ABCA1 lacking the 60-amino acid extension (c2) produced little or no protein. These immunoprecipitation results were confirmed using the anti-ABCA1 antisera in immunoblots of 293 cells transfected with the c1 and c2 constructs (Fig. 2 B). Similar to the immunoprecipitation data, the construct initiating at the downstream methionine 61 yielded little or no signal by immunoblot, whereas the full-length construct produced a robust band. Since Northern analysis showed comparable levels of ABCA1 mRNA generated by both the c1 and c2 constructs (Fig. 2 C), the lack of protein expression by the c2 construct could not be due to a poorer transfection efficiency or transcription rate of the DNA encoding the truncated protein. Since the nucleotide sequences surrounding the downstream methionine at position 61 have a suboptimal context for translation initiation (29Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar, 30Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar, 31Kozak M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), a relatively trivial explanation for the above finding would be that constructs dependent on initiation at Met-61 are poorly translated (19Pullinger C.R. Hakamata H. Duchateau P.N. Eng C. Aouizerat B.E. Cho M.H. Fielding C.J. Kane J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test the ability of Met-61 to serve as a translational initiator, a construct was generated which truncated ABCA1 just proximal to its first putative transmembrane domain. Although translation initiation at Met-61 did not support significant expression of the full transporter, it was able to drive expression of the 570-aa segment of ABCA1 that is proximal to this putative first transmembrane domain (Fig. 3 A, mockversus c4, performed in duplicate). The expression of c4 was next compared with a construct that was otherwise identical (c3) but included the 60-aa extension (Fig. 3 B, compare c4versus c3). Expression of c4 was somewhat decreased compared with c3, but this difference could not solely account for the difference in expression of the full transporters shown in Fig. 2. However, when the proximal six-transmembrane cassette (6-TM1) was added back to these truncation mutants, expression of the half-transporter was markedly diminished in the construct initiating at Met-61 (Fig.3 B, compare c6 versus c5). These data indicate that the first 60 amino acids of ABCA1 provide a function that is critical to expression of the polytopic membrane protein. The marked size difference and heterogeneity of the band representing c3 (molecular mass of ∼90 kDa) when compared with the c4 band (∼60 kDa) could not be explained by their predicted polypeptide molecular masses (72.2 versus 64.9 kDa, respectively), suggesting that c3 was undergoing a post-translational modification. Since previous models of the topology of ABCA1 had suggested that all but one of the potential N-glycosylation sites in these polypeptides were intracellular and therefore would not be glycosylated, we next examined the post-translational modifications of these proteins. There are 12 potential N-glycosylation sites between the putative signal sequence and amino acid 630, where the c3 and c4 constructs were truncated. To examine glycosylation, ABCA1 constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells, and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with the ID4 monoclonal antibody. The precipitated proteins were then either treated or not treated with the glycoamidase enzyme,N-glycosidase F, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The c4 polypeptide, which initiates at Met-61, ran as a narrow band whose migration was unaffected by glycoamidase treatment (Fig.3 C). In contrast, glycoamidase treatment of the c3 polypeptide significantly increased its migration rate and resolution. The c5 polypeptide, which contains the putative transmembrane domains of the half-transporter, also had its migration dramatically increased by deglycosylation, whereas the c6 protein, lacking the signal sequence, was barely detectable in this assay (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). These findings indicate that ABCA1 constructs that contain distal transmembrane domains require the upstream signal sequence for stable protein expression and cannot use the downstream transmembrane domains as surrogates for signal anchor activity. In the absence of this signal sequence, protein detection is dramatically compromised, presumably due to protein degradation resulting from misfolding following the failure to insert into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results establish that the 60-amino acid extension of ABCA1 contains a functional signal sequence that directs the translocation of distal sequences across the endoplasmic reticulum. This translocation results in the N-glycosylation of asparagine residues located in the region from amino acid 98 (the first potential glycosylated asparagine) to amino acid 630, the residue at which the constructs used were terminated. Several of the computer algorithms used to predict signal sequence structure suggested that the ABCA1 sequence would be cleaved between residues 45 and 46 (19, 21). Fig. 3 Bprovides conflicting evidence as to the cleavage of the signal sequence. The molecular weight difference between polypeptides c3 and c4 is determined by the number of residues remaining in the 60-amino acid extension following translocation and signal cleavage, should the latter occur. If no cleavage occurs, the entire 60-amino acid extension would be present with the increase in size of c3 over c4 calculated to be 7.3 kDa. With cleavage after residue 45, c3 would only be 15 amino acids larger than c4, a size difference calculated to be 1.8 kDa. The relative molecular weights of the deglycosylated c3 and c4 proteins were determined by comparison with unstained molecular weight markers using SDS-PAGE (methods and data not shown). The difference between c3 and c4 was found to be 6.4 kDa (c3, 69.7 kDa versus the expected 72.3 kDa; c4, 63.3 kDa versus the expected 64.9 kDa) and indicated no signal cleavage. In contrast, the c5 protein was noted to yield a doublet on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, B andC), suggesting the possibility that the faster migrating band might arise from signal cleavage of the polypeptide following membrane translocation. To examine this issue further, we tested whether secretion of the c3 protein occurred. Lacking the distal transmembrane segments of the transporter contained in the c5 construct, the c3 polypeptide's cleavage by a signal peptidase would be predicted to yield a soluble protein within the ER lumen"
https://openalex.org/W2037892813,"Previously, we reported two types of neutral ceramidase in mice, one solubilized by freeze-thawing and one not. The former was purified as a 94-kDa protein from mouse liver, and cloned (Tani, M., Okino, N., Mori, K., Tanigawa, T., Izu, H., and Ito, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 11229–11234). In this paper, we describe the purification, molecular cloning, and subcellular distribution of a 112-kDa membrane-bound neutral ceramidase of rat kidney, which was completely insoluble by freeze-thawing. The open reading frame of the enzyme encoded a polypeptide of 761 amino acids having nine putative N-glycosylation sites and one possible transmembrane domain. In the ceramidase overexpressing HEK293 cells, 133-kDa (Golgi-form) and 113-kDa (endoplasmic reticulum-form) Myc-tagged ceramidases were detected, whereas these two proteins were converted to a 87-kDa protein concomitantly with loss of activity when expressed in the presence of tunicamycin, indicating that theN-glycosylation process is indispensable for the expression of the enzyme activity. Immunohistochemical analysis clearly showed that the ceramidase was mainly localized at the apical membrane of proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts in rat kidney, while in liver the enzyme was distributed with endosome-like organelles in hepatocytes. Interestingly, the kidney ceramidase was found to be enriched in the raft microdomains with cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside. Previously, we reported two types of neutral ceramidase in mice, one solubilized by freeze-thawing and one not.

Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Ceramide (N-acylsphingosine; Cer),1 a common lipid backbone of sphingolipids, functions as a second messenger in a variety of cellular events including apoptosis and cell differentiation (3Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 256: 1769-1771Crossref Scopus (1618) Google Scholar, 4Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Sphingosine (Sph) has bifunctional effects on cell growth,i.e. it exerts mitogenic (5Zhang H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and apoptosis inducing (6Ohta H. Sweeney E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar) activities, depending on the cell type and cell cycle. Sph-1-phosphate (S1P) was found to function as an intra- and intercellular second messenger to regulate cell growth (7Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), motility (8Kupperman E. An S. Osborne N. Waldron S. Stainier D.Y.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and morphology (9Van Brocklyn J.R. Tu Z. Edsall L.C. Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4626-4632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S1P inhibits the apoptosis induced by Cer and Fas ligand (10Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), indicating that the balance of Cer/Sph/S1P affects cell phenotype. Ceramidase (CDase, EC 3.5.1.23) is an enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of the N-acyl linkage of Cer to produce Sph, which can be phosphorylated to S1P by sphingosine kinase (11Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Sph is not produced by de novo synthesis (12Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and thus the activity of CDase is crucial not only for switching off the Cer-induced signaling but also for generation of Sph and S1P. CDase is classified into two categories: acid and neutral/alkaline enzymes depending on pH optimum. Acid CDase is thought to be a housekeeping enzyme to catabolize Cer in lysosomes. The enzyme was purified from human urine (13Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Science. 1972; 178: 1100-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Neutral/alkaline CDase seems to change the balance of Cer/Sph/S1P in response to various stimuli including cytokines and growth factors, and could modulate the sphingolipid-mediated signaling. For example, the activity of membrane-associated neutral CDase was shown to be up-regulated by platelet-derived growth factor in rat glomerular mesangial cells (17Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and the enzyme activity was modulated in a bimodal manner by interleukin-1β in rat hepatocytes (18Nikolva-Karakashian M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), resulting in a decrease of Cer concomitantly with an increase of Sph. However, the biological function of the enzyme is still not clear. Recently, cDNAs encoding sphingomyelinase, Sph kinase (19Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

The functions of sphingolipids are now open for elucidation at the molecular level. In the past few years, molecular cloning of neutral/alkaline CDases, one of the missing links of sphingolipid signaling, has been performed in mice (21Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H.

In the present paper, we report the purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a 112-kDa membrane-bound CDase of rat kidney, which was absolutely resistant to extraction with freeze-thawing and had an optimum pH of 6–7. It is worth noting that neutral/alkaline CDase of human brain is specifically localized in mitochondria, suggesting the existence of a Cer pool in this organelle (22Bawab S.E. Roddy P. Qian T.

On the other hand, we show here using a specific antibody against the neutral CDase that the enzyme was mainly localized at apical membranes of proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting ducts in rat kidney, while in rat liver the enzyme was distributed with endosome-like organelles in hepatocytes. Furthermore, the kidney CDase was recovered in the detergent-insoluble, cholesterol, and GM1-enriched fractions by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, suggesting that the enzyme is present in the raft microdomains. Monoclonal antibody YA30 against LGP85 (Limp-2) and CHOP cells were kind gifts from Dr. K. Akasaki (Fukuyama University, Japan) and Dr. K.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 682-689Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar. HEK293 cell (JCRB9068, established by F. L. Graham) was from the Human Science Research Resource Bank. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. CDase activity was measured using C12-NBD-Cer as a substrate (25Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake M. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol.

Briefly, 550 pmol of C12-NBD-Cer was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 µl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.25% Triton X-100. The reaction was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. After being dried up with a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Inc.), the sample was dissolved in 30 µl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia (90/20/0.5, v/v). The NBD-dodecanoic acid released and C12-NBD-Cer produced were quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (Shimadzu, Japan). One enzyme unit was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 µmol of NBD-dodecanoic acid/min from C12-NBD-Cer under the conditions described above. A value of 10−3 and 10−6 units of enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit and 1 microunit, respectively. To characterize the CDase, various cations at 5 mm as a final concentration were added, or 150 mm GTA buffer at different pH values was used instead of Tris-HCl buffer. In some cases, 100 pmol of [14C]Cer (C16:0/d18:1) was used instead of the fluorescent Cer as a substrate. The reverse hydrolysis reaction of the CDase was determined by the method described in Ref. 25Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake M. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol.

After sonication for 2 min on ice, the homogenate was then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was used as a detergent-extracted fraction. The membrane fractions of rat kidney and liver were suspended in 100 µl of 0.25 msucrose containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 µg/ml leupeptin. The solutions were frozen in ethanol-dry ice immediately and thawed in warm water at 37 °C. The procedure was repeated the number of times indicated.

The precipitate was suspended in 100 µl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and used as a membrane-bound fraction. The CDase (1.14 units), extracted from the membrane fraction of rat kidney with a mixture of 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Tween 20, was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (200 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX (buffer A) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system (Yamazen Co., Osaka, Japan). After sample loading, the column was washed with 300 ml of buffer A followed by a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The eluted fractions containing the CDase activity were pooled, and then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 6FF column (100 ml) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system. The column was washed with 200 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and then the CDase was eluted using a linear gradient of 0–2% Lubrol PX in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The eluate was pooled and loaded onto a column of chelating Sepharose FF (50 ml) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer A and 100 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mNaCl and the CDase activity was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 m NH4Cl at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated about 10-fold using a MiniTan ultrafiltration system (Millipore). The buffer was exchanged to 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, using the same apparatus. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a HiTrap lentil lectin column (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, and 0.5 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using a BioCAD system (Applied Biosystems). The CDase was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5m methyl-α-d-glucoside. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep (Millipore) and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.3% Lubrol PX at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min using a BioCAD system. The purified CDase was concentrated with a Y-shaped gel a modified form of a funnel-shaped gel (27Hatt P.D. Quadroni M. Staudenmann W. James P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After the concentration, the 112-kDa protein band localized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue was cut out, equilibrated with SDS sample buffer, and loaded again on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted on a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 112-kDa protein (about 3 µg) was cut out and treated in situ with lysylendopeptidase AP-1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Peptides released from the membrane were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC using a C8 column (1.0 × 100 mm), and sequenced using a pulse-liquid phase protein sequencer (Procise cLc, Applied Biosystems). The sequences of four peptides obtained after digestion with lysylendopeptidase AP-1 showed high identity to the mouse liver neutral CDase (21Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and thus we designed two primers based on the nucleotide sequence of the mouse enzyme. PCR using sense (5′-AGGAAATGTTGCTAATGTGC-3′) and antisense primers (5′-GGTGACACGTCTCCGAGAT-3′) was performed with the cDNA library of rat kidney (Takara Shuzo Co., Otsu, Japan) as a template in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied in Biosystems) using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied in Biosystems). The cycling parameters for PCR were 94 °C for 30 s, 51 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and the cycle number was 40. After this amplification, a 325-base pair PCR product containing the sequence of rat CDase was obtained. To obtain the full-length cDNA encoding the rat CDase, colony hybridization was performed using the α-32P-labeled 325-base pair PCR product as a probe after concentration of the CDase cDNA with a CloneCaptureTM Selection Kit (CLONTECH). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Colony hybridization was carried out by the standard method (28Sambrook H. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a Bigdye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems), and a DNA Sequencer (model 377A, Applied Biosystem). A cDNA fragment encoding the open reading frame of rat CDase was prepared by PCR using 5′ primer containing aHindIII site (5′-AGTAAGCTTATCGAAAACCACAAAGATTCAGGGA-3′) and 3′ primer containing a XhoI site (5′-GCCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACAATTTCAAAAGGGGAAGA-3′) and the cloned rat cDNA (pAPkCD) as a template. The PCR product was inserted into theHindIII and XhoI sites of pET23b vector (Novagen) with a COOH-terminal histidine tag. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the construct in the presence of ampicillin (100 µg/ml). To obtain the recombinant CDase, 2 ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 100 ml of LB in the presence of ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubated for no more than 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet (inclusion bodies) was lysed by sonication in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea. Recombinant protein was purified using a HiTrap chelating column (Ni2+) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified protein was dialyzed against distilled water before being used for immunization. From a rabbit immunized with the purified recombinant CDase, antiserum was obtained and purified with a HiTrap Protein A column according to the manufacturer's instructions. CHOP cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells that express polyoma LT antigen for supporting efficient replication of eukaryotic expression vectors (29Hefferman M. Dennis W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were grown in a α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney cell, were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 60 µg/ml kanamycin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. cDNA transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINETMPlus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To obtain Myc-tagged CDase, cDNA encoding the CDase was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) vector (Invitrogen Co.) by PCR using a 5′ primer with a KpnI restriction site (5′-AGGGTACCGAAATGGCAAAGCGAACCTTCTCC-3′) and a 3′ primer with aXhoI restriction site and disrupted stop codon (5′-GCCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACAACTTCAAAAGGAGAAGA-3′). Cells were treated with tunicamycin to block the N-glycosylation of neutral CDase. Medium containing tunicamycin (10 µg/ml) was added at 4 h after transfection of CDase gene and cells were harvested after 12 h. Measurement of protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Protein transfer onto a polyvinyldifluoride membrane was performed using TransBlot SD (Bio-Rad) according to the method described in Ref. 31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar. After treatment with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with first antibody (anti-neutral CDase antibody, anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen), or anti-CD71 antibody (Harian Sera-Lab)) for 1 day at 4 °C. After a wash with T-TBS, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. After another wash with T-TBS, the ECL reaction was performed for 2–3 min as recommended by the manufacturer, and chemiluminescent signals were visualized on STORM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Percoll density gradient centrifugation was performed according to the method described in Ref.32Symons L.J. Jonas A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar. The tissues were homogenized for 15–20 strokes in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 msucrose and 1 mm EDTA with a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatant obtained was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 m sucrose. This suspension was mixed with isotonic Percoll solution (1 ml of 200 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 m sucrose was mixed with 9 ml of Percoll) at a ratio of 55/45 (v/v) and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 90 min using a 10-ml centrifuge tube. The resulting gradient was divided into 10 fractions from top to bottom. Activities of β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase were measured using chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and NBT/BCIP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as substrates, respectively. An appropriate amount of each fraction was incubated with 50 µl of 5 mmchlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 or NBT/BCIP (3.75/1.88 µg) in 100 µl of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for a given period. After incubation, absorbance at 574 and 550 nm were measured for quantification of β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities, respectively. Samples (rat kidney and liver) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS and 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS, and then infiltrated with 20% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The materials were embedded in OCT compound, rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The frozen materials were cut into 8-µm thick sections using a cryostat (Leica CM1850) and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. After treatment with 5% skim milk in PBS (blocking buffer) for 20 min at room temperature, the samples were incubated with the anti-neutral CDase antibody diluted 1:100 with a blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation with Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 1 h. For controls, the primary antibody was replaced by preimmune serum IgG. For double labeling, the samples were stained with anti-neutral CDase and anti-LGP85 followed by incubation with a mixture of Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunostained samples were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus LSM-GB200). A part of immunostained samples were incubated with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) to visualize actin filaments. A Northern blot membrane loaded with ∼2 µg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from 8 different rat tissues (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a 2.0-kilobase EcoRI fragment of pAPkCD, which was gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 20 h. Detection and quantification were performed using a BAS 1500 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). A detergent-insoluble lipid raft was prepared as described in Refs. 33Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholarand 34Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar with some modification. In brief, a fresh rat kidney (200 mg wet weight) was homogenized in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (homogenized buffer) with a manually operated Teflon-glass homogenizer (20 strokes). The homogenate was centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 30 min to obtain a pellet of total membrane. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of the homogenized buffer containing 0.5% Lubrol 17A17 (serva), extracted for 30 min on ice, and mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in the same buffer. The raft fraction was prepared by layering 5–30% sucrose on top of the extract, followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 20 h. After centrifugation, 10 fractions were collected from top to bottom of the gradient and dialyzed against distilled water. The free-cholesterol in each fraction was measured using a cholesterol oxidase/peroxidase (35Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), withN-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probe) as substrate instead of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. Detection of ganglioside GM1 was performed using a biotin-labeled cholera toxin B subunit as described below. An aliquot of 50 µl of each fraction was dried up, dissolved in 10 µl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a Polygram Silica G TLC plate (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). After being developed with chloroform, methanol, 0.02% CaCl2 (5/5/1, v/v), the TLC plate was blocked with 1% skim milk-TBS for 1 h, and incubated with biotin-labeled cholera toxin B subunit (1 µg/ml in T-TBS) for 2 h and then streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection of alkaline phosphatase was conducted using NBT/BCIP as a substrate as described above. As shown in Fig. 1, the CDase of rat liver was solubilized from the membrane fraction by freeze-thawing (A), whereas the enzyme of rat kidney was completely resistant to extraction with freeze-thawing (B). This discrepancy was also observed when the neutral CDase was extracted from mouse liver and kidney (25Tani M. Okino N. Mitsutake M. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3462-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The neutral CDase of mouse liver was easily solubilized by freeze-thawing, and purified as a 94-kDa protein, and thus cDNA encoding the enzyme was cloned (21Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T.

Recent studies indicate that HCV IRES and 40 S ribosomal subunit form a stable binary complex that is believed to be important for the subsequent assembly of the 48 S initiation complex. Ribosomal protein (rp) S9 has been suggested as the prime candidate protein for binding of the HCV IRES to the 40 S subunit. RpS9 has a molecular mass of ∼25 kDa in UV cross-linking experiments. In the present study, we examined the ∼25-kDa proteins of the 40 S ribosome that form complexes with the HCV IRES upon UV cross-linking. Immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against two 25-kDa 40 S proteins, rpS5 and rpS9, clearly identified rpS5 as the protein bound to the IRES. Thus, our results support rpS5 as the critical element in positioning the HCV RNA on the 40 S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation.

Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in hepatitis C virus (HCV)1 as well as in members of the picornavirus family, the positive-stranded RNA genome is not capped. In these viral genomes, the 5′ noncoding region (NCR) contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (2Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wang C. Siddiqui A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Trans-acting cellular proteins regulate viral protein synthesis by binding to multiple sites within the IRES (2Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts with several sites in the IRES elements of picornaviruses (e.g. poliovirus (PV), encephalomyocarditis virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and human rhinovirus) (4Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Litterst M. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hellen C.U. Witherell G.W. Schmid M. Shin S.H. Pestova T.V. Gil A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Petersen A. Meyer K. Beck E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8330-8339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 52-kDa nuclear factor, La protein, appears to be essential for PV translation initiation, because its addition to La-deficient rabbit reticulocyte lysates stimulates and corrects PV translation (8Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these two proteins, other cellular factors (e.g. the 97-kDa protein and poly(rC)-binding protein-2) are likely to stimulate translation initiation directed by the picornavirus IRES (9Blyn L.B. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6243-6246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Borman A. Howell M.T. Patton J.G. Jackson R.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1775-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Identification and characterization of IRES-binding proteins are important to the understanding of the mechanisms of internal initiation and, ultimately, to the development of novel therapies for HCV. The binding PTB and La are required for translation by HCV IRES (11Ali N. Pruijn G.J. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Siddiqui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27531-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Anwar A. Ali N. Tanveer R. Siddiqui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34231-34235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, Kaminski et al. (13Kaminski A. Hunt S.L. Patton J.G. Jackson R.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 924-938PubMed Google Scholar) reported that recombinant PTB did not stimulate HCV IRES function, suggesting that PTB may not be necessary during HCV translation initiation under certain experimental conditions. Despite a considerably lower level of La protein in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, HCV IRES promotes efficient translation activity (14Fukushi S. Katayama K. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Ando T. Oya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Rijnbrand R. Bredenbeek P. van der Straaten T. Whetter L. Inchauspe G. Lemon S. Spaan W.

This clearly differs from the case of translation initiation on the PV genome. Thus, general models proposed for the process of 40 S ribosome entry to IRES elements on the picornavirus genome do not seem to apply to the HCV genome. In this respect, the formation of a stable binary complex between HCV IRES and purified 40 S ribosomal subunit is of great interest. It differs fundamentally from the initiation process on picornavirus IRES, which depends absolutely on one or more initiation factors, and direct ribosome binding to IRES may be an important step in internal initiation of the HCV genome (17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Although other ribosomal proteins may interact with HCV IRES, the binding of ribosomal protein S9 (rpS9) to the IRES has been assumed to be the initial step in translation initiation (17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). RpS9, with a molecular mass of 25 kDa in UV cross-linking experiments, is a primary target protein of binary IRES-40 S subunit complex. (17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 18Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6242-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether rpS9 binding is essential for function of HCV IRES, and unambiguous identification of ribosomal protein cross-linked to HCV IRES is still missing. We have previously shown that the binding of a 25-kDa cellular protein (p25) to the HCV IRES is most likely an important step for efficient translation of HCV (19Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This p25 protein interacts specifically with the HCV IRES and is cross-linked to the IRES when purified 40 S subunits are being used as a binding material (20Fukushi S. Okada M. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Katayama K. Virus Genes. 1999; 19: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Binding of p25 to HCV IRES, therefore, seems to be crucial for the interaction between 40 S subunit and IRES and to be a unique feature in the translation mechanism of HCV. In this study, we purified p25 from cultured HeLa cells and characterized it by with specific antibodies. As the main result we present here the first evidence that the HCV IRES-binding protein of the 40 S ribosomal subunit is ribosomal protein S5 (rpS5) and not rpS9 as suggested earlier. Plasmid pUC5END-nc containing a cDNA of full-length HCV 5′ NCR located just downstream of the T7 promoter was described earlier (19Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for human rpS5 was amplified from a HeLa cDNA library with polymerase chain reaction primers HS51 (5′-GGATCCGATGACGATGACAAAATGACCGAGTGGGAGACAGCA-3′) and HS52 (5′-GAAGCTTTCAGCGGTTGGACTTGGCCAC-3′), digested with BamHI and HindIII, and inserted into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) to yield pQE-RS5. Plasmid pQE-RS9, which contains a cDNA for human rpS9, was constructed with the primers HS91 (5′-GGATCCGATGACGATGACAAACCAGTGGCCCGGAGCTGGGTT-3′) and HS92 (5′-GAAGCTTTTAATCCTCCTCCTCGTCGTC-3′) by the same strategy as used for pQE-RS5. Cytoplasmic S10 extracts were prepared from HeLa S3 cells cultured in suspension. Purification of p25 protein was monitored by UV cross-linking a [32P]UTP-labeled HCV RNA probe to protein chromatographic fractions. A HeLa S10 cytoplasmic extract containing ∼650 mg of protein was fractionated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) containing 120 mm KCl. The binding activity of p25 to the HCV 5′ NCR RNA probe was measured in the void fractions. The void fractions were diluted with buffer A and loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions were collected by stepwise elutions with 0, 150, 300, and 500 mm KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing binding activity to the HCV 5′ NCR RNA were eluted with 300 and 500 mm KCl in buffer A. The 500 mmKCl fraction was diluted 5-fold with buffer A and loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions were eluted by a gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in buffer A. The fractions with the highest HCV 5′ NCR RNA binding activities were eluted by 250–340 mm KCl and pooled. Approximately 38 mg of the partially purified protein was obtained. Partially purified protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 14% gel. After electrophoretic transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the proteins were visualized with the stain Ponceau S. Selected peptide fragments were eluted, digested withAchromobactor proteinase I (Lys-C), and subjected to Edman degradation chemical sequencing. A [32P]UTP-labeled probe of high specific activity and corresponding to nucleotides 1–347 of the HCV 5′ NCR was transcribed from ScaI-digested pUC5END-nc with the Riboprobe T7 system (Promega). Analyses of protein-RNA interactions after UV-induced cross-linking were performed as described (19Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of rabbit antisera against rat 40 S ribosomal proteins, their purification by immunosorption, and their monospecificity were as described (21Theise H. Noll F. Bielka H. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1978; 37: 1353-1362PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lutsch G. Bielka H. Enzmann G. Noll F. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1983; 42: 705-723PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of polyclonal antibodies directed against PTB was as described (23Fukushi S. Okada M. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Nagai K. Katayama K. Virus Res. 2001; 73: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). JM109 cells were transformed with pQE-RS5 and pQE-RS9, and recombinant rpS5 and rpS9 were isolated by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Recombinant ribosomal proteins were separated by gradient SDS-PAGE on a 5–20% gel and used as reference proteins in Western immunoblotting according to the method of Towbin et al. (24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies against rat ribosomal proteins and PTB. HeLa S10 extracts cross-linked with [32P]UTP-labeled HCV IRES RNA were heat-denatured in cross-linking buffer containing 0.5% SDS and centrifuged. The supernatants were diluted 5-fold in sample buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After pre-incubation with uncoated protein G-Sepharose for 60 min, the samples were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatants were incubated with antibody-coated protein G-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed with sample buffer six times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. We used a HeLa S10 cytoplasmic extract as the starting material in our efforts to purify and characterize p25 cross-linked to HCV IRES. Purification of p25 was monitored by UV-induced cross-linking of the protein fractions to a HCV probe. During subsequent gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column, p25 bound to the HCV probe and migrated close to the void fractions, suggesting that p25 exists as a component of a macromolecular complex rather than as a single cytoplasmic molecule with an affinity for HCV (20Fukushi S. Okada M. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Katayama K. Virus Genes. 1999; 19: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The initial void fraction was subjected to heparin-Sepharose and cation exchange chromatography. Maximum activities of HCV 5′ NCR RNA binding were eluted from cation exchange column by 250–340 mm KCl (Fig. 1 A). The proteins for this fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, and silver staining revealed two closely migrating proteins of ∼25 kDa and a peptide corresponding to p25 just between them (Fig. 1 B). The gel sections containing each of the two proteins were cut out (Fig. 1 C), and the Lys-C-digested fragments were subjected to amino acid sequencing. Nine of 10 amino acids of the slower migrating band (a) matched amino acids 155–163 of human rpS9 (Fig.1 D). Ten amino acids of the faster migrating band (b) were identical to amino acids 23–32 of human rpS5. To identify which protein corresponded to p25, we analyzed the fractions by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-rpS5 and anti-rpS9 antibodies. The monospecificities of these antibodies had been established previously (21Theise H. Noll F. Bielka H. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1978; 37: 1353-1362PubMed Google Scholar), and we reconfirmed those by immunoblot analysis. The anti-rpS5 and anti-rpS9 antibodies specifically recognized recombinant human rpS5 and rpS9, respectively (Fig. 2 A). These antibodies were mixed with HeLa cytoplasmic extracts that had been UV cross-linked to [32P]UTP-labeled HCV IRES. Immunoprecipitation was carried out under highly stringent conditions to avoid nonspecific precipitation of aggregated protein during incubation with antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated that the cross-linked p25 was immunoprecipitated by anti-rpS5 antibodies but not by anti-rpS9 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, p25 was not precipitated with a different rabbit anti-rpS9 preparation raised against recombinant human rpS9 (data not shown). Among the control antibodies, anti-PTB precipitated a single protein of 58 kDa, a size corresponding to that of PTB. Anti-ribosomal protein S26 did not precipitate any protein, indicating that nonspecific precipitation did not exist under our experimental conditions. Thus, we conclude that the p25 protein cross-linked to HCV IRES was rpS5. In contrast, a previous report (17Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) indicated that rpS9 was the 25-kDa protein cross-linked to HCV RNA. We cannot explain the discrepancy between their results and ours. However, it is obviously difficult to clearly identify two ribosomal proteins of similar molecular mass and electrophoretic mobility, particularly when they are cross-linked to the HCV IRES. Although the radioactive signal of p25 shown on the autoradiogram is closer to rpS9 than to rpS5, special caution is required when identifying cross-linked proteins. Proteins covalently cross-linked with nucleotides can migrate more slowly than the native molecules. For these reasons, we believe our immunoprecipitation experiments were of particular value. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of rat rpS5 protein is also highly conserved in the ribosomal protein S7 (rpS7) from other species, including eubacteria, archaebacteria, and chloroplasts (25Kuwano Y. Olvera J. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25304-25308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stringent conservation of this region in ribosomal proteins from evolutionarily diverse species strongly implies a common function. RpS7 controls translation of the str operon by binding to an intercistronic region of the mRNA (26Spiridonova V.A. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Kopylov A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Affinity labeling experiments with mRNA analogues in bacterial ribosome systems revealed rpS7 as a frequent binding target (27Gimautdinova O.I. Karpova G.G. Knorre D.G. Kobetz N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3465-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Vladimirov S.N. Babkina G.T. Venijaminova A.G. Gimautdinova O.I. Zenkova M.A. Karpova G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and immunological analysis of a 30 S ribosomal protein indicate that rpS7 is a primary target for binding to an upstream region of mRNA (29Stade K. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9889-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,30Dontsova O. Kopylov A. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2613-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A binary complex consisting of mRNA and the small ribosomal subunit has been identified in prokaryotes and suggests a parallel binding mechanism via specific ribosomal proteins (31Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Green L. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These observations support our findings that the analogous eukaryotic rpS5 functions as a primary target at the 40 S ribosomal subunit when binding to HCV IRES. The affinity of p25 for the HCV IRES correlates well with the efficiency of translation initiation of HCV RNA, indicating a critical role for this protein in HCV translation (19Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction between p25 and the IRES is specific for HCV (20Fukushi S. Okada M. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Katayama K. Virus Genes. 1999; 19: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This protein may also be important in HCV translation by favoring preferential complex formation with the 40 S subunit. In this way, it may differ from the mechanism of ribosome recruitment during translation of normal cellular mRNAs in infected cells. Other studies support our finding that rpS5 interacts with the IRES. Mapping by cryo-electron microscopy revealed that domain II of HCV IRES interacts with the head region of the 40 S ribosomal subunit (32Spahn C.M. Kieft J.S. Grassucci R.A. Penczek P.A. Zhou K. Doudna J.A. Frank J. Science. 2001; 291: 1959-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This location corresponds to that of rpS5 on the surface of the 40 S subunit as demonstrated by immune electron microscopy (22Lutsch G. Bielka H. Enzmann G. Noll F. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1983; 42: 705-723PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion or alteration of domain II RNA sequences abolished the cross-linking between HCV IRES and the 25-kDa cellular protein (18Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6242-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of rpS5 is dependent on domain II. In this way, rpS5 may be involved in positioning the IRES in the ribosomal decoding center, a process accompanied by pronounced conformational changes in the structure of the 40 S subunit (32Spahn C.M. Kieft J.S. Grassucci R.A. Penczek P.A. Zhou K. Doudna J.A. Frank J. Science. 2001; 291: 1959-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the rpS5 protein interacts specifically with the IRES. Additional studies of this interaction may reveal insights into potential target for the specific inhibition of HCV translation in the infected cells. Further understanding of these mechanisms may provide new strategies for development of novel antiviral drugs."

Overexpression also transforms Rat1 fibroblasts by an unknown mechanism, which is likely to be related to its role in leukemia and which depends upon its repressor activity. We show here that mutant murine Evi-1 proteins, lacking either the N-terminal zinc finger DNA binding domain or both DNA binding zinc finger clusters, function as dominant negative mutants by reverting the transformed phenotype of Evi-1 transformed Rat1 fibroblasts. The dominant negative activity of the non-DNA binding mutants suggests sequestration of transformation-specific cofactors and that recruitment of these cellular factors might mediate Evi-1 transforming activity.C-terminal bindingprotein (CtBP) co-repressor family proteins bind PLDLS-like motifs.

Functional analysis of specific CtBP binding mutants show site b is absolutely required to mediate both transformation of Rat1 fibroblasts and transcriptional repressor activity. This is the first demonstration that the biological activity of a mammalian cellular transcriptional repressor protein is mediated by CtBPs.

The EVI-1 gene encodes one of these transcription factors, which is activated in 4–6% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)1 patients with various karyotypic abnormalities of chromosome 3q26 (2Morishita K.

For example, patients with karyotypes t(3;21) (q26;q22) or t(3;12) (q26;p13) express AML1/EVI1 (7Mitani K. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Miyoshi H. Kurokawa M. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Ohki M. Hirai H.

The precise contribution of ectopic EVI1 and EVI1 fusion protein production in leukemia progression is unknown, but a combination of enforced transgene expression and intervention studies shows a causative role, affecting both cell differentiation and proliferation. Expression of AML1/MDS1/EVI1 induces AML in mice, resulting in the accumulation of myeloid blast cells and immature differentiated myelocytic and monocytic lineages (10Cuenco G.M. Nucifora G. Ren R.

The 145-kDa nuclear EVI-1 full-length protein (FL) is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor protein (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that is organized into at least four distinct domains. Two comprise seven (ZF1) and three repeats (ZF2) of the DNA binding Cys2-His2 zinc finger motif, which have distinct DNA binding specificities (17Delwel R. Funabiki T. Kreider B. Morishita M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Funabiki T. Kreider B. Ihle J.N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1575-1581PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there are two separate transcriptional repressor domains designated Rp (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and IR (19Kilbey A. Bartholomew C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repressor activity is very important to the biological function of the EVI1 protein. EVI1 transforms Rat1 fibroblasts (20Kurokawa M. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Witte O.N. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar) by deregulating cell cycle control (21Kilbey A. Stephens V. Bartholomew C. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 601-610PubMed Google Scholar) in an Rp domain-dependent manner (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and this activity must be related to its role in leukemia progression. However, the precise mechanism of EVI1-mediated repression is unknown. In the case of several other transcriptional repressor proteins with vital roles in the development of acute leukemias, such as AML1/ETO, PML/RARα, and PLZF/RARα fusion proteins, repression is mediated by the aberrant recruitment of chromatin structure modifying co-repressor complexes comprising N-CoR·mSin3·N-CoR·mSin3·HDAC1HDAC1 proteins (22Wang J.

Recruitment of co-repressors is a common theme in transcriptional repression, because several non-DNA binding co-repressors have been identified that become anchored to DNA by interacting with subsets of sequence-specific transcription factors.

Although the CtBP proteins have been shown to mediate repressor activity for a number of cellular factors, the role of these interactions in mediating biological activity has not been previously demonstrated in mammalian cells. They are good candidates for mediating aspects of the biological activities of EVI1. CtBP protein binding is mediated by a conserved PLDLS motif (40Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and there are two potential sites, PFDLT and PLDLS, located in the EVI1 Rp domain. In this study we examine the binding of CtBP and EVI-1 proteins and demonstrate their interaction is necessary for the transformation of Rat1 cells and mediate transcriptional repressor activity. RatFL cells have been described before and Rat1, RatFL, Bosc-23, and 293 cells were all maintained as described previously (21Kilbey A. Stephens V. Bartholomew C. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 601-610PubMed Google Scholar). Procedures for transfections, production of helper free recombinant retrovirus, retroviral infections, growth in soft agar, CAT, and β-galactosidase assays have all been described previously (16Bartholomew C.

Cells infected with the zeocin resistance marker (zeo)-containing retroviral vectors were selected and maintained in 1 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). The zeocin gene was initially PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides 1 and 2 and inserted as aBamHI/SalI fragment into pMK20 (gift, C. Stocking). Retroviral vectors p50MX-zeo and p50MΔZF1-zeo were created by replacing the 6418 resistance marker (neo) gene of p50MX-neo (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M.

The yeast vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH) was modified by replacing the SstI site with NotI, utilizingNotI linkers (New England BioLabs), to create pGBT9N. The vector pGBT9Rp was created by inserting anEcoRI/NotI fragment from pGEV514/724 (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) into pGBT9N. pGBT9RpΔ514–631 was created by insertingEcoRI/NotI fragments, derived by PCR of pBS21 using oligonucleotides 10 and 11 intoEcoRI/NotI-digested pGBT9N. A cassette containing the Rp domain of Evi-1 encompassing amino acids 521–724 was created by PCR of pBS21 using oligonucleotides 12/13 and inserted as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment into pBluescript KSII (Stratagene). This wild type sequence, designated RpWT was then inserted into pGBT9 as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment producing pGBT9RpWT, into pSG424 as anEcoRI/XhoI fragment producing pSG424RpWT, and as a BglII/BamHI fragment into the BamHI site of p50MΔRp-neo to create p50MFLRpWT-neo. Similarly, mutant Rp domain cassettes, created by site-directed mutagenesis, were inserted as EcoRI/BamHI-digested fragments into pBluescriptKSII to create pKSIICtBPa and pKSIICtBPb. The CtBPa/b double-mutant was created by ligatingEcoRI/Eco0109I andEco0109I/BamHI fragments from pKSIICtBPa and pKSIICtBPb, respectively, intoEcoRI/BamHI-digested pBluescript KSII. The various mutant Rp domain cassettes were subsequently introduced into expression vectors as described above to create pGBT9ΔRpCtBPa, pGBT9ΔRpCtBPb, pGBT9ΔRpCtBPa/b, pSG424ΔRpCtBPa, pSG424ΔRpCtBPb, pSG424ΔRpCtBPa/b, p50MFLRpΔa, p50MFLRpΔb, and p50MFLRpΔa/b. Creation of the Myc-tagged EVI1 expression vector will be described elsewhere. 2A. Gill, unpublished.FLAG-tagged mCtBP2 was created by replacing Smad2 in pCMV5B-FLAGSmad2 (gift of Dr. J. Wrana, Toronto) with aSalI/SmaI mCtBP2 fragment PCR-amplified from pGAD424mCtBP2 with oligonucleotides 18 and 19. Site-directed mutants were created using a PCR-based procedure. Briefly, mutation ΔCtBPa was created in two steps. First, PCR reactions were performed with oligonucleotides 12/14 and 15/13 using pBS21 template DNA. The amplified fragments were diluted to 2 ng/µl and mixed, and 20 ng of the mixture was re-amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 12/13 to create an RpΔCtBPa fragment. Creation of the RpΔCtBPb fragment was the same except oligonucleotides 12/16 and 17/13 were utilized in the first PCR reaction. The oligonucleotides were as follows: 1, AATTGGATCCACCATGGCCAAGTTGACCAGTGC; 2, AATTGGATCCTGCTGTTCATGAAGAGCGAAGACT; 3, AATTCGGGCCGCTGCTGTTCATGGAGGGCAAGAACCATT; 4, AAGCTGGATCGTAGCGCTCTTTCCCCT; 5, AAGCTGGATCCGAGAACGGCAACATGTC; 6, AGCTGAATTCATACATGGCTTATGGACTGGAT; 7, AATTGCGGCCGCTGCTGTTCATGAAGAGTGAAGAAGG; 8, AAGCTGGATCCGTACATTGATTGAGAGA; 9, AAGGGATCCCCCTTCTTCATGGACCC; 10, GGAAGAATTCCCCACTCCCTTCTTC; 11, AATTGCGGCCGCTCAGTAGCGCTCTTTCCCCT; 12, AAGCTGAATTCAGATCTCCATTTCCTGATAGAGA; 13, AAGCTGGATCCGTAGCGCTCTTTCCCCT; 14, CCTTTTGCCTCCACCACTAAGAGAAAGGAT; 15, AAGTGGTGGAGGCAAAAGGGGACTCAGAGCTTCC; 16, CCCCTGGCTTCAAGTATGGGCAGTAGGGGTAGA; 17, CCATACTTGAAGCCAGGGGCTGGTCTTGGCTTGT; 18, AAGCTGTCGACTTGTGGATAAGCACAA; 19, AAGCTCCCGGGCT- ATTGCTCGTTGGGGT. Specific DNA sequences were amplified by PCR as described previously (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DNA amplification was performed using a PTC-100 96AgVH Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc.). PCR products were either purified directly or resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified, using a NucleoSpin extraction kit (CLONTECH). Nucleotide sequences of constructs were confirmed by sequencing using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems) and analysis on an ABI 373A automated sequencer. Total cellular RNAs were prepared from asynchronous exponentially dividing cultures of cells with RNazol B (Biogenesis Ltd.). Northern blots were performed with 20 µg of total RNA/lane as described previously (42Bartholomew C. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Proteins were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose, incubated with appropriate antibodies, and visualized with an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast strains SFY526 and AH109 (CLONTECH) were used. YPD media and liquid culture β-galactosidase assays were as described for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). Synthetic drop out media was prepared as 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco laboratories), 0.06% CSM-HIS-LEU-TRP-URA (Bio 101, Inc.), 2% glucose, pH 5.8, and + or −1.5% select agar (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 20 µg/ml l-histidine HCl (Sigma, H-9511). Yeast cells were transformed by a procedure based on LiOAc. Briefly, yeast cultures were grown in YPD overnight at 30 °C and sequentially pelleted and washed in 50%, 20%, and 0.72% volumes of sterile distilled water, SORB (100 mm LiOAc, 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1 m sorbitol), and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Competent cells were transformed by the addition of plasmid DNA and six volumes of PLATE (100 mm LiOAc, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 40% polyethylene glycol 3350), at 20 °C for 30 min. Me2SO was added to 10% and incubated at 42 °C for 15 min, then at 0 °C for 1 min, and cells were pelleted, resuspended, and plated in appropriate synthetic drop-out media. Cells were scraped into 0.25 ml of IP buffer (43Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), rapidly frozen, thawed at 0 °C for 1 h, then microcentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, 25 µl was aliquoted as whole cell extract for Western blotting, and the remainder was incubated overnight with 1 µl of FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, F3165) at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with 50 µl of 50% slurry of rabbit anti-mouse IgG-coated protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in IP buffer and prepared for Western blot analysis. We examined the ability of various murine Evi-1 mutant proteins to revert the transformed phenotype of RatFL cells (21Kilbey A. Stephens V. Bartholomew C. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 601-610PubMed Google Scholar), which express the full-length Evi-1 (FL) protein. Retroviral vectors containing either a zeocin-selectable marker alone (p50MX-zeo) or encoding Evi-1 mutant proteins that lack either the ZF1 (p50MΔZF1-zeo) or both ZF1 and ZF2 (p50MΔZF1/ZF2) DNA binding domains were used to infect RatFL cells, and zeocin-resistant cell lines were isolated. The growth of cell lines, selected because the mutant proteins were expressed at either similar or higher levels than the full-length protein (Fig.1), were examined in soft agar. Both ΔZF1 and ΔZF1/ZF2 proteins behave as dominant negative mutants, reverting the transformed phenotype of RatFL cells as demonstrated by the inhibition of colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 1,RatFL, ΔZF1,ΔZF1/ZF2), whereas expression of zeo alone has no effect (Fig. 1, Zeo). The ability of the non-DNA binding ΔZF1/ZF2 protein to act in a dominant negative fashion suggests that it can bind to, compete for, and sequester cellular factors necessary for Evi-1 biological activity. Recently, it has been shown that the repressor domain binds CtBP proteins (29Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The Rp domain-dependent Evi-1 repressor and cell transformation activities have been shown in human 293 embryo kidney cells and Rat1 fibroblasts, respectively, and Northern blot analysis with an mCtBP2-specific probe confirmed both cell lines express this gene (data not shown). To determine if CtBP interactions might be required for Evi-1 biological activity we compared mCtBP2 binding activity in yeast two-hybrid assays with the Evi-1 repressor domain and a deletion mutant that lacks two CtBP PLDLS-like binding motifs located at amino acids 553–557 (CtBPa) and 584–588 (CtBPb). The yeast expression vectors pGBT9Rp and pGBT9ΔRp, containing Evi-1 residues 514–724 and 632–724, respectively, fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD), were introduced into yeast strain SFY526 in combination with pGAD424mCtBP2 encoding a GAL4 activation domain (AD) mCtBP2 fusion protein. Yeast cells expressing only ADmCtBP2 and DBDRp produce active β-galactosidase (Fig. 2 A) clearly demonstrating a functional interaction between these proteins. However, binding activity is lost upon deletion of the repressor domain between amino acids 514 and 631, which includes the two potential CtBP interaction sites (Fig. 2 A,ΔRp). The interaction between Evi-1 and mCtBP2 was independently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies utilizing Evi-1myc and FLAGmCtBP2 epitope-tagged expression vectors. Western blot analysis of anti-FLAG M2-immunoprecipitated cell extracts, with anti-myc 9E10, detects the Evi1myc fusion protein only in cell extracts containing both Evi1myc and FLAGmCtBP2 epitope-tagged proteins (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating the two proteins can interact in mammalian cells. To see if CtBP binding correlates with Evi-1 transforming activity, we examined growth in soft agar of various recombinant retrovirus-infected cell populations. Rat1 cells expressing either FL, ΔRp, or ΔRp521–633 Evi-1 proteins (Fig. 2 C) were isolated. Macroscopic colonies were observed with populations of cells expressing the entire Evi-1 protein (Fig. 2 C, FL). Cells expressing mutants lacking the entire Rp domain, just a partial deletion encompassing both potential CtBP sites, or neo alone produced significantly fewer colonies (Fig. 2 C,ΔRp, ΔRp521–633,Neo). The deletion mutant studies show a correlation between CtBP binding and Evi-1 biological activity. To directly determine the role of CtBP co-repressors, site-directed mutations were made to destroy the two potential CtBP binding sites in the Evi-1 repressor domain. Previous studies have shown that mutation of the consensus CtBP binding motif PLDLS to PLASS blocks CtBP binding to E1A (40Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Similar changes were made in the Evi-1 Rp domain CtBP-like binding sites, converting PFDLT (CtBPa) and PLDLS (CtBPb) to PFAST (RpΔa) and PLASS (RpΔb), respectively. The wild type and mutant Rp sequences were inserted in-frame back into the Evi-1 mutant cDNA of p50MΔRp-neo (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to recreate full-length Evi-1 retroviral vectors (Fig. 3). Rat1 cells were infected with the recombinant retroviruses and G418-resistant cell populations isolated. The growth properties of the various Rat1 cell lines were examined in soft agar to determine the impact of these mutations on Evi-1 biological activity. Numerous macroscopic colonies were produced in cells expressing FLRpWT (Fig. 3), demonstrating that reconstruction of full-length Evi-1 with wild type RpWT sequences creates a protein with similar properties to the wild type protein. Rat1 cells expressing the FLRpΔa mutation still show moderate transforming activity (Fig. 3). However, a dramatic reduction in colony formation is seen with either the FLRpΔb or FLRpΔa/b proteins (Fig. 3), showing that the CtBPa site is partially required and the CtBPb site is essential to biological activity of the Evi-1 protein. Western blot analysis of cell extracts with Evi-1-specific antibodies (1806) revealed that equal amounts of the proteins were expressed that were indistinguishable in size from the wild type Evi-1 protein (Fig.3). This showed that we had successfully recreated and expressed full-length wild type and mutant proteins in each case. CtBP binding of the various site-directed mutants were tested in yeast. The wild type and mutant Rp domain-encoding fragments were inserted in-frame with the DBD of pGBT9. These constructs were introduced into the yeast strain AH109 with pGAD424mCtBP2 and protein interactions assessed using the β-galactosidase assay. As expected the wild type Rp domain (DBDRpWT) binds ADmCtBP2 as indicated by the production of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4 A). However, binding of the CtBPa site mutant (DBDRpΔa) is significantly impaired and an even more severe loss of binding is observed with the CtBPb and CtBPa/b site mutations (Fig. 4 A,DBDRpΔb, DBDRpΔa/b). Both Rp domain CtBP sites a or b can complement AH109 cell growth on media lacking histidine in the presence of mCtBP2, indicating that these sites can independently bind this protein (Fig. 4 B). These results show that mutations of the CtBP sites reduce CtBP binding and that there is a direct correlation of binding activity with transforming activity of Evi-1 proteins containing these mutations. Finally we determined if CtBP binding is necessary for Evi-1 repressor activity. The Rp wild type and mutant fragments were inserted in-frame with the DBD of the mammalian expression vector pSG424. We examined the ability of these constructs to inhibit lexA VP16 induction of the reporter construct pL8G5CAT in transiently transfected kidney 293 cells, as we have described previously (16Bartholomew C. Kilbey A. Clark A.M. Walker M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As expected the wild type Rp sequence represses 80% of lexA VP16 induction of reporter activity, whereas the vector alone has no inhibitory effect (Fig. 5,RpWT, DBD). The CtBPa mutation only partially relieves repressor activity, but the CtBPb and CtBPa/b mutations significantly reduce it to 30% (Fig. 5, RpΔa,RpΔb, RpΔa/b). Western blot analysis of cell extracts with GAL4DBD-specific antibodies revealed that equal amounts of the expected size DBD fusion proteins were expressed in each case. Therefore, the Evi-1 Rp CtBP binding sites mediate transcriptional repressor activity in kidney 293 cells. Several invertebrate and vertebrate transcriptional repressor proteins have previously been shown to bind CtBP proteins through evolutionarily highly conserved PLDLS motifs to mediate transcriptional repression. These specific interactions are very likely to be required for some or all of their biological properties, but this has not been previously shown. However, we now show for the first time that CtBP proteins interact with the Evi-1 transcriptional repressor. We demonstrate that this interaction is required for at least one of the known biological activities of the Evi-1 protein, transformation of Rat1 fibroblasts, and in addition transcriptional repressor activity. CtBP binds Evi-1 site b (PLDLSMG) more efficiently in yeast than site a (PFDLTTK), which probably reflects its closer similarity to the consensus core binding site P-DLS (29Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This relative binding activity reflects the situation in mammalian cells, because the greater affinity of site b correlates with the greater impact its mutation has on the efficiency of both Evi-1-mediated cell transformation and transcriptional repressor activity. Thus, mutation of just site b is sufficient to block the vast majority of repressor and transforming activities. However, in each case optimal binding, transcriptional repression, and transformation requires both sites (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). CtBP proteins can dimerize (32Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and the presence of two adjacent Evi-1 binding sites in the Rp domain might enhance dimerization, which could be necessary to either stabilize intermolecular interactions and/or be necessary for function. In this study we have demonstrated that Evi-1 binds to mCtBP2, which is expressed in 293 and Rat1 cells. There are two murine CtBP genes, mCtBP1 and mCtBP2, which appear to have similar binding specificities (34Furusawa T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8581-8590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are both likely to bind Evi-1. Therefore, mCtBP1 and mCtBP2 are equally likely to mediate Evi-1 biological activity, but the status of mCtBP1 expression in 293 and Rat1 cells is not known. Interestingly, whole mount in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis in the mouse show that mCtBP1 is expressed more generally in embryonic and adult tissues, whereas mCtBP2 expression is spatially restricted in the developing embryo (34Furusawa T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8581-8590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the high level of mCtBP2 expression in the limb buds and dorsal root ganglia of day 10.5 post coitum mouse embryos, which overlaps with the highest levels of Evi-1 expression observed (15Hoyt P.R. Bartholomew C. Davis A.J. Yutzey K. Gomer L.M. Potter S.S. Ihle J.N. Mucenski M.L. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that mCtBP2 is important to the role of Evi-1 in development, because Evi-1 FL null mouse embryos have multiple defects, including underdeveloped or absent limb buds and no peripheral nervous system (15Hoyt P.R. Bartholomew C. Davis A.J. Yutzey K. Gomer L.M. Potter S.S. Ihle J.N. Mucenski M.L. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, probably not all Evi-1 functions are mediated by CtBP proteins, because these mutant mice also have severe heart defects where mCtBP1 and mCtBP2 are not expressed (34Furusawa T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8581-8590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is well established that CtBP proteins are co-repressors, their mechanism of action is unknown. There are mixed reports, suggesting CtBP proteins need deacetylase activity to repress transcription. One report shows CtBP-dependent repression is sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitors (37Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.-M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas another contradicts this (38Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has been reported that hCtBP1 binds histone deacetylase (44Sundqvist A. Sollerbrandt K. Svensson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Curiously, a highly homologous and either new member or isoform of the CtBP family designated CtBP3, involved in Golgi structure and function, has intrinsic acyl transferase activity (45Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spano S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N.J. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Nature. 1999; 402: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that CtBP proteins might repress transcription by generating specific areas of heterochromatin, possibly by bridging interactions between sequence-specific transcription factors and Polycomb group complex proteins, which are involved in silencing homeotic genes (46Sewalt R.G.A.B. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P.E. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recently, Evi-1 has been shown to inhibit transforming growth factor-β signaling by the ZF1 domain interacting with Smad3 (47Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These studies also show that the Rp domain is necessary for transforming growth factor-β blocking activity. One possibility is that Smad3 binds Evi-1, which then recruits a repressor complex containing CtBP to block signaling. Although the transforming growth factor-β blocking activity is dependent upon amino acids 608–732 of Rp (47Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which are outside the CtBP sites, such gross deletions might create changes in protein conformation that prevent binding. This possibility is currently under investigation. The Evi-1 dominant negative mutants described in this study are likely to act by two distinct mechanisms. Evi-1 mutants, which lack ZF1, are non-transforming in Rat1 fibroblasts (19Kilbey A. Bartholomew C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and competition for endogenous ZF2 DNA binding sites between the defective and wild type proteins is the most plausible explanation of dominant negative activity in this case. Evi-1 mutants, which lack the Rp domain but retain ZF1 and ZF2, also have dominant negative activity (data not shown) supporting the competitive DNA binding mechanism. The dominant negative mutant, which lacks both zinc finger DNA binding domains, most likely sequesters factors that Evi-1 needs to transform cells. Our results suggest CtBP might be such a factor but do not eliminate the possibility that other factors are involved. Therefore, these results show that the expression of partial Evi-1 polypeptides, which either compete for DNA binding activity or co-factors like CtBP, inhibit Evi-1 activity and suggest that smaller peptides designed to block the same targets could be the basis of effective therapeutic agents. The murine Evi-1 PFDLTTK and PLDLSMG motifs are absolutely conserved in the human EVI1 primary amino acid sequence and, therefore, are very likely to be required for its biological activity as well. The interaction of human EVI1 and CtBP proteins might therefore be necessary in the development of leukemias where either EVI1 or EVI1 fusion proteins are produced. In the case of AML1/EVI1 fusion proteins, EVI1 might be required to recruit a repressor complex comprising CtBP proteins to AML1 DNA binding sites in analogy to ETO recruiting NCoR·mSin3·HDAC1 complexes for the AML1/ETO fusion protein (22Wang J. Hoshino T. Redner R.L. Kajigaya S. Liu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). A possible role for CtBP proteins in the development of leukemias has not been described before. These studies suggest a potential pharmacological use for peptides containing the PLDLS motif in blocking the interaction between EVI1 and CtBP proteins in the treatment of some acute myeloid leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemias in blast crisis (48Ogawa S. Kurokawa M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Hangaishi A. Mitani K. Kamada N. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 788-794PubMed Google Scholar), and myelodysplasias (49Russell M. List A. Greenberg P. Woodward S. Glinsmann B. Parganas E. Ihle J. Taetle R. Blood. 1994; 84: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where EVI-1 is expressed.

The present study focuses on our finding that the vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET1), whose signaling is not coupled to cAMP production, stimulates PKA in two independent cellular models. Using an in vivo assay for PKA activity, we found that ET1 stimulated PKA in HeLa cells overexpressing ET1 receptors and in aortic smooth muscle cells expressing endogenous levels of ET1 receptors. In these cell models, ET1 did not stimulate cAMP production, indicating a novel mechanism for PKA activation. The ET1-induced activation of PKA was found to be dependent on the degradation of inhibitor of κB, which was previously reported to bind and inhibit PKA. ET1 potently stimulated the nuclear factor-κB pathway, and this effect was inhibited by overexpression of the inhibitor of κB dominant negative mutant (IκBαm) and by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Importantly, IκBαm and MG-132 had similar inhibitory effects on ET1-induced activation of PKA without affecting Gs-mediated activation of PKA or ET1-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, another vasoactive peptide, angiotensin II, also stimulated PKA in a cAMP-independent manner in aortic smooth muscle cells.

Two types of ET1 receptors, namely ETA and ETB, have been cloned and identified as typical G protein-coupled receptors (3Adachi M. Yang Y.Y. Furuichi Y. Miyamoto C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

ETA receptors are coupled to Gq/11, G12/13, and Giheterotrimeric G proteins, leading to stimulation of phospholipase C, small GTPase RhoA, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, respectively (5Vogelsang M.

Moreover, there was no convincing evidence that the main target of cAMP, the protein kinase A (PKA), could be activated by ET1. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetrameric complex consisting of two catalytic subunits (PKAc) bound to a homodimer of two regulatory subunits (PKAr). The established mechanism of PKA activation in response to various hormones involves stimulatory G proteins, Gs, which activate adenylyl cyclase resulting in production of cAMP. Binding of cAMP to PKAr leads to a release and activation of PKAc (16Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Ortega Mateo A. de Artinano A.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 17Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel mechanism for PKA activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been described that is related to the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) pathway (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). NFκB is a transcription factor that is commonly activated during immune and inflammatory responses (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 20Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, NFκB exists in an inactive state bound to its natural inhibitor IκB. Activation of NFκB occurs as a result of agonist-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB followed by a release of free NFκB. Apparently, a certain pool of PKAc also exists in a complex with IκB (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, IκB retains PKAc in the inactive state, presumably by masking its ATP binding site. LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB results in a release and activation of PKAc (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). However, except for bacterially derived LPS, there was no evidence that other physiological agonists are able to activate PKA by this mechanism. The present study demonstrates for the first time that ET1 stimulates PKA activity by a cAMP-independent mechanism involving degradation of IκB. Moreover, our data suggest that this is most likely a general phenomenon common for vasoactive peptides. The cDNA for ETA receptor was kindly provided by Dr. Masashi Yanagisawa (University of Texas, South Western Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The cDNA for FLAG-tagged vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was a gift from Dr. Michael Uhler (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The cDNA for the dominant negative mutant of PKA (δR1α) was a gift from Dr. Stanley McKnight (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The cDNA for the phosphorylation-deficient S32A,S36A mutant of mouse IκBα (IκBαm) was a gift from Dr. Inder Verma (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). The phosphorylation-deficient S19A,S23A mutant of mouse IκBβ (IκBβm) was generated by polymerase chain reaction, and its identity was confirmed by sequencing. The NFκB-driven luciferase reporter plasmid was described previously (21Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Endothelin-1, isoproterenol, tumor necrosis factor α, and MG-132 were from Calbiochem. Angiotensin II was from Peninsula Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibodies were from New England Biolabs. The HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The primary culture of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) from Wistar-Kyoto rats was kindly provided by Dr. Sergei Orlov (University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada). The RASMC were cultured for up to 10 passages in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin as described elsewhere (22Orlov S.N. Tremblay J. Hamet P. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 774-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transient overexpression of proteins, the HeLa cells or RASMC were transfected with desired DNA in the presence of serum, using LipofectAMINE-2000 or LipofectAMINE-Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were serum-starved in 0.2% FBS for 24 h before the experiment. Phosphorylation-induced electrophoretic mobility shift of the VASP is a highly sensitive functional assay for the activity of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases in intact cells (23Halbrugge M. Friedrich C. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbacher P. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3088-3093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was used in this study. The specificity of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of VASP was confirmed by overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of PKA, δR1α, which abolished VASP phosphorylation induced by isoproterenol (see Fig. 1 C) or by 8-bromo-cAMP (25Browning D.D. McShane M.P. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but not by 8-bromo-cGMP (25Browning D.D. McShane M.P. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The assay involved transient transfection of cells with FLAG-tagged VASP cDNA, stimulation of quiescent cells with desired agonists, cell lysis followed by immunoblotting of cell lysates with FLAG antibodies (see below), and monitoring the phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift of VASP, as described previously (25Browning D.D. McShane M.P. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After stimulation of quiescent cells with desired agonists, the cells were lysed in the buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared from insoluble material by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting with 0.5 μg/ml primary antibodies followed by 0.3 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cyclic AMP accumulation was determined as described previously (26Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4721-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved and labeled with 3 μCi/ml [3H]adenine for 24 h, washed twice with serum-free DMEM, and stimulated with desired agonists for various times at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of medium followed by addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Acid-soluble nucleotides were separated on ion-exchange columns and subjected to scintillation spectroscopy. The radioactivity of cAMP-containing fractions was normalized on the total (cAMP + ATP) radioactivity in each sample and finally expressed as -fold increase over control (zero time point). Fig.1 shows a time course of PKA activation in response to ET1 (Fig. 1 A) and β2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO) (Fig. 1 B) after transient transfection of HeLa cells with ETA and β2-adrenergic receptor, respectively, as measured by gel retardation of the PKA substrate VASP (see “Materials and Methods”). ET1 induced a transient phosphorylation of VASP with a maximum at 5 min. In contrast, ISO-induced phosphorylation of VASP was much stronger and persisted for at least 1 h (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that phosphorylation of VASP is mediated by PKA, we employed a cAMP-unresponsive dominant negative mutant of PKAr, δR1α. As shown in Fig. 1 C, phosphorylation of VASP, induced by ET1 and ISO, was abolished by overexpression of δR1α. Confirming the specificity of δR1α, it had no effect on ET1-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D) or on cGMP-mediated phosphorylation of VASP (25Browning D.D. McShane M.P. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because two mechanisms of PKA activation have been described, it was important first to examine whether the effect of ET1 on PKA activity was mediated by cAMP. As shown in Fig.2, ET1 did not stimulate cAMP production but rather reduced basal levels of cAMP in ETA-transfected HeLa cells. By contrast, ISO (positive control) increased cAMP levels by more than 8-fold in β2-adrenergic receptor-transfected cells (Fig. 2). This suggests that ET1-induced activation of PKA is cAMP-independent and confirms that in our cellular model, ET1 signaling is not coupled to Gs and adenylyl cyclase. We next addressed the possibility of a cAMP-independent mechanism of ET1-induced PKA activity, described previously for LPS, wherein PKA activation was mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). ET1 stimulated NFκB activity in HeLa cells by 35.8 ± 4.4-fold, as measured by κB-dependent expression of the luciferase gene (Fig.3). This effect of ET1 was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, as well as by overexpression of the phosphorylation-deficient dominant negative mutant of IκB, IκBαm (Fig. 3). These data indicate that ET1 stimulates NFκB via phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Preincubation of cells with increasing concentrations of MG-132 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ET1-induced PKA activity, reaching maximum at 15 μm MG-132 (Fig.4 A). By contrast, up to 50 μm MG-132 had no significant effect on ET1-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase (Fig. 4 B) or the ISO-induced VASP shift (Fig. 4 F). This suggests that ET1-induced activation of PKA is mediated by proteasome-dependent protein degradation. To examine whether this PKA activation is dependent on the degradation of IκB, we employed phosphorylation-deficient dominant negative mutants of IκB. PKA was previously shown to bind IκBα, as well as IκBβ isoforms (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of IκBα-S32A,S36A (IκBαm) and IκBβ-S19A,S23A (IκBβm) overexpression on ET1-induced PKA activity. Overexpression of increasing amounts of IκBαm resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ET1-induced PKA activity (Fig. 4 C) without affecting MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig.4 D) or the ISO-induced VASP shift (Fig. 4 F). By contrast, overexpression of IκBβm had no significant effect on ET1-induced VASP phosphorylation (Fig. 4 E). Taken together, these data suggest that proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα mediates ET1-stimulated PKA activity in HeLa cells. It was important to confirm that cAMP-independent activation of PKA by ET1 in HeLa cells was not an artifact of ETA overexpression. Therefore, we next examined the ability of ET1 to activate PKA in a primary culture of RASMC, which express endogenous levels of ETA receptors. As shown in Fig.5 A, ET1 and ISO stimulated phosphorylation of VASP in these cells with a striking similarity to their effects in the transiently transfected cellular model (compare Fig. 5 A and Fig. 1). Moreover, in RASMC, PKA was also stimulated by another vasoactive peptide, angiotensin II (AII) (Fig.5 A). Importantly, ET1 and AII failed to stimulate cAMP production in RASMC, whereas ISO increased cAMP levels by more than 200-fold (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that cAMP-independent activation of PKA may be a general phenomenon, common for vasoactive peptides. The present study describes for the first time cAMP-independent activation of PKA by G protein-coupled receptor agonist endothelin-1 and provides the mechanism of this signaling event. Employing two independent cellular models with overexpressed or endogenous levels of ETA receptors, we provide strong evidence for the ability of ET1 to stimulate PKA activity in a cAMP-independent manner. Moreover, this may represent a general phenomenon common for vasoactive peptides, because angiotensin II elicited similar effect on PKA in RASMC. With the exception of one study, which showed a modest, cAMP-dependent activation of PKA by ET1 in pig coronary arteries (10El-Mowafy A.M. White R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the stimulation of PKA by either ET1 or AII has not been reported. In our experiments, ET1 failed to stimulate cAMP production but rather reduced the basal levels of cAMP. This is in accord with other investigators having shown that ET1 either had no effect or inhibited basal or agonist-induced cAMP production, which is consistent with the coupling of ETAreceptors to Gi proteins (5Vogelsang M. Broede-Sitz A. Schafer E. Zerkowski H.R. Brodde O.E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 23: 344-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wu-Wong J.R. Opgenorth T.J. J. Cardiovasc.

However, one might still consider the possibility of compartment-specific changes in cAMP-levels in response to ET1, which have not been detected in the present study. The cAMP-independent mechanism of PKA activation, which is mediated by LPS-induced degradation of IκB, has been described previously by Zhong et al. (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). However, except for bacterially derived LPS, no physiological ligand has been reported to activate PKA by this mechanism. The present work demonstrates for the first time that the physiologically relevant hormone ET1, which is central to cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary physiology, also stimulates PKA in an IκB-dependent manner (Fig. 4). This suggests that this mechanism for PKA activation is more widespread and might also be relevant to other G protein-coupled receptors. Several important questions are still to be resolved, such as the signaling pathways, which link ETA receptors to the degradation of IκB and activation of PKA, as well as the functional significance of ET1-induced PKA activation. IκB degradation can be mediated by a variety of mechanisms, including protein kinase C (27Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Regarding the functional significance of ET1-induced PKA activation, stimulation of PKA by isoproterenol or forskolin was shown to inhibit agonist-induced activation of phospholipase C (33Dodge K.L. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ca2+ mobilization (34Tertyshnikova S. Fein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, it is generally accepted that activation of PKA leads to cell relaxation and regulation of cell growth (36Murray K.J. Pharmacol.

This suggests that activation of PKA may serve as a regulatory mechanism in the function of ET1. Future studies will address these issues.

The effect, however, requires a ≥20 μm concentration of the fatty acid. We find that human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) equilibrated with a ligand for the diacylglycerol receptor on PKC, [3H]phorbol dibutyrate (PDB), increased binding of [3H]PDB within 15 s of exposure to ≥10–30 nm AA. Other unsaturated fatty acids, but not a saturated fatty acid, likewise stimulated PDB binding. These responses, similar to those caused by chemotactic factors, resulted from a rise in the number of diacylglycerol receptors that were plasma membrane-associated and therefore accessible to PDB. Unlike chemotactic factors, however, AA was fully active on cells overloaded with Ca2+chelators. The major metabolites of AA made by PMN, leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate, did not mimic AA, and an AA antimetabolite did not block responses to AA. AA also induced PMN to translocate cytosolic PKCα, βII, and δ to membranes. This response paralleled PDB binding with respect to dose requirements, time, Ca2+-independence, resistance to an AA antimetabolite, and induction by another unsaturated fatty acid but not by a saturated fatty acid. Finally, HEK 293 cells transfected with vectors encoding PKCβI or PKCδ fused to the reporter enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were studied. AA caused EGFP-PKCβ translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane at ≥0.5 μm, and EGFP-PKCδ translocation from cytosol to nuclear and, to a lesser extent, plasma membrane at as little as 30 nm. We conclude that AA induces PKC translocations to specific membrane targets at concentrations 2–4 orders of magnitude below those activating the enzymes. These responses, at least as they occur in PMN, do not require changes in cell Ca2+ or oxygenation of the fatty acid. AA seems more suited for signaling the movement than activation of PKC.

The execution of this movement, or translocation, from one cell compartment to another is crucial to the function of these kinases. Typically, signal pathways entrained by cell stimulation convert resident lipids to products that help guide these kinases to the substrates and milieus appropriate for their phosphorylating activity. One family of AGC kinases, the protein kinases C (PKC),1 affects virtually all aspects of cell physiology. The family was first studied as a phosphorylating activity that developed during the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i ) and formation of diacylglycerol (DG) attending cell stimulation. High [Ca2+]i , it was found, caused PKC to move from a latent state in cytosol to plasma membranes. Upon attaching to plasmalemmal phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine, the translocated PKC engaged membranous DG and thereby became active. It is now known that human PKC exist as four subfamilies of 13 isoforms (1Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr.

Conventional PKCα, βI, βII, and γ are sensitive to Ca2+ and DG; novel PKCδ, ε, η, and θ are sensitive only to DG; and atypical PKCζ and ι are sensitive to neither signal. A more distantly related group of μ, ν, and PKD-2 isoforms binds DG but is Ca2+-insensitive and may or may not translocate depending on cell type (5Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Lozuma S. Saito T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), arachidonic acid (AA) has been proposed to participate in signaling for activation of the enzymes. AA is the major UFA released during cell stimulation and among UFAs has high efficacy in activating PKC. It nonetheless achieves this activation only at ≥20–100 μm, levels unlikely to occur physiologically. On the other hand, UFAs also cause cells to translocate PKC. Observed mainly at UFA concentrations that activate PKC, this effect has been either ignored or viewed as consequential and secondary in importance to PKC activation (21–33). We show here that AA induces PKC translocation in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and HEK 293 cells at concentrations 2–4 orders of magnitude below those reported to activate the enzymes. Based on the criterion of potency, AA is better suited as a translocating than activating signal for PKC.DISCUSSIONUFAs directly activate PKC and, when added to hepatocytes (23Diaz-Guerra M.J.M.

Although the latter effect may be consequential to activating these enzymes, the two responses are separable. For example, a low level of phosphatidylserine or Ca2+ causes PKC to attach to membranes in vitrowhereas a higher level of either agent also activates the membrane-attached PKC (1Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Oancea E. Meyer T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The activating effect of AA on most PKC isoforms, including α, βII, and δ, reportedly requires at least 20–100 μm. Such extreme levels of the fatty acid can occur in vivo; microparticles shed by perturbed cells may stimulate PKC and PKC-dependent functions by delivering up to 100 μm free AA to various target cells (31Barry O.P. Kazanietz M.G. Praticò D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7545-7556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 52Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Under most physiological conditions, however, AA occurs at levels below this. Cells responding to receptor agonists, in particular, are unlikely to propel cytosolic AA to levels engendering PKC activation. We find that ≥10–100 nm AA causes PMN and HEK 293 cells to bind [3H]PDB and translocate PKC.PDB binding responses to AA reflected an increase in the number of receptors available to the ligand (Tables I and II). In studies not shown, PMN were challenged for 2 min with 3 μm AA or arachidic acid, diluted with 9 volumes of 4 °C buffer, disrupted, and fractionated on Percoll gradients. The former but not the latter fatty acid caused significant falls in cytosol and rises in plasmalemma PDB receptors but no such change in granule, endoplasmic reticulum, or heavy Golgi fractions. Thus, AA-induced PDB binding responses involve the movement of PDB receptors from cytosol to plasmalemma. In sucrose gradient experiments, AA, but not arachidic acid, similarly caused PMN to decrease cytosol and increase membrane PKCα, βII, and δ (Fig. 5). Although membranes isolated from the latter gradients contain not only plasmalemma but also Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and other organelles (36Kent J.D. Sergeant S. Burns D.J. McPhail L.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4641-4647PubMed Google Scholar), PKC translocation paralleled [3H]PDB binding. We accordingly interpret sucrose gradient data as indicating that PKC moved mainly if not exclusively from cytosol to plasmalemma. We stress, however, that other PDB receptor-bearing proteins (PKCβI, chimerin, etc.) may and likely do contribute to PDB binding (41Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,42Majumdar S. Rossi M.W. Fujiki T. Phillips W.A. Disa S. Queen C.F. Johnston Jr., R.B. Rosen O.M. Corkey B.E. Korchak H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9285-9294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PDB binding responses to CFs were slowed in Ca2+-fixed and absent in Ca2+-chelated PMN (34O'Flaherty J.T. Jacobson D.P. Redman J.F. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9146-9152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F. Jacobson D.P. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21619-21623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). CFs, including FMLP, likewise have reduced ability to translocate various PKC isoforms in PMN deprived of Ca2+ (43Dang P.M.C. Rais S. Hakim J. Périanin Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, AA caused prominent PBD binding and PKCβII, α, and δ translocation (Figs. 3 and Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7) responses regardless of PMN Ca2+ status. Thus, CFs need a minimal level of cell Ca2+ to affect PKC, whereas UFAs have far less such a requirement. Because PKCα and βII, but not PKCδ, exhibited reduced responses to AA in Ca2+-chelated PMN (Figs. 6 and 7), [Ca2+]i rises likely contribute to PDB binding (34O'Flaherty J.T. Jacobson D.P. Redman J.F. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9146-9152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F. Jacobson D.P. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21619-21623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) responses to CFs by enhancing the movement of Ca2+-sensitive PKC isoforms. On the other hand, the effect of AA on PDB proved largely indifferent to PMN Ca2+ status (Fig. 3). The relatively slow-paced [Ca2+]i rise initiated by AA may explain this anomaly: Ca2+-actuated PDB binding response to AA overlap and may be obscured by Ca2+-insenstive PDB binding response. In any case, studies clearly show that Ca2+-sensitive PKC isoforms translocate in the absence of Ca2+ transients in PMN challenged with AA (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), as well as CFs (43Dang P.M.C. Rais S. Hakim J. Périanin Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or other receptor agonists (32Lennartz M.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether endogenous AA has a role in these receptor-driven translocations. Relevant to this, agents that block AA-releasing enzymes, phospholipases A2, have recently been found to inhibit interleukin 2 in stimulating T lymphocytes to translocate PKC activity (53Lu Y. Morley P. Durkin J.P. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).AA did not trigger PKC translocation as a result of its oxygenation. 5-HETE and LTB4, the major oxygenation products formed from AA by PMN, did not mimic the action of AA. Moreover, LTB4down-regulated PMN to itself but not AA (data not shown), nordihydroguaiaretic acid did not alter the action of AA (Table I), and other UFAs stimulated PDB binding (Table II and Fig. 4) and PKC translocation (data not shown). These results contrast with those found with many AA activities. For example, AA stimulates PMN to activate cytosolic phospholipase A2. The effect is sensitive to nordihydroguaiaretic acid and produced by LTB4 and 5-HETE but not other UFAs. Here, then, PMN convert AA to LTB4 and 5-HETE, which bind respective receptors to initiate signal pathways activating the enzyme (54Wijkander J. O'Flaherty J.T. Nixon A.B. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 55Capodici C. Pillinger M.H. Han G. Philips M.R. Weissmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our data exclude this route for AA-induced PKC translocation. An alternate metabolic route, however, could explain PKC translocation responses to UFAs. Cells acylate UFAs to CoA, transfer the UFA moiety of UFA-CoA to glycerolipids, and shuttle glycerolipid-bound UFAs to other lipids. PMN conduct these steps rapidly even if overloaded with Ca2+-chelators (56Daniele J.J. Fidelio G.D. Bianco I.D. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 57: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because UFA-CoA alters PKC activity and because glycerolipids bearing UFAs have higher affinity for PKC than their saturated fatty acid-containing counterparts (57Szamel M. Rehermann B. Krebs B. Kurrle R. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2806-2813PubMed Google Scholar, 58Yaney G.C. Korchak H.M. Corkey B.E.

Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), UFA-CoA or UFA-glycerolipids may influence the dispositions of PKC and thereby the translocation response to UFAs. The same events could operate in cells stimulated to release endogenous AA. Our studies also do not address other indirect means for translocating PKC, e.g. by stimulating formation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, phosphorylation of PKC, changes in PKC docking proteins, or issuance of various other signals, although these events may not occur in Ca2+-chelated cells challenged by low levels of AA. Studies with pharmacological inhibitors offer a first step to determine whether AA acts directly, upon esterification to CoA or glycerolipids, or through signal pathways.Fluorescent fusion products have been used to monitor the movements of various PKC isoforms. In CHO cells, EGFP-PKCδ localizes to cytosol and nucleoplasm (60Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 61Wang Q.J.

Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LLCPK-1 cells localize EGFP-PKCδ to plasmalemma and do not translocate it in response to dopamine, although dopamine translocates other PKC isoforms (63Nowicki S. Kruse M.S. Brismar H. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1812-C1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGFP-PKCβII localizes exclusively to cytosol in HEK 293 cells and moves to plasmalemma in less than 1 min of challenge by G protein-coupled receptor agonists (64Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10762-19755Google Scholar). These reports evidence that the location, as well as the direction and kinetics of EGFP-PKCδ and βII movements, varies with cell, isoform, and stimulus type. Other PKC isoforms show similar variability (60Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 65Vallentin A. Prévostel C. Fauquier T. Bonnefont X. Joubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6014-6021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Most relevant here, however, are reports on UFAs. In CHO cells, ≥200 μm AA and oleic acid cause rapid, transient shifts in EFFP-PKCγ from cytosol to plasma membrane, whereas 50 μm AA causes a slow, sustained shift in cytosol EGFP-PKCε to the perinuclear area (66Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 67Shirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We are unaware of reports on the effect of UFAs on other EGFP-PKC isoforms. We show here that AA caused HEK 293 cells to translocate EGFP-PKCδ from cytosol to the entire nuclear and limited portions of the plasma membrane (Fig. 9,D–I). Responses occurred and reversed within minutes of exposure to ≥30 nm AA (Fig. 8, bottom two rows,and Fig. 11). AA affected EGFP-PKCβ differently, causing it to move from cytosol to plasma membrane (Fig. 9, A–C). Unlike the EGFP-PKCδ response to AA here or the EGFP-PKCγ responses to ≥200 μm AA in CHO cells (66Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), EGFP-PKCβ movements evolved slowly, did not reverse for 60 min, and occurred at ≥0.5 μm AA in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 8, top two rows,and Fig. 10).

Interestingly, resting HEK 293 cells localized EGFP-PKCδ to both the cytosol and nucleoplasm but localized EGFP-PKCβ only to the cytosol. This allows for the possibility that PKCδ may have a nuclear membrane-targeting motif that over longer periods aids its penetration into nuclei.In conclusion, AA causes PMN and HEK 293 cells to translocate PKCα, βI, βII, and δ at concentrations 2–4 orders of magnitude below those reportedly activating the enzymes. Because PKCs must be correctly compartmentalized in order to engage their cofactors and substrates, AA, as presented to cells by, for example, microparticles or released during stimulation, may serve to direct Ca2+-sensitive and Ca2+-insensitive PKC isoforms to proper membrane targets and thereby assist, modulate, or (when no Ca2+ transient occurs) replace [Ca2+]i signals. Indeed, exogenous AA and DG operate synergistically to stimulate PKC and PKC-dependent responses in whole cells (1Peterso"

Currently, little is known about the function of corepressorsin vivo. We thus used a mouse albumin promoter to generate several transgenic mouse lines that overexpressed a dominant negative mutant corepressor, NCoRi, in liver. The transgenic mice had normal liver weight, appearance, and minimal changes in enzyme activity. To study the effects of NCoRi on transcription of hepatic target genes, we examined T3-regulated gene expression of hypo- and hyperthyroid transgenic mice. In hypothyroid mice, hepatic expression of Spot 14, Bcl-3, glucose 6-phosphatase, and 5′-deiodinase mRNA was higher in transgenic mice than littermate controls whereas these genes were induced to similar levels in T3-treated mice. Derepression was not observed for malic enzyme mRNA expression in hypothyroid mice. Thus, NCoRi selectively blocked basal transcription of several thyroid hormone-responsive genes but had no effect on ligand-mediated transcription. Additionally, compensatory increases in endogenous SMRT and NCoR mRNA were observed in hypothyroid transgenic mice. Interestingly, hepatocyte proliferation as detected by BrdUrd incorporation was increased in transgenic mice. The gene profile in transgenic mouse livers was studied by cDNA microarray, and several genes related to cell proliferation were induced. In summary, our studies show that NCoR plays important roles in mediating basal repression by TRs and may prevent cellular proliferation in vivo.

In contrast, transcriptional activation occurs via ligand-dependent recruitment of p160 co-activators by TR, which then forms complexes that contain histone acetyltransferase activity (12McKenna N.J.

Recent evidence also suggests that NCoR and Sin3 may interact directly with the key components of the basal transcriptional machinery to inhibit basal transcription in an alternative repression pathway (22Muscat G.E. Burke L.J. Downes M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Almost all studies of NCoR function to date have been performed inin vitro transcription and cotransfection systems. Currently, little is known about the physiological and developmental roles played by NCoR in vivo. Hollenberg et al.(23Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have shown that a variant form of NCoR, NCoRi, lacks the repression domains in the amino terminus but retains the nuclear receptor interaction domains. NCoRi also had dominant negative activity on TR-mediated basal repression in cotransfection assays. The liver has long been known to be a major target organ for TH, with more than 50 target genes identified recently by cDNA microarray (24Feng X. Jiang Y. Meltzer P. Yen P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, to examine the roles of NCoR in vivo, we created several transgenic mouse lines in which the dominant negative NCoRi was targeted to liver via an albumin promoter. Our studies showed that NCoRi selectively blocked basal repression of several TH-regulated target genes but had no effect on transcriptional activation. Additionally, hepatocellular proliferation was increased in the transgenic mice. Our study demonstrates that NCoR plays an important role in mediating basal repression by TRs in vivo and also may be involved in cellular proliferation in the liver. To construct a vector containing the albumin promoter and NCoRi sequence, a 3.1-kilobase NCoRi fragment was obtained byEcoRI digestion from PKCR2-NCoRi (gift of A. Hollenberg, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA, Ref. 23Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and inserted into multiple cloning sites in the albumin promoter cassette PGEMLB-SVPA (gift from Dr. Jack Liang, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health), resulting in PGEMLB-SVPA-NCoRi vector (25Kawamura T. Furusaka A. Koziel M.J. Chung R.T. Wang T.C. Schmidt E.V. Liang T.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A FLAG (2×) sequence also was inserted into the amino terminus of NCoRi cDNA. All sequences were verified by sequencing. Alb-NCoRi (6.8-kilobase) fragment containing the mouse albumin promoter, NCoRi cDNA, and SV40 intron/poly(A) sequence (Fig. 1 A) was liberated from the plasmid vector PGEMLB-SVPA-NCoRi by digestion with AatII and MluI, separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and purified through a Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen), following by Elutip column (Schleicher and Schuell). Microinjection was carried out by the NIDDK Transgenic Facility, National Institutes of Health. Transgenic mice carrying Alb-NCoRi was identified by PCR genotyping of tail DNA using primers specific to albumin promoter and NCoRi cDNA. PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles using 200–400 ng of mouse tail DNA, with each cycle set at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min. 5 μg of genomic DNA from mouse tails was digested withEcoRV restriction enzyme. Digestion products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon transfer membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). cDNA probe preparation, hybridization, and washes were carried out as described for Northern blotting (see below). All animals used in these experiments were 8–12 weeks old. Hypothyroid mice were fed a low iodine (loI) diet supplemented with 0.15% propylthiouracil (PTU) purchased from Harlan Teklad Co. (Madison, WI) for 4 weeks (26Weiss R.E. Murata Y. Cua K. Hayashi Y. Seo H. Refetoff S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4945-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Serum TSH measurements (kindly measured by Dr. Samuel Refetoff, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) showed that mice littermate control and transgenic mice treated with PTU were profoundly hypothyroid (TSH 27.0 ± 7.2 milliunits/ml and 37.1 ± 8.0 milliunits/ml, respectively n = 4; nl 0.005–0.034 milliunits/ml). After 4 weeks on this diet, hypothyroid mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of l-T3 (Sigma) per 100 g mouse body weight in phosphate-buffered saline for 6 h before sacrifice and liver harvest. Control mice were injected with the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline alone for 6 h before sacrifice and liver harvest. Euthyroid mice were fed a normal diet. Control and transgenic mice were bled from their tails, and sera were analyzed by the clinical chemistry laboratory, National Institutes of Health. Total RNA was isolated from individual mouse livers by RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and further purified by TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 100 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA by using SuperScript II RNA reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as previously described (27Khan J. Bittner M.L. Saal L.H. Teichmann U. Azorsa D.O. Gooden G.C. Pavan W.J. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13264-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RNA isolated from a littermate control mouse liver was used to prepare cDNA probes labeled with Cy3-deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and RNA isolated from a transgenic mouse liver was used to prepare cDNA labeled with Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled cDNA was purified using MicroCon 30 filters(Amicon). Hybridization and cDNA microarray analyses were performed as described previously (24Feng X. Jiang Y. Meltzer P. Yen P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from mouse livers using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A+) was isolated using poly(A) tract mRNA isolation kit (Promega). Poly(A+) RNA (2 μg) was separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a nylon transfer membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). The blots were probed with gel-purified α-[32P]dCTP-labeled fragments and probes were purified using NICK column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA signals were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized with corresponding thyroid hormone-insensitive 36B4 signals. Fold-induction was determined from transgenic mice signal values divided by control mice signal values within the same experiment. Mouse liver sections were taken from mice and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigma). The specimens then were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin by American Histolab (Rockville, MD). To detect proliferating hepatocytes, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 50 mg per kg of body weight, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 1 h, the mice were killed immediately, and liver biopsies were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigma). Immunostaining of BrdUrd and TUNEL analysis was carried out by Molecular Histology Laboratories (Rockville, MD). To study basal repression in vivo, we constructed an expression vector containing the NCoRi cDNA and the mouse albumin promoter to target expression of NCoRi to the liver (25Kawamura T. Furusaka A. Koziel M.J. Chung R.T. Wang T.C. Schmidt E.V. Liang T.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). NCoRi is derived from a 3.1-kilobase cDNA that was originally isolated from a human placental library. The NCoRi protein contains the TR interaction domains and surrounding amino acids (1539–2453) but lacks the repressor domains (1–1120) present in full-length murine NCoR (23Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It also has been shown that NCoRi has dominant negative activity on endogenous NCoR as it blocked basal repression by TR (23Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing the Alb-NCoRi transgene then were isolated and microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs. Newborn mice were screened for the presence of Alb-NCoRi transgene by PCR genotyping using primers specific to mouse albumin promoter and NCoRi cDNA. Thirteen of a total 96 pups were identified as Alb-NCoRi transgene carriers and did not show developmental abnormalities. Southern blot analysis of founder mouse tail DNA showed that the founders carried 2–80 copies of the Alb-NCoRi transgene (data not shown). We outbred five of these transgenic founders and examined their F1–F4 heterozygous progeny in more detail. To determine whether these mice expressed NCoRi mRNA, poly(A+) RNA was extracted from the mouse livers and analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig.1 B, a 4-kilobase mRNA corresponding to NCoRi mRNA was detected from the transgenic mice but not their littermate controls. NCoRi mRNA was expressed 17–146 times higher than endogenous NCoR mRNA in these mouse lines in the euthyroid state. Moreover, endogenous NCoR mRNA did not increase in the transgenic lines (Figs. 1 B and 2B). To determine whether the transgene was specifically expressed in liver, we examined the tissue distribution of NCoRi mRNA by Northern blot analysis and found NCoRi mRNA was detected only in the liver in transgenic line 210 (Fig. 1 C). Mice from all the transgenic lines had normal appearance, size, and weight when compared with littermate controls (data not shown). Livers were normal in size and appearance. Small differences in serum alkaline phosphatase (transgenic 60 ± S.D. of 10 versus control 34.5 ± S.D. of 10, n = 4) and triglycerides (transgenic 41.25 ± S.D. of 0.9 versus control 78.5 ± S.D. of 24.9, n = 4) were observed between euthyroid transgenic and littermate control mice. No differences in serum glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, alkline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT, total bilibrubin were found between hypothyroid transgenic and littermate control mice. SMRT is another nuclear corepressor expressed in various tissues (2Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar,28Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Like NCoR, SMRT interacts with the unliganded thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors via conserved nuclear receptor interaction domains and strongly represses basal transcription in cotransfection studies. To determine whether expression of NCoRi changed the expression of endogenous SMRT and NCoR mRNA, we examined their expression in transgenic mice from line F210, which expressed the highest amount of NCoRi mRNA, and their littermate controls. Hepatic SMRT mRNA was slightly increased in the euthyroid transgenic mice (Fig. 2 A). Because basal repression is mediated by unliganded TR in the hypothyroid state, we examined whether hepatic SMRT expression was increased in transgenic mice rendered hypothyroid after 4 weeks of treatment with PTU. SMRT mRNA was expressed at 3-fold higher levels in hypothyroid control mice than in euthyroid control mice suggesting that SMRT gene expression is negatively regulated by T3 in liver. Hepatic SMRT mRNA increased 7-fold in transgenic mice suggesting a compensatory increase in hypothyroid transgenic mice. Similarly, endogenous NCoR mRNA was increased in hypothyroid transgenic mice (Fig.2 B). To study whether overexpression of NCoRi affected basal repression of target genes, we examined mRNA expression levels of six different thyroid hormone-responsive genes, Spot 14, 5′-deiodinase,bcl3, glucose 6-phosphatase, malic enzyme, and sialyltransferase in hypothyroid and hyperthyroid mice. With the exception of sialyltransferase, which is negatively regulated, all of these target genes are positively regulated (24Feng X. Jiang Y. Meltzer P. Yen P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). For these studies, transgenic mice from line F183 (which had a medium level of NCoRi mRNA expression) and their control littermates were used. We first examined hepatic spot 14 (S14) gene expression in hypothyroid transgenic mice, and found they exhibited 4-fold higher expression than their littermate controls (Fig.3 A), suggesting that NCoRi was able to derepress basal repression in the absence of ligand. In contrast, hepatic S14 mRNA expression was similar in hyperthyroid transgenic and littermate control mice, consistent with the notions that NCoR only interacts with TR in the absence of ligand and co-activator complexes are involved in ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. Similar results were found in several other thyroid hormone-responsive genes: bcl3, glucose 6-phosphatase, and 5′-deiodinase (Fig. 3, B–D). Of note, not all of the thyroid hormone-responsive genes studied were affected by overexpression of NCoRi. No difference in malic enzyme mRNA expression was observed between transgenic and control mice in the absence or presence of T3 (Fig. 3 E). These findings suggest that NCoRi selectively blocked basal repression of several positively regulated thyroid-hormone responsive genes, but had no effect on their ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. We also studied the role of NCoR on gene expression of a negatively regulated target gene, sialyltransferase. We previously used cDNA microarrays to identify this gene as negatively regulated by T3 in liver (24Feng X. Jiang Y. Meltzer P. Yen P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In some negatively regulated target genes, there is ligand-independent activation by TR (29Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Northern blotting analysis showed that ligand-independent activation in the hypothyroid state was decreased in the transgenic mice compared with littermate controls (Fig. 4). These findings result in decreased negative-regulation of sialyltransferase mRNA in the transgenic mice as the difference between mRNA expression in the hypothyroid state and the hyperthyroid state is less in the transgenic mice than wild-type control mice. To investigate other effects of NCoRi expression on hepatic function, we injected control and transgenic mice intraperitoneally with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Proliferating cells that incorporated BrdUrd into their genomic DNA were visualized by staining liver sections with an antibody specific for BrdUrd (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B, proliferating cells were increased by 120% in the highest expressing line (F210) and 50% in the medium expressing line (F183) when compared with control littermates. Additionally, TUNEL analyses was performed and did not show any significant apoptosis in the transgenic or littermate control mice (data not shown). cDNA microarray analyses was undertaken to study the patterns of gene expression in the transgenic mouse livers. cDNAs obtained from hepatic RNA from two different transgenic lines were labeled with the fluorescent dye, cy5, whereas cDNA obtained from control mice RNA were labeled with a second fluorescent dye, cy3. The labeled cDNAs were hybridized on an array containing a total 4500 mouse gene elements, and their expression pattern was determined. We observed 28 genes that were up-regulated by more than 2-fold and 10 genes that were down-regulated by more than 60% in two different transgenic lines. The full results of this microarray study will be reported elsewhere. Interestingly, we found up-regulation of a number of genes that were either markers of proliferation or correlated with hepatocyte proliferation (Table I). Additionally, we observed a strong down-regulation of retinoblastoma (Rb) mRNA, which is a key regulator of G1 to S phase transition. Northern blotting performed on RNA samples from each of the transgenic lines confirmed the up-regulation of these genes (Fig.6).Table IcDNA microarray analysis of genes related to cell proliferation in transgenic mouse liversClone IDGeneFold-InductionF210F220387802alpha fetoprotein3.362.48597868bcl35.052.84515968cAMP response element modulator3.572.97552363tumor necrosis factor receptor5.264.44582081MAP kinase phosphatase-14.695.56483145insulin-like growth binding protein3.698.4779163cyclin A23.684.06463944zinc finger protein 905.563.05619049retinoblastoma-binding protein0.1660.157Hepatic RNA from individual transgenic mice (lines F210 (high-copy number) and F220 (medium-copy number)) and their littermate controls was prepared, labeled, and analyzed by cDNA microarray analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Similar results were obtained in a repeat analysis with different mice from the same lines.

Unliganded thyroid and retinoic acid receptors can repress transcription in cotransfection and in vitro systems by interacting with corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT. Previously, it was not known whether basal repression of target gene expression by TRs occurs in physiological conditions, and what its mechanism might be if it did occur. Our Alb-NCoRi transgenic mouse model provides in vivo evidence that nuclear hormone corepressors are involved in the basal repression by TRs in absence of ligand. Earlier in vitro studies showed that overexpression of NCoRi and several regions of NCoR involved in nuclear receptor interaction blocked RAR- and TR-mediated basal repression (23Hollenberg A.N.

Yang W.M. Seto E. Peterson D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this derepression was dominant negative activity by the mutant NCoRs on wild-type NCoR activity. Our in vivo data are consistent with these in vitro findings, as overexpression of NCoRi in transgenic livers resulted in derepression of several positively regulated thyroid hormone-responsive genes but had no effect on ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. Additionally, NCoRi did not affect basal transcription of at least one thyroid hormone-responsive gene, malic enzyme, suggesting that specific corepressors may mediate basal repression of target genes. We also found that overexpression of NCoRi partially blocked the basal transcription of a negatively regulated target gene, sialyltransferase, in the absence of hormone. These results are consistent with the findings of Tagami et al. (29Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) who showed that NCoR can augment basal transcription of negatively regulated target genes in cotransfection studies.

https://openalex.org/W2061735505,"We describe the molecular cloning and characterization of S2V, a novel sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin. The cDNA of S2V encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein with four extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains and a cytoplasmic tail bearing a typical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and an ITIM-like motif. A unique feature of S2V is the presence of two V-set Ig-like domains responsible for the binding to sialic acid, whereas all other known siglecs possess only one. S2V is predominantly expressed in macrophage. In vivo S2V was tyrosine-phosphorylated when co-expressed with exogenous c-Src kinase. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, S2V recruits both Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, two important inhibitory regulators of immunoreceptor signal transduction. These findings suggest that S2V is involved in the negative regulation of the signaling in macrophage by functioning as an inhibitory receptor. When expressed in COS-7 cells, S2V was able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding to human red blood cells, suggesting that S2V may function through cell-cell interaction."

Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The nAChR is composed of four subunits organized pseudo-symmetrically as an α2βγδ pentamer around a central ion channel pore. The ion channel transiently gates open in response to the binding of two molecules of acetylcholine, leading to the flux of cations across the postsynaptic membrane. Prolonged exposure to acetylcholine converts the nAChR into a nonconducting desensitized state. Each of the four subunits contains a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four 25–30-amino acid-long hydrophobic segments designated M1 to M4, and a cytoplasmic loop between the M3 and M4 transmembrane segments. The N-terminal domain of each α-subunit contains one binding site for acetylcholine. The four transmembrane segments form the ion channel pore, with M2 from each subunit directly lining the ion channel. The intracellular loop between M3 and M4 may serve as a regulatory domain in that several residues can be phosphorylated, leading to altered rates of desensitization. The structure of the transmembrane domain of the nAChR has been the subject of considerable recent investigation. All four transmembrane segments were originally assigned α-helical secondary structures based on hydrophobicity analysis (5Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Kikyotani S. Furutani Y.

The resulting four-transmembrane-α-helices-per-subunit model is supported by a large body of biochemical and biophysical data, including the α-helical-labeling pattern of the exposed transmembrane surfaces by both ion channel-specific and lipid-soluble photoactivatable probes (7Revah F.

A 9 Å resolution structure of the nAChR exhibits five rods of electron density lining the ion channel pore, consistent with α-helical transmembrane M2 pore-lining segments (17Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cryoelectron microscopic studies reveal a diffuse pattern of electron density at the periphery of the receptor transmembrane domain that has been interpreted in terms of M1, M3, and M4 from each subunit, contributing to a ring of transmembrane β-strands surrounding an inner core of channel-lining M2 α-helices (17Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). FTIR studies of proteolytically degraded native nAChR membranes and molecular modeling are both consistent with a mixture of α-helices and β-strands forming the transmembrane domain (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Hucho F. Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Trends Biochem.

A mixed secondary structure has also been suggested for the transmembrane domain of the glycine receptor (21Leite J.F. Amoscato A.A. Cascio M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13683-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Cascio M. Shenkel S. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20981-20988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mixed α-helix/β-sheet structure suggested by Unwin (17Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) represents a new motif for the transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins in general and for neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in particular. The proposed transmembrane structure has important implications for the mechanisms of channel gating and desensitization as well as for the mechanisms of channel regulation by endogenous factors such as receptor phosphorylation. The transmembrane model also questions the general validity of interpreting hydrophobicity plots in terms of transmembrane α-helices. Here, we examine the secondary structure of the transmembrane domain of affinity-purified nAChR. In contrast to recent proteolytic studies on native membranes (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), our analysis shows that all nAChR transmembrane segments adopt α-helical secondary structures. Our results strongly support an nAChR transmembrane domain composed of five bundles of four-transmembrane α-helices. The nAChR from frozen Torpedo californica electric tissue (Marinus, Inc., Long Beach, CA) was affinity-purified on a bromoacetylcholine bromide-derivatized Bio-Rad Affi-Gel 201 column and reconstituted into membranes composed of 3:1:1 egg phosphatidylcholine/dioleoylphosphatidic acid/cholesterol (23McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This lipid composition supports both cation flux and agonist-induced conformational change. Affinity-purified membranes typically give a purity of 90–100% nAChR, as estimated by [125I]-bungarotoxin binding (24Méthot N. McCarthy M.P. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7709-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (see also theinset of Fig. 1). Proteinase K treatment was essentially as described previously for native nAChR membranes (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), except that the affinity-purified nAChR membranes were dissolved in a solution containing 5 mg/ml proteinase K, 50 mm phosphate buffer, and 150 mm KCl at pH 8.0. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and equivalent aliquots of proteinase K were added after 3 and 7 h. Before digestion with Pronase, the nAChR membranes were permeabilized with saponin to ensure enzyme access to both faces of the nAChR membranes. The nAChR was suspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 2 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. A small volume containing 0.01 mg/ml saponin in 2 mmphosphate buffer was added to give a final saponin concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the nAChR was centrifuged for 30 min, the resulting pellets dissolved in a 0.2 mg/ml Pronase solution containing 0.1 m Tris and 10 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.5, and the nAChR membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Both reactions were stopped with the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 5 mm. An equal volume of 1 mNaCl was added, each tube was shaken on ice for 1 h to solubilize any aggregated peptides, and the membranes were pelleted 2 times to isolate the integral membrane peptides. The final pellets were resuspended in 2 mm phosphate buffer and stored at −80 °C. Proteolytic digestion of the nAChR was assessed by Tricine SDS-PAGE on 16% gels (25Shägger H. von Jaggow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar) with Coomassie Blue-staining. Alternatively, the degraded nAChR was equilibrated for 1 h with 0.4 μm3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine [125I]TID, irradiated at 365 nm for 7 min, and then run on Tricine SDS gels. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography for 2 h with an intensifying screen. FTIR spectra of the native and digested nAChR membranes were recorded using the attenuated total reflection technique on an FTS-575 spectrometer (Bio-Rad) equipped with a DTGS detector. A small volume of nAChR containing the equivalent of 250 μg of starting material was spread on the surface of a germanium internal reflection element, and the bulk aqueous solvent was evaporated with a gentle stream of N2 gas. The nAChR membranes were exposed to 2H2O-saturated N2 gas for 2 h before recording spectra in the deuterated state. Each spectrum is a minimum of 256 scans, and each was recorded at 2 cm−1 resolution. Spectra of myoglobin, lysozyme, and trypsinogen for resolution enhancement were recorded as described elsewhere (24Méthot N. McCarthy M.P. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7709-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Linear dichroism spectra were recorded in 2H2O using a Brewster angle polarizer (Harrick). Spectra were recorded with the infrared light polarized either parallel (A∥) or perpendicular (A⊥) to the plane of incidence. The dichroic ratio, R, is defined as the ratio of the absorbance of light oriented parallel (A∥)versus perpendicular (A⊥) to the plane of incidence with the germanium internal reflection element (26Günthard H.H. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 270-332Google Scholar, 27Hübner W. Mantsch H.H. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 1261-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The thick film approximation was used to interpret the data, as samples containing similar amounts of intact nAChR are well beyond the penetration depth of the evanescent wave and saturate the absorption signal. In this approximation, an Rvalue of 2 is defined as Risotropic and usually corresponds to no orientation preference. For the amide I and amide II vibrations, R values greater and less thanRiso, respectively, suggest a net orientation perpendicular to the internal reflection element and, thus, bilayer surface. The orientation of the transmembrane α-helices was calculated according to Hübner and Mantsch (27Hübner W. Mantsch H.H. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 1261-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) from the amide II vibration dichroism assuming an angle between the amide II transition dipole and α-helix long axis of either 75 or 90°. The residual amide II band in 2H2O reflects unexchanged peptide hydrogens that are likely located within the transmembrane domain, whereas the amide I vibration likely has additional contributions from randomly oriented extended or loop structures located at the membrane surface. Infrared spectra of intact affinity-purified nAChR exhibit two relatively intense protein vibrations located in the 1600–1700-cm−1(amide I) and 1520–1580-cm−1 (amide II) regions. The amide I contour in FTIR spectra recorded in2H2O (Fig. 1) is relatively broad and symmetric, with substantial intensity centered near both 1655 and 1635 cm−1, frequencies characteristic of the α-helix and β-sheet, respectively (28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar, 29Jackson M. Mantsch H.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 30Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 365-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Both the amide I band shape and a more extensive curve-fitting analysis of the amide I contour suggest a mixed α-helix/β-sheet protein with a slight predominance of α-helical secondary structures (24Méthot N. McCarthy M.P. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7709-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Dousseau F. Pézolet M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8771-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The secondary structure estimated for intact affinity-purified nAChR is ∼40% α-helix and ∼35% β-sheet, similar to values that have been reported for the nAChR based on studies of native alkaline-extracted nAChR membranes (32Naumann D. Schultz C. Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Hucho F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3162-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The rapid (within seconds) change in amide I band shape upon exposure to2H2O suggests the presence of a substantial number of peptides forming random conformations (11Baenziger J.E. Méthot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29129-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To investigate the structure of the pore-forming domain of the nAChR, the transmembrane structure was isolated by digesting the extramembranous domains with one of two water-soluble proteolytic enzymes, proteinase K or Pronase. SDS-PAGE of the transmembrane polypeptides obtained after centrifugation shows that both enzymes cleave the α, β, γ, and δ subunits, disrupting agonist binding capabilities (Fig.2 a). Only very weak staining near 34 kDa for the proteinase K-treated sample and potential staining below 7 kDa in both the proteinase K- and Pronase-treated samples, however, were consistently observed. The former is likely due to small amounts of proteinase K that co-sediments with the nAChR membranes (see the legend to Fig. 2), whereas the latter is likely due to the proteolytically generated polypeptides (see Fig. 2 b). The poor staining could reflect the preference of Coomassie Blue for positively charged residues and, thus, a limited ability to interact with hydrophobic transmembrane segments. This interpretation is consistent with the lack of staining observed for peptides generated in proteolytic studies of native nAChR membranes (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain preparation was analyzed further by first photolabeling the lipid-exposed segments with the hydrophobic photoreagent [125I]TID (8Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 33Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and then separating the labeled polypeptides by Tricine SDS-PAGE (25Shägger H. von Jaggow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar). As is evident in the autoradiographs of dried Tricine gels for proteinase K- and Pronase-degraded nAChRs (Fig. 2 b), the vast majority of the [125I]TID labeling is clearly detected in polypeptides migrating with apparent masses in the 3–6 kDa range. Even with a 4-fold increase in autoradiographic exposure (not shown), there is no visual evidence of [125I]TID-labeled intact nAChR subunits and only very minor evidence of labeled fragments migrating with masses greater than 6 kDa. Furthermore, densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs and γ-counting of excised gel slices reveals that greater than 95% of the total [125I]TID photoincorporation is restricted to peptides in the 3–6-kDa mass range. These results indicate that the nAChR transmembrane domain preparation is comprised predominantly of polypeptides ∼3–6 kDa in mass, consistent with the expected mass of polypeptides containing only the nAChR transmembrane segments (5Noda M.

Nature. 1982; 299: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of the 125I-labeled fragments confirms this result. For example, sequence analysis of the ∼6-kDa fragment revealed a primary peptide beginning at αMet243, consistent with the presence of a peptide comprising the M2-M3 hydrophobic segments. The intense labeling with the hydrophobic reagent, [125I]TID, is also consistent with a transmembrane location for the generated polypeptides. FTIR spectra of proteolytically treated nAChR exhibit several features consistent with enzymatic digestion of the extramembranous domains (Fig.3, top two traces ina and b). The intensity ratio of the 1740 cm−1 (lipid carbonyl stretching) to 1655 cm−1 (protein amide I) vibrations, which is related to lipid-protein ratio (35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), increases substantially upon proteolytic treatment. The magnitude of the relative increase in intensity near 1740 cm−1 suggests that roughly 70% of the nAChR protein mass has been degraded, consistent with the 70–75% nAChR protein mass located outside the lipid bilayer (17Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There is also a dramatic loss in the intensities of bands near 1580 cm−1, which are due to the vibrations of ionized carboxyl groups of aspartate and glutamate side chains (Fig.3 b). The loss of intensity in this region suggests that proteolytic treatment removes the vast majority of negatively charged amino acid side chains located in extramembranous regions of the nAChR. The very weak intensity remaining near 1580 cm−1 in the proteinase K-treated sample spectra could be due to residual proteinase K. The proteolytically treated nAChR is relatively resistant to peptide1H/2H exchange. Comparison of the amide II band intensities near 1547 cm−1 observed before and after exposure to 2H2O suggests that roughly 60% of the polypeptides generated by proteinase K treatment remain in a protiated form after 2 h of exposure to2H2O. This contrasts the roughly 90% peptide1H/2H exchange that occurred upon exposure of three water-soluble proteins, myoglobin, lysozyme, and trypsinogen, to2H2O for 2 h under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). The strong protection of these peptide hydrogens located in relatively short polypeptide segments to exchange with deuterium supports a location within the hydrophobic, relatively water-inaccessible environment of the lipid bilayer. Pronase-treated nAChR is also resistant to peptide 1H/2H exchange (40–50% protiated after 2 h), but prior permeabilization of the membranes with saponin slightly enhances peptide 1H/2H exchange rates relative to the proteinase K-treated receptor. In contrast to spectra of intact nAChR, spectra of the transmembrane domain preparation exhibit relatively sharp symmetric amide I band contours centered near 1657 and 1655 cm−1 in1H2O and 2H2O, respectively. Both band shapes and frequencies are highly characteristic of α-helical structures. The lack of significant change in band shape upon exposure to 2H2O suggests there is little random coil. The weak intensity near 1635 cm−1 in comparison to the intensity observed in spectra of intact nAChR suggests there is minimal if any β-sheet (Figs. 3 and 4). The strong α-helical character of the nAChR transmembrane domain is supported by a curve-fitting analysis of the amide I contour (data not shown). Curve-fitting suggests an α-helical content of between 75 and 80%, although this value must be viewed as a very rough estimate given the inherent difficulties associated with the curve-fitting complex amide I contours (see “Discussion”). The remaining 20–25% of the peptides adopt structures that vibrate in the 1700–1670 cm−1 (β-sheet and/or turn) and 1640–1620 cm−1 (β-sheet) regions of the spectra and could reflect the presence of small amounts of transmembrane β-strands. Weak bands in both regions, however, are evident in the spectra of proteins such as myoglobin and bacteriorhodopsin, which are completely devoid of β-sheet (see Fig. 4 and Refs. 28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar and 35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The weak bands observed between 1700–1670 cm−1 and 1640–1620 cm−1 in the transmembrane domain spectra, thus, cannot unequivocally be interpreted in terms of β-sheet in the transmembrane domain. A quantitative sense of the α-helix and β-sheet character of the transmembrane segments was obtained by comparing the deconvolved spectra with those of proteins of known secondary and tertiary structures (Fig. 4). The deconvolved transmembrane domain spectra contrast sharply those recorded from trypsinogen (∼10% α-helix, ∼55% β-sheet) and other proteins, such as the β-barrel membrane protein porin, which exhibits predominantly β-sheet secondary structures (28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar, 35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Note that the β-sheet content of trypsinogen approaches that suggested for the nAChR transmembrane domain based on low resolution electron microscopic images. The transmembrane domain spectra are not compatible with the roughly 75% β-sheet content suggested for the nAChR transmembrane domain (17Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain spectra exhibit much less intensity in both the 1700–1670 cm−1 and 1640–1620 cm−1 β-sheet regions than is observed in spectra of lysozyme (∼45% α-helix, ∼20% β-sheet) and other proteins with low β-sheet content (28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). This comparison suggests that much less than 20% of the nAChR transmembrane domain peptides adopt β-sheet secondary structures. A β-sheet content of 10% would only correspond to roughly 1 β-strand/subunit. Given that the length of each hydrophobic segment (M1-M4, 25–30 amino acids) would require the presence of at least 2 or 3 β-strands/subunit (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the intensities of bands potentially attributable to β-strands may be too low to interpret in terms of any transmembrane β-sheet. The weak bands observed between 1700–1670 cm−1 and 1640–1620 cm−1 are, thus, likely due to turn or extended structures possibly located in the aqueous environment at the membrane surface as opposed to transmembrane β-strands. The high α-helical content of the transmembrane domain and the possibility that the non-α-helical amide I vibrations arise from turn and extended structures, both, are supported further by a comparison of the transmembrane domain spectra with those of myoglobin (∼85% α-helix, no β-sheet). Both exhibit relatively narrow and symmetric amide I bands that undergo little change in shape upon exposure to2H2O [1H/2H exchange spectra of myoglobin are found in Baenziger and Chew (38Baenziger J.E. Chew J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3617-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)]. The amide I contours are similar in terms of the relative intensities of α-helical and non-α-helical vibrations. The non-α-helical bands also vibrate at similar frequencies. In fact, the only clear difference between the spectra is that the deuterated α-helical structures in myoglobin vibrate at a lower frequency relative to the α-helical structures of the transmembrane domain preparation, which remain predominantly in the protiated form. The latter difference is expected given that α-helical structures, including those of intact nAChR, shift down in frequency by 5–10 cm−1 upon complete peptide 1H/2H exchange (11Baenziger J.E. Méthot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29129-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Méthot N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14815-14822Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 365-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar,38Baenziger J.E. Chew J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3617-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As noted, protection of the transmembrane domain peptide hydrogens to exchange with deuterium is consistent with a hydrophobic transmembrane location. This spectral comparison shows that both myoglobin and the transmembrane domain preparations have very similar secondary structural contents. In addition, the transmembrane domain amide I band is very similar in terms of the frequencies and relative intensities of both α-helical and non-α-helical component bands to that observed for the α-helical integral membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin, which also does not exhibit β-sheet (35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The spectra are thus entirely consistent with a transmembrane domain preparation composed predominantly of transmembrane α-helices, the remaining peptides adopting turn or extended structures at the bilayer surface. The nAChR transmembrane preparation exhibits dichroic ratios of 2.3 and 1.5 for the amide I and amide II bands, respectively, which both suggest a net orientation preference for α-helices perpendicular to the bilayer surface and contrast the dichroism expected for oriented transmembrane β-strands (Fig. 5) (39Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2710-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The average net tilt of the transmembrane α-helical polypeptides away from the bilayer normal is ∼40o, although both the mosaic spread of the transmembrane domain-containing bilayers and polypeptide motion average the measured amide I and II band dichroism closer toRisotropic and, thus, increase the calculated net tilt away from the bilayer normal (see the legend to Fig. 5). The calculated net tilt thus represents a maximum limiting value. The actual net tilt of the transmembrane α-helices is likely much less than 40°. The data presented here suggest an exclusively α-helical structure for the transmembrane domain of the nAChR. This conclusion is based on the highly α-helical character of the infrared spectra recorded from the nAChR transmembrane domain preparations as well as from linear dichroism spectra, which suggest α-helical structures orientated perpendicular to the bilayer surface. In particular, the amide I contour observed in spectra of the transmembrane domain exhibits much less β-sheet character than spectra of proteins such as lysozyme and trypsinogen, which contain ∼20% and ∼55% β-sheet content, respectively (28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar, 35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain spectrum contrasts sharply that of the β-barrel integral membrane protein, porin (35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Conversely, the transmembrane domain amide I band shape is very similar to the band shapes observed in spectra recorded from myoglobin and the α-helical integral membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), which both lack any β-sheet. These spectral comparisons suggest an almost exclusively α-helical character for the transmembrane domain. A curve-fitting analysis of the transmembrane domain spectra supports further our conclusion and suggests an α-helical content of 75–80%. Although this value is consistent with the amide I band shape, it should be noted that accurate curve-fitting of complex amide I contours composed of numerous broad overlapping component bands is difficult, particularly when few definitive input parameters (component band shape, height, and width as well as a precise knowledge of the number of bands and base-line position) are available. Although a quantitative analysis of secondary structural content based on amide I band shape comparisons, as performed here, does not provide distinct numerical estimates, the analysis is not affected by the mathematical uncertainties associated with curve-fitting and provides an accurate visual estimate of the relative limits of the α-helix and β-sheet contents. The spectral comparisons noted above show clearly that less than 20% of the nAChR transmembrane peptides adopt a β-sheet structure, assuming that all bands in non-α-helical regions of the spectra are due to β structures. Note that 10% β-sheet content is not sufficient to account for the 2–3 transmembrane β-strands required to account for one transmembrane segment of 25–30 amino acids in each subunit. Conversely, the close similarity between the amide I band shapes in spectra of the transmembrane domain and myoglobin suggests similar secondary structures for these two proteins and is, thus, consistent with a transmembrane domain preparation composed of at least 80% α-helix with the remaining peptides adopting extended or turn structures. Given that the studied transmembrane fragments are 3–6 kDa in length, the most plausible interpretation of our data is that the transmembrane domain preparation is composed of α-helical transmembrane structures with extended or turn structures at the bilayer surface. This conclusion contrasts a recent study of the transmembrane domain of the nAChR generated after proteolytic treatment of native nAChR membranes (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The latter study calculated a secondary structural content of ∼50% α-helix, ∼40% β-structure and turn and 10% random and concluded a mixed α-helix/β-sheet transmembrane domain. The discrepancy between the two studies can be attributed to a number of factors. First, the native membrane preparations used in the latter may contain non-nAChR impurities, such as a Torpedoanalog of the voltage-dependent transmembrane anion channel (40Blanton, M. P., Lala, A. K. & Cohen, J. B. (2001)Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). This protein shares homology with the β-barrel porins, and its possible presence in the native transmembrane preparations could contribute to the β-sheet character of the spectra. Second, the presented secondary structural analysis of Gorne-Tschelnokow et al. (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was performed on spectra recorded in1H2O. Because 1H2O vibrations overlap the amide I band in a region normally attributed to β-sheet, unavoidable difficulties subtracting1H2O from the spectra could have contributed to the calculated β-sheet content of the transmembrane domain. Finally, the analysis of Gorne-Tschelnokow et al.(18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) did not take into account the possibility that weak non-β-sheet vibrations can occur in regions of FTIR spectra normally attributed to β-sheet, as has been observed in spectra of numerous α-helical proteins (Fig. 4and Refs. 28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar and 35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Although the relative merits of assigning such weak bands to β-sheet versus turn and/or extended structures is debatable, it is significant to note that the β-sheet content suggested by Gorne-Tschelnokow et al. for the transmembrane domain is similar to that which has been reported for intact nAChR despite dramatically different amide I band shapes for the intact and proteolyzed receptor. Furthermore, the amide I band shapes observed for the transmembrane domain both here and in the work of Gorne-Tschelnokow et al. (18Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) do not exhibit close to the same level of β-sheet character that is observed in spectra of other proteins that contain 30–40% β-sheet. These empirical comparisons, which are at the heart of all FTIR analyses of protein secondary structure (although supported by theoretical calculations), indicate that the nAChR transmembrane domain does not contain a large percentage of transmembrane β-sheet. In conclusion, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility, there is no definitive evidence in our spectra for the existence of any β-sheet in the transmembrane domain preparations of the nAChR. The strong α-helical character of the nAChR transmembrane segments is consistent with biophysical studies of individual transmembrane segments (13Corbin J. Méthot N. Wang H.H. Baenziger J.E.
