https://openalex.org/W1582769766,"NADPH-cytochrome c (cytochrome P-450) reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) has been purified to homogeneity, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis, from detergent-solubilized rat and pig liver microsomes using an affinity chromatography procedure. Treatment of microsomes with a polyethoxynonylphenyl ether plus either cholate or deoxycholate and subsequent batch-wise DEAE-cellulose chromatography followed by biospecific affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B-bound N6-(6-aminohexyl)-adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (2'5'-ADP-Sepharose 4B) result in a greater than 30% yield of purified reductase from microsomes. The enzyme contains 1 mol each of FAD and FMN and exhibits a molecular weight of 78,000 g mol-1 estimated by comparison with protein standards on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The turnover numbers calculated on the basis of flavin are 1360 min-1 and 1490 min-1 at 25 degrees for the pig and rat liver enzymes, respectively. Titration of these purified preparations aerobically with both NADPH and potassium ferricyanide demonstrated unequivocally that the air-stable, reduced form of NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase contains 2 electron equivalents, confirming recent results obtained by Masters et al. (Masters, B. S. S., Prough, R. A., and Kamin, H. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 607-613) for the proteolytically solubilized enzyme. In addition, these preparations are capable of reconstituting benzphetamine N-demethylation activity in the presence of partially purified cytochrome P-450 and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, as measured by formaldehyde formation from benzphetamine."
https://openalex.org/W2051291943,"These studies provide new insight into the complex mechanisms wherby hyperlipidemia causes progressive atherosclerosis. It has been shown that physical injury to the endothelial lining of arteries sets off a process which probably is an attempt at healing the injury but which can lead to atherosclerosis. It has also been found that chemical agents such as homocystine can produce a similar series of events leading to atherosclerosis. These events include focal loss of endothelium, exposure of subendothelial connective tissue, and adherence of platelets followed by release of factors that stimulate intimal smooth muscle proliferation. The present studies indicate that the effects of chronic hyperlipidemia are complex in that the condition results not only in the deposition of lipids in the atheromatous lesions but that it may produce the primary endothelial injury that initiates the process of atherosclerosis as well."
https://openalex.org/W2000880684,"Chromatin was obtained from Drosophila melanogaster during early embryogenesis and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Nuclear contents spread at progressive stages of syncytial development show a low level of only non-nucleolar template activity, and very few RNP fibril gradients extending over 2 μm in length are observed. At the cellular blastoderm stage, newly activated nucleolar genes appear during the early portion of the first true cell cycle. Variation in the lengths of incomplete rRNP gradients indicates that the activation of each rRNA gene is independently controlled. All rRNA loci, whether having complete or incomplete gradients, exhibit high densities of nascent transcripts per unit length, suggesting that the rate of chromatin transcription, rather than the RNA polymerase I pool size, limits rRNA synthesis on individual genes. No more than half the rRNA genes are derepressed at this stage, indicating that total rRNA synthesis is regulated by the number of genes activated. Non-nucleolar RNP fibril gradients covering up to 8 μm of genome are also first observed at the cellular blastoderm stage. Most of these gradients are differentiated from the short gradients first seen during syncytial growth by a lower density of transcribing RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1740416844,"The fatty acid cyclooxygenase (ec 1.14.99.1) that produces the prostaglandin and thromboxane precursor, 15-hydroperoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-peroxidoprosta-5, 13-dienoic acid (PGG2), has been purified from sheep vesicular glands to a specific activity of 46,000 units/mg of protein by combining detergent solubilization, (NH4)SO4 fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Flurbiprofen-Sepharose, isoelectric focusing, and gel filtration. The final enzyme preparation exhibited only one band of 70,000 molecular weight following sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie blue. Treatment of the purified oxygenase with [3H] acetylsalicylic acid yielded a radioactive product which co-electrophoresed with the protein of 70,000 molecular weight. Thus, the isolated protein appeared to be the same one which, in crude preparations, selectively binds acetyl groups in association with prostaglandin synthetic activity. Incubation of the purified oxygenase with [1-14C] arachidonic acid in the presence of stannous chloride yielded only 9 alpha, 11 alpha, 15-trihydroxy-prosta-5,13-dienoic acid (PGF2alpha). Without stannous chloride, a mixture of radioactive products was observed which was characteristic of nonenzymic breakdown of PGG2. Thus, the isolated enzyme catalyzed the insertion of both oxygen molecules required for the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from polyunsaturated fatty acid substrates. The aerobic absorption spectrum of the isolated oxygenase showed a faint peak at 412 nm indicative of heme. The iron content indicated that a significant amount of nonheme iron was present. The purified oxygenase was activated by added hemin, which was readily bound to the protein. The subsequently isolated heme-protein complex showed a major absorption peak at 407 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1602211564,"A highly purified and reconstituted hepatic microsomal monooxygenase system, completely free of epoxide hydrase and consisting of cytochrome P-448 from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, phosphatidylcholine, and NADPH, metabolizes benzo (a)pyrene to products highly mutagenic in strains TA 98 and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium. The formation of mutagenic metabolites is completely dependent on the presence of benzo (a)pyrene, NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome P-448 and is partially dependent on phosphatidylcholine. Mutation frequency in both strains is linearly related to amount of cytochrome P-448 and to time of incubation. Highly purified cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-treated rats is relatively poor in catalyzing the formation of mutagenic metabolites from benzo (a)pyrene. Addition of 7.5 to 75 units of highly purified epoxide hydrase to the cytochrome P-448-dependent monooxygenase system decreases the number of mutations by approximately 50% and30% in strains TA 1538 and TA 98, respectively. Additional amounts of epoxide hydrase (300 units) fail to further suppress mutations, indicating that at least some, but probably not all, of the mutagenic metabolites of benzo (a)pyrene are arene oxides. In the absence of a monooxygenase system, mutations induced by benzo (a)pyrene 4,5-oxide are readily quenched by epoxide hydrase, whereas mutations induced by a diol epoxide metabolite of benzo (a)pyrene [(+/-)-7 beta, 8alpha-dihydroxy-9beta, 10beta-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo (a)pyrene] are not. Several known and potential phenolic and dihydrodiol metabolites of benzo (a)pyrene are metabolized to products mutagenic in the Salmonella. The number of mutations induced per nmol of hemoprotein is approximately 3- to 4-fold higher when trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo (a)pyrene replaces benzo (a)pyrene as a substrate for the cytochrome P-448-dependent monooxygenase system. Little or no mutagenic activity is observed with trans-dihydrodiols at positions 4,5, 9,10, or 11,12 of the hydrocarbon, either in the absence or presence of the active monooxygenase system. Of the 12 possible isomeric monophenols of benzo (a)-pyrene, only 6- and 12-hydroxybenzo (a)pyrene are moderately active bacterial mutagens; 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-hydroxybenzo (a)pyrene are premutagens (i.e. metabolized to mutagenic products); and 4-, 5-, 7-, 8-, 10-, and 11-hydroxybenzo (a)pyrene have little or no mutagenic activity with or without further oxidative metabolism. Benzo (a)pyrene 7,8-oxide, a carcinogen on mouse skin, is weakly mutagenic but can be further metabolized to a highly active bacterial mutagen(s), presumably diol epoxide(s), by a combination of epoxide hydrase and the cytochrome P-448 monooxygenase system. This is the first example of a direct role of epoxide hydrase in the metabolic activation of a chemical to a toxic product."

https://openalex.org/W1583528970,"The binding protein for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D3 or calcifidiol) in human plasma has been purified from Cohn Fraction IV. Following in vitro labeling with 25-OH-[3H]D3, the isolation sequence of procedures included: DEAE-cellulose chromatography; gel filtration on Sephadex G-200; chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex; preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These procedures resulted in a calcifidiol-binding protein (Cal-BP) which had been purified approximately 170-fold, and which was homogeneous by physical and immunological criteria. The purified Cal-BP had inter-alpha mobility, a sedimentation constant (S20, w) of 3.46 S, and a molecular weight of approximately 59,000. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of Cal-BP and ligand incubations indicated that there was apparently one binding site for either cholecalciferol, calcifidiol or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol per molecule of human Cal-BP. The protein had highest affinity for calcifidiol, displaying an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 6.4 X 10(-8) M for this sterol. Specific anti-human Cal-BP antisera were prepared in rabbits, and produced precipitate lines of identity between Cal-BP and human serum. Specific binding of vitamin D3,25-OH-D3, and 1,25-(OH)2D3 by human serum was completely neutralized after immunoprecipitation of the serum with the gamma globulin fraction of anti-Cal-BP antiserum, indicating a common transport protein for these sterols in human plasma. There was no immunological cross-reactivity between Cal-BP and rat or chicken sera, indicating that the Cal-BP in these three sera are immunologically completely distinct. Purified human Cal-BP and human sera also produced lines of identity with commercial anti-human group-specific component (Gc) antisera in radial immunodiffusion experiments. This finding supports an earlier report of the identity of calciferol/calcifidiol-binding protein and group-specific component in human serum. The Cal-BP content of human serum is approximately 10(-5) M, whereas the calcifidiol content is approximately 10(-7) M. Normally, the dominant moiety of human plasma Cal-BP is the apoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1645492839,"Blocked and methylated 5' termini of reovirus mRNA are formed by viral cores at an early stage of transcription. Cores incubated in a complete transcription reaction mixture for 30 s, or in a mixture lacking UTP and ATP for a longer time, synthesize the cap structure, m7GpppGmpC. The dinucleotide ppGpC functions as substrate for a core-associated guanylyltransferase and is converted to GpppGpC by addition of pG from GTP. For optimal conversion, both the diphosphate terminus and phosphodiester bond are required. pGpC is not a substrate, but pppGpC is utilized after removal of the gamma-phosphate by a core nucleotide phospohydrolase. Methyltransferases also present in cores transfer methyl groups sequentially from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to the N7-position of the 5'-terminal guanosine followed by the 2'-OH of the penultimate guanosine. GpppGpC is hydrolyzed by cores in the presence of pyrophosphate to ppGpC, the predominant 5'-terminal structure of reovirus mRNA made in the absence of S-adenosylmethionine. N7-methylation prevents pyrophosphorolysis of m7GpppGpC, which may explain the increased proportion of blocked, methylated 5' termini in viral mRNA synthesized in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine. On the basis of these findings, the following reaction series is proposed for the synthesis of reovirus mRNA caps. In the series, AdoHcy is the abbreviation for S-adenosylhomocysteine (see article)9"
https://openalex.org/W2054620086,"We have measured the reassociation kinetics of DNA from the micronucleus and from the macronucleus of the hypotrichous cillate Oxytricha. The micronuclear DNA reassociates with at least a two-component reaction, indicating the presence of both repeated and non-repeated sequences. The kinetic complexity of micronuclear non-repeated DNA is in the range of 2 to 15 × 1011 daltons; the haploid DNA content of the micronucleus is 4 × 1011 daltons (0.66 pg), measured microspectrophotometrically. The DNA of the macronucleus reassociates as a single second-order reaction, with a kinetic complexity of 3.6 × 1010 daltons. A comparison of the kinetic complexities of micronuclear and macronuclear DNAs suggest a 5 to 30 fold reduction in DNA sequence complexity during the formation of a macronucleus from a micronucleus. Macronuclear DNA is in pleces with an average molecular weight of 2.1 × 106 daltons. Since the kinetic complexity of macronuclear DNA is 3.6 × 1010 daltons, the macronucleus must contain about 17,000 different kinds of DNA pieces. Each macronucleus contains 3.5 × 1013 daltons (58 pg) of DNA, indicating that each sequence must be present about 1000 times per macronucleus or 2000 times per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1564684046,"Methods have been developed for identifying the pathway of assimilation of N2-derived nitrogen. The products of fixation of 13N-labeled nitrogen gas ([13N]N2), and the distribution of 13N within glutamine, were determined after short periods of labeling (approximately 1 to 120 s) and also in pulse-chase experiments. Ammonia, the amide nitrogen of glutamine, and the alpha-amino nitrogen of glutamate, in that order, were the first observed products of fixation of N2 by the cyanobacterium (blue-green alga), Anabaena cylindrica. This sequence of the formation of nitrogenous products was confirmed by the use of inhibitors. The presence of 1 mM methionine sulfoximine permitted continued formation of 13NH3, while virtually preventing 13N-labeling of amino acids. In the presence of 1 mM azaserine, glutamine was labeled, but not other amino acids. Our observations demonstrate unequivocally that N2-derived nitrogen fixed by this organism is metabolized initially by the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1531713878,"The orientation of proteins and glycoproteins of the platelet surface has been studied using various surface probes and labeling reagents. A fourth major glycoprotein has now been detected in platelet plasma membranes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis in addition to the previously recognized glycoproteins I, II, and III. Glycoprotein IV Mr, = approximately 87,000) appears to be present on the inner aspect of the membrane or buried within it since it is not accessible to surface probes such as lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, radiolabeling with transglutaminase and [14C]glycine ethyl ester, or proteolytic enzymes. The ratio of these four major membrane-bound glycoproteins is approximately 10:4:2:3. Contrary to previous reports, only one glycoprotein, glycoprotein III, is accessible to lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination in intact platelets. Differences in the rate of destruction of glycoprotein II in intact platelets by trypsin suggests that two components may be migrating in this region. Examination of the soluble fraction obtained following platelet homogenization showed the presence of a single soluble glycoprotein of molecular weight 148,000 comprising about 10% of total platelet sialic acid. Treatment of intact platelets with neuraminidase resulted in the quantitative loss of siliac acid from the soluble glycoprotein, and it was strongly labeled in the intact platelet by [14C]glycine ethyl ester in the presence of transglutaminase. Treatment of intact platelets with chymotrypsin which does not cause the platelet release reaction, caused the rapid conversion of the soluble glycoprotein to a macroglycopeptide. These results indicate a surface origin for the soluble glycoprotein rather than a cytoplasmic or granular origin. The term glycocalicin is suggested for this glycoprotein in view of its origin in the platelet glycocalyx."
https://openalex.org/W1983198647,"Somatic cell hybrides between different mouse myeloma cell lines have been readili isolated using modifications of existing techniques. The hybrid nature of these cells was established by HAT or HAT-ouabain selective procedures, their chromosome number, and, in one case, H-2 surface antifen expression. Three hybrid cell lines are described here in detail: an IgG2B, K X LgG2a, k; an IgG1, k X IgG2b, k; and an IgG1, k X IgM, Lambda. In all cases, both parental types of H and L chains are expressed in the hybrid cells and no new chains are observed. However, molecules possessing disulfide-bonded mixtures of parental H and/or L chains are seen. Analysis of subclones of these hybrids indicates considerable stability in the expression of the immunoglobulins for up to 13 months. However, segregant clones no longer synthesizing one or more of the parental H or L chains arise frequently."
https://openalex.org/W1542656360,"GTP cyclohydrolase I, an enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction in the pathway for the biosynthesis of the pteridine portion of folic acid, was purified from Escherichia coli by 3,900-fold to apparent homogeneity. Its molecular weight is estimated at 210,000. At relatively high concentrations of salt (e.g. 0.3 M KCl) the enzyme can be dissociated into seemingly identical subunits of 51,000 molecular weight. Removal of the salt allows reassociation. GTP, ATP, and inorganic orthophosphate at concentration of 5 muM, 100muM, and 0.2 mM, respectively, promote the reassociation of the subunits even in the presence of 0.3 M salt. The subunits have little or no catalytic activity. When the enzyme was subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions (in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate) only one protein band was evident; its molecular weight was estimated at 25,500. Proline was determined as the only NH2-terminal amino acid residue of the enzyme. These observations suggest that the enzyme consists of four identical subunits and that each subunit contains two identical polypeptide chains. Enough GTP was bound to the enzyme to suggest that each polypeptide contains one GTP binding site. The Km value for GTP IS 0.02 MuM. ATP, dGTP, and guanosine 5'-tetraphosphate are competitive inhibitors with Ki values of 0.25 muM, 0.24 muM, and 0.13 muM, respectively. Orthophosphate is an uncompetitive inhibitor. The enzyme is relatively heat-stable; its half-life at 82 degrees is 7 min. Salt (NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl) at a concentration of 0.1 M activates the enzyme by 4- to 5-fold. The only products of the action of the enzyme are formate and the triphosphoester of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(D-erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydropteridine (H2-neopterin-PPP). The evidence strongly suggests that this single enzyme catalyzes 4 independent chemical reactions in the conversion of GTP to H2-neopterin-PPP."
https://openalex.org/W1520399899,"Glycocalicin, a major glycoprotein of the platelet glycocalyx, is obtained in soluble forms following platelet homogenization and has been purified to homogeneity. Glycalicin has a molecular weight of 148,000 (+/- 5,000) as determined by gel electrophoresis. It contains 60 grams % carbohydrate (46.6 mol %) comprising galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acid as its principal sugars in a ratio of 2:1:1:2, but with a small amount of glucose (2.3 mol %), mannose (1.2 mol %), and fucose (1.9 mol %). The principal amino acids are serine and threonine (4.9 and 7.6 mol %), leucine (6.7 mol %), proline, (6.8 mol %), and aspartic and glutamic acids (4.7 and 5.8 mol %). Tryptic digestion of glycocalicin yielded a macroglycopeptide (Mr = 118,000 +/- 5,000) identical with that previously obtained from intact platelets (Pepper, D.S., and Jamieson, G.A. (1970) Biochemistry 9, 3706-3713) and a peptide of molecular weights 45,000 (+/- 2,000) which contained only 7 mol % carbohydrate. This peptide showed a significant enrichment of serine, glycine, and glutamic acids compared with glycocalicin and together these amino acids comprised over 50 mol % of the peptide. Purified glycocalicin gave a single precipitin line with antiserum prepared in chickens. It showed reactions of partial identity with both the macroglycopeptide and the (non-glyco)peptide obtained by tryptic digestion and these showed lines of partial identity with each other. These results suggest that at least three determinants are present in the intact molecule. Glycocalicin gave precipitin reactions with wheat germ agglutinin and with the lectin of Agaricus bisporus."
https://openalex.org/W1552520990,"The primary structure of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase C has been determined. The single polypeptide chain contains 259 amino acid residues devoid of disulfide bridges. The experimental approach has involved restriction of the action of trypsin to arginyl bonds by amidination of the lysyl side chains. The six tryptic fragments obtained have been separated and sequenced by manual techniques. During the sequence work on human carbonic anhydrase C, 3 very easily deamidated asparagine residues were noted, all occurring in -Asn-Gly- sequences. The deamidation which takes place even under normal conditions of peptide preparation seems to be associated with a beta-aspartyl shift. A few minor differences existing between our structure and the results from another laboratory are discussed. A brief comparison is made with the primary structures of other carbonic anhydrases with regard to the function of some amino acid residues in the active site of the enzymes."

Affinity chromatography was the most effective step in a purification procedure which resulted in a preparation that contained only a single 40,000 molecular weight protein band upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel electrophoresis. The purified galactanase digests a beta-1,4-galactan purified from citrus pectin and digests partially the isolated cell walls of suspension-cultured sycamore cells. The predominant product of the enzymic degradation of the substrates tested is a 4-linked tetragalactose. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that the galactanase attacks its substrates in both an exo- and endo-manner. The products obtained upon galactanase digestion of the soybean arabianin-galactan demonstrate that the earlier proposal concerning the structure of this polysaccharide must be incorrect."

https://openalex.org/W1489649770,"ATP citrate lyase was purified by two different procedures from the livers of rats first starved and then fed with a fat-deficient and high carbohydrate-glycerol diet. These enzyme preparations were judged homogeneous by sedimentation equilibrium and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was around 4.4 X 10(5) as determined by sedimentation equilibrium. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis the enzyme usually showed a single protein band with an estimated molecular weight of 1.2 X 10(5). A similar value for the molecular weight of the subunit was obtained by gel filtration on 6% agarose in the presence of 6 M guanidinium chloride. The molecular weight of this polypeptide chain was estimated by sedimentation equilibrium to be around 1.1 X 10(5). These results indicated that ATP citrate lyase has a subunit structure of four polypeptides of similar size. The extinction coefficient of the dry protein and its amino acid composition are also reported. Some batches of fully active enzyme, judged to be homogeneous by sedimentation equilibrium and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showed two additional major polypeptides (Mr approximately 7.1 X 10(4) and 5.5 X 10(4)) on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Studies on the polypeptides produced by proteolytic modification of the native enzyme by trypsin indicated that the additional protein bands observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis with some of the batches of enzyme could have been formed by limited proteolysis (nicking) of the original 1.1 X 10(5) subunit. Trypsin treatment of the native enzyme did not affect the enzyme activity, whereas chymotrypsin and pronase treatment inactivated the enzyme. The trypsin-treated enzyme, which contained only the two smaller polypeptides, did not differ significantly from the untreated enzyme with respect to sedimentation behavior, phosphorylation by ATP, Km for citrate, and immunoreactivity, but it was more heat-labile than the untreated enzyme. The phosphate group on the phosphorylated nicked enzyme was located on the larger polypeptide fragment."

At various stages of growth and spore formation, cells of B. subtilis were pulse-labeled with (35)S-methionine. Protein was extracted from the radioactively labeled bacteria and then subjected to high resolution one-dimensional and two-dimensional slab gel electrophoresis. We report that sporulating cells restricted or ""turned off"" the synthesis of certain polypeptides characteristic of the vegetative phase of growth. In certain cases, this ""turn off"" was prevented in a mutant (SpoOa-5NA) blocked at the first stage of spore formation. Sporulating bacteria also elaborated new polypeptide species that could not be detected in vegetatively growing cells or in cells of the asporogenous mutant SpoOa-5NA in sporulation medium. The synthesis of these sporulation-specific proteins was ""turned off"" in a temporally defined sequence throughout the period of spore formation. Spore coat protein, for example, was first synthesized at 4 hr after the onset of sporulation, the time at which refractile prespores appeared. Certain sporulation-specific polypeptides including the coat protein were among the most actively produced polypeptides in sporulating cells."

Eight monkeys were trained preoperatively on a visual discrimination and tested postoperatively for retention and relearning of the task. They were also tested for Kluver-Bucy symptoms. The two animals that had complete lesions were unable to relearn the visual discrimination. It is suggested that human medial temporal lesions may produce their effects on learning and retention by damage to temporal white matter rather than by destruction of hippocampus.

Some of the more frequently encountered pathological conditions were selected in order to illustrate the mechanisms and the consequences of the metabolic derangements. Therapeutic approaches for the correction of such disorders are discussed where it appears appropriate. In time the precise etiology for those eponymous genetic conditions with stereotyped pathologic and clinical manifestations such as Huntington's chorea (79) and Friedreich's ataxia (80) will be disclosed. It is possible that some forms of epilepsy (81) and perhaps certain psychiatric disturbances (82) will be shown to be inherited metabolic disorders. As our knowledge and skill increase, this logic may eventually be extended to biochemical explanations of variation in individual skills and talents. Certainly innovative extrapolation and novel research directions will be necessary to provide an understanding of these differences.

(a) The promoter of the tRNA1Tyr (su+) gene in the bacteriophage phi80psu+III (the singlet strain) and phi80psu+-III (the doublet strain) and, significantly, the promoter of the tRNA2Tyr gene in the bacteriophage lambdah80dglyTsu+36 all have the following identical sequence in the first 59 nucleotides: (see article) Transcription begins at the underlined terminal nucleotide and proceeds to the right. (b) tRNA1Tyr (su+) as present in the singlet strain phi80psu+III and the tRNA1Tyr (su-), the second gene in the doublet strain phi80psu+-III, have the following identical sequence beyond the C-C-A sequences: (5') TCACTTCAAAAGTCCTGAACT (3') (c) tRNA1Tyr (su+), the first gene in the doublet strain phi80psu+-III, has the sequence (5') TAATTCACCACAGGG (CA) (3'), and tRNA2Tyr in lambdah80dglyTsu+36 has the sequence (5') ATTTCGGCCACGCGA (TGCGG) (3') beyond the C-C-A nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2006466211,"The phage SPO1-modified RNA polymerase B-P can form rapidly initiating complexes with SPO1 DNA but not with heterologous phi1 DNA. The B-P enzyme binds only weakly to heterologous phi29 DNA: preincubation with phi29 DNA does not substantially slow the formation of rapidly initiating complexes between polymerase B-P and subsequently added SPO1 DNA. In contrast, B. subtilis holoenzyme and core polymerase are substantially sequestered by preincubation with phi29 DNA. The results show that at least one of the phage SPO1-coded subunits of the polymerase B-P determines selective transcription at the level of DNA binding and RNA chain initiation, weakens the binding of RNA polymerase core to heterologous DNA, and discriminates against promoter complex formation at certain promoters that are utilized by the B. subtilis holoenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1657914571,"Wheat germ supernatant is resolved into four fractions, C3alpha, C3beta, D and A, all of which are required in addition to elongation EF1 and EF2 for tobacco mosaic virus-RNA (TMV-RNA)-catalyzed amino acid polymerization. Fractions C3beta and D function in the binding of Met-tRNAiMet to the 40 S ribosomal subunit forming an unstable 40 S-Met-tRNA1Met complex that is detected in sucrose gradients only after fixation with glutaraldehyde. Fraction C3beta binds Met-tRNAiMet suggesting that a C3beta-Met-tRNAiMet complex may be an intermediate in the formation of the 40 S complex. GTP is required for the formation of both the C3beta-Met-tRNAiMet and the 40 S-Met-tRNAiMet complexes. In either reaction the nucleotide is partially replaceable by quanyl-5'-yl methylene diphosphonate (GMP-P (CH2) P) while ATP is inactive. When ATP, C3alpha, mRNA, and magnesium acetate (final concentration 3.6 mM) are added to an incubation reaction containing the 40 S-Met-tRNAiMet complex, a stable 80 S-Met-tRNAiMet complex is formed. Radioactive TM virus-RNA binds specifically to the 80 S-Met-tRNAi complex suggesting that mRNA is a component of this complex. C3beta and D, the fractions required in the formation of the 40 S-Met-tRNAiMet complex, are also required for formation of the 80 S-Met-tRNAiMet complex. In addition, unlabeled Met-trnaiMet does not compete significantly with preformed 40 S-Met-tRNAiMet in the 80 S complex-forming reaction. These observations suggest that the 40 S-Met-tRNAiMet complex is an intermediate in the 80 S reaction. The 80 S-Met-tRNAiMet product of the sequential reaction is reactive with puromycin and on this basis it is tentatively considered to be a functional initiation complex. The additional requirement of Fraction A for amino acid polymerization suggests, however, that the initiation process may be more complex."

https://openalex.org/W1668282107,"Abstract The inhibition by specific antibody of carbonic anhydrase B activity towards bicarbonate was uncompetitive (Ki 9.5 X 10(-7) M) whereas that of activity towards p-nitrophenylacetate was mixed-type (Ki 9.2 X 10(-7) M). Differences in the immunological reactivity of the enzyme in the presence of the substrates was documented by quantitative precipitin tests and by the Farr technique. In the presence of bicarbonate, nearly half of the antigenic determinants of the enzyme were altered to such an extent that antibodies directed against these determinants in the native form did not bind. This antibody fraction was separated and shown to react with the native enzyme in different molar ratios than the total antibody population. It produced only a very limited inhibition of the activity towards CO2 and p-nitrophenyl acetate. The immunological reactivity of the enzyme with both the total antibody population and the fraction that is nonreactive in the presence of bicarbonate was identical in the absence of substrates and in the presence of CO2 and p-nitrophenyl acetate. It is suggested that the native enzyme form exhibits enzymatic activity towards CO2 and p-nitrophenyl acetate, whereas in the presence of bicarbonate a conformational adaptation is induced."
