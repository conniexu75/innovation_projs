Thom, Megalithic Sites in Britain (Oxford, London, 1967). 4. G. Daniel, The Megalithic Builders of Western Europe (Hutchenson, London, 1959), pp. 111-113. 5. Actually this tumulus represents what Thom calls a type D ring, one in which the two pivot stakes are placed at one-third the radius from a, rather than at the midpoint. As Fig. 3 shows, the pivots can be kept at the midpoint of the radius if a, is allowed to move inside the design. 6. L. B. Borst, Science 163, 567 (1969). 7. The monument at Borrowston Rig requires anchor points that are placed farther apart on the circumference than the intersections made by the trisecting radii demand. In this design the circle of the smaller end arc passes through the center of the larger end arc, and the wider placement of the anchor stakes may have been made on this account. The site at Maen Mawr had anchor stakes that were closer together on the circumference. If the radial line from P2 to either anchor is taken as a hypotenuse of a right triangle one side of which is half the anchor line, then the lengths of the sides of this triangle (in megalithic half-yards) are 14, 17, and 22, which is nearly Pythagorean (142+ 172= 485e 484). 8. M. Gardner, Sci. Amer. 221, 239 (1969). 9. To mention one such consequence, with the megalithic method concentric rings, such as those found at Woodhenge, can be drawn without using any special mensuration technique. That is, a rope can be lengthened by an unspecified amount and a concentric design can be drawn at once. With a flexible compass, on the other hand, the large arc in a type II egg, for example, can be drawn without special measurement but the other arcs must be changed by x amount to remain equidistant from the perimeter of the original figure. 10. Thom presents a good argument for use of a standard length of 2.72 feet (one megalithic yard) in the construction of these structures, as well as of others in both the Old World and the New. 11.

https://openalex.org/W2134357598,We studied the effects of environmental stimulation on the development of rat cortical pyramidal cell synaptic loci (dendritic spines) and the number of such cells staining by the rapid Golgi technique. Stimulation three to five times a day from the day of birth increased the number of spines per micrometer in 8-day-old animals and increased the number of neurons stanining at 8 to 16 days of age. This effect of afferent input upon development of the dendritic spine may represent the neuroanatomical basis for the influence of early experience on subsequent behavior. The number of neurons staining by the rapid Golgi technique appears to be related to those that are functionally involved at the time of tissue preparation.
https://openalex.org/W1511093181,"Abstract Crystalline preparations of l-amino acid oxidase, which contained the three electrophoretic components, A, B, and C, were separated further into multiple components by isoelectric fractionation in a pH gradient. At least 18 peaks of coincident enzymatic activity and protein were observed when electrofocusing was carried out in a sucrose density gradient according to Vesterberg and Svensson (Acta Chem. Scand., 20, 820 (1966)). The components ranged in isoelectric point from pH 5.2 to 8.4 and differed in amino acid composition. A new technique of electrofocusing in polyacrylamide gels yielded even greater resolution. A two-dimensional separation, utilizing both electrophoresis and electrofocusing in gel, showed that A, B, and C each consisted of five or more components having different isoelectric points. This was confirmed by a study of fractions obtained by ion exchange chromatography of the enzyme and by the study of venoms from individual snakes possessing only Component A, only C, or A, B, and C. The blood, the venom, and extracts of the venom gland of a single snake exhibited identical isozyme patterns. For comparison, gel electrofocusing of d-amino acid oxidase was also carried out. Only two active components, identified as the holoenzyme and the apoenzyme, were observed."

Immunization with a single high dose (100 micrograms) of antigen failed to demonstrate these differences."
https://openalex.org/W2057407056,"Total DNA and DNA from the heterochromatin and euchromatin fractions of male guinea pig liver nuclei were analyzed by cesium sulfate-silver density-gradient centrifugation. Total DNA is composed of three components: a heavy satellite DNA, a main DNA of intermediate density, and a light satellite DNA. Heterochromatin DNA shows a fourfold enrichment in the satellite components while euchromatin DNA is relatively devoid of them. The strands of both satellite DNA's are separable by centrifugation in alkaline cesium chloride. Base analyses on the separate strands demonstrate that the two satellite DNA's represent different species."

https://openalex.org/W1547751414,"Antibodies which fail to precipitate with the monomeric homologous cytochromes c were elicited in rabbits by the conjugate of bovine γ-globulin and cytochrome c (tuna and turkey proteins) or by free monomeric cytochrome c (kangaroo and, in one case, the horse protein). Such antibodies do form precipitates and fix complement when allowed to react with the polymerized homologous antigen. In contrast, antisera elicited by monomeric human, Macaca mulatta, or horse cytochrome c precipitate with the monomeric homologous antigen; these antisera also give much stronger reactions, both in precipitin and complement fixation tests, when reacted with polymeric preparations of the antigens than with monomers. In all cases but one, the reactions of the polymers were completely or nearly completely inhibited by an excess of the monomeric protein, and these inhibitions were highly efficient. Such differences in immunological behavior between polymeric and monomeric preparations of cytochrome c can be accounted for by the increase in antigenic valence on polymerization. As immunogens, polymeric preparations of the cytochromes c from the horse, tuna, M. mulatta, kangaroo, and rabbit are much more effective in rabbits than the corresponding monomeric proteins, and except for the rabbit protein, yield antibodies in amounts comparable to those elicited by other effective soluble protein antigens. In the case of human cytochrome c, polymers and the monomer are good and equally effective immunogens. Polymers fix more complement and precipitate more antibody than monomeric preparations when reacted with antisera elicited by polymeric, as well as monomeric preparations. These antisera contain no antibodies specific to the polymerized forms of the cytochromes c. Possible reasons for the large enhancement of cytochrome c immunogenicity on polymerization are discussed. Of all cytochromes c examined, only the human protein is strongly immunogenic as the monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1480920903,"Abstract The production of antibodies by rabbits in response to monomeric preparations of human, Macaca mulatta, and horse cytochromes c, incorporated in complete Freund's adjuvant, is described. These antibodies precipitate with the monomeric homologous antigens, whereas no such precipitates occurred with antisera elicited by monomeric preparations of the kangaroo (Macropus canguru), turkey, and tuna proteins, or by preparations of these last two cytochromes c conjugated to acetylated bovine γ-globulin. The most potent immunogen was the human protein and the antibodies elicited were shown to be associated with the γG-globulin fraction of serum. The cross-reactions of the three precipitating antisera with the cytochromes c from 25 different eukaryotic species were studied by quantitative complement fixation and by competition of unlabeled heterologous antigen with 125I-labeled homologous antigen for its combination with antibody. Cytochromes c from different species which have identical amino acid sequences cannot be distinguished immunologically. With some antisera there is a rough correlation between the number of differences in primary structure among various cytochromes c and the homologous antigen and the extent of their immunological cross-reactivity. Some antisera do not distinguish between cytochromes c of different amino acid sequences. For those cytochromes c which differ by single residues, the immunological distinction may vary from very minor to major. In a small globular protein such as cytochrome c, the effects of amino acid substitutions on antigenic properties can serve to identify and characterize antigenic determinants."

https://openalex.org/W2049653874,"Fast axoplasmic transport, shown in cat sciatic nerves by a crest of labeled activity after injection of the L7 ganglion with [(3)H]-leucine or [ (3)H]-lysine, was stopped within 15 minutes after death of the animals by bleeding. If the sciatic nerves were removed from the animals and placed in a chamber supplied with oxygen at 38 degrees centigrade, fast transport was sustained. Transport was rapidly blocked in similar in vitro preparations when the nerves were kept in a nitrogen environment. Fast axoplasmic transport is closely dependent upon oxibdative metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2063204940,"Oxidation of exogenous nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide and succinate by corn mitochondria was measured as a function of lead chloride concentration. Lead chloride (50 to 62 micromoles per liter) stimulated oxidation of exogenous reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide by 174 to 640 percent depending on the reaction mediums, whereas lead chloride (12.5 micromoles per liter) inhibited succinate oxidation by more than 80 percent. When inorganic phosphate was included in reaction mediums the subsequent addition of lead was without effect due to the low solubility of lead phosphate. If addition of lead was followed by addition of phosphate the inhibition of succinate oxidation by lead was released, but there was no reduction in the stimulation of oxidation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide by lead. The effects of lead on plant growth might be accentuated under conditions of phosphate deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1542742221,"Abstract Pig heart l-lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 1 was purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino acid composition, specific activity, and pH optima with several substrates were determined. Catalysis of both the oxidation and the reduction of glyoxylate by this enzyme was studied. Reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate requires DPNH, and the rate is optimal at pH 6.9. Oxidation of glyoxylate to oxalate requires DPN+, and the pH optimum is 9.3. General rate equations for both reactions were determined. The two reactions appear to be catalyzed in a common protein site, and a compulsory order mechanism for the reactions is suggested by analogy with other lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reactions. Inhibitor constants with oxalate, oxamate, and several other glyoxylate analogues were determined for both reactions at pH 8.6. The pattern of inhibition by oxalate and oxamate is similar to that observed when pyruvate and lactate are used as substrates for the enzyme. The glyoxylate reactions appear to occur in the same site and probably involve the same amino acid functional groups as the pyruvate-lactate reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2001494787,Mouse myeloma cells in continuous culture were cloned in soft agar. The clones were assayed for their ability to synthesize heavy and light chains of gamma globulin by immunoprecipitation directly in the agar. A minor population secreting only light chains was identified. The two cell types were recloned and a low incidence of conversion of 7S to light-chain production was demonstrated. This technique can be used to isolate rare variants of cells secreting specific macromolecules.

Since the dye does not cross nerve cell membranes, the selective staining of cones is further evidence for structural differences between rod and cone outer segments. Specifically, it is believed that cone saccules are open to extracellular space whereas rod saccules are not."
https://openalex.org/W2081620236,"In 29 acutely psychotic patients (mostly schizophrenic), histochemical abnormalities of a myopathic type were demonstrated in skeletal muscle biopsies from 13 and were generally correlated with elevation of the ""muscle"" type isoenzymes of creatine phosphokinase in the patients' serum. The incidence was much higher than found in normal controls, hospitalized neurotic psychiatric patients, or parents of acutely psychotic patients. A diazo-coupling type of ""alka-line phosphatase"" reaction was particularly useful in identifying abnormal muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1623476209,"Abstract Proteins to which a series of peptides of defined length and structure have been attached were used in this study as immunogens and as cross-reacting antigens in order to evaluate to what extent the hapten inhibition method reflects the size and nature of the antigenic determinant to which the animal was exposed. Peptides of the structure (dAla)n-Gly (n = 1 to 4) were coupled to RNase and rabbit serum albumin in a one-step synthesis. Peptides of the structures (dAla)n (n = 2 to 5), (dAla)n-Gly (n = 1 to 4), and (dAla)n-Gly-e-aminocaproic acid (n = 1 to 3) were used as inhibitors of the immunological reactions. From cross-precipitation and inhibition experiments it was concluded that the size of the combining sites was in all cases such as to accommodate 4 amino acid residues, and thus the antigenic determinant is a tetrapeptide. Direct evidence is presented that the lysine residue in the protein carrier participates in the antigenic determinant only when the hapten attached is smaller than a tetrapeptide. The most exposed portion of the determinant (NH2-terminal amino acid residue) plays an immunodominant role. An increase in the inhibitory capacity in a series of related haptens does not necessarily reflect the properties of the combining site. Nevertheless, the inhibition technique can be used as a tool for estimating the size and nature of the combining sites of antibodies, provided that the structure of the antigenic determinants is known."
https://openalex.org/W1578895102,"Isolated brown fat cells were prepared from hamsters fasted for 48 hours and were incubated in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer. Endogenous respiration was low and was stimulated 6-fold by succinate, 4-fold by α-glycerophosphate, 20-fold by oleate, up to 30-fold by epinephrine or norepinephrine, and 2- to 4-fold by uncoupling agents. The norepinephrine-stimulated respiration was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by oligomycin, arsenite, and uncoupling agents. Succinate respiration was relatively insensitive to inhibition by oligomycin or to stimulation by uncoupling agents. Malonate at concentrations which inhibited completely succinate respiration had no effect on norepinephrine-stimulated respiration. Malate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate were shown to be the end products of succinate and α-glycerophosphate respirations, respectively. The ratio of endogenous ATP to ADP in resting cells was 4.6. This ratio decreased by about one-half when respiration was initiated by norepinephrine or oleate. A submaximal concentration of the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone decreased ATP levels by 60%, whereas subsequent addition of norepinephrine caused an elevation of the ATP content towards control values. Addition of oligomycin also caused a fall of ATP, which was restored almost to normal by addition of norepinephrine. Arsenite caused a small depletion of ATP, but subsequent addition of norepinephrine produced a rapid fall of the ATP content. A similar effect was obtained in the presence of arsenite and oligomycin. Addition of succinate to cells after prior additions of arsenite and norepinephrine was able to spark a large increase of oxygen uptake, possibly by providing ATP for fatty acid activation. The present results emphasize the role of substrate level phosphorylation for generation of high energy phosphate required for the activation of fatty acids to the coenzyme A derivatives. However, it is apparent that some degree of control at phosphorylation sites by phosphate acceptors limits respiration of brown fat in the resting state. Stimulation of the tissue by norepinephrine, which causes the liberation of free fatty acids from triglyceride, provides both substrate and messenger for the release of respiratory control. It is suggested that if fatty acids themselves are the primary uncoupling agent, brown fat mitochondria must be extremely sensitive to the release of respiratory control by these agents."

Membranes not treated with valinomycin are not affected by DDT. This blockade of potassium conductance parallels the effect of DDT on axonic conduction. Dieldrin and lindane, whose physiological actions are in some ways like those of DDT, do not affect valinomycin-induced conductance of lecithin-decane membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1571780627,"Abstract Studies on the enzymic fragmentation of a single component 6.5 S human cryoglobulin (γ1:λ, Gm factor 4), obtained from a patient suffering from idiopathic cryoglobulinemia, were undertaken to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of temperature-dependent gel formation and its relation to the gross structure of the cryoglobulin molecule. Proteolytic scission of cryoglobulin by papain produced Fab monomers and Fc dimers of apparent molecular weights of 44,600 and 48,900, respectively. Papain fragments, individually or collectively, did not form gel. The Fab (papain) fragments, however, exhibited a dimer-monomer equilibrium dependent on the hydrogen ion concentration of the milieu. Treatment of the cryoglobulin with pepsin produced two F(ab)2 fragments, F1(ab)2 and F2(ab)2, and one Fc fragment of apparent molecular weight of 105,600, 93,000, and 40,500, respectively. The disulfide-linked pepsin fragments formed gel in neutral and alkaline buffers at 3°. An increase in the molecular size of the F(ab)2 fragments and alkaline pH produced greater gel formation. Sedimentation velocity analysis with F1(ab)2 fragment under varying conditions of temperature and pH revealed the formation of a dimer as a major polymer component and a trimer as a minor one. Carbohydrate analyses showed the presence of 10 residues of hexoses (galactose and mannose), 2 residues of fucose, 6 residues of glucosamine, and 2 residues of sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1964427326,"Rats reared on diets containing tricyanoaminopropene, the antithyroid compound that stimulates RNA synthesis, showed a deficit in performance on automated closed-field maze tests many weeks after discontinuation of the drug. The rats were also tested while still receiving the drug, and performance deficits were indicated in tests of Y-maze reversal and manual closed-field maze performance; rats treated with the drug and with thiouracil behaved in a highly similar fashion on several tasks. No evidence of facilitation by tricyanoaminopropene appeared in any of the eight learning situations used. Exposure to tricyanoaminopropene before and after birth, at doses sufficient to produce anatomical cretinism, apparently induces an enduring behavioral deficit which is similar to that of neonatal thyroidectomy-induced cretinism in rats and which parallels the mental retardation associated with human cretinism."

https://openalex.org/W1505533197,"Abstract An induced antibiotic peptide lactonase from Actinoplanes missouriensis-degrading actinomycin has been purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by calcium phosphate-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, and Sephadex G-200 column chromatography. The enzyme appears to be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and in acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Km value for actinomycin is 1.14 x 10-5 m. The molecular weight, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, is approximately 60,000. The sedimentation coefficient is s020,w = 3.42 S. This enzyme is induced by addition of actinomycin to the growing cells. It does not hydrolyze other peptide lactone antibiotics including staphlomycin S, vernamycin Bα, echinomycin, etamycin, or stendomycin. The crude enzyme preparations convert actinomycin to actinomycinic acid through actinomycin monolactone, but the purified enzyme only converts actinomycin to actinomycin monolactone."
