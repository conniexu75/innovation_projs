https://openalex.org/W2129319296,"Mutations of the gene Lps selectively impede lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal transduction in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice, rendering them resistant to endotoxin yet highly susceptible to Gram-negative infection. The codominant Lps d allele of C3H/HeJ mice was shown to correspond to a missense mutation in the third exon of the Toll-like receptor-4 gene ( Tlr4 ), predicted to replace proline with histidine at position 712 of the polypeptide chain. C57BL/10ScCr mice are homozygous for a null mutation of Tlr4 . Thus, the mammalian Tlr4 protein has been adapted primarily to subserve the recognition of LPS and presumably transduces the LPS signal across the plasma membrane. Destructive mutations of Tlr4 predispose to the development of Gram-negative sepsis, leaving most aspects of immune function intact."

All calves were visibly normal, but four died at or soon after birth from environmental causes, and postmortem analysis revealed no abnormality. These results show that bovine cumulus and oviductal epithelial cells of the adult have the genetic content to direct the development of newborn calves."

Tryptic peptides from this protein were determined to be alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG). Several strains of LCMV and other arenaviruses, including Lassa fever virus (LFV), Oliveros, and Mobala, bound to purified alpha-DG protein. Soluble alpha-DG blocked both LCMV and LFV infection. Cells bearing a null mutation of the gene encoding DG were resistant to LCMV infection, and reconstitution of DG expression in null mutant cells restored susceptibility to LCMV infection. Thus, alpha-DG is a cellular receptor for both LCMV and LFV."
https://openalex.org/W2086402424,"The c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway has been implicated in the immune response that is mediated by the activation and differentiation of CD4 helper T (T H ) cells into T H 1 and T H 2 effector cells. JNK activity observed in wild-type activated T H cells was severely reduced in T H cells from Jnk1 –/– mice. The Jnk1 –/– T cells hyperproliferated, exhibited decreased activation-induced cell death, and preferentially differentiated to T H 2 cells. The enhanced production of T H 2 cytokines by Jnk1 –/– cells was associated with increased nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor NFATc. Thus, the JNK1 signaling pathway plays a key role in T cell receptor–initiated T H cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1984744054,"alpha-Tocopherol (vitamin E) is a lipid-soluble antioxidant synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms. alpha-Tocopherol is an essential component of mammalian diets, and intakes in excess of the U.S. recommended daily allowance are correlated with decreased incidence of a number of degenerative human diseases. Plant oils, the main dietary source of tocopherols, typically contain alpha-tocopherol as a minor component and high levels of its biosynthetic precursor, gamma-tocopherol. A genomics-based approach was used to clone the final enzyme in alpha-tocopherol synthesis, gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase. Overexpression of gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase in Arabidopsis seeds shifted oil compositions in favor of alpha-tocopherol. Similar increases in agricultural oil crops would increase vitamin E levels in the average U.S. diet."
https://openalex.org/W1964052965,"Autophagy is an intracellular process for bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components. We recently found a protein conjugation system essential for autophagy in the yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The C-terminal glycine of a novel modifier protein, Apg12p, is conjugated to a lysine residue of Apg5p via an isopeptide bond. This conjugation reaction is mediated by Apg7p, a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1)-like enzyme, and Apg10p, suggesting that it is a ubiquitination-like system (Mizushima, N., Noda, T., Yoshimori, T., Tanaka, Y., Ishii, T., George, M. D., Klionsky, D. J., Ohsumi, M., and Ohsumi, Y. (1998) Nature 395, 395–398). Although autophagy is a ubiquitous process in eukaryotic cells, no molecule involved in autophagy has yet been identified in higher eukaryotes. We reasoned that this conjugation system could be conserved. Here we report cloning and characterization of the human homologue of Apg12 (hApg12). It is a 140-amino acid protein and possesses 27% identity and 48% similarity with the yeast Apg12p, but no apparent homology to ubiquitin. Northern blot analysis showed that its expression was ubiquitous in human tissues. We found that it was covalently attached to another protein. This target protein was identified to be the human Apg5 homologue (hApg5). Mutagenic analyses suggested that this conjugation was formed via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of hApg12 and Lys-130 of hApg5. These findings indicate that the Apg12 system is well conserved and may function in autophagy also in human cells.

Recently, we found a quite novel protein conjugation system, which is required for autophagy in yeast (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a bulk protein degradation process in which cytoplasmic components including organelles are enclosed in double membrane structures termed autophagosomes and delivered to lysosome/vacuole to be degraded (21Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 22Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Autophagy is essential for cells to survive during nutrient limitation and may be crucial for cellular remodeling during development and differentiation and removal of obsolete cellular components. This process is ubiquitous in eukaryotes. However, the molecular basis of the autophagic pathway is poorly characterized. We found that autophagy proceeds in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in a manner quite similar to that in animals (23Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 24Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It allows us to study the autophagic process at a molecular level. So far we have isolated 14 autophagy-defective (apg) mutants (25Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Cloning of APG genes revealed that they were novel genes (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 26Kametaka S. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y.

Gene. 1997; 192: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), except APG6, which is allelic toVPS30 involved in vacuolar protein sorting (29Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This indicates that little effort has been paid to uncover the molecular mechanism of autophagy. During systematic characterization of Apg proteins, we discovered a new protein conjugation system (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Apg12p, a 186-amino acid protein, is attached covalently to Apg5p, a 294-amino acid protein. The C-terminal glycine of Apg12p and the Lys-149 of Apg5p is indispensable for the conjugation, suggesting they are conjugated via an isopeptide bond between these two residues. Among Apg proteins, two other factors, Apg7p and Apg10p, are required for the conjugation. Apg7p shows significant homology to the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1). Apg10p might be a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2)-like protein. Thus, at least four Apg proteins (Apg5p, -7p, -10p, and -12p) function together in the protein conjugation system. Autophagy cannot proceed with a defect in any one of their genes. Although the Apg12p conjugation system is similar to ubiquitination, the amino acid sequence of Apg12p is distinct from that of ubiquitin. Considering that the other modifier proteins discovered are all “ubiquitin-like” (13Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), Apg12p is the first “ubiquitin-unrelated” modifier. In higher eukaryotes, although autophagy is described morphologically and physiologically (21Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 22Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), no molecules have been isolated that are directly involved in autophagy. The Apg12 conjugation system would be conserved also in mammals. Here we report the cloning of human Apg12. We also show that it is conjugated to human Apg5 homologue. S. cerevisiae APG12-related genes were searched in the EST data base using the tblastn program. It identified several cDNA fragments (EST183504, EST42556, zo30d07, zx66d05.r1, EST86492, zo17a07.r, etc.) encoding parts of a potential human APG12 homologue. The sequence of 5′-end was obtained using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, poly(A) mRNA obtained from HeLa cells was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) primer. The double-stranded cDNA was ligated with the Marathon cDNA adaptor. 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed with the adaptor primer 1 (AP1) and a gene-specific primer (h12GSP1; 5′-GTTCGTGTTCGCTCTACTGCCCACTT-3′) derived from the ESTs. The PCR products were subcloned and sequenced by automated DNA sequencing (ABI-PRISM model 377). The cDNAs of hApg12 and hApg5 amplified by PCR from total cDNA of HeLa cells were cloned intoEcoRI and SmaI sites of pCI-neo expression vector (Promega), respectively. DNA containing 3× hemagglutinin (HA) or 3× Myc epitope coding sequence was inserted after the first ATG codon of hApg12 (pHA-Apg12 and pMyc-Apg12) and before the stop codon of hApg5 (pApg5-HA). hApg5 was also cloned into pEGFP-C1, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expression vector (CLONTECH) to obtain pGFP-Apg5. Deletion of the C-terminal glycine residue of hApg12 (pHA-Apg12ΔG) and substitution of Lys-130 of hApg5 by arginine (pApg5K130R-HA) were performed by PCR-based mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNA probe of the whole Apg12 coding region was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern blot analysis of human multiple tissue blot (CLONTECH) was performed with the probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was stripped and rehybridized with the actin probe (CLONTECH). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, cells were seeded on 6-well or 35-mm dishes. The next day, cells were transfected with a mixture of 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of FuGENE6 (Boehringer Mannheim). For cotransfection, 0.5 μg of each plasmid was used. The transfected cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and directly lysed in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing protease inhibitors and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots (10 μl) of the lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (16B12, BAbCO) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) and developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A homology search of the human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base identified several cDNA fragments coding regions of a protein that is significantly related to yeast Apg12p (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). However, all of them lack the first methionine codon. To obtain the 5′-end sequence, we performed 5′-RACE method using the gene specific primer (h12GSP1). The PCR amplification yielded a single band of about 250 base pairs. Sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed that two fragments derived from independent PCR contained an ATG codon in the reading frame. One of the PCR fragments reached to nucleotide −19, but no more ATG codon was found. The ATG codon is surrounded by a consensus sequence that is characteristic to the eukaryotic ribosome binding site used for the initiation of translation (30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). These suggest that this ATG codon is the translation initiation point (see below). The cDNA encodes a hydrophilic protein, designated as human Apg12 (hApg12), 140 amino acids long with a predicted molecular mass of 15 kDa (Fig. 1). hApg12 is 46 amino acids shorter than the yeast Apg12p and is 27% identical and 48% similar to amino acids 49–186 of the yeast Apg12p (Fig. 1). In particular, the C-terminal half of hApg12 is highly related to the yeast Apg12p. The C-terminal glycine, which is involved in the yeast Apg5p/Apg12p conjugation, is conserved. hApg12, as well as the yeast Apg12p, does not have homology to ubiquitin. The EST sequences of hApg12 were derived from various tissues and cells such as brain, placenta, colon, germinal B cell, and Jurkat T cell. This suggests that hApg12 could be ubiquitously expressed among human tissues. To confirm it, we carried out Northern blot analysis. Four major transcripts of 1.0, 2.4, 3.6, and 5.0 kb were detected in all tissues examined, including heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, suggesting that hApg12 mRNA is widely expressed (Fig.2). The yeast Apg12p is a novel modifier protein whose C-terminal glycine is conjugated to Apg5p (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Since the C-terminal regions of hApg12 and the yeast Apg12p are significantly similar, we tested whether hApg12 is also conjugated to other proteins. To detect hApg12, we tagged hApg12 with 3× HA epitopes at its N terminus. COS-1 cells were transfected with pHA-Apg12 and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Most of hApg12 presented as a band at 26 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2,band a). In addition, we detected a faint band at about 65 kDa (band b). Judging from the predicted molecular mass, the band at 26 kDa represents a monomer of tagged hApg12. The higher band suggests that hApg12 is covalently conjugated to another protein. While we were cloning a human homologue of the yeast Apg5p, it was reported by another group (31Hammond E.M. Brunet C.L. Johnson G.D. Parkhill J. Milner A.E. Brady G. Gregory C.D. Grand R.J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is a 276-amino acid-long protein and 26% identical and 46% similar to the yeast Apg5p (26Kametaka S. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To ask whether the higher 65-kDa band (Fig. 3, lane 2, band b) is an hApg12/hApg5 conjugate, we cotransfected COS-1 cells with pHA-Apg12 and pApg5. Overexpression of hApg5 increased the amount of the 65-kDa band (Fig. 3, lane 3), suggesting that it represents an hApg12/hApg5 conjugate. To confirm this, hApg5 was fused with GFP and expressed. The higher band was shifted to about 100 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 4, band c), which was also detected by anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 3, lane 5). Taken together, we concluded that hApg12 is conjugated to hApg5. We next examined whether hApg12 is conjugated to hApg5 in a manner similar to yeast cells. When COS-1 cells were transfected with pHA-Apg12ΔG, in which the C-terminal glycine codon was deleted, the hApg12/hApg5 conjugate was not observed (Fig.4 A, lane 3). This conjugation did not occur even when hApg5 was overexpressed (Fig. 4A,lane 6). These results indicate that C-terminal glycine of hApg12 is required for the conjugation. For analysis of hApg5, we tagged hApg5 with 3× HA epitopes at C terminus, since C-terminal tagging did not affect the function of the yeast Apg5p. On immunoblotting, most of HA-hApg5 presented as a free form of about 37 kDa (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). In addition, another HA-specific band was observed at about 65 kDa (Fig.4 B, lane 2). When untagged hApg12 was overexpressed, intensity of the band was augmented (Fig. 4 B,lane 3). These results indicate that the 65-kDa band represents the hApg12/HA-hApg5 conjugate. The transfected hApg12 generated exactly the same sized band as authentic hApg12 did (Fig.4 B, lanes 2 and 3), supporting the fact that the hApg12 cDNA we cloned contains a whole open reading frame sequence. As expected, overexpression of 3× Myc epitope-tagged hApg12 led to formation of a larger hApg12/hApg5 conjugate (Fig.4 B, lane 4), which was detected with anti-Myc antibody also (data not shown). Replacement of Lys-149 of the yeast Apg5p resulted in complete loss of the conjugate, whereas replacement of the other lysine residues had no effect, suggesting that Lys-149 is the acceptor site for Apg12p conjugation (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Alignments of the amino acid sequences of the yeast and human Apg5 suggested that Lys-130 of hApg5 is a candidate for acceptor residue. To assess this possibility, we substituted the lysine with arginine (K130R). HA-hApg5K130R was not conjugated by hApg12 (Fig. 4 B, lane 5), even when hApg12 was overexpressed (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Taken together, these data suggest that hApg12 is conjugated to hApg5 in a manner quite similar to that in yeast; the C-terminal glycine of hApg12 is attached to the central lysine residue of hApg5. We have shown a new human protein conjugation system in which hApg12 is conjugated to hApg5. This is most probably due to an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of hApg12 and an ε-amino group of Lys-130 of hApg5. These results indicate that the yeast Apg12p conjugation system is well conserved in human. In addition, there are potential Apg12 homologues inArabidopsis thaliana (AA720252) andCaenorhabditis elegans (U32305), suggesting that this system exists in all eukaryotes. In yeast, at least two other proteins, Apg7p (activating enzyme) and Apg10p (possible conjugating enzyme), are required for the conjugation (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Therefore, these molecules should also have mammalian counterparts. One of the most striking features of the Apg12 system in both yeast and human is a unique character of Apg12 as a “modifier protein.” Recently, several “ubiquitin-related” modifiers, such as UCRP (17Haas A.L.

Although the Apg12 system is quite similar to the ubiquitin conjugation system, both human and yeast Apg12 are much larger than and have no homology to ubiquitin. However, it is still possible that the three-dimensional structure of Apg12 may resemble that of ubiquitin. All of ubiquitin and its related modifiers are synthesized as precursors and then processed to expose functional C termini that end with Gly-Gly (40Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). In contrast, Apg12 has functional C-terminal “single Gly” instead of “double Gly,” and it does not require C-terminal processing for the conjugation (Figs. 1 and 5). Apg12 seems to have a single target protein, Apg5, whereas the other modifiers are conjugated to several proteins, which have not been fully identified. Thus, Apg12 is a quite new type of modifier protein. Our findings may suggest that there are still unidentified modifier proteins that are not necessarily similar to ubiquitin. Hammond et al. (31Hammond E.M. Brunet C.L. Johnson G.D. Parkhill J. Milner A.E. Brady G. Gregory C.D. Grand R.J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) cloned hApg5 as an “apoptosis-specific protein (ASP).” By cross-reaction of polyclonal antibody against c-Jun, they detected somehow modified hApg5 of about 45 kDa. They reported that, otherwise not detected, the 45-kDa band appeared at late stage or as a result of apoptosis, possibly due to post-translational regulation. They failed to detect an unmodified form of hApg5 through the course. Since our experiments shown here are based on transfection, we do not know the natural expression level of hApg5 and hApg12/hApg5 conjugate. However, our results that transfected HA-hApg12 generated the HA-hApg12/hApg5 conjugate in vivo (Fig. 3, lane 2) suggest that hApg5 is constitutively expressed without apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, the 45-kDa band they detected is much smaller than our 65-kDa band of the conjugate. This discrepancy cannot be attributed to addition of tagged HA peptide (40 amino acids). They may detect degraded or additionally processed forms of hApg5 with anti-c-Jun antibody. Further experiments will be needed to elucidate the role of hApg5 in apoptosis. We do not have direct evidence to show that this system is related to autophagy in human. hApg12 and hApg5 did not complement the autophagy-defective phenotype of yeast strains deficient for Apg12p and Apg5p, respectively (data not shown). However, our results that both the modifier and modified proteins are homologues of yeast Apg proteins strongly suggest that the Apg12 system plays a crucial role in autophagy also in human. Although autophagy is mainly described in hepatocytes and neurons, it is thought to occur in virtually all types of cells (22Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Physiological significance of autophagy in mammals is not clear, but it is probably necessary for normal turnover of cellular components. This is in agreement with the data that mRNA of hApg12 (Fig. 2) and hApg5 (31Hammond E.M. Brunet C.L. Johnson G.D. Parkhill J. Milner A.E. Brady G. Gregory C.D. Grand R.J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) are expressed ubiquitously. Some cDNA clones of hApg12 in EST data base are derived from fetal tissues, suggesting that hApg12 is expressed during fetal stage as well. It remains to be solved at which step in autophagy this modification system works. We speculate that it functions in formation of autophagosome, since (i) accumulation of autophagosomes was not observed in apg5, apg7, apg10, andapg12 mutants, 2M. Baba and Y. Ohsumi, unpublished observation. (ii) most of the yeast Apg12p, Apg5p, and Apg12p/Apg5p conjugate exist in membrane fractions, and (iii) subcellular localization of the yeast Apg12p changes after the conjugation (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). On our transfection experiments, about one-half of both overexpressed hApg12 and hApg5 were detected in membrane fractions. 3N. Mizushima, H. Sugita, T. Yoshimori, and Y. Ohsumi, unpublished observation. Therefore, it is expected that the human Apg12 conjugation system is also involved in membrane dynamism. We now are examining their precise intracellular localization and their expression level under various conditions. Finally, generation of mice deficient for this conjugation system will provide important information on the physiological role of the system, moreover that of autophagy in mammals."

Here, we report that betulinic acid (BetA) is a prototype cytotoxic agent that triggers apoptosis by a direct effect on mitochondria. In isolated mitochondria, BetA directly induces loss of transmembrane potential independent of a benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone-inhibitable caspase. This is inhibited by bongkrekic acid, an agent that stabilizes the permeability transition pore complex. Mitochondria undergoing BetA-induced permeability transition mediate cleavage of caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH/Mch5) and caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama) in a cell-free system. Soluble factors such as cytochrome c or apoptosis-inducing factor released from BetA-treated mitochondria are sufficient for cleavage of caspases and nuclear fragmentation. Addition of cytochromec to cytosolic extracts results in cleavage of caspase-3, but not of caspase-8. However, supernatants of mitochondria, which have undergone permeability transition, and partially purified apoptosis-inducing factor activate both caspase-8 and caspase-3 in cytosolic extracts and suffice to activate recombinant caspase-8. These findings show that induction of mitochondrial permeability transition alone is sufficient to trigger the full apoptosis program and that some cytotoxic drugs such as BetA may induce apoptosis via a direct effect on mitochondria.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that BetA-induced apoptosis differs from “classical” anticancer agents such as doxorubicin (37Fulda S. Friesen C. Los M. Scaffidi C. Mier W. Benedict M. Nuñez G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). BetA-induced apoptosis is not associated with activation of ligand/receptor systems such as CD95 and does not involve p53. Perturbation of mitochondrial function including loss of mitochondrial permeability transition precedes other key features of apoptosis such as activation of the caspase cascade and nuclear fragmentation (37Fulda S. Friesen C. Los M. Scaffidi C. Mier W. Benedict M. Nuñez G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that BetA may have a direct effect on mitochondria. We therefore asked whether BetA would directly activate mitochondria and studied the sequence of the BetA-triggered apoptosis pathway.DISCUSSIONCytotoxic drugs have been reported to act primarily by inducing apoptosis in sensitive target cells (1Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Triggering of apoptosis by anticancer drugs involves simultaneous or subsequent activation of death receptor systems, perturbation of mitochondrial function, and proteolytic processing of caspases, the death effector molecules of apoptosis (25Debatin K.-M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 750-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell death pathway may be entered at multiple sites, and most drugs may hit various targets, although the precise molecular mechanisms have not been characterized in detail. Here, we report that one class of anticancer agents exemplified by BetA may act by directly targeting mitochondria, resulting in caspase activation downstream of mitochondria.Using a cell-free system, we found that BetA directly triggered PT in isolated mitochondria, and induction of PT appears to be the initial event in BetA-triggered apoptosis. Inhibition of PT by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL or by the mitochondrion-specific inhibitor BA prevented all manifestations of apoptosis in intact cells and in a cell-free system such as disruption of ΔΨm, activation of caspases, cleavage of substrates (PARP), and nuclear fragmentation. In contrast to BetA, classical cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin, cis-platinum, or etoposide did not induce mitochondrial perturbations in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial PT, which occurred in intact cells during apoptosis triggered by these substances (20Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar), was the consequence of a primary activation of other pathways or systems. BetA specifically kills neuroectodermal tumor cells (37Fulda S. Friesen C. Los M. Scaffidi C. Mier W. Benedict M. Nuñez G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). When added to intact cells, BetA specifically induced mitochondrial alterations in SHEP neuroblastoma cells, but not in lymphoid cell lines (data not shown). However, BetA-treated mitochondria isolated from the B lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4 triggered mitochondrial PT and mediated nuclear fragmentation, similar to mitochondria from SHEP cells. Thus, the specificity of BetA for neuroectodermal tumors may be explained by cell-specific uptake and/or translocation of the compound to the mitochondrial compartment rather than by differences in mitochondria themselves.In BetA-treated neuroblastoma cells, activation of different caspases and nuclear fragmentation were found only in cells with perturbed mitochondrial function, and BetA-induced loss of ΔΨm could not be inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. This suggests that caspase activation occurs downstream of mitochondria and that activation of mitochondria is sufficient to trigger all downstream events leading to apoptosis. In contrast, in doxorubicin-treated cells, loss of ΔΨm was inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk, indicating that activation of mitochondria is preceded by upstream caspase activation. 2Fulda, S., Susin, S.

Thus, BetA seems to define a class of cytotoxic agents whose apoptosis-inducing effect is predominately initiated by activation of mitochondria.Our studies on BetA-induced apoptosis provide a molecular sequence of the interplay between activation of different caspases and mitochondrial PT.

However, activated caspases can also induce PT, probably via a direct effect on the PT pore complex (3Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S. Fassy F. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J.

Induction of the CD95 ligand and up-regulation of CD95 after treatment with cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin have been observed in a variety of tumor cells, and blockade of CD95/CD95 ligand interaction by antagonistic antibodies has been found to inhibit drug-induced cell death (19Friesen C.

Lee I.S Chagwedera T.E. Farnsworth N.R. Cordell G.A. Beecher C.W. Fong H.H. Kinghorn A.D. Brown D.M. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Hieken T.J. Das Gupta T.K. Pezzuto J.M. Nat.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that BetA-induced apoptosis differs from “classical” anticancer agents such as doxorubicin (37Fulda S. Friesen C. Los M. Scaffidi C. Mier W. Benedict M. Nuñez G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). BetA-induced apoptosis is not associated with activation of ligand/receptor systems such as CD95 and does not involve p53. Perturbation of mitochondrial function including loss of mitochondrial permeability transition precedes other key features of apoptosis such as activation of the caspase cascade and nuclear fragmentation (37Fulda S. Friesen C. Los M. Scaffidi C. Mier W. Benedict M. Nuñez G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that BetA may have a direct effect on mitochondria. We therefore asked whether BetA would directly activate mitochondria and studied the sequence of the BetA-triggered apoptosis pathway. DISCUSSIONCytotoxic drugs have been reported to act primarily by inducing apoptosis in sensitive target cells (1Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Triggering of apoptosis by anticancer drugs involves simultaneous or subsequent activation of death receptor systems, perturbation of mitochondrial function, and proteolytic processing of caspases, the death effector molecules of apoptosis (25Debatin K.-M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 750-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell death pathway may be entered at multiple sites, and most drugs may hit various targets, although the precise molecular mechanisms have not been characterized in detail. Here, we report that one class of anticancer agents exemplified by BetA may act by directly targeting mitochondria, resulting in caspase activation downstream of mitochondria.Using a cell-free system, we found that BetA directly triggered PT in isolated mitochondria, and induction of PT appears to be the initial event in BetA-triggered apoptosis. Inhibition of PT by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL or by the mitochondrion-specific inhibitor BA prevented all manifestations of apoptosis in intact cells and in a cell-free system such as disruption of ΔΨm, activation of caspases, cleavage of substrates (PARP), and nuclear fragmentation. In contrast to BetA, classical cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin, cis-platinum, or etoposide did not induce mitochondrial perturbations in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial PT, which occurred in intact cells during apoptosis triggered by these substances (20Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar), was the consequence of a primary activation of other pathways or systems. BetA specifically kills neuroectodermal tumor cells (37Fulda S. Friesen C. Los M. Scaffidi C. Mier W. Benedict M. Nuñez G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). When added to intact cells, BetA specifically induced mitochondrial alterations in SHEP neuroblastoma cells, but not in lymphoid cell lines (data not shown). However, BetA-treated mitochondria isolated from the B lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4 triggered mitochondrial PT and mediated nuclear fragmentation, similar to mitochondria from SHEP cells. Thus, the specificity of BetA for neuroectodermal tumors may be explained by cell-specific uptake and/or translocation of the compound to the mitochondrial compartment rather than by differences in mitochondria themselves.In BetA-treated neuroblastoma cells, activation of different caspases and nuclear fragmentation were found only in cells with perturbed mitochondrial function, and BetA-induced loss of ΔΨm could not be inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. This suggests that caspase activation occurs downstream of mitochondria and that activation of mitochondria is sufficient to trigger all downstream events leading to apoptosis. In contrast, in doxorubicin-treated cells, loss of ΔΨm was inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk, indicating that activation of mitochondria is preceded by upstream caspase activation. 2Fulda, S., Susin, S. A., Kroemer, G., and Debatin, K.-M. (1998) Cancer Res. 58,4453–4460. Thus, BetA seems to define a class of cytotoxic agents whose apoptosis-inducing effect is predominately initiated by activation of mitochondria.Our studies on BetA-induced apoptosis provide a molecular sequence of the interplay between activation of different caspases and mitochondrial PT. Following death receptor triggering, the receptor proximal caspase-8 becomes activated, which in turn mediates full activation of the caspase cascade, cleavage of substrates, and concomitant triggering of mitochondrial PT (40Scaffidi C.

Inhibition of PT by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL or by the mitochondrion-specific inhibitor BA prevented all manifestations of apoptosis in intact cells and in a cell-free system such as disruption of ΔΨm, activation of caspases, cleavage of substrates (PARP), and nuclear fragmentation. In contrast to BetA, classical cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin, cis-platinum, or etoposide did not induce mitochondrial perturbations in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial PT, which occurred in intact cells during apoptosis triggered by these substances (20Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar), was the consequence of a primary activation of other pathways or systems. BetA specifically kills neuroectodermal tumor cells (37Fulda S. Friesen C. Los M. Scaffidi C. Mier W. Benedict M. Nuñez G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4956-4964PubMed Google Scholar). When added to intact cells, BetA specifically induced mitochondrial alterations in SHEP neuroblastoma cells, but not in lymphoid cell lines (data not shown). However, BetA-treated mitochondria isolated from the B lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4 triggered mitochondrial PT and mediated nuclear fragmentation, similar to mitochondria from SHEP cells. Thus, the specificity of BetA for neuroectodermal tumors may be explained by cell-specific uptake and/or translocation of the compound to the mitochondrial compartment rather than by differences in mitochondria themselves. In BetA-treated neuroblastoma cells, activation of different caspases and nuclear fragmentation were found only in cells with perturbed mitochondrial function, and BetA-induced loss of ΔΨm could not be inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. This suggests that caspase activation occurs downstream of mitochondria and that activation of mitochondria is sufficient to trigger all downstream events leading to apoptosis. In contrast, in doxorubicin-treated cells, loss of ΔΨm was inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk, indicating that activation of mitochondria is preceded by upstream caspase activation. 2Fulda, S., Susin, S. A., Kroemer, G., and Debatin, K.-M. (1998) Cancer Res. 58,4453–4460. Thus, BetA seems to define a class of cytotoxic agents whose apoptosis-inducing effect is predominately initiated by activation of mitochondria. Our studies on BetA-induced apoptosis provide a molecular sequence of the interplay between activation of different caspases and mitochondrial PT. Following death receptor triggering, the receptor proximal caspase-8 becomes activated, which in turn mediates full activation of the caspase cascade, cleavage of substrates, and concomitant triggering of mitochondrial PT (40Scaffidi C.

Therefore, upon CD95 triggering, activation of caspase-8 occurs even in cells in which mitochondrial PT and processing of downstream caspases are blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (2Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In contrast, in BetA-treated cells, activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 was secondary to mitochondrial PT. Apoptogenic proteins such as cytochromec and AIF released from mitochondria upon permeability transition have been shown to directly induce cleavage of caspases (2Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar,3Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S. Fassy F. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). BetA-triggered mitochondrial PT and apoptosis involved cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 independent of CD95 ligand/receptor interaction. Thus, in BetA-treated cells, caspase-8 became activated by mitochondria undergoing PT in the absence of CD95 death-inducing signaling complex formation. AIF released from mitochondria may mediate caspase-8 cleavage following BetA treatment since partially purified AIF could cleave recombinant caspase-8. In contrast, cytochromec did not induce activation of caspase-8, although it induced caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that the mechanism of caspase-8 activation downstream of mitochondria differed from that of caspase-3. Caspases might appear to be dispensable for mediating DNA fragmentation since partially purified AIF has been described to induce DNA fragmentation and since we found fragmentation of nuclei upon incubation with isolated mitochondria. However, these preparations may still contain small amounts of cytosolic fractions that may mediate activation of downstream targets such as PARP, DNA fragmentation factor, or caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (44Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 45Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1997; 391: 43-50Crossref Scopus (2796) Google Scholar). Different classes of anticancer drugs may enter the apoptotic pathway at distinct entry sites before they eventually induce a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-controlled ΔΨm disruption that marks the initiation of a common effector phase of apoptosis. Our findings may have implications for tumor therapy directed toward activation of apoptosis effector systems. Direct activation of mitochondrial PT, as exemplified by cytotoxic drugs such as BetA, may be sufficient for induction of apoptosis in cancer cells and may bypass the requirement for upstream signaling. Those drugs could still be effective against tumor cells that have a defect in upstream apoptosis pathways. In this context, it appears intriguing that tumors cells with a defect in the CD95 system (24Friesen C. Fulda S. Debatin K.-M. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 1: 1833-1841Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which fail to respond to classical chemotherapeutic agents, are fully susceptible to BetA-induced cell death (37Fulda S.

Thus, our findings may be important to define and develop a new class of cytotoxic agents with direct mitochondrial effects that could overcome some forms of tumor-associated mechanisms of chemoresistance.

RANK1and RANK ligand (RANKL) are a recently described cognate pair of the TNF receptor/ligand superfamilies (1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. Dubose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). The receptor (RANK) cDNA was originally isolated from a human DC cDNA library and shows the highest homology (40% identity within the extracellular domain) with CD40 among TNFR family members. Among antigen-presenting cells, RANK surface expression appears to be specific to DC and can be significantly up-regulated by a DC activator, CD40 ligand. However, RANK protein expression is not DC-specific as RANK is also expressed on human peripheral blood T cells treated with phytohemagglutinin and IL-4 or transforming growth factor-β (1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. Dubose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). In contrast to the relatively specific protein expression, RANK mRNA is broadly expressed in a variety of tissues including skeletal muscle, thymus, liver, colon, adrenal gland, and small intestine. The discrepancy between mRNA and surface protein expression suggests complex post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for RANK expression. Cells may therefore express RANK after discrete activation or differentiation conditions. The identification of the cognate ligand for RANK (RANKL) was performed by direct expression cloning from a mouse CD4+ thymoma cell line (1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C.

Although the role of RANK in bone resorption/osteoclast differentiation has not been elucidated, RANK and its ligand appear to be important in the regulation of T cell/DC interactions and may also function in other important cellular differentiation processes. Although the physiological functions of RANK and RANKL have been investigated, the mechanisms of RANK signal transduction have not been intensively studied. Multimerization of TNFR family members (as a result of ligand binding or receptor overexpression) is thought to lead to receptor activation and signal transduction, perhaps by revealing binding domains for enzymes or adaptor proteins. In recent years, substantial progress has been made to define the cytoplasmic proteins that function as adaptors (TRAFs 1–6, TRADD, FADD) or as serine/threonine kinases (RIP) and link TNF receptor stimulation with the induction of cell death, Jun kinase (JNK) or NF-κB activation pathways (reviewed in Ref. 6Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte. Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). RANK stimulation leads to activation of the nuclear transcription complex NF-κB in RANK-expressing human T cells and transfected 293 cells (1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C.

However, the RANK cytoplasmic determinants or the cytoplasmic effector/adaptor proteins necessary for downstream signaling have not been described. While the 383-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of RANK is the largest of any known TNFR, it does not contain sequences suggestive of catalytic activity or significant homology with any known protein. The amino acid sequences of the human and mouse RANK cytoplasmic domains include multiple sections that show striking homology (64% amino acid identity and 78% similarity) between species (1Anderson D.M.

In this study we have identified the structural and functional features of RANK required for both NF-κB and JNK-mediated signaling. Our analysis delineates multiple distinct and independent domains capable of binding TRAF proteins and transmitting downstream signals. In addition, TRAF6 appears to mediate RANK function through unique determinants independent of other TRAF proteins and plays a selective role in RANKL-induced signaling. Deletion constructs of RANK were generated by PCR amplification, and point mutants were generated by PCR using primers containing the appropriate nucleotide substitutions. The appropriate inserts were subcloned into the pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector at the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The correct sequence of each of the PCR-generated inserts was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A GST-human FAS cytoplasmic domain construct was used as a specificity control. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by glutathione-agarose affinity media according to published procedures (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Fusion protein concentrations of 0.5–2.5 mg/ml were typically obtained. Full-length TRAF cDNAs were subcloned into the pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pGEM-T (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) vectors. RNA was generated in vitro with either T7 or T3 polymerase using the Ambion (Austin, TX) mMessage Machine according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (1 μg) was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine using 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems, Promega). The integrity of the protein product was determined by SDS-PAGE, and relative protein amounts were normalized after image analysis using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) Storm 860 optical scanner. Proteins were diluted into binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA) and precleared by overnight incubation with 100 μg of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For each in vitro binding assay, translated protein was combined with 5 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein complexed to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed four times in binding buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal loading of GST fusion proteins, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and subjected to fluorography for 6–24 h. A NF-κB-responsive reporter plasmid was constructed in pGL2-Basic (Promega) with the human IL-8 promoter containing a NF-κB binding site (15Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Parnet P. Sonoda G. Testa J.R.

Total DNA concentrations for each transfection were equalized by the addition of empty pDC304 vector. Transfections were performed in triplicate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with recombinant human RANKL for 16 h at 37 °C. Recombinant human RANKL is an NH2-terminal fusion of a leucine zipper trimerization domain (20Fanslow W.C. Srinivasan S. Paxton R. Gibson M.G. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Semin.

Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega) using a EG&G/Berthold luminometer. Relative luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity.

Oligonucleotides containing an NF-κB binding site were annealed, radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and combined with 10 μg of nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature. Specificity of the reaction was confirmed by competition with 50-fold molar excess of non-labeled wild-type oligonucleotides or oligonucleotides containing a mutated NF-κB binding site. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 6% PAGE in 0.25× TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. For JNK assays, whole cell extracts were prepared from 293 cells 24 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg each of anti-JNK (FL) and anti-JNK (C17) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA). The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, two times with wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and three times in assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). JNK activity was determined by an immune-complex assay using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–169) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and 5 μCi of [32P]ATP as substrate in 40 μl of assay buffer at 30 °C for 20 min. Reaction products were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In order to define whether TRAFs may bind to RANK, each of the known TRAFs was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine and coprecipitation assays were performed to determine the interaction with a GST fusion expressing the full-length RANK cytoplasmic domain. This domain (RANK amino acids 206–616) was able to interact with TRAFs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 in a specific manner (Fig.1). We observed strong binding of RANK with TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 6; weak interaction with TRAF5; and no binding with TRAF4. In contrast, none of the TRAFs interacted with a control GST protein (Fig. 1) or a GST-FAS cytoplasmic domain fusion protein (data not shown). To confirm that the in vitro interaction of TRAFs with RANK also occurred in cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in 293 cells cotransfected with RANK and epitope-tagged TRAFs and revealed that full-length RANK associated with the same repertoire of TRAFs (TRAFs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) but not TRAF4 (data not shown). To identify the binding sites in the RANK cytoplasmic domain, four individual COOH-terminal deletions were constructed and the in vitro binding assays were repeated. In contrast to the full-length RANK cytoplasmic domain, a deletion construct that lacks the COOH-terminal 72 amino acids (RANK Δ544) was unable to interact with TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5 (Fig. 1), and TRAF6 binding was reduced by approximately 50%. The deletion of an additional 68 amino acids (RANK Δ476) or 123 amino acids (RANK Δ421) showed no difference in TRAF6 binding activity relative to RANK 206–544. However, when the COOH-terminal 277 amino acids were deleted (RANK Δ339), the remaining interaction with TRAF6 was lost. These data demonstrate that two separate regions of the RANK cytoplasmic domain are each capable of binding TRAF proteins. Examination of the protein sequence within the COOH-terminal 72-amino acid RANK domain capable of TRAF binding revealed multiple regions with limited homology with experimentally defined TRAF binding sites (TBS) in other TNFR family members. We defined two potential RANK TBS in this region (residues 569–574 (P-V-Q-E-E-T) and residues 607–611 (P-V-Q-E-Q)) due to their similarity to the P-X-Q-X-T TBS found in CD40 and CD30 (22Boucher L.-M. Marengère L.E. Lu Y. Thukral S. Mak T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as well as the HVEM TBS (V-E-E-T) (9Hsu H. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Elliott R. Kelley M. Boyle W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13471-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the OX40 TBS (P-I-Q-E-E) (12Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if these residues in RANK were important for TRAF binding, we substituted certain amino acids within these putative TBS with alanine and assayed TRAF binding. Mutagenesis of amino acids 609–610 (Q-E) to alanine within the full-length RANK cytoplasmic domain significantly abolished TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF5 binding (Fig.2), similar to that seen with the GST-RANK Δ544 deletion. Binding of TRAF3 and TRAF6 were unaffected. Substitution of residues 571–573 (Q-E-E) with alanine resulted in a loss of TRAF3 binding without reducing the binding of any other TRAF. These results identify two separate regions critical for binding TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5. By combining mutations of these two sites (571–573 and 609–610), loss of TRAFs 1, 2, and 3 binding was more pronounced (Fig.2), suggesting that these two sites cooperate in binding. None of the mutations examined, either alone or in combination, reduced TRAF6 binding, indicating that TRAF6 recognizes distinct TBS in RANK. We have previously reported that activation of RANK either by receptor overexpression or by RANKL treatment leads to the activation of NF-κB complexes (1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. Dubose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). In order to study the role of RANK cytoplasmic sequences and other cellular protein effectors in RANK signaling, we established a transient transfection/NF-κB-responsive reporter system. We first examined reporter activity resulting from increased RANK expression in the 293 cells. NF-κB-dependent reporter activity increased in a RANK dose-dependent manner until optimal (30-fold) induction was achieved with 6.4 ng of RANK DNA transfected (Fig. 3 A). These data illustrate that ectopic overexpression of RANK can lead to ligand-independent NF-κB signaling, similar to that seen with other TNFR family members, p80 TNFR and CD40 (7Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 23Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). RANKL-dependent signaling was next examined by the transfection/reporter system using a suboptimal RANK DNA concentration (0.4 ng/transfection). Co-transfection of RANK and the transmembrane form of RANKL stimulated the NF-κB-reporter more than that seen after transfection with RANK only (Fig. 3 B). We also demonstrated that soluble RANKL protein enhanced reporter activity (Fig.3 B). Similar effects of RANK overexpression or RANKL treatment were also seen with a minimal NF-κB promoter (data not shown), confirming that these responses are due to NF-κB activation. The interaction of TRAFs with multiple RANK cytoplasmic domains and the ability of some TRAFs to mediate NF-κB activation (7Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 24Song H.Y. Régnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) suggests that the deletion of TBS may abrogate NF-κB-dependent signaling. To address this possibility, COOH-terminal cytoplasmic deletions of RANK were expressed in 293 cells and reporter activity was measured. Equivalent expression levels of each RANK construct were confirmed by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins and by flow cytometry (data not shown). Transfection of 293 cells with the RANK deletion construct lacking the COOH-terminal 72 amino acids (RANK Δ544) resulted in reduced NF-κB reporter activity in the absence of RANKL activation (Fig.4 A). However, RANKL treatment of RANK Δ544-expressing cells induced NF-κB activation to levels similar to that seen with full-length RANK. Further deletion of COOH-terminal sequences had minimal effects on the constitutive and RANKL-mediated reporter activity until the removal of amino acids 339–422 (construct RANK Δ339), which completely abrogated both constitutive signaling and responsiveness to RANKL. The deletion of RANK cytoplasmic determinants had similar effects on NF-κB activation as determined by direct EMSA assays (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these data suggest that RANK contains two domains (amino acids 339–422 and 544–616) within its cytoplasmic tail important for NF-κB signaling. These two RANK functional regions correspond with the two domains that affect binding of TRAFs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 (amino acids 544–616) and TRAF6 (amino acids 339–422). Moreover, the deletional analysis of RANK domains important for NF-κB signaling expose differences between RANK signal transduction as a result of receptor overexpression and RANKL treatment. Constitutive signaling resulting from RANK overexpression was significantly affected by the loss of the COOH-terminal 72 amino acids (RANK Δ544). However, RANKL-mediated signaling was only affected by the deletion of amino acids 339–422 correlating to the loss of direct TRAF6 binding in vitro. In the absence of receptor expression, TRAFs 2, 5, and 6 activated NF-κB (data not shown) as has been reported previously (7Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 24Song H.Y. Régnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To examine the functional involvement of these TRAFs in RANK-mediated NF-κB activation, 293 cells were co-transfected with RANK and expression vectors encoding NH2-terminal truncations of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, each of which has been demonstrated to suppress NF-κB signaling in a dominant negative manner (7Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 18Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol.

Co-expression of the zinc ring-deleted forms of TRAFs 2, 5, or 6 each inhibited the RANKL-inducible reporter activity in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig.5). However, only NH2-truncated TRAF2 and TRAF5 suppressed constitutive signaling from the full-length RANK. The NH2-truncated TRAF6 selectively inhibited RANKL-induced signaling, but not constitutive signaling, revealing a specific role for TRAF6 in RANKL-induced signaling.

However, instead of recognizing critical prolines on the basis of side chain shape or rigidity, these domains broadly accepted amide N-substituted residues. Proline is apparently specifically selected in vivo, despite low complementarity, because it is the only endogenous N-substituted amino acid. This discriminatory mechanism explains how these domains achieve specific but low-affinity recognition, a property that is necessary for transient signaling interactions. The mechanism can be exploited: screening a series of ligands in which key prolines were replaced by nonnatural N-substituted residues yielded a ligand that selectively bound the Grb2 SH3 domain with 100 times greater affinity."

Addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone or detergent to the reconstituted reductase-phospholipid vesicles abolished O⨪2production, suggesting that O⨪2 generation is caused by the membrane potential generated during electron transfer through the cytochrome bc 1 complex. Production of O⨪2 was also observed during electron transfer from succinate to cytochrome c by antimycin-treated reductase, in which ∼99.7% of the reductase activity was inhibited. The rate of O⨪2 production was closely related to the rate of antimycin-insensitive cytochrome c reduction. Factors affecting antimycin-insensitive reduction of cytochrome calso affected O⨪2 production and vice versa. When the oxygen concentration in the system was decreased, the rate of O⨪2production and cytochrome c reduction by antimycin-treated reductase decreased. When the concentrations of MCLA and cytochromec were increased, the rate of O⨪2 production and cytochrome c reduction by antimycin-treated reductase increased. The rate of antimycin-insensitive cytochrome creduction was sensitive to Qo site inhibitors such as 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole. These results indicate that generation of O⨪2 during the oxidation of ubiquinol by the cytochrome bc 1 complex results from a leakage of the second electron of ubiquinol from its Q cycle electron transfer pathway to interact with oxygen. The electron-leaking site is located at the reduced cytochrome b 566 or ubisemiquinone of the Qo site because addition of MCLA to antimycin-treated cytochrome bc 1 complex, in the presence of catalytic amounts of succinate-cytochrome creductase, delayed cytochrome b reduction by succinate. In the presence of oxidized cytochrome c, purified succinate dehydrogenase also catalyzed oxidation of succinate to generate O⨪2. When succinate dehydrogenase was reconstituted with thebc 1 particles to form succinate-cytochrome c reductase, the production of O⨪2 diminished.

During mitochondrial respiration, there is a continuous release of electrons from their normal pathway to molecular oxygen (O2) to form superoxide anion (O⨪2) (1Loschen G. Azzi A. Flohe L. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2Loschen G. Azzi A. Richter C. Flohe L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 3Nohl H. Hegner D. Biochem. J. 1978; 134: 707-714Google Scholar). O⨪2 subsequently dismutates to H2O2spontaneously or by the action of superoxide dismutases (4McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria in state 4 generate 0.6–1.0 nmol of H2O2/min/mg of protein, accounting for ∼2% of O2 uptake under physiological conditions (5Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Production of O⨪2 during mitochondrial respiration is closely related to mitochondrial coupling efficiency. Reactions in two segments of the respiratory chain are responsible for univalent reduction of dioxygen to O⨪2. The one located in NADH-Q1 reductase is cyanide-insensitive. Production of O⨪2 is probably via autoxidation of the reduced flavin mononucleotide of NADH dehydrogenase (6Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 7Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The other is located in the cytochromebc 1 complex (ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase). Two redox components of the cytochromebc 1 complex, ubisemiquinone (8Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and reduced cytochrome b 566 (9Nohl H. Jordan W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), have been suggested as the autoxidizable factors causing O⨪2 production. To date, most information concerning mitochondrial O⨪2generation has been obtained from studies with intact heart mitochondria and electron transfer inhibitors. Production of O⨪2 in intact mitochondria is difficult to measure because O⨪2 has a very short half-life (2Loschen G. Azzi A. Richter C. Flohe L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and cannot pass outward through the inner membrane. However, since heart mitochondria contain superoxide dismutase, but no catalase, and H2O2is a relatively stable species that readily penetrates the mitochondrial membrane, production of O⨪2 in intact heart mitochondria is generally determined by measuring H2O2 concentration in the suspending medium (6Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Studies of O⨪2 formation by purified electron transfer complexes should yield less ambiguous results, especially when production of O⨪2 is directly measured by chemiluminescence of the MCLA-O⨪2 adduct (10Nakano M.

Succinate-Q reductase catalyzes electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone, whereas the cytochromebc 1 complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. The cytochromebc 1 complex, which contains four redox centers (cytochromes b 566, b 562, and c 1 and the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster), has recently been crystallized (12Yu C.-A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M.

Four redox components of the succinate-cytochrome c reductase segment of the respiratory chain (reduced FAD, ubiquinol, ubisemiquinone, and reduced cytochrome b 566) have been suggested as the electron donors for O2. Reduced FAD is in succinate dehydrogenase; ubiquinol is produced by succinate-Q reductase; and ubisemiquinone and reduced cytochrome b 566 are generated during the catalytic cycle of the cytochromebc 1 complex. Herein we report the production of O⨪2 during electron transfer through succinate-cytochromec reductase, succinate-Q reductase, and succinate dehydrogenase under various conditions.

Spectral measurements were carried out with a Shimadzu UV-2101PC spectrophotometer at room temperature. O⨪2 generation was determined by measuring the chemiluminescence of MCLA-O⨪2 (10Nakano M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 μm MCLA, 7 mm sodium succinate, and 10 μm cytochrome c was treated with an appropriate amount of enzyme solution to start the reaction. Luminescence was measured with a Lumac/3M Biocounter (Model 2010A). O⨪2 generation is expressed in XO units. One XO unit is defined as the chemiluminescence generated by 1 unit of xanthine oxidase in 1 min, which equals 4.3 × 109 counts from a Lumac/3M Biocounter (Model M2010) in 1 ml of assay mixture containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 43 μm hypoxanthine, 4 μm MCLA, and 0.2 m sucrose. One unit of xanthine oxidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of xanthine to uric acid/min at pH 7.5 at 25 °C. For measurement of the rate of oxygen-dependent antimycin-insensitive cytochrome c reduction, 1 ml of assay mixture containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 7 mm succinate, 0.6 μmantimycin, 50 μm cytochrome c, and 12 μm MCLA was placed in the main chamber, and a 10-μl aliquot of succinate-cytochrome c reductase (1.6 mg/ml) was in the side arm. The complete anaerobic conditions were achieved by repeated evacuating and flushing with argon. The reaction was started by tipping the succinate-cytochrome c reductase solution in the side arm into the main chamber. The assay mixtures containing different O2 concentrations were made by injecting various amounts of air-saturated assay mixture (assuming 250 μmO2 concentration) through a rubber plug into the anaerobic assay mixture in the main chamber before starting the reaction. For measurement of oxygen-dependent O⨪2 production, the assay mixtures containing varying concentrations of O2 were prepared as described for cytochrome c reduction assays. The concentrations of cytochrome c and MCLA used were 10 and 4 μm, respectively. 5-μl aliquots of succinate-cytochromec reductase (1.6 mg/ml) were used. Purified succinate-cytochromec reductase complex, as prepared, was in the detergent-dispersed state. It catalyzed electron transfer from succinate to cytochrome c with a specific activity of 4 μmol of succinate oxidized per min/mg of protein. No O⨪2 was produced during electron transfer through this complex (TableI).Table IProduction of O⨪2 by purified succinate-cytochrome c reductase under various conditionsAdditionsO⨪2 productionaXO units are defined under “Experimental Procedures.”XO units/mg proteinSCRbSCR, succinate-cytochrome c reductase; SDH, purified succinate dehydrogenase; KDOC, potassium deoxycholate; TTFA, thenoyltrifluoroacetone.0((SCR-PL vesicle) + SDH)c((SCR-PL vesicle) + SDH) indicates that purified, reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase was added to the succinate-cytochrome c reductase-PL vesicle at a 3:1 molar ratio (succinate dehydrogenase/succinate-cytochrome creductase).2.45((SCR-PL vesicle) + SDH) + FCCP1.34((SCR-PL vesicle) + SDH) + KDOC1.31SCR + PL + SDH + KDOC0.81SCR + TTFA0.07SCR + antimycin0.71a XO units are defined under “Experimental Procedures.”b SCR, succinate-cytochrome c reductase; SDH, purified succinate dehydrogenase; KDOC, potassium deoxycholate; TTFA, thenoyltrifluoroacetone.c ((SCR-PL vesicle) + SDH) indicates that purified, reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase was added to the succinate-cytochrome c reductase-PL vesicle at a 3:1 molar ratio (succinate dehydrogenase/succinate-cytochrome creductase). Open table in a new tab When purified succinate-cytochrome c reductase complex was incorporated into phospholipid (PL) vesicles by the cholate dialysis method (21Miki T. Miki M. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1827-1833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Beattie D.S. Villalobo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14745-14752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the resulting protein-PL vesicles showed little succinate-cytochrome c, succinate-Q, and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities. Whereas addition of the protonophore FCCP to the reductase-PL vesicles enhanced succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity only slightly, it increased ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity by 7-fold. This indicates that the succinate-Q reductase region, but not the cytochrome bc 1 complex, is inactivated in the reductase-PL vesicles. The inactivated component was identified as succinate dehydrogenase because addition of purified, reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase to the FCCP-treated reductase-PL vesicles increased antimycin-sensitive succinate-cytochromec reductase activity to about the same level as that of the starting reductase. Inactivation of succinate dehydrogenase is due to the labile nature of this enzyme in soluble form under aerobic conditions (16Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase was detached from the QPs-cytochrome bc 1 complex upon addition of a mixture of 2% sodium cholate/asolectin during the first step of reductase-PL vesicle preparation. The high detergent concentration, used to ensure complete dispersion of phospholipid during the preparation of reductase-PL vesicles, apparently caused solubilization of succinate dehydrogenase from its anchoring proteins (QPs). Soluble succinate dehydrogenase was inactivated before it could be re-associated with QPs, in the phospholipid bilayer, during the subsequent dialysis step. Oxidation of succinate by succinate-cytochrome creductase-PL vesicles, replenished with a 3-fold molar excess of succinate dehydrogenase, produced 2.45 XO units of O⨪2/mg of protein. Addition of FCCP or detergent to the succinate dehydrogenase-replenished reductase-PL vesicles decreased the rate of O⨪2 production by 50%, suggesting that the membrane potential generated during electron transfer through the cytochromebc 1 complex region induces electron leakage, from the normal pathway to react with O2 to form O⨪2. The remaining O⨪2 production observed with FCCP-treated reductase-PL vesicles was due to the excess succinate dehydrogenase in the reconstituting system and not to incomplete disruption of protein vesicles by FCCP or detergent. Production of O⨪2 by soluble succinate dehydrogenase is discussed below. It has been reported that the production of H2O2 in rat or pigeon heart mitochondria supplemented with antimycin was stimulated up to 13-fold by addition of protonophores (20Cadenas E. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The difference in the protonophore sensitivity between the succinate-cytochrome c reductase-phospholipid vesicle system and the mitochondrial system can be explained by the presence of antimycin and endogenous cytochrome c in the latter. In the mitochondrial system, the presence of protonophores causes the disruption of membrane potential, thus stimulating the oxidation of endogenous cytochrome c by cytochromec oxidase to generate the oxidized cytochromec needed for the generation of O⨪2 from reduced Q. In the case of reconstituted succinate-cytochrome creductase vesicles, disruption of membrane potential by addition of protonophores will simply stimulate the activity of succinate-cytochrome c reductase to reduce cytochromec. The most unambiguous way to confirm membrane potential-induced O⨪2 production by the cytochromebc 1 complex region is to detect O⨪2production by protein-PL vesicles formed from purified cytochromebc 1 complex and phospholipid. When purified cytochrome bc 1 complex was embedded in phospholipid vesicles, the resulting cytochromebc 1-PL vesicles showed an oxidation control ratio of 11 with an H+/e− ratio of 2. However, detection of O⨪2 production by these vesicles was difficult because the rate of non-enzymatic production of O⨪2 from ubiquinol (substrate) by cytochrome c (acceptor) was high compared with that of the enzymatic production. The finding that during oxidation of succinate by antimycin A inhibited succinate-cytochromec reductase O⨪2 is produced (Table I) provides us a model system to study generation of O⨪2 in the cytochromebc 1 complex region of the respiratory chain. When detergent-dispersed succinate-cytochrome c reductase was treated with antimycin, 99.7% of its activity was inhibited, and 0.71 XO units of O⨪2 were produced per mg of protein. Antimycin is known to block transfer of the second electron of ubiquinol from cytochrome b 562 to ubiquinone to form ubisemiquinone at the Qi site, according to the Q cycle mechanism (Fig. 1). Therefore, the reduction of cytochrome c observed with antimycin-inhibited reductase must result from the first electron of ubiquinol being transferred to cytochrome c via the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c 1. The second electron of ubiquinol in antimycin-treated reductase probably leaks out of its normal electron transfer pathway at reduced cytochromeb 566 or ubisemiquinone at the Oosite and reacts with O2 to produce O⨪2. If this is the case, one would expect the rate of O⨪2 production to be closely related to the rate of electron transfer to cytochromec in the antimycin-treated reductase. In other words, factors affecting the rate of O⨪2 production should also affect the rate of antimycin-insensitive cytochrome c reduction and vice versa. Since O2 is the reactant for O⨪2formation and MCLA reacts with O⨪2 to produce the chemiluminescence compound MCLA-O⨪2, their involvement in O⨪2 production is expected. Cytochrome c, on the other hand, is the electron acceptor for the first electron of ubiquinol via the iron-sulfur protein and cytochromec 1. The relationship between O⨪2production and cytochrome c reduction by antimycin-treated reductase can be studied by examining the effect of MCLA, O2, and cytochrome c on the rate of O⨪2production. It should be noted that in the antimycin-treated reductase, MCLA not only facilitated the detection of O⨪2, but also had a great effect on stimulation of O⨪2 production. A similar stimulating effect on O⨪2 production was not observed in the soluble xanthine oxidase system. Addition of MCLA has no effect on cytochrome c reduction by O⨪2 generated by xanthine oxidase in the presence of catalase (4McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the effect of MCLA concentration on the rate of O⨪2 production and cytochrome creduction by antimycin-treated succinate-cytochrome creductase. When succinate was added to antimycin-inhibited reductase in the presence of varying concentrations of MCLA, the rate of O⨪2generation increased as the MCLA concentration increased. Maximum production of O⨪2 was observed when the MCLA concentration reached 2 μm; higher MCLA concentrations caused an apparent decrease in O⨪2 production. This apparent decrease is due to quenching of the chemiluminescence of MCLA-O⨪2 by higher concentrations of MCLA (yellow color) and not to a decrease in the rate of O⨪2 production. Since cytochrome c acts both as the first electron acceptor and the scavenger of superoxide, the reduction of cytochromec should be twice as much as the MCLA-O⨪2 adduct formation if the measured chemiluminescence could stoichiometrically represent the later. This relation was only observed when a low concentration of MCLA was used (Fig. 2). The quenching of the chemiluminescence of MCLA-O⨪2 by high concentrations of MCLA was also observed with O⨪2 generated by the xanthine oxidase system (Fig. 3). The amount of chemiluminescence generated by a given amount of xanthine oxidase increased as the MCLA concentration increased, reached a maximum (at 1.2 μm), and then decreased. This result confirms that higher concentrations of MCLA cause quenching of chemiluminescence. It should be noted that MCLA at the concentrations used had neither an inhibitory nor an activating effect on xanthine oxidase when the activity was followed by product formation spectrophotometrically or cytochrome c reduction in the presence of catalase (4McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cytochrome c reduction by antimycin-inhibited succinate-cytochrome c reductase was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of MCLA, using succinate as substrate, the rate of reduction increased when the MCLA concentration was increased, reaching a maximum at an MCLA concentration of 15 μm. This increase can be explained by assuming that MCLA serves as an electron sink for O⨪2 by forming MCLA-O⨪2. It pulls the second electron of ubiquinol from reduced cytochromeb 566 or ubisemiquinone at the Qosite, thus increasing the rate of O⨪2 production and facilitating transfer of the first electron of ubiquinol to cytochromec via the iron-sulfur protein and cytochromec 1. This explanation is supported by the observation that MCLA-induced antimycin-insensitive cytochromec reduction was sensitive to Qo site inhibitors such as 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole (Fig.4).Figure 3Effect of MCLA concentration on the rate of O⨪2 production by xanthine oxidase.

The experimental conditions were the same as those described for Fig. 2, except that the indicated concentrations of 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole (UHDBT) were used. 100% O⨪2 generation is 30 XO units/mg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since O⨪2 is converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase, it was of interest to see whether or not the rate of O⨪2 generation and cytochrome c reduction by antimycin-treated reductase is affected by addition of superoxide dismutase. To our surprise, addition of superoxide dismutase did not enhance the antimycin-insensitive cytochrome c reduction activity. Apparently, the O⨪2 generation site is not accessible to superoxide dismutase since the rate of dismutation of O⨪2was not affected by its addition. This indicates that the O⨪2generation site is in a hydrophobic environment easily accessible to MCLA, but not to superoxide dismutase. On the other hand, addition of superoxide dismutase to the antimycin A- and MCLA-treated reductase greatly reduced the chemiluminescence of the system, suggesting that superoxide dismutase is able to catalyze dismutation of O⨪2 in the form of MCLA-O⨪2. Addition of superoxide dismutase to the xanthine oxidase system did not stimulate the oxidation of hypoxanthine, but decreased the chemiluminescence of MCLA-O⨪2, as expected, indicating that MCLA-O⨪2 can serve as a substrate for superoxide dismutase. Fig. 5 shows the effect of O2concentration on the rate of O⨪2 production and antimycin-insensitive cytochrome c reduction by antimycin-treated succinate-cytochrome c reductase. When the O2 concentration was decreased, the rate of O⨪2production and cytochrome c reduction decreased. When O2 was completely depleted, neither O⨪2 production nor antimycin-insensitive cytochrome c reduction was observed. This again demonstrates that cytochrome creduction correlates with O⨪2 production by antimycin-treated succinate-cytochrome c reductase. Fig. 6 shows the effect of cytochromec concentration on O⨪2 production and cytochromec reduction by antimycin-treated succinate-cytochromec reductase. When varying amounts of cytochrome cwere added to antimycin-treated succinate-cytochrome creductase in the presence of 4 μm MCLA, O⨪2production increased as the concentration of cytochrome cincreased, up to 2 μm. When the cytochrome cconcentration was higher than 2 μm, O⨪2production decreased. This decrease results from the quenching of the chemiluminescence of MCLA-O⨪2 by cytochrome c. On the other hand, the rate of cytochrome c reduction catalyzed by antimycin-inhibited reductase increased as the concentration of cytochrome c increased. The apparent K mfor cytochrome c for antimycin-treated succinate-cytochromec reductase in the presence of MCLA was calculated to be 40 μm, similar to that obtained for the uninhibited reductase, indicating that binding of cytochrome c to cytochrome c 1 is not affected by antimycin or MCLA. Although cytochrome c is an O⨪2 scavenger (10Nakano M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it is less effective than MCLA in scavenging O⨪2 produced in hydrophobic environments or in a protein-bound form. By limiting the rate of electron input to the cytochrome bc 1 complex, either by partial inhibition of succinate-Q reductase activity in succinate-cytochromec reductase preparations by malonate or by the addition of limiting amounts of succinate-cytochrome c reductase to purified cytochrome bc 1 complex, the sequence of reduction of cytochromes b and c 1 can be determined by conventional spectrophotometric methods. When succinate was added to purified cytochrome bc 1complex in the presence of catalytic amounts of purified succinate-cytochrome c reductase, the reduction of cytochrome b occurred at about the same time as the reduction of cytochrome c 1. When the cytochromebc 1 complex was treated with antimycin, the reduction of cytochrome b occurred before the reduction of cytochrome c 1. Addition of MCLA to the antimycin-inhibited cytochrome bc 1 complex resulted in cytochrome c 1 being reduced before cytochrome b. This delayed reduction of cytochromeb further supports the hypothesis that the second electron of ubiquinol leaks out to react with oxygen to form O⨪2, trapped as the MCLA-O⨪2 adduct, before it reduces cytochrome b . The observation that ubiquinol reduces O2to O⨪2 in the presence of cytochrome c encouraged us to investigate the production of O⨪2 by succinate-Q reductase. Purified succinate-Q reductase, in the presence and absence of cytochrome c, produced 0.18 and 0.05 XO units of O⨪2/mg of protein, respectively (TableII). Succinate-Q reductase supplemented with Q2 in the presence and absence of cytochromec produced 9.88 and 0.05 XO units of O⨪2/mg of protein, respectively. Production of O⨪2 by succinate-Q reductase in the presence of cytochrome c and Q2was diminished upon addition of its electron acceptor, the cytochromebc 1 complex. This is in line with the observation that electron transfer through soluble succinate-cytochromec reductase does not generate O⨪2. Apparently, active succinate-cytochrome c reductase is formed from succinate-Q reductase by addition of the cytochromebc 1 complex. These results indicate that electron transfer through succinate-Q reductase in the absence of the cytochrome bc 1 complex produces O⨪2through the non-enzymatic oxidation of ubiquinol in the presence of cytochrome c. The production of O⨪2 through oxidation of ubiquinol by cytochrome c may proceed by a sequence in which ubiquinol gives its high potential electron to cytochrome c to generate a low potential semiquinone that reduces O2 to O⨪2. This suggestion is supported by the fact that no O⨪2 is formed from ubiquinol in the presence of reduced cytochrome c.Table IIProduction of O⨪2 by succinate-Q reductase under various conditionsAdditionsO⨪2 productionXO units/mg of SQRaSQR0.05SQR + cyt.c 3+ aSQR, succinate-Q reductase; cyt. c, cytochrome c; QCR, ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase., bThe concentration of cytochrome c and K3Fe(CN)6 used was 10 μm.0.18SQR + K3Fe(CN)6 bThe concentration of cytochrome c and K3Fe(CN)6 used was 10 μm.0.97SQR + QcThe concentration of ubiquinone used was 0.27 μm.0.05SQR + Q + cyt. c 3+9.88SQR + Q + cyt. c 3+ + QCR1.25SQR + cyt.c 3+ + QCR0.01SQR + cyt.c 2+0a SQR, succinate-Q reductase; cyt. c, cytochrome c; QCR, ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase.b The concentration of cytochrome c and K3Fe(CN)6 used was 10 μm.c The concentration of ubiquinone used was 0.27 μm. Open table in a new tab Since O⨪2 production was observed during succinate oxidation by the reconstituted succinate-cytochromec reductase system in the presence of excess succinate dehydrogenase (Table I), O⨪2 production by succinate dehydrogenase under various conditions was investigated. The rate of O⨪2 production by soluble succinate dehydrogenase increased from 0.07 to 0.49 XO units/mg of protein upon addition of oxidized cytochrome c (Table III). Addition of the bc 1 particles (QPs + the cytochrome bc 1 complex), but not the cytochromebc 1 complex, drastically decreased the rate of O⨪2 production by reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase in the presence of cytochrome c. The difference between the bc 1 particles and the cytochrome bc 1 complex is that the former contains QPs, which mediate electron transfer between Q and succinate dehydrogenase. Thus, addition of the bc 1particles to reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase reconstitutes succinate-cytochrome c reductase. Although the rate of O⨪2 production by reconstitutively inactive succinate dehydrogenate was the same as that of the reconstitutively active enzyme, addition of the bc 1 particles to the reconstitutively inactive succinate dehydrogenase did not decrease O⨪2 production. These results indicate that reduced flavin in succinate dehydrogenase, in the absence of an immediate electron transfer partner, gives a high potential electron to cytochromec through iron-sulfur clusters to generate a low potential flavin semiquinone radical, which in turn reduces O2 to form O⨪2. Ferricyanide can replace cytochrome ceffectively in the generation of O⨪2 catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase (Table III) or succinate-Q reductase (Table II). At the same concentration used, ferricyanide is more effective than cytochromec in stimulating O⨪2 formation in succinate-Q reductase than in succinate dehydrogenase.Table IIIProduction of O⨪2 by succinate dehydrogenase under various conditionsAdditionsO⨪2 productionXO units/mg SDHSDHaSDH, purified succinate dehydrogenase; cyt.c, cytochrome c; QCR, ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase; SCR, succinate-cytochrome creductase.0.07SDH + cyt.c 3+0.49SDH + K3Fe(CN)60.91SDH + QCR + cyt.c 3+0.55SDH + (QCR + QPs) + cyt.c 3+0.17SDH + SCR + cyt.c 3+0.12SDH + QPs + cyt.c 3+0.56SDH + cyt.c 2+0a SDH, purified succinate dehydrogenase; cyt.c, cytochrome c; QCR, ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase; SCR, succinate-cytochrome creductase.

Finally, mutations in WRN result in large DNA deletions, possibly as a result of chromosomal rearrangements, a prolonged S-phase of DNA replication, and sensitivity to the genotoxic agent, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4Salk D.

Together, these observations suggest that RecQ DNA helicases, including WRN, are involved in maintaining genomic stability, possibly by preventing deleterious recombination events from occurring during active DNA metabolism.The BLM and WRN proteins are both human RecQ-like DNA helicases. Yet, mutations in the respective genes result in distinctly different phenotypes. Examination of the domain structure of the two proteins reveals that, outside the helicase domain, the two polypeptides share little, if any, homology (28Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Boork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These regions, N- and C-terminal to the helicase domain, may encode other activities and/or interact with accessory proteins, both of which could determine the type of DNA transaction that each helicase carries out. Hence, identification of properties unique to each helicase may shed light on our understanding of their biological function(s). Recently, a conserved nuclease domain was identified in WRN by protein sequence data base searches (28Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Boork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Mushegian A.R. Bassett Jr., D.E. Boguski M.S. Boork P. Koonin E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This domain is unique to WRN, spans amino acids 80–240 in the N terminus, and exhibits significant similarity to the 3′ → 5′ proofreading domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I, to RNaseD and to the nuclease domain of the human polymyositis/scleroderma nuclear autoantigen. Based on this homology, WRN was proposed to encode an exonuclease. In this report we present molecular genetic, biochemical, and immunochemical evidence to demonstrate that the WRN protein possesses an integral DNA exonuclease activity in addition to its intrinsic DNA helicase activity.DISCUSSIONThe recent identification in WRN of a nuclease domain with a sequence consensus similar to the 3′ → 5′ proofreading domain of E. coli polymerase I and to RNase D (28Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Boork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Mushegian A.R. Bassett Jr., D.E. Boguski M.S. Boork P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) led us to test whether WRN exhibits a deoxyribonucleolytic activity in vitro. Three complementary approaches independently indicate thatWRN encodes an endogenous exonucleolytic activity in addition to a DNA helicase activity.First we demonstrate a direct correlation between the presence of the putative WRN nuclease domain and observation of nuclease activity (Fig.1). Full-length wild-type WRN purified by a single step of His-Bind affinity chromatography exhibits both DNA helicase and DNA exonuclease activities. Mutant proteins harboring either a deletion of the helicase domain (WRN-ΔH) or a single-base substitution (WRN-K577M) that inactivates ATP hydrolysis digest DNA exonucleolytically but fail to unwind it. In contrast, WRN-ΔE lacking the nuclease domain is unable to degrade DNA but retains its ability to displace DNA. Evidence for the presence of an exonuclease has also been obtained by Huang et al. (34Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These authors site- specifically altered two critical amino acid residues (Asp-82 and Glu-84) in the N-terminal exonuclease domain that are predicted to be important for nuclease activity. While the nuclease activity was abolished in these mutant proteins, the helicase activity remained unchanged relative to wild-type WRN. These genetic studies provide convincing evidence that hydrolysis of DNA is dependent on an intact N-terminal WRN exonuclease domain and that it does not require an intact helicase domain.Second, our data provide biochemical evidence to suggest that the exonuclease and helicase activities reside on the WRN polypeptide. Both activities copurify with an extensively purified preparation of WRN. The elution profile of the exonuclease activity from the final step of His-Bind affinity chromatography is superimposable on the elution profiles of the 160-kDa WRN protein, the WRN DNA helicase and ATPase (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the WRN helicase and exonuclease activities co-migrate on glycerol gradients suggesting that both activities are encoded by a protein of a high molecular mass (Fig. 4). While most exonucleases are of low molecular weight, high molecular weight DNA polymerases frequently contain an associated 3′ → 5′ exonuclease that functions in proofreading errors by the polymerase (35Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). That the high molecular weight nuclease is not the result of such contaminating DNA polymerases was demonstrated by primer extension assays. No strand extension was observed when the DNA substrate used for helicase/exonuclease activity assays was incubated with WRN in the presence of all four dNTPs under DNA synthesis reaction conditions (not shown).Finally, by incubating WRN with a polyclonal anti-WRN antiserum, we demonstrate that the helicase and nuclease activities are co-immunoprecipitated in a complex with protein A-agarose (Fig. 5). The depletion of the enzymatic activities of WRN is specific since neither activity is precipitated by the preimmune serum obtained from the same animal. These results further suggest that the helicase and exonuclease activities reside on the WRN polypeptide.The presence of both a DNA helicase and a DNA exonuclease activity on the same polypeptide is so far unique to the WRN protein and may provide clues to its function in DNA metabolism. The fact that they are encoded within separate domains and that they can be uncoupled by selective deletion of each domain suggests that these activities need not function concertedly during the same catalytic step. Furthermore, studies with a mutant WRN protein in which the lysine residue (Lys-577) essential for NTP hydrolysis is substituted by a methionine residue show that the mutant protein can lose its ability to unwind DNA but retain its nuclease function. The spatial separation of helicase and exonuclease is reminiscent of many DNA polymerases in which polymerization and exonucleolytic hydrolysis occur sequentially (35Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). This could imply that the exonuclease functions in the removal of damaged DNA to yield a functional 3′-terminus suitable for elongation by a DNA polymerase that lacks proofreading exonucleolytic activity. Such a DNA polymerase presumably functions in concert with a 3′ → 5′ helicase that displaces duplex DNA ahead of the growing replication fork.The ability of WRN helicase to exonucleolytically digest DNA also distinguishes it from other members of the RecQ helicase family. Although all members share the conserved helicase domains (7Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), none except WRN encodes an exonuclease domain. The presence of three, seemingly functionally redundant RecQ helicases in human cells (RecQL, BLM, and WRN) is puzzling. However, as more information is gained about possible other activities exhibited by these proteins, their substrate preferences, and their interaction with other proteins, they will likely be more distinct from one another. Hence, the helicase activity of WRN in conjunction with its exonuclease may limit the participation of WRN to processes that are distinct from those that require the RecQL and BLM proteins. Defective WRN activities could, therefore, impair these specific processes and result in the phenotypic manifestations that are characteristic of Werner Syndrome.In summary, we have identified a novel exonuclease that is encoded within the N-terminal sequence of the WRN protein. In the following paper (36Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.-C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we have biochemically characterized this activity and present evidence that it is a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease with properties distinct from other known exonucleases. The exonucleolytic activity exhibited by WRN could contribute to the unique characteristics of Werner Syndrome and distinguish it from other genomic instability disorders. Werner Syndrome (WS)1 is an inherited disease characterized by an early onset of atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and cancers of non-epithelial cell origin (1Epstein C.J. Martin G.M. Schultz A.L. Motulsky A.G. Medicine. 1966; 45: 177-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 2Goto M. Miller R.W. Ishikawa Y. Sugano H. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 1996; 5: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells from WS patients also present a shortened replicative lifespan (3Martin G.M. Sprague C.A. Epstein C.J. Lab. Invest. 1970; 23: 86-92PubMed Google Scholar) and increased genetic instability (4Salk D. Au K. Hoehn H. Martin G.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1981; 30: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 5Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The genomic instability of WS cells is manifested at the cytogenetic level in the form of chromosome breaks and translocations, and at the molecular level predominately by multiple, large DNA deletions (4Salk D. Au K. Hoehn H. Martin G.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1981; 30: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 5Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The gene responsible for the WS phenotype has been identified, cloned, and sequenced (6Yu C.-E. Oshima J. Fu Y.-H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). The cDNA encodes a protein (hereafter designated as WRN) of 1432 amino acids with a central helicase domain that is homologous in sequence to members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. This family includes Escherichia coli RecQ,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs-1p, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rqh-1p, human RecQL, and the protein associated with Bloom Syndrome, BLM. All of these proteins share the seven sequence motifs common to helicases, including the characteristic motif II DExH box (7Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The prototype of this family, the bacterial RecQ protein, is an active helicase that unwinds DNA in the 3′ → 5′ direction (8Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Likewise, as predicted from DNA sequence alignments, the yeast Sgs-1p and the human RecQL, WRN, and BLM proteins have recently been demonstrated to exhibit ATP-dependent, 3′ → 5′ DNA unwinding activities in vitro (9Lu J. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Kleff S. Romeo A.M. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 383: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Bennett R.J. Sharp J.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

The RecQ family of DNA helicases is believed to participate in numerous DNA transactions such as replication, recombination, and repair.E. coli RecQ is believed to initiate homologous recombination and suppress illegitimate recombination and the generation of aberrant recombination products (14Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J-I. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 15Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Further, RecQ is proposed to play a role in the reassembly of replication forks disrupted by UV lesions (16Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.): 1368Google Scholar). The phenotypes of mutations in the eukaryotic homologs also suggest their involvement in these processes.S. cerevisiae SGS-1 mutants display increased frequency of chromosome missegregation and recombination within ribosomal DNA repeats to generate extrachromosomal rDNA circles (18Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 19Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D.

Genetic studies indicate that S. pombe Rqh-1 is required to suppress inappropriate recombination that is essential for reversible S-phase arrest (22Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.E. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mutations in human BLM, responsible for Bloom Syndrome, are associated with a high frequency of sister chromatid exchange, sensitivity to several DNA damaging agents, and a defect in DNA replication (23Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 80: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1204) Google Scholar).

Both activities copurify with an extensively purified preparation of WRN. The elution profile of the exonuclease activity from the final step of His-Bind affinity chromatography is superimposable on the elution profiles of the 160-kDa WRN protein, the WRN DNA helicase and ATPase (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the WRN helicase and exonuclease activities co-migrate on glycerol gradients suggesting that both activities are encoded by a protein of a high molecular mass (Fig. 4). While most exonucleases are of low molecular weight, high molecular weight DNA polymerases frequently contain an associated 3′ → 5′ exonuclease that functions in proofreading errors by the polymerase (35Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). That the high molecular weight nuclease is not the result of such contaminating DNA polymerases was demonstrated by primer extension assays. No strand extension was observed when the DNA substrate used for helicase/exonuclease activity assays was incubated with WRN in the presence of all four dNTPs under DNA synthesis reaction conditions (not shown). Finally, by incubating WRN with a polyclonal anti-WRN antiserum, we demonstrate that the helicase and nuclease activities are co-immunoprecipitated in a complex with protein A-agarose (Fig. 5). The depletion of the enzymatic activities of WRN is specific since neither activity is precipitated by the preimmune serum obtained from the same animal. These results further suggest that the helicase and exonuclease activities reside on the WRN polypeptide. The presence of both a DNA helicase and a DNA exonuclease activity on the same polypeptide is so far unique to the WRN protein and may provide clues to its function in DNA metabolism. The fact that they are encoded within separate domains and that they can be uncoupled by selective deletion of each domain suggests that these activities need not function concertedly during the same catalytic step. Furthermore, studies with a mutant WRN protein in which the lysine residue (Lys-577) essential for NTP hydrolysis is substituted by a methionine residue show that the mutant protein can lose its ability to unwind DNA but retain its nuclease function. The spatial separation of helicase and exonuclease is reminiscent of many DNA polymerases in which polymerization and exonucleolytic hydrolysis occur sequentially (35Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). This could imply that the exonuclease functions in the removal of damaged DNA to yield a functional 3′-terminus suitable for elongation by a DNA polymerase that lacks proofreading exonucleolytic activity. Such a DNA polymerase presumably functions in concert with a 3′ → 5′ helicase that displaces duplex DNA ahead of the growing replication fork. The ability of WRN helicase to exonucleolytically digest DNA also distinguishes it from other members of the RecQ helicase family. Although all members share the conserved helicase domains (7Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), none except WRN encodes an exonuclease domain. The presence of three, seemingly functionally redundant RecQ helicases in human cells (RecQL, BLM, and WRN) is puzzling. However, as more information is gained about possible other activities exhibited by these proteins, their substrate preferences, and their interaction with other proteins, they will likely be more distinct from one another. Hence, the helicase activity of WRN in conjunction with its exonuclease may limit the participation of WRN to processes that are distinct from those that require the RecQL and BLM proteins. Defective WRN activities could, therefore, impair these specific processes and result in the phenotypic manifestations that are characteristic of Werner Syndrome. In summary, we have identified a novel exonuclease that is encoded within the N-terminal sequence of the WRN protein. In the following paper (36Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.-C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we have biochemically characterized this activity and present evidence that it is a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease with properties distinct from other known exonucleases. The exonucleolytic activity exhibited by WRN could contribute to the unique characteristics of Werner Syndrome and distinguish it from other genomic instability disorders."

Although both phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI 3,4-P2) have been implicated in the regulation of Akt activity in vitro, the relative roles of these two phospholipids in vivo are not well understood. Co-ligation of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the inhibitory FcγRIIB1 on B cells results in the recruitment of the 5′-inositol phosphatase SHIP to the signaling complex. Since SHIP is known to cleave PIP3 to generate PI 3,4-P2 both in vivo and in vitro, and Akt activity has been reported to be regulated by either PIP3 or PI 3,4-P2, we hypothesized that recruitment of SHIP through FcγRIIB1 co-cross-linking to the BCR in B cells might regulate Akt activity. The nature of this regulation, positive or negative, might also reveal the relative contribution of PIP3 and PI 3,4-P2 to Akt activation in vivo. Here we report that Akt is activated by stimulation through the BCR in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner and that this activation is inhibited by co-cross-linking of the BCR to FcγRIIB1. Using mutants of FcγRIIB1 and SHIP-deficient B cells, we demonstrate that inhibition of Akt activity is mediated by the immune cell tyrosine-based inhibitory motif within FcγRIIB1 as well as SHIP.

Based on these data, the current model of Akt activation is that Akt is recruited to the membrane by its PH domain binding to 3-OH-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol phosphates, which causes a conformational change in Akt, which allows phosphorylation and activation by PDK1 and at least one other kinase. Although there is some indication that PIP3 may be more permissive in allowing PDK1-mediated activation of Akt than PI 3,4-P2 in vitro (18Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N.

The nature of this regulation, positive or negative, might also reveal the relative contribution of PIP3 and PI 3,4-P2 to Akt activation in vivo. We demonstrate here that Akt activity is down-regulated by co-cross-linking FcγRIIB1 to the BCR, as compared with BCR cross-linking alone, and that this Akt down-regulation is dependent upon the ITIM motif of FcγRIIB1. Finally, we show that FcγRIIB1-mediated regulation of Akt is dependent on the 5′-inositol phosphatase SHIP.DISCUSSIONCo-ligation of FcγRIIB1 and the BCR results in a potent inhibitory signal, which leads to a selective attenuation of BCR-mediated signals (26Ravetch J.V.

Recently, it has been suggested that SHIP-mediated dephosphorylation of PIP3 and consequently the inhibition of Btk membrane localization and activation plays a central role in inhibition of calcium flux by FcγRIIB1 (35Scharenberg A.M.

Here, we show the activation of Akt by BCR stimulation in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that co-ligation of FcγRIIB1 with BCR results in inhibition of Akt kinase activity in murine A20 cells as well as in chicken DT40 cells transfected with murine FcγRIIB1. Using an FcγRIIB1-deficient subclone of A20 (IIA1.6) reconstituted with either wild type FcγRIIB1 or a carboxyl-terminally truncated FcγRIIB1 (lacking ITIM), we demonstrate that the inhibition of Akt activity is dependent on the ITIM motif. Additionally, in SHIP-deficient DT40 cells stably transfected with murine FcγRIIB1, co-ligation of BCR and FcγRIIB1 could not significantly inhibit Akt activation. These data indicate that the inhibition of Akt kinase activity is mediated by the inositol phosphatase SHIP. However, we consistently observed a slight inhibition of Akt by BCR plus FcγRIIB1 stimulation in SHIP-deficient cells. This may reflect minor roles played by other molecules such as SHP-1, known to interact with FcγRIIB1 (41Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 87: 961-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there could be some redundancy for SHIP, since a second SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP2) has been recently described (42Habib T. Hejna J. Moses R. Decker S. J. Biol.

In the absence of PDK1, one of the kinases that phosphorylates Akt, the addition of PI 3,4-P2 containing micelles to immunoprecipitated Akt increased its enzymatic activity, whereas PIP3 either had no effect or was inhibitory (11Klippel A.

In contrast, when purified PDK1 was present, activation of Akt was dependent on the presence of 3′-phosphorylated inositol lipids, with PIP3 being at least 2–3-fold more effective than PI 3,4-P2 in allowing Akt activation (18Alessi D.R.

It has been proposed that SHIP functions upstream of Akt and that the generation of PI 3,4-P2 positively regulates Akt activation (10Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Inhibition of BCR-induced signals by FcγRIIB1 involves recruitment of SHIP to the BCR signaling complex (26Ravetch J.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recently, Scharenberg et al. (35Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) have demonstrated in A20 cells that FcγRIIB1 co-cross-linking to the BCR decreases cellular PIP3 levels generated by BCR stimulation. Therefore, this system provides a useful tool to indirectly address the role of PIP3 versus PI 3,4-P2 in in vivo activation of Akt. Our data strongly suggest that, in vivo, dephosphorylation of PIP3 inhibits Akt activation and that SHIP-mediated generation of PI 3,4-P2does not positively regulate Akt. Therefore, in this system, PIP3 appears to be a more potent activator of Akt than PI 3,4-P2. Additionally, in several experiments, we observed a greater level of BCR-mediated activation of Akt in SHIP-deficient DT40 cells compared with SHIP-expressing cells, most likely due to the absence of PIP3 dephosphorylation. This suggests that SHIP also directly regulates the BCR-mediated rise in PIP3levels. This is consistent with the reported increase in Btk activation and calcium flux (another PIP3-dependent event) in SHIP-deficient cells as compared with SHIP-expressing cells (37Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, SHIP, through its effects on PIP3, could set the threshold for the magnitude of Akt activation and the downstream consequences.Others have suggested a biphasic pattern of Akt activation, with PIP3 being responsible for the early phase and PI 3,4-P2 mediating the late activ"

S., Fry, M., Oshima, J., and Loeb, L. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 34139–34144). Here we describe the properties of nearly homogeneous WRN exonuclease. WRN exonuclease hydrolyzes a recessed strand in a partial DNA duplex but does not significantly digest single-stranded DNA, blunt-ended duplex, or a protruding strand of a partial duplex. Although DNA is hydrolyzed in the absence of nucleoside triphosphates, nuclease activity is markedly stimulated by ATP, dATP, or CTP. WRN exonuclease digests DNA with a 3′ → 5′ directionality to generate 5′-dNMP products, and DNA strands terminating with either a 3′-OH or 3′-PO4 group are hydrolyzed to similar extents. A recessed DNA strand with a single 3′-terminal mismatch is hydrolyzed more efficiently by WRN than one with a complementary nucleotide, but the enzyme fails to hydrolyze a DNA strand terminating with two mismatched bases. WRN exonuclease is distinguished from known mammalian DNA nucleases by its covalent association with a DNA helicase, preference for a recessed DNA strand, stimulation by ATP, ability to equally digest DNA with 3′-OH or 3′-PO4 termini, and its preferential digestion of DNA with a single 3′-terminal mismatch. In addition to its DNA helicase activity, Werner syndrome protein (WRN) also possesses an exonuclease activity (Shen, J.-C. , Gray, M. D., Kamath-Loeb, A. S., Fry, M., Oshima, J., and Loeb, L. A.

We used molecular genetic, biochemical, and immunochemical methods to establish that the exonuclease, like the DNA helicase, is integral to WRN. Although the two activities are expressed in the same polypeptide in the wild-type protein, they can be uncoupled from each other by introducing mutations separately in each of the two domains. In patients, mutations in WRN are not necessarily located in the helicase domain. They are found throughout the gene and invariably introduce stop codons or deletions (6Oshima J. Yu C.E. Piussan C.

It has been argued that many mutations obliterate the nuclear localization signal and that lack of localization may be important in the pathogenesis of WS (17Matsumoto T. Shimamoto A. Goto M.

This lack of nuclear localization would result in deficits of both helicase and exonuclease activities. To gain a better understanding of the functions of the WRN exonuclease, we have studied its properties in some detail. We report the following characteristic features of the WRN exonuclease: 1) it hydrolyzes DNA in a 3′ → 5′ direction in an ATP-stimulated reaction to generate 5′-deoxynucleoside monophosphate products, 2) its preferred substrate is a recessed strand of a partial DNA duplex that terminates with either a 3′-OH or 3′-PO4 group, and 3) it efficiently digests DNA with a single 3′-terminal mismatched nucleotide but does not degrade DNA with two 3′-terminal mismatches, nor does it hydrolyze single-stranded DNA.

To label the 20-mer DNA at its 3′-end, it was annealed to the 46-mer oligonucleotide (Table I), and its 3′-terminus was extended by a single complementary [32P]dCMP residue in a reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 10 μl, 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5 μm dCTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 pmol of 20-mer/46-mer hybrid DNA, and 0.5 unit of Klenow DNA polymerase. Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, incorporation of [32P]dCMP was terminated by the addition of denaturing loading buffer; the samples were boiled, and DNA was electrophoresed through a 14% polyacrylamide-urea gel (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resolved32P-labeled 3′-21-mer DNA band was excised, extracted from the gel, and precipitated by ethanol (20Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. J. Biol.

In a standard assay for exonuclease activity, WRN was incubated with a32P-labeled 5′-20-mer/46-mer partial duplex substrate (Table I) under the previously described DNA helicase/exonuclease reaction conditions (16Shen J.-C.

Substrate specificity of the exonuclease was measured using the standard DNA substrate as well as the following oligomers: single-stranded 32P-labeled 5′-20-mer; blunt-ended 32P-labeled 5′-20-mer/unlabeled anti 20-mer duplex, and a 20-mer/32P-labeled 5′-46-mer partial duplex. To measure the relative capacity of WRN exonuclease to digest matched and terminally mismatched DNA substrates, unlabeled 46-mer DNA was annealed to either a fully matched 32P-labeled 5′-23-mer, a 3′-singly mismatched 24-mer, or a 3′-doubly mismatched 25-mer (TableI). Products of exonucleolytic digestion of DNA were resolved by electrophoresis through a 14% polyacrylamide-urea gel and were visualized by autoradiography or quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. To determine whether hydrolysis of DNA by WRN nuclease generates 3′- or 5′-dNMP residues, 32P-labeled 3′-21-mer in a partial duplex with unlabeled 46-mer was digested by WRN, and the labeled nucleoside monophosphate released was resolved and identified by thin layer chromatography. The DNA substrate was incubated with either an invariable amount of WRN protein (0.25 pmol) for different periods of time or with increasing amounts of WRN (0.125–1.5 pmol) for 10 min at 37 °C. DNA hydrolysis was terminated by setting the reaction mixtures on ice, and 50 nmol each of 3′-dCMP and 5′-dCMP marker nucleoside monophosphates were added. Aliquots were spotted on a polyethyleneimine-Cellulose F thin layer plate, and 3′- and 5′-nucleoside monophosphates were resolved by chromatography using a mixture of isobutyric acid:H2O:NH4OH (66:20:3). A wick of Whatman No. 3MM filter paper was attached to the top of the plate to increase the distance of migration and the resolution between 3′- and 5′-dCMP. Spots of migrated 3′- and 5′-dCMP standards were visualized by UV light, and 32P-labeled dCMP was located by autoradiography. To determine the DNA substrate requirements of WRN nuclease, we examined the ability of WRN to hydrolyze single-stranded DNA, blunt-ended DNA duplex, and a partial duplex in which one of the DNA strands has 3′ and 5′ protruding tails relative to the other. A fixed amount of each of the 32P-labeled DNA substrates was mixed with increasing amounts of the same unlabeled DNA and incubated with WRN as described. Measurements of the exonucleolytic activity of WRN demonstrated that only a recessed strand in a partial DNA duplex was significantly hydrolyzed by the enzyme (Fig.1). Quantitation of the amount of DNA digested as a function of substrate concentration yielded aK m value of 22 × 10−9m. No detectable WRN nuclease activity was observed with the other DNA substrates even when they were used at 100-fold higher concentrations. This suggests that the lack of exonucleolytic activity with these substrates is not simply reflective of lower binding affinities. Furthermore, WRN helicase was able to unwind the partial duplex irrespective of the strand that was 5′-end-labeled (data not shown). This again indicates that, at least with the 3′-protruding DNA substrate, a lower affinity of WRN for DNA is not responsible for the lack of exonuclease activity. WRN exonuclease is distinguished, therefore, from the large majority of the known nucleases by its preference for recessed DNA in a partial duplex (see “Discussion”). Since the helicase activity of WRN is completely dependent on the hydrolysis of NTPs, we tested whether the activity of WRN exonuclease is similarly affected by nucleoside triphosphates. A partial duplex of 32P-labeled 5′-20-mer/unlabeled 46-mer was incubated with 15 or 30 fmol of WRN protein in the absence or presence of different nucleoside tri- or monophosphates as indicated. In accord with recently reported results (21Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we found that the activity of WRN helicase was entirely dependent on ATP hydrolysis and that dATP, CTP, or dCTP could substitute for ATP to a significant extent (data not shown). On the other hand, WRN DNA helicase activity was undetectable in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATPγS, AMP, cAMP, GTP, dGTP, cGMP, UTP, or dTTP (results not shown). By contrast, hydrolysis of DNA by WRN exonuclease was observed in the absence of NTPs; this activity could be further increased by hydrolyzable NTPs. Fig. 2 shows a representative electrophoretogram of the DNA digestion products generated by WRN nuclease in the presence of different nucleoside phosphates, and TableII summarizes the quantitative results of the extents of DNA degradation. Under our experimental conditions, 15 and 30 fmol of WRN degraded 1.1% and 6.1% of the DNA substrate (100 fmol), respectively, in the absence of NTPs. Selected nucleoside triphosphates were especially effective in stimulating DNA hydrolysis by the lower amount of WRN nuclease. For example, ATP and dATP stimulated hydrolysis of the 20-mer DNA substrate by 4- to 5-fold. By contrast, although non-hydrolyzable ATPγS appeared to increase the processivity of the WRN exonuclease, it did not stimulate the overall extent of digestion (Table II). Like the WRN DNA helicase (21Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), WRN exonuclease was also stimulated by CTP and dCTP. Interestingly, whereas UTP or dTTP did not increase the activity of WRN helicase (results not shown), they did enhance the nuclease activity ∼3-fold using 15 fmol of WRN protein (Table II). Thus, unlike WRN DNA helicase that completely depends on ATP hydrolysis, its nuclease activity was measurable in the absence of hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphates. However, at protein to DNA molar ratios of <0.3, WRN-catalyzed DNA hydrolysis was significantly stimulated by selected nucleoside triphosphates in the order ATP = dATP > CTP > UTP = dTTP > dGTP = dCTP.Table IIEffect of nucleoside phosphates on DNA hydrolysis by WRN exonucleaseNucleoside phosphateX-fold stimulation of DNA hydrolysis15 fmol WRN30 fmol WRNNoneaThe fraction of 32P-labeled 5′-20-mer that was degraded by 15 and 30 fmol of WRN nuclease in the absence of nucleoside phosphate was 1.1 and 6.1%, respectively.1.01.0ATP4.551.9ATPγS1.350.85dATP4.651.5AMP1.50.6cAMP1.00.8GTP1.351.05dGTP1.81.2CTP3.11.3dCTP1.61.4UTP2.71.25dTTP2.70.95WRN protein (15 or 30 fmol) was incubated with the 32P-labeled 5′-20-mer/unlabeled 46-mer partial DNA duplex in the absence or presence of 1 mm of each of the indicated nucleoside phosphates at 37 °C for 10 min.

Open table in a new tab WRN protein (15 or 30 fmol) was incubated with the 32P-labeled 5′-20-mer/unlabeled 46-mer partial DNA duplex in the absence or presence of 1 mm of each of the indicated nucleoside phosphates at 37 °C for 10 min. Products of nucleolytic digestion were resolved by electrophoresis through a 14% polyacrylamide-urea gel as shown in Fig. 2. Relative amounts of hydrolyzed DNA were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. To determine the polarity of DNA digestion by the WRN nuclease, increasing amounts of the protein were incubated with a partial duplex of unlabeled 46-mer DNA annealed to either a32P-labeled 5′-20-mer or a 32P-labeled 3′-21-mer for 10 min at 37 °C. In a parallel experiment, a constant amount of WRN protein (5 fmol) was incubated with each DNA substrate for different periods of time. Whereas both substrates were equally unwound by WRN helicase (data not shown), there was a difference in the profiles of degradation products that accumulated with either 5′- or 3′-labeled DNA. Incubation of WRN with the 5′-32P-labeled DNA substrate resulted in the removal of single nucleotide residues to generate a ladder of progressively shortened DNA fragments, all labeled at the 5′-end (Fig. 3, upper left and right panels, respectively). By contrast, no such intermediate degradation products were detected when the 3′-32P-labeled DNA was incubated with WRN; the only product that accumulated proportionally to the amount of enzyme or time of incubation was a single 32P-labeled dCMP residue removed from the 3′-terminus (Fig. 3, lower leftand right panels, respectively). The progressive accumulation of 5′-labeled but not 3′-labeled DNA fragments indicates that WRN does not digest DNA endonucleolytically and that it acts exclusively as a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease under our experimental conditions. To determine whether WRN nuclease cleaves DNA to generate 3′- or 5′-dNMP residues, a 21-mer DNA substrate 32P-labeled at its 3′-terminal cytosine residue was hydrolyzed by increasing amounts of WRN or with a constant amount of the enzyme for different periods of time. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were co-chromatographed through a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer with 3′- and 5′-dCMP markers (see “Experimental Procedures”). As seen in Fig.4, the amount of [32P]dCMP accumulated was proportional to the amount of added WRN and to the duration of DNA hydrolysis. The absence of products other than free dCMP is in accord with the 3′ → 5′ directionality of DNA digestion (Fig. 3, lower left and right panels) and with the inability of WRN to cleave DNA endonucleolytically. Further, the32P-labeled dCMP product of WRN nuclease co-migrated with the 5′-dCMP marker but not with the 3′-dCMP marker (Fig. 4) indicating that WRN cleaves phosphodiester bonds to generate 5′-dNMP residues. To examine the relative capacity of WRN nuclease to degrade DNA molecules that terminate with either a 3′-OH or a 3′-PO4 group, the enzyme was incubated with increasing concentrations of a hybrid of the 46-mer DNA and a32P-labeled 5′-20-mer that ends with either a 3′-OH or 3′-PO4 terminus (Table I). Both DNA substrates were displaced equivalently by WRN helicase (results not shown). Likewise, the 3′-OH and 3′-PO4oligomers were degraded to similar extents by WRN exonuclease. PhosphorImager analysis and Lineweaver-Burk plots of the amount of DNA degraded as a function of substrate concentration yielded similar kinetic constants for both substrates. The V maxvalues were 0.03 and 0.02 pmol of DNA digested/10 min, and theK m values were 13 × 10−9 and 6 × 10−9m for the 3′-OH 20-mer and 3′-PO4 20-mer, respectively (Fig.5). The WRN 3′ → 5′ exonuclease is further distinguished by its ability to digest DNA that has a 3′-PO4 terminus equally or in a slight preference over DNA that carries a 3′-OH end. The sequence of the WRN exonuclease is homologous to the 3′ → 5′ proofreading domain of E. coliDNA polymerase I (22Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Boork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the 3′ → 5′ WRN exonuclease is capable of removing non-complementary nucleotides from the 3′-end of DNA. WRN nuclease was incubated with DNA substrates that were comprised of the unlabeled 46-mer annealed to either a 5′-32P-labeled fully complementary 23-mer, a 24-mer with a single 3′-terminal mismatch, or a 25-mer with two mismatches at the 3′-terminus (see Table I). Under our experimental conditions, removal of the single 3′-terminal mismatched nucleotide was more efficient than that of a complementary terminal base pair. However, 3′-terminal double mismatches were relatively resistant to digestion by WRN (Fig.6). A similar preference for DNA containing a single mismatch was observed (data not presented) when the reaction mixtures were incubated with WRN-ΔH, a mutant enzyme that expresses only the N-terminal exonuclease domain (16Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, at least within the sequence and structure contexts of the DNA substrates examined, WRN exonuclease preferentially hydrolyzes DNA with a single 3′-terminal mismatched nucleotide. In the preceding paper (16Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that WRN possesses an integral exonuclease activity. The present study characterizes this activity. Using a >90% homogeneous preparation of recombinant wild-type WRN, we have identified several novel properties of the exonuclease that distinguish it from most known eukaryotic nucleases. 3′ → 5′ exodeoxyribonucleases are, in general, small molecular weight proteins that hydrolyze DNA in an ATP-independent manner (24Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The majority of these enzymes exclusively digest single-stranded, rather than double-stranded, DNA. The catalytic properties of the 3′ → 5′ WRN exonuclease are markedly different. First, the WRN exonuclease is a large molecular weight entity (16Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Apart from the 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonucleases that are intrinsic to eukaryotic DNA polymerases δ and ε (24Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar), no other proteins of ∼160 kDa have thus far been reported to possess nuclease activity. Second, the WRN exonuclease preferentially degrades a recessed strand in a partial DNA duplex to generate 5′-deoxynucleoside monophosphates (Figs. 1 and 4). Unlike most other 3′ → 5′ exonucleases, it fails to measurably hydrolyze single-stranded DNA, a blunt-ended DNA duplex or a 3′-protruding DNA strand of a partial duplex when used over a 100-fold range of DNA concentrations (Fig. 1). The fact that the helicase activity of WRN unwinds the duplex with the protruding DNA strand argues that the lack of hydrolysis is not simply due to a reduced binding affinity of WRN for these DNA molecules. Also, the absence of nucleolytic degradation of single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1) negates the presence of a nonspecific DNase in the preparation. Recessed DNA chains terminating with either a 3′-OH or 3′-PO4 group are equally degraded by the enzyme, as reflected by the similar values ofV max and K m for both DNA substrates (Fig. 5). Furthermore, 3′ recessed termini with either a matched sequence or with a single mismatch are preferably degraded over those with two mismatches (Fig. 6). Finally, the exonuclease activity of WRN is markedly stimulated by ATP or dATP at low enzyme concentrations; CTP, dCTP, UTP, and dTTP also increase the activity (Fig. 2 and Table II). The most likely explanation for the stimulatory effect is that binding and hydrolysis of NTPs in the helicase domain induces a conformational change of the nuclease domain that, in turn, increases its exonucleolytic activity. Another unique characteristic of the WRN exonuclease is its low processivity, as reflected by the appearance of intermediate sized degradation products (Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 6). That this is not a result of pause sites in the sequence of the oligonucleotide was shown using a 20-mer with a different sequence context; a similar pattern of major degradation products, ranging from 14–19 nucleotides in length, is observed (data not presented). The low processivity is also indicated by the high enzyme concentrations and the extended incubation times that are required to see the appearance of the single 5′-terminal nucleoside monophosphate (Figs. 2 and 3), the completely digested product of the WRN nuclease. However, the processivity could be increased in vivo by the interaction of WRN with accessory proteins. It is possible that the primary function of the WRN exonuclease is the hydrolysis of short stretches of DNA. Alternatively, competing helicase and exonuclease activities may limit the processivity of the WRN exonuclease. Several of the properties of the WRN exonuclease are similar to those of E. coli exonuclease III (exo III). Both nucleases preferentially hydrolyze recessed DNA with a 3′ → 5′ polarity (Fig. 3and Ref. 25Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, both proteins are 3′-phosphomonoesterases, capable of hydrolyzing a DNA chain terminating with a 3′-PO4 group (Fig. 5 and Ref. 26Richardson C.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 242-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, while E. coli exo III is an endonuclease responsible for the repair of apurinic-apyrimidinic sites in DNA (27Weiss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1896-1901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the WRN nuclease does not exhibit endonucleolytic activity with any of the substrates used in this study (Fig. 1). The exonuclease activity of E. coli exo III has been postulated to play a role in the repair of DNA damaged by reactive oxygen species. This proposal is based on the observation that bacteria lacking functional exo III show an increased sensitivity to H2O2 (28Demple B. Halbrook J. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity of WS cells to 4NQO (29Ogburn C.E. Oshima J. Poot M. Chen R. Hunt K.E. Gollahon K.A. Rabinovitch P.S. Martin G.M. Hum. Genet. 1997; 101: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), an agent also known to generate O2 free radicals, may imply that the exonuclease activity of WRN is required for repair of DNA damaged by 4NQO. 4NQO forms direct adducts with DNA and also induces the formation of reactive oxygen species that modify DNA and generate double strand breaks that could result in recessed DNA strands with either a 3′-OH or 3′-PO4 terminus. Thus, like exo III, WRN exonuclease may be involved in the repair of oxygen-damaged DNA. The identification and characterization of the novel WRN exonuclease raises an interesting question. Do the helicase and exonuclease activities function together? If they do, the opposite polarities of DNA unwinding and hydrolysis make the process highly unusual. At least two models can be invoked to explain these inconsistencies. In the first, WRN binds the 3′ tail of a DNA chain and initiates unwinding of the complementary annealed strand. When it approaches the last few bases of annealed DNA, it is unable to proceed further. At this point, WRN undergoes a conformational change that orients the nuclease domain in proximity to the 3′ end of the strand that is being displaced, promoting the exonucleolytic degradation rather than unwinding of the terminally base-paired sequences. The second model proposes that the DNA, rather than WRN, assumes an altered conformation. For example, if the DNA strand that is bound by WRN were to bend, WRN could simultaneously unwind DNA from one end and hydrolyze it from the other. It is more conceivable, however, that the two activities of WRN are manifested at different steps of the same pathway. In our accompanying paper (16Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) we showed that DNA unwinding does not require the exonuclease function and vice versa. In this and other studies (21Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that whereas DNA unwinding is completely dependent on the hydrolysis of NTPs, exonucleolytic digestion is not. These observations suggest that the two enzymatic activities of WRN need not function concertedly. Based on the known DNA replication phenotypes of WS cells (14Poot M. Hoehn H. Runger T.M. Martin G.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1992; 202: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,15Fujiwara Y. Higashikawa T. Tatsumi M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 92: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), WRN may participate in DNA synthesis. In this process, the WRN exonuclease may remove a 3′-terminal nucleotide that is misincorporated by a DNA polymerase lacking an associated 3′ → 5′ proofreading activity. The WRN helicase on the other hand could function in lagging strand DNA synthesis by displacing upstream Okazaki fragments and enabling FEN1/RTH1 endonuclease to digest the displaced strand and DNA ligase to join the DNA. Alternatively, the restricted sensitivity of WS cells to 4NQO (29Ogburn C.E. Oshima J. Poot M. Chen R. Hunt K.E. Gollahon K.A. Rabinovitch P.S. Martin G.M. Hum. Genet. 1997; 101: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) suggests that WRN may be required to repair DNA modified by 4NQO. Among other alterations, 4NQO generates chromosomal breaks that, if repaired incorrectly, can lead to chromosome translocations and other types of genetic instability. Since WS cells are characterized by this form of genomic instability, it is tempting to speculate that one function of WRN may be the repair of DNA double strand breaks. This pathway could require the participation of a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease to remove PO4 groups from the 3′-terminus and/or create a gap, and a helicase to unwind DNA during repair synthesis (30Haber J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Model in vitro systems that mimic partial steps of DNA replication, repair, and recombination (31Bambara R.A.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) should allow one to assess the ability of WRN to function as a helicase and an exonuclease in these processes."

The membrane compartmentalization of cells results in the segregation of biochemical activities through the selective transport and retention of molecules into specific organelles. As part of this process, exo- and endocytosis regulate the availability of secreted chemical messengers and their receptors. The organization and dynamics of the secretory pathway are generated through a series of vesicle budding events from donor compartments and membrane fusion events with acceptor compartments (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the selective capture of specific cargo into vesicles, the fidelity of vesicle target selection, and the mechanisms of membrane fusion are not fully understood. Contributions to understanding these processes have come from three approaches: yeast genetics, in vitrobiochemical reconstitution of intracellular membrane trafficking, and the study of synaptic vesicle proteins and their interactions. These seemingly independent lines of investigation converged, leading to the realization that a common set of molecules appear to mediate membrane trafficking in all eucaryotic cells (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 3Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). At the core of the membrane fusion process, six molecules appear to be particularly important. In the nerve terminal, the vesicle and plasma membrane are thought to be brought into close apposition through the formation of a four helix bundle structure (5Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.-K. Bennet M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). A vesicle protein VAMP,1 contributes one helix, while the plasma membrane proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin contribute three helices to form a parallel bundle alternatively referred to as the core complex, the fusion complex, or the SNARE complex (6Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The structure of this complex and the subcellular localization of the components suggest that its formation may drive the membrane fusion process itself, although this issue remains controversial (7Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). The core complex is extremely stable and its dissociation is mediated by NSF, an ATPase chaperone, that requires αSNAP to bind the core complex (8Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Dissociation of this complex allows the components to recycle for another round of membrane fusion. Since the complex of VAMP, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 binds to αSNAP, these proteins have been referred to as αSNAP receptors or SNAREs. The sixth protein critical for membrane fusion in the nerve terminal is nsec1 (munc-18), a member of the sec1 family (9Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 10Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 11Garcia E.P. Gatti E. Butler M. Burton J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This protein binds syntaxin to form a complex distinct from the core complex, although the role of nsec1 in membrane fusion is not clearly understood. The binding of SNAREs to each other from opposite membranes may underlie at least part of the specificity of vesicle trafficking; however, this idea has not yet been experimentally established. A prerequisite for SNARE proteins to impart specificity to the fusion process is that each membrane compartment should have a complement of SNARE proteins sufficient to ensure pairing with appropriate partners. Recently, several SNARE proteins have been characterized based either on interactions with known SNAREs or due to sequence homology to known SNARE proteins (12Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Indeed, it appears that many membrane compartments have a specific and/or unique complement of SNAREs. For example, rsec22b, rbet1, membrin, and syntaxin 5 are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), intermediate compartment, and the Golgi, where they mediate trafficking at this stage of the secretory pathway (12Hay J.C.

Many other SNARE proteins also appear to distribute uniquely within the secretory pathway even if their precise subcellular localization is not yet known. A complete understanding of the secretory pathway will require a full definition of the complement of SNARE proteins in mammalian cells. Sequence analysis of the growing family of SNAREs has already provided important insights. In particular, while all SNARE proteins have been proposed to be members of a large gene family, several subfamilies exist based on higher levels of homology. While many members of the VAMP and syntaxin families have been identified, only two closely related members of the SNAP-25 family (SNAP-25 and SNAP-23) have been characterized (18Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 19Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this report, we present a new member of the SNAP-25 subfamily we refer to as SNAP-29. In addition, we characterize two new members of the syntaxin family, syntaxin 8 and syntaxin 17. These proteins are broadly expressed suggesting general roles in membrane trafficking and, like the other SNAREs, appear to localize to specific membrane compartments. In our earlier search of the GenBankTM EST data base (20Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we obtained a human epithelial cell cDNA clone (accession number AA654455). Sequencing of this clone and comparison to another human cDNA clone (accession number AF062077) yielded an open reading frame (ORF) of 711 base pairs and was designated syntaxin 8. The clone AA654455 encodes for all but the first 8 amino acids of human syntaxin 8. AA062077 encodes for the complete ORF of human syntaxin 8 plus 150 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region. The complete coding region of human syntaxin 3 (21Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) was amplified in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in pAS2K, a vector derived from pAS1 (22Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), to create pAS/syn3. Yeast strain Y190 (CLONTECH) was sequentially transformed with first pAS/syn3 and grown up in SD−Trp medium (CLONTECH) to generate Y190/syn3 strain. A combined human lymphocyte/HeLa cell cDNA library was transformed into the Y190/syn3 strain. Eight million transformants were placed on SD−Leu/−Trp/−His + 40 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole plates and incubated at 30 °C for 8 days. 287 blue colonies were selected for further analysis. In addition to αSNAP, SNAP-25A, SNAP-25B, membrin, munc-18B, and Ykt6, partial coding regions of two novel human proteins, with homology to different syntaxins and to SNAP-25, respectively, were identified. Multiple clones contained the partial sequence of human syntaxin 17. Custom-designed oligonucleotides were used to amplify a 360-base pair fragment using the human clone as a template for the PCR. The PCR product was then 32P-labeled by a random hexamer priming reaction and used to screen 6 × 105 plaques from a rat brain 5′-Stretch PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH) at 61 °C. Library screening yielded seven positive, overlapping clones. λ DNA was obtained by standard methods, and the EcoRI fragments were subcloned into pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene Inc.) and both strands were sequenced using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and custom oligonucleotide primers. The largest clone (1.7 kb) contained an 906-base pair ORF which was designated syntaxin 17. Using syntaxin 3 as a bait in the yeast-two-hybrid system (see above), multiple clones were isolated, which contained partial coding region of SNAP-29. Custom-designed oligonucleotides were designed and used to amplify a 390-base pair fragment taking one of the human clones as a template for the PCR. The PCR product was used as a probe to screen 8 × 105 plaques of a human brain 5′-Stretch PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH) at 62 °C. The λ DNA of the four resulting positive clones was obtained by standard methods, the EcoRI fragments were subcloned into pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene Inc.), and both strands were sequenced using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and custom oligonucleotide primers. The largest clone (1.1 kb) contained an 777-base pair open reading frame, which was designated SNAP-29. DNA and protein sequences were analyzed with the Genetics Computer Group software package (23Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar). The basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) algorithm was used to search the GenBankTMdata base (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the PILEUP program using default parameters (gap creation penalty = 12 and gap extension penalty = 4), and pairwise sequence comparisons were performed with the BESTFIT program using identical parameters. Statistical significance of the homology of two proteins was also determined with this program by generating z scores.z scores were calculated from the quality scores provided by the BESTFIT program: z = (quality score of alignment in question − mean quality score of 100 alignments using randomized sequences)/S.D. of 100 quality scores from randomized sequences. The phylogenetic tree of the syntaxin/SNAP-25 gene family was generated by first aligning all family members using the PILEUP program (gap creation penalty = 1.5 and gap extension penalty = 1). A table of the pairwise distances was then created (DISTANCES program; Kimura method), and the GROWTREE program (UPGMA method) was used to reconstruct the actual tree from the distance matrix. Coiled-coil motifs were analyzed with the Coils program, version 2.1, using both the MTIDK and the MTK matrix (25Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). Human and rat multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased fromCLONTECH. Human blots were used for syntaxin 8 and SNAP-29, and a rat blot was used for syntaxin 17. A random-primed32P probe was generated using full-length coding region for each gene. Hybridization and washing were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The complete coding regions of syntaxin 8, syntaxin 17, and SNAP-29 were amplified by PCR using custom-designed oligonucleotide primers with appropriate restriction sites. The PCR products were subcloned into a derivative of the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen Corp.) that contained an oligonucleotide encoding the myc epitope so that the epitope was at the amino-terminal end of the protein. NRK and COS cells (passage 3–20) were maintained using standard techniques. For transfections with the expression constructs, one barely confluent 10-cm dish of NRK cells (1 × 107cells) was harvested with trypsin-EDTA, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 600 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 10 min on ice with 10 μg of plasmid DNA in a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). The cells were then electroporated using 960 microfarads and 0.25 kV in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with capacitance extender, seeded in appropriate density into each well of an eight-chamber microscope slide (Nunc), and fixed for microscopy 24 h after transfection. COS cells were transiently transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus system (Life Technologies Inc.). For extraction studies, transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Indirect immunofluorescence localization was performed on NRK and COS cells as described previously (26Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5671-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-myc (9E10) and rabbit anti-myc polyclonal IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and utilized for immunofluorescence at a dilution of 1:1000 and 1:1500, respectively. For immunoblotting, the 9E10 monoclonal antibody was used at a 1:2000 dilution. For immunofluorescence, affinity-purified anti-syntaxin 5 rabbit antibody was used at a 1:300 dilution (26Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1500. Monoclonal antibodies against NSF were obtained from the corresponding hybridoma cell lines generated by fusion of NS-1 mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with His-tagged bovine NSF fusion protein (28Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Ascites fluid was produced by Josman Laboratories (Napa Valley, CA). For immunofluorescence, ascites fluid of the anti-NSF hybridoma cell line 6A11–3 was used at a dilution of 1:1000. For Western blotting, ascites fluid of the anti-NSF hybridoma cell line 9G7–3 was used at a dilution of 1:2000. Using the forward primers T7-hSNAP-23 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACATGGATGGATAATCTGTCATCAGAAG-3′) and T7-mSNAP-25 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACATGGATGGATGGCCGAGGACGCAGACATGCG-3′) as well as the reverse primer GEX3′ (5′-GCGGGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGG-3′), the full-length coding region of human SNAP-23 and mouse SNAP-25 was amplified by PCR by using the bacterial expression constructs pGEX/hSNAP-23 and pGEX/mSNAP-25 as templates (18Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar,19Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J.

Full-length cDNA for SNAP-29 was linearized from the expression construct pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). mRNA was generated by using the T7-mMESSAGE mMACHINETM kit (Ambion Inc.), andin vitro translations were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins incorporating the full cytoplasmic domains of either rat or human syntaxins 1a, 3, 4, 7, and 13 were prepared as described (17Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; (in press): 143Google Scholar, 29Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H.

The full-length cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 17 was prepared by PCR using custom-designed oligonucleotide primers with appropriate restriction sites. The fragment was subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Qiagen), transformed into the Escherichia coli strain XL1blue-MRF, and induced and purified as described (29Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were eluted off the glutathione-agarose beads for 10 min with 25 mmreduced glutathione, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, and excessively dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). [35S]Methionine-labeled SNAP-23/-25/-29 (14 μl of lysate/sample) was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of solid glutathione-agarose beads and 5 μg of either syntaxin-GST fusion protein or 25 μg of GST in 500 μl of buffer A. Samples were washed four times in 1 ml of buffer A with brief centrifugations. The beads were then boiled in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, and eluted proteins were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed for fluorography. Membrane extraction studies ofmyc-SNAP-29-transfected COS cells was carried out as described previously (14Advani R.J. Bae H.-R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.-C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.-S. Scheller R.H. J.

Searches of the data bases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) using the amino acid sequence of syntaxin 6 revealed the presence of several mouse and human EST clones (AA111025, W41301,AA654455) predicted to encode a homologous protein (20Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The EST cloneAA654455 was fully sequenced, and found to contain an ORF of 228 amino acids. A BLAST search performed with this sequence identified another human cDNA clone (AF062077), which completely overlapped with the sequence of the clone AA654455. In addition, AF062077 provided the nucleotide sequence of 174 nucleotides preceding the sequence ofAA654455. By assembling both sequences, a putative start Met (at nucleotides 151–153), an open reading frame predicted to encode a protein of 236 amino acids and a molecular mass of 26,879 Da, and a stop codon at nucleotides 858–860 were identified (Fig.1). When the GenBankTMnucleotide data base was translated and searched with the predicted amino acid sequence of syntaxin 8 using the TBLASTN algorithm, significant homology to mammalian syntaxin 6 and to mammalian SNAP-25 was revealed (see Fig. 1) (13Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). When the amino acid sequences of these proteins were compared in a pairwise fashion using the BESTFIT algorithm, syntaxin 8 was found to be 32% identical and 45% similar to syntaxin 6 (z score = 23.7), when considering the most conserved carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain (amino acids 138–230). By using the same algorithm, syntaxin 8 was also found to be 30% identical and 44% similar to SNAP-25 (z score = 7.8; amino acids 150–203). These results indicate an ancestral relationship between these three proteins. Sequence analysis reveals several potential structural motifs. The carboxyl-terminal 26 residues of syntaxin 8 probably function as a membrane anchor because they are not charged and contain a central stretch of hydrophobic amino acids. Syntaxin 8 is also predicted to contain two coiled-coil domains. The first helical domain resides in the amino-terminal part of the protein, whereas the second predicted coiled-coil domain directly precedes the hydrophobic tail. The amino-terminal predicted coil does not have the characteristics of a sequence that functions in forming a core SNARE complex. For example, the heptad repeat is not centered on a glutamine or arginine residue that appears in all well characterized domains that associate to form SNARE complexes. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal repeat of syntaxin 8 aligns well with the predicted coiled-coil of syntaxin 6 and SNAP 25, and includes a conserved glutamine residue at the center of the domain. From this analysis, we conclude that syntaxin 8 will contribute one helical domain to the formation of a four-stranded SNARE complex. Northern blot analysis revealed one syntaxin 8 transcript of 1.3 kb that displayed similar expression levels across all tissues tested (see Fig. 2 A), with elevated expression in heart. These data are consistent with a general role of syntaxin 8 in the secretory pathway. Intracellular targeting of a protein to a particular organelle often provides valuable insight into its specific role in the cell. To this end, the full-length cDNA of syntaxin 8 was tagged at its amino terminus with the c-myc epitope and transiently expressed in NRK cells and COS cells. myc-syntaxin 8 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using either the 9E10 anti-myc monoclonal antibody or affinity purified rabbit anti-myc antibodies. As illustrated in Fig.3 (A, C,E, and G), myc-syntaxin 8 was localized to intracellular membranes displaying a tubular/reticular pattern. This staining pattern is characteristic of the ER and overlapped significantly with that of the ER protein calnexin (Fig. 3,E versus F and G versus H) (27Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). On the other hand,myc-syntaxin 8 did not overlap with the intermediate compartment and Golgi marker syntaxin 5 (Fig. 3, A versus B), and the endosomal recycling pathway marker transferrin receptor (Fig. 3, C versus D) (21Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 32Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In summary, syntaxin 8 appears to be a SNARE protein important in membrane trafficking in many different cell types, perhaps functioning within the early secretory pathway. Using the yeast two-hybrid system (33Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), we isolated multiple overlapping cDNAs, which encoded a protein that interacted with syntaxin 3. Sequencing of these cDNAs revealed a putative protein that displayed significant homology to various syntaxin family members. A nucleic acid probe was generated from one of these clones and used to screen a rat brain cDNA library. We obtained rat cDNA clones containing an ORF encoding a protein of 301 amino acids and a predicted mass of 33,182 Da (Fig.4). Preceding the putative start Met, the longest of the isolated cDNA clones contained 129 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region sequence. Syntaxin 7 (p = 0.0095) and syntaxin 13 (p = 0.007) are the highest scoring mammalian proteins that are found when searching the data base with the BLAST program using the full-length amino acid sequence as a query (14Advani R.J. Bae H.-R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.-C. Prekeris R. Yoo J.-S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10317-10324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 31Wang H. Frelin L. Pevsner J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The homology between syntaxin 7, syntaxin 13, and syntaxin 17 is illustrated in Fig. 4. The BESTFIT algorithm revealed a 35% identity and 57% similarity between syntaxin 17 and syntaxin 7 (z score = 17), which resides in the conserved membrane-proximal coiled-coil domain that defines the syntaxin family of proteins (amino acids 174–227). Likewise, the BESTFIT algorithm revealed a 36% identity and 55% similarity between syntaxin 17 and syntaxin 13 (z score = 16.1; amino acids 172–227). Syntaxin 17 also displays high homology to the yeast syntaxins Sso1 (p = 0.0041) and Sso2 (p = 0.0075) (34Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), as well as to the syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE inArabidopsis thaliana (p = 0.0080) and a proposed A. thaliana syntaxin T1F9.22 (AC004255) (p = 0.0037) (35Lukowitz W. Mayer U. Jurgens G. Cell. 1996; 84: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the syntaxin family, the predicted transmembrane domain encoded by this sequence is not at the carboxyl terminus of the ORF. Rather, it is followed by a stretch of 52 amino acids that show no obvious homology to known proteins or motifs. A predicted coiled-coil sequence just amino-terminal to the hydrophobic domain fits the consensus for other syntaxins including a glutamine residue at the center of the heptad motif. To determine if syntaxin 17 performs a general vesicle trafficking function in all tissues or whether it is restricted to a subset of tissues, we determined its expression by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, syntaxin 17 is expressed in a series of six transcripts of different sizes (2.7, 3.1, 4.0, 4.4, 6.0, and 6.4 kb). There are three major transcripts (3.1, 6.0, and 6.4 kb) in all tissues examined; however, they are particularly abundant in liver. Liver is well known for its prominent secretory role and is especially enriched in the ER compared wit"

However, the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that dephosphorylate these proteins and terminate signaling remained unidentified. We have noted that IL-4-dependent activation of Stat6 is sustained longer in fibroblasts than in lymphoid cells. Because Shp-1, an SH2 domain-containing PTP, is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, we examined whether Shp-1 activity could regulate IL-4-dependent cell signaling. Expression of an Shp-1 transgene in NIH 3T3 cells markedly reduces both IL-4-dependent Stat6 activation and Stat6-mediated transcription of IL-4-responsive genes. In accord with this, IL-4 treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages from viable motheaten mice that express substantially reduced levels of Shp-1 activity show remarkably enhanced activation of Stat6. In addition, Stat6 activation by IL-4 is significantly enhanced in pre-B cells derived from motheaten (Shp-1 null mutant) mice compared with normal pre-B cells derived from control animals.

Dephosphorylation of these signaling proteins is a key mechanism for down-regulation of cytokine signaling; however, the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that dephosphorylate the proteins in the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathway remain to be identified. We have proposed that more than one PTP is involved in the negative regulation of the Jak-Stat pathway activated by interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines (16Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. Semin.

A global inhibition of PTP-activities by pervanadate (PV) results in the constitutive phosphorylation of Stat6, which depends on the activation of both Jak1 and IL-4Rα (18Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W.

This suggests that PTPs not only down-regulate cytokine-dependent activation of the Jak-Stat pathway but also inhibit the constitutive activation of the pathway (18Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W.

Here we present biochemical and genetic evidence that Shp-1 is involved in the negative regulation of IL-4/IL-13-dependent activation of Stat6 and subsequent induction of IL-4/IL-13-responsive gene expression.

To understand the negative regulation of IL-4 signaling, we determined the time course of IL-4-dependent Stat6 activation in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines. Binding of IL-4 to its receptor on the cell surface results in Jak-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine 641 residue of latent Stat6 and subsequent homodimerization of phospho-Stat6 molecules through the SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interaction (28Hou J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation and activation of Stat6 can be monitored by measuring the in vitro binding of Stat6 homodimer to N6-GAS, which is not recognized by any other activated Stat proteins (18Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Hou J. Schindler U.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Stat6 activation by IL-4 at varying times (0.5–8.0 h) was measured by EMSA in NIH 3T3 and Daudi cells (Fig.1 A). In both cell lines, Stat6 activation attained a similar maximum level at ∼0.5 h of cytokine treatment. At 2 h, while more than 50% activation of Stat6 persisted in NIH 3T3 cells, Daudi cells retained less than 20% activated Stat6. Even after 8 h of IL-4 treatment, 30% activated Stat6 remained in NIH 3T3 cells compared with less than 10% activated Stat6 sustained in Daudi cells (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that regulation of Stat6 activity in hematopoietic cells may be different from other cell types. Two potential possibilities may account for this cell-type-specific differential kinetics of IL-4-dependent Stat6 activation. First, the cell lines that support sustained Stat6 activation in response to IL-4 or IL-13 may not express either the γc chain or Jak3 or both and, hence, are responsive to these cytokines through the type II IL-4 receptor complex, whereas in Daudi cells, IL-4 acts through the type I receptor complex (2Keegan A.D. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Immunologist. 1996; 4: 194-198Google Scholar, 6O'Shea J.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Kondo M. Takeshita T.

Friedmann M.C. Miyajima A. Puri R.K. Paul W.E. Leonard W.J. Science. 1993; 262: 1880-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Daudi cells did not respond to IL-13 (data not shown), indicating that the type II IL-4 receptor complex is not functional in these cells. Besides differential usage of the receptor complex, the number of functional receptors may contribute to the duration of IL-4 signaling in these two cell types (31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). The second possibility is that differential expression of Shp-1, an SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase that is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and has been shown to down-regulate other cytokine signals, may account for the difference in Stat6 activation kinetics (20Yi T. Mui A.L-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 22Yi T. Zhang J. Muira O. Ihle J.N. Blood. 1995; 85: 87-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23David M. Chen H.E.

Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In support of the latter possibility, Western blot analysis shows that Shp-1 protein is barely detectable in NIH 3T3 cell extract while Daudi cells express high levels of Shp-1, and IL-4 treatment did not alter the levels of Shp-1 protein in these cell lines (Fig. 2 A). To examine further the involvement of Shp-1 in the IL-4-dependent signaling of Stat6, we overexpressed murine Shp-1 in NIH 3T3 cells. Stable cell lines were isolated by drug (puromycin) selection, and a representative clone that expressed Shp-1 at high levels (Fig. 2 A) was selected for further analyses. In response to IL-4 or IL-13, the DNA-binding activity of Stat6 was markedly reduced in Shp-1-overexpressing cells compared with the corresponding control cell line (Fig. 2 B). It is interesting to note that PV-mediated activation of Stat6 is also significantly (>3-fold) reduced in cells expressing the Shp-1 transgene compared with the control cells (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that Shp-1 is involved in the down-regulation of IL-4/IL-13-dependent Jak-Stat signaling. To confirm the involvement of Shp-1 in IL-4/IL-13 signaling, we determined cytokine-dependent Stat6 activation in cells derived from Shp-1-deficient mice. The viable strain ofmotheaten(mev/mev) mice have a homozygous mutation in the Shp-1 gene that results in the expression of Shp-1 protein with substantially reduced PTP activity (32Shulz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L. Beier D.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Upon IL-4 treatment, BMDM frommev/mev mice show remarkably enhanced DNA-binding activity of Stat6 compared with BMDM from control littermates (Fig. 3,A and B). These data clearly indicate that Shp-1 is involved in the down-regulation of the IL-4/IL-13-dependent Stat6 activation. Shp-1 associates with IL-2Rβ, IL-3Rβ-chain, and EPO receptor upon treatment of cells with the respective cytokine (19Migone T-S. Cacalano N.A. Taylor N. Yi T. Waldman T.A. Johnson J.A. Proc. Natl.

Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Therefore, Shp-1 fulfills the function of an upstream PTP that we have designated PTP-x that dephosphorylates the activated Jaks and the receptor subunits (17Haque S.J. Flati V. Deb A. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25709-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that PTP-x not only down-regulates cytokine-induced signals but also inhibits the constitutive signals that result from the basal activity of the cytokine receptor-associated Jaks (18Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, in the IL-2, IL-3, and EPO-system, Shp-1 does not constitutively associate with the receptors (19Migone T-S. Cacalano N.A. Taylor N. Yi T. Waldman T.A. Johnson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3845-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Yi T. Mui A.L-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kingmüller U.

If Shp-1 constitutively associates with IL-4 receptor subunits and inhibits the basal activity of IL-4 receptor-associated Jak(s), one would expect to see constitutive Stat6 activation in cells that are derived from the me/me mice. These mice have a frameshift mutation in the Shp-1 gene and do not express detectable Shp-1 activity (32Shulz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L. Beier D.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). To test for constitutive Stat6 activation, pre-B cell lines were established fromme/me and control mice (26Yang W. Mckenna S.D. Jiao H. Tabrizi M. Lynes M.A. Shulz L.D. Yi T. Exp. Hematol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We found that pre-B cells from me/me mice do not support constitutive activation of Stat6, and even a brief exposure to IL-4 does not enhance Stat6 activation in me/me pre-B cells compared with control pre-B cells (Fig. 3 C). However, after 4 h of IL-4 treatment, the activated Stat6 level is significantly increased in me/me pre-B cells over that of the control cells (Fig. 3 C). These results further confirm that Shp-1 is involved in the down-regulation of IL-4 signaling but suggest that an additional PTP activity is also involved in the negative regulation of IL-4- and IL-13-dependent Jak-Stat signaling. To determine whether Shp-1 expression regulates the transcription of IL-4/IL-13-responsive genes, an IL-4/IL-13-responsive luciferase reporter construct TPU474 (29Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and a Shp-1 expression plasmid (27Yang W. Tabrizi M. Berrada K. Yi T. Blood. 1998; 91: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cotransfected into NIH 3T3 cells. IL-4 treatment (20 ng/ml for 15 h) resulted in more than an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity in the absence of exogenous Shp-1 expression (Fig.4). On cotransfection with the Shp-1-expression plasmid, the TPU474-derived IL-4-dependent as well as IL-4-independent (basal) luciferase activity was ablated in these cells (Fig. 4). These results clearly indicate that Shp-1 overexpression can down-regulate the transcription of IL-4/IL-13 responsive genes. Taken together, our results show for the first time that Shp-1 is a negative regulator of IL-4/IL-13-responsive gene expression through the down-regulation of cytokine-activated levels of phospho-Stat6 molecules. In general, cytokine signals are limited in both magnitude and duration. Tyrosine dephosphorylation of signaling proteins has been recognized as a key mechanism underlying the negative regulation of cytokine signaling. Based on our previous findings that the IFN-γ-dependent Jak-Stat signaling is differentially inhibited by two different groups of PTP inhibitors, we have postulated that at least two PTP activities are involved in the negative regulation of the Jak-Stat signaling (17Haque S.J.

The activated Jaks and cytokine receptors are proposed to be inactivated by an upstream phosphatase PTP-x, whereas PTP-y dephosphorylates activated Stats (possibly in the nucleus). Using the IL-4/IL-13 system as a paradigm, we have recently shown that PTP-x not only down-regulates cytokine-induced signals, but inhibits spontaneous (constitutive) activation of the Jak-Stat pathway that results from the basal kinase activity of the cytokine receptor-associated Jak molecules (18Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The PTPs that regulate either IFN-γ- or IL-4-dependent Jak-Stat signaling have remained unknown. The SH2 domain-containing PTPs are plausible candidates for PTP-x, and two mammalian SH2 domain-containing PTPs, Shp-1 and Shp-2, have been identified (24Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Shp-2 binds to IRS-1 and IRS-2 through an SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interaction (2, 3, 14, and 15). Activated IL-4Rα recruits IRS proteins and activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, leading to proliferation of responsive cells (2Keegan A.D. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E.

Shp-2 is expressed in all cell types and is implicated in the positive regulation of cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases, including the receptors for insulin, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, where it primarily functions as an adapter protein (2Keegan A.D.

Using cells overexpressing, underexpressing, or deficient in Shp-1 activity, we have demonstrated herein that IL-4-dependent Stat6 activation and subsequent activation of IL-4-responsive gene expression are down-regulated by Shp-1 in different cell types. A question that remains to be addressed is whether Shp-1 functions as PTP-x or PTP-y in the previous model (17Haque S.J. Flati V. Deb A. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25709-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that a gain-of-function point mutation in IL-4Rα (glutamine 576 to arginine) leads to an enhanced IL-4 signaling in human cells (35Harshey G.K.K. Friedrich M.F. Esswein L.A. Thomas M.L. Chatila T.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). A phosphopeptide derived from the mutant IL-4Rα (encompassing the point mutation) has reduced binding affinity for Shp-1 compared with the wild-type peptide as determined in an in vitrobinding assay (35Harshey G.K.K. Friedrich M.F. Esswein L.A. Thomas M.L. Chatila T.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Shp-1 may associate with the IL-4Rα and function as PTP-x in IL-4/IL-13 signaling cascade. However, Shp-1 deficiency in cells does not result in the constitutive activation of IL-4 receptor complex (Fig. 3). Therefore, Shp-1 is unlikely to associate constitutively with IL-4 receptor complex and inhibit the basal kinase activity of associated Jak. This suggests that another PTP also functions as PTP-x in the IL-4/IL-13 system (17Haque S.J. Flati V. Deb A. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol.

Although we have provided compelling evidence that Shp-1 is a negative regulator of IL-4/IL-13-dependent Jak-Stat signaling, an identification of Shp-1 substrate(s) in this signaling cascade is necessary to understand mechanisms underlying Shp-1-mediated down-regulation of IL-4/IL-13-dependent gene expression in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells.

NKRs are characterized by the existence of inhibitory and activating isoforms, which are encoded by highly homologous but separate genes present in the same locus. Inhibitory isoforms express an intracytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif, whereas activating isoforms lack any immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif but harbor a charged amino acid residue in their transmembrane domain.

Although NK1 cells have been initially defined as non-MHC restricted large granular lymphocytes (1Trinchieri G. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 47: 187-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar), they have now been revealed as controlled in their effector function (i.e. cytotoxicity and cytokine production) by MHC class I molecules expressed at the surface of target cells (2Höglund P.

Multigenic and multiallelic families of NK cell surface receptors for classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules have been identified in human and mouse. Human NK receptors belong to two structurally distinct groups: the immunoglobulin superfamily for the killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs), and the C-type lectins for the CD94/NKG2 heterodimers (3Moretta A. Moretta L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 5Long E.O.

NK receptors are members of the ITIM-bearing receptor family and recruit upon engagement with their cognate ligands, the intracytoplasmic SH2 tandem protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, which terminate NK cell activation programs (6Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Isoforms of NK receptors have been described that do not express intracytoplasmic ITIM and propagate activating rather than inhibitory signals (7Biassoni R. Cantoni C. Falco M. Verdiani S. Bottino C.

In this report, we identified and analyzed the structure and the function of a novel ITAM-bearing molecule, KARAP, which selectively associates with activating isoforms of KIRs, referred as to killer cell activating receptor (KARs). In contrast to KARs that are restricted to NK and T cell subsets, the KARAP transcription pattern revealed its expression on a wide variety of cell types including nonhematopoietic cells, such as neurons. Originally identified in lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells (11Malissen B. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar), ITAM-bearing molecules are therefore more broadly distributed, because, in addition to the wide spectrum of KARAP expression, members of this family can also be encoded by viral genes or involved in platelet activation (13Beaufils P.

The “select_hits” program has been developed to extract all potential KARAP sequences in a fully automatic manner, from sequence data bases. This program has been written in C (ANSI) and FORTRAN 77 and processes a data base in four consecutive steps: step 1, for DNA data base, translation of entries in all reading frames and selection of only potential peptides 50–200 amino acids in length; step 2, selection of entries with a predicted ITAM site (Y-X-X-[IL]-X(6,8)-Y-X-X-[IL]); step 3, on this subset, selection of entries with a predicted transmembrane region, as described (15Rao J.K.M. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar); these regions must contain more than 12 amino acids; and step 4, selection of entries with charged amino acids in the transmembrane region (Asp, Glu, Arg, or Lys), a cysteine residue between the transmembrane region and the N terminus, and the ITAM between the transmembrane region and the C terminus. RBL-2H3 cell transfectants expressing p50.2 KAR, i.e. KIR2DS2 (RBL-KAR: RTIIB.p50 cells), have been previously described (16Bléry M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R.

Wild type mouse KARAP and human DAP-12 cDNAs were cloned in pNT-neo using PCR and cDNAs prepared from mouse spleen and human NK cell clone total RNA, respectively (17Fleischer B. Necker A. Leget C. Malissen B. Romagné F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 987-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable mouse KARAP and human DAP-12 transfectants of RBL-KAR cells were established by electroporation and culture in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml); representative clones were selected for further investigation. Point mutation constructs were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis of the mouse KARAP and human DAP-12 constructs. Each point mutation involved a tyrosine replacement by phenylalanine. Fidelity of the constructs was verified by sequencing. Cells were resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated for 5 min in the presence or absence of pervanadate (500 μm) prepared as described (18Le Dréan E. Vély F. Olcese L. Cambiaggi A. Guia S. Krystal G. Gervois N. Moretta A.

After removing insoluble material by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h using indicated mAbs coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were then combined with reducing sample buffer (New England Biolabs) and boiled prior to fractionation on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (18Le Dréan E. Vély F. Olcese L. Cambiaggi A. Guia S.

RBL cell serotonin release assays were performed as described previously (16Bléry M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Chavrier P. Moretta A. Daëron M. Vivier E.

Malissen (Centre d'Immunologie INSERM/CNRS de Marseille-Luminy (CIML)); this genomic DNA was extracted from E14 clone of embryonic stem cells derived from 129/Ola substrain. The screening of the library was performed as described previously by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Mouse DC27.1 T cell hybridoma and mouse BWδ thymoma cell lines were gifts of B. Malissen (CIML); the mouse T cell line 2M2 (gift of J.-P. Kinet, Harvard, Boston, MA), IIA1.6 B cell line, and P815 mastocytoma have been previously described (20Gabert J. Langlet C. Zamoyska R. Parnes J.R. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Malissen B.

Mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, T end (endothelial cell line), 3.19 (perivasal cell line), and 1D (thymic epithelial cell line) were provided by P. Naquet (CIML). The mouse fibroblast cell line LTK was a gift of M. D. Cooper and H. Kubagawa (Birmingham, AL). Mouse cell lines N2A (neuroblastoma) and AZT20 (derived from a pituitary axis tumor) were provided by G. Rougon (IBDM, Marseille, France). Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were used for cDNA conversion in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR were performed in a 50-μl total volume with 5 μl of cDNA template. Primer used were as follows: KARAP forward (5′-GGCTCTGGAGCCCTCCTGGTGC-3′) and KARAP reverse (5′-CTGTGTGTTGAGGTCACTGTA-3′). PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 26 cycles. β-Actin was used as a template control with the following primers: β-actin forward (5′-TACCACTGGCATCGTGATGGACT-3′) and β-actin reverse (5′-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGCGGCAAT-3′). DNA was subsequently denatured in a NaOH 0.4% solution and transferred under alkaline conditions onto a Hybond N+ membrane. This membrane was hybridized with mouse KARAP cDNA, previously labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and then revealed by autoradiography. For β-actin, a mouse β-actin PCR product was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as probe. Metaphase spreads were prepared from a WMP male mouse, in which all autosomes except chromosome 19 were in the form of metacentric Robertsonian translocations. Concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes were cultured at 37 °C for 72 h with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (60 μg/ml) added to the final 6 h of culture. The KARAP λ phage was biotinylated by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP according to manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization to chromosome spreads was performed with standard protocols (22Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar). The biotin-labeled DNA was mixed with hybridization solution at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and used at 150 ng per slide. Before hybridization, the labeled probe was annealed for 45 min at 37 °C with a 150-fold excess amount of murine Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) to compete with nonspecific repetitive sequences. The hybridized probe was detected by means of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories). Chromosomes were counterstained and R-banded with propidium iodide diluted in anti-fade solution at pH 11.0. We previously identified KARAP as a 12-kDa polypeptide that selectively associates with KARs (23Olcese L. Cambiaggi A. Semenzato G. Bottino C. Moretta A. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5083-5086PubMed Google Scholar). Several biochemical observations revealed that KARAP shares striking similarities with members of the ITAM-bearing polypeptide family. First, KARAP is expressed as disulfide-linked dimer. Second, KARAP associates with KARs, which contain a charged amino acid residue in their transmembrane portion, similarly to ITAM-bearing polypeptides and their associated receptors (e.g. TCR, BCR, FcεRI, and FcγRs) (24Cosson P. Lankford S. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Third, KARAP co-precipitates with a protein-tyrosine kinase activity and is tyrosine-phosphorylated, a critical signaling feature shared with ITAM-bearing polypeptides. We reasoned that these biochemical characteristics would enable us to elaborate a bio-informatic strategy in an attempt to identify the KARAP cDNA. The “select_hits” program was then generated as indicated under “Materials and Methods” and applied on ESTs. As reported in TableI, 467 potential candidates were detected. Among these hits, 131 were discarded because they present significant similarity with protein sequences of known function. On the subset of 336 hits with unknown function, we subsequently searched for the most similar entries with the CD3ζ and FcεRIγ polypeptides by using the FASTA program set on default parameters (25Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). The most similar entry to CD3ζ and FcεRIγ was the mouse EST AA734769. Table I indicates that four other ESTs were found to share high pairwise similarities (at least 96% identity) with AA734769. PCR primers were generated to obtain the full-length coding sequence corresponding to AA734769 from mouse spleen RNA. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to this PCR product revealed a 342-bp open reading frame (Fig. 1). The predicted amino acid analysis indicated the features of a type I transmembrane protein, including a 27-amino acid leader peptide (Met−27to Ala−1), a 16-amino acid extracytoplasmic domain (Gln1 to Gly16), a 24-amino acid transmembrane domain (Val17 to Gly40), and a 47-amino acid long intracytoplasmic domain (Arg41 to Arg87). Consistent with our bio-informatic search strategy, the predicted mouse KARAP is a 9.6-kDa molecular mass mature polypeptide that contains N-terminal cysteine residues, a charged transmembrane amino acid (Asp25), and a typical ITAM based on Tyr65 and Tyr76: Y65QELQGQRPEVY76SDLN. Computer-based sequence alignment revealed a 73% amino acid identity of the AA734769 predicted protein with the recently described human DAP-12 ITAM polypeptide, which was found to associate with KARs (KIR2DS2) in transfected cells (26Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum (KP1) was raised against an amino acid stretch present in human DAP-12 intracytoplasmic domain (I57TETESPYQELQGQRSDVYSDLNTQR81), which is highly homologous to that present in AA734769(I57AETESPYQELQGQRPEVYSDLNTQR81). Immunoblotting of anti-KAR immunoprecipitates prepared from human interleukin-2 activated NK cells revealed a 12-kDa band reactive with KP1 antibodies (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that DAP-12 corresponds to human KARAP and that AA734769 corresponds to mouse KARAP.Table IBio-informatics search resultsNumber of entriesESTEST data bases1,389,619Step 1: Translation2,855,509Step 2: ITAM9,333Step 3: Transmembrane region3,608Step 4: Charged amino acid and cysteine467Unknown function336Most similar to CD3ζ and FcεRIγ5AA734769W88159W41142AA098506AA242315 Open table in a new tab We originally reported that the stable transfection of RBL cells with KAR cDNAs (i.e. KIR2DS2) leads to cell surface expression of a nonfunctional KAR molecule (16Bléry M.

RBL-KAR transfectant cell lines were then transfected with a set of cDNAs corresponding to wild type or mutant mouse KARAP (AA734769) and human DAP-12. RBL transfectants coated with mouse anti-KIR2DS2 mAb or mouse IgE as a positive control were stimulated by the addition of goat anti-mouse antisera in a standard serotonin release assay. As shown in Fig.2 A, both wild type mouse KARAP (mKARAP) and human DAP-12 (hDAP-12) reconstituted the activating property of KAR in RBL transfectants. Consistent with these results, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots performed on anti-KAR immunoprecipitates prepared from RBL-KAR + mKARAP transfectants revealed that mKARAP co-precipitates with KAR as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein upon pervanadate stimulation (Fig.2 B), as well as upon KAR engagement (data not shown). In contrast, single Tyr → Phe point mutants of mouse KARAP, mKARAP Y65F and mKARAP Y76F, as well as of human DAP-12, hDAP-12 Y75F, are unable to couple KAR engagement to the signaling machinery that drives RBL serotonin release (Fig. 2 A). In parallel, no phosphorylation of mKARAP Y65F (Fig. 2 B), mKARAP Y76F, or hDAP-12 Y75F (data not shown) could be detected in anti-KAR immunoprecipitates prepared from RBL transfectants upon pervanadate stimulation. Of interest, a 50–60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was repetitively observed to selectively co-precipitate with mKARAP Y65F, mKARAP Y76F, or hDAP-12 Y75F but not with wild type mKARAP or hDAP-12 (data not shown). Southern blot analysis revealed that mouse KARAPis a single gene, as is its human DAP-12 ortholog (data not shown). An 18-kilobase mouse KARAP genomic clone was isolated by screening a 129 mouse λ phage library with mouse KARAP cDNA. This KARAP phage served as a probe for determining the chromosomal localization of the mouse KARAP gene using fluorescencein situ hybridization. A total of 50 metaphase cells were analyzed, and 90% of them showed specific fluorescent signal in the B band of murine chromosome 7. These results are consistent with the localization of human DAP-12 to chromosome 19q13, a region syntenic to mouse chromosome 7. The structure of the mouseKARAP gene was then determined by generating a set of primers spanning the corresponding cDNA sequence (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, the mouse KARAP gene spans 3.56 kilobases (from the start methionine residue to the stop codon) and is divided into 5 exons of varying length. The leader sequence is encoded by exon 1 and exon 2, the latter being a mini-exon of only 28 bp. Similar features have been observed in KIR genes, as well as inFcR genes, irrelevant of their presence on chromosome 19, such as FcαR, or on chromosome 1, such asFcεRIa and FcγRs (27Wilson M.J. Torkar M. Trowsdale J. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The first two amino acids of the extracytoplasmic domain are also encoded by exon 2. The rest of the extracytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain as well as the first eleven amino acids of the intracytoplasmic domain are encoded by exon 3. As a typical ITAM-bearing molecule, KARAPgene harbors two exons, exon 4 and 5, which encode the ITAM and are separated by a type 0 intron (11Malissen B. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All intron/exon boundaries for theKARAP gene have classical donor/acceptor motifs GT-AG except for intron 1, which appears to harbor a TA donor site (Fig.3 A). ITAM-bearing molecules have been documented only within the hematopoietic compartment. In contrast, reverse transcription-PCR analysis of KARAP transcription in a variety of cell lines revealed that KARAP transcripts can be detected not only in NK cells (not shown) or in T and B lymphocytes but also in mast, endothelial, and epithelial cell lines as well as in neuronal cells lines (Fig. 4). A feature of the ITIM-bearing molecules such as KIRs is the existence of activating counterparts devoid of intracytoplasmic ITIMs and characterized by the presence of a charged amino acid residue in their transmembrane domain (28Vély F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that the activating isoforms of KIRs associate with KARAPs, which function as transducing polypeptides coupling the engagement of KAR to the signaling machinery leading to RBL degranulation. The model of KAR reconstitution in RBL cells is directly relevant to the activation of lymphocyte-mediated cell cytotoxicity by KARs, because NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes express intracytoplasmic granules that undergo regulated exocytosis upon interaction with target cells. Our molecular cloning strategy also revealed that mouse KARAP is the ortholog of human DAP-12 and is highly similar to the AA242315 mouse EST, which was identified during the course of our studies (26Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). We will thus refer to KARAP/DAP-12 for both human and mouse polypeptides hereafter. KARAP/DAP-12 is a canonical ITAM-bearing polypeptide closer to CD3ζ and FcεRIγ than to any other ITAM-bearing molecule. CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3ε, Igα, and Igβ polypeptides harbor an Ig-like extracytoplasmic domain, whereas FcεRIβ spans four times the membrane. In contrast KARAP/DAP-12 as well as CD3ζ and FcεRIγ are single transmembrane pass polypeptides that express a very short extracytoplasmic domain (5 amino acids for FcεRIγ, 9 amino acids for CD3ζ, and 16 amino acids for mouse KARAP/DAP-12), suggesting the absence of a specific extracytoplasmic ligand. CD3ζ andFcεRIγ are both present on mouse and human chromosome 1, whereas KARAP/DAP-12 are present on mouse chromosome 7 and human chromosome 19. It is thus tempting to speculate that genes encoding for ITAM-bearing molecules and their associated receptors might have originally evolved from the same locus, asFcγRs, FcεRIα, and FcεRIγ as well as KARAP/DAP-12 and KARs are respectively present in a close chromosomal vicinity. CD3ζ, FcεRIγ, and other ITAM-bearing polypeptides have been shown to be involved both in the assembly and in the transducing properties of oligomeric complexes (11Malissen B. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cell surface expression of KARs appears independent of KARAP/DAP-12 association in stable transfectants of RBL and Ba/F3 cell lines (16Bléry M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Chavrier P. Moretta A. Daëron M. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8989-8996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). However, KARAP/DAP-12 also form noncovalent complexes with various activating counterparts of ITIM-bearing molecules, such as the lectin-like MHC class I receptors, NKG2C/CD94 heterodimers in human as well as Ly-49H and Ly-49D homodimers in the mouse (29Mason L.H. Willette-Brown J. Anderson S.K. Gosselin P. Shores E.W. Love P.E. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4148-4151PubMed Google Scholar, 30Smith K.M. Wu J. Bakker A.B.H. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 7-10PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lanier L.L. Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The cell surface expression of these lectin-like receptors requires association with KARAP/DAP-12 for efficient cell surface expression (30Smith K.M. Wu J. Bakker A.B.H. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 7-10PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lanier L.L. Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). It thus appears that KARAP/DAP-12 is required for the stable cell surface expression of lectin-like dimers, in contrast to Ig-like molecules. The expression of KARAP/DAP-12 in CD3ζ-deficient T cell lines, BWδ and 2M2, reveals that KARAP/DAP-12 cannot substitute for CD3ζ or FcεRIγ for the assembly of the TCR complex, because KARAP/DAP-12 association with the TCR components would have restored its cell surface expression (21Paolini R. Renard V. Vivier E. Ochiai K. Jouvin M.-H. Malissen B. Kinet J.-P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, the absence of KAR function in RBL-KAR transfectants as well as analysis of anti-KAR immunoprecipitates have shown that despite its transmembrane charged amino acid residue, KAR cannot associate with FcεRIγ in RBL cells (16Bléry M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Chavrier P. Moretta A. Daëron M. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8989-8996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, the selective interaction between KARAP/DAP-12 and its associated receptors occurs through the interaction between charged transmembrane amino acid residues (26Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 29Mason L.H. Willette-Brown J. Anderson S.K. Gosselin P. Shores E.W. Love P.E. Ortaldo J.R.

Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) but is ensured by specific amino acid interaction motifs yet to be determined. Similarly to other ITAM-bearing polypeptides, the integrity of KARAP/DAP-12 ITAM is mandatory to its transducing properties (32Donnadieu E. Trautmann A. Malissen M. Trucy J. Malissen B. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32828-32834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as judged by receptor-induced RBL serotonin assays (Fig. 2 A). The SH2-containing protein-tyrosine kinases ZAP-70 and Syk are the only effector molecules that associate in vivo with the phosphorylated form of ITAM-bearing molecules (33Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The requirement of both tyrosines residues for complete KARAP/DAP-12 transducing function is consistent with the structure of ZAP-70 tandem SH2 domains, which dictates the simultaneous recruitment of both ITAM phosphotyrosines to a ZAP-70 SH2 tandem (34Hatada M.H Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 35Vély F. Nunès J.A. Malissen B. Hedgecock C.J.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3010-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The recently reported in vitroassociation between KARAP/DAP-12 phosphorylated peptides and ZAP-70/Syk is consistent with our in vivo point mutation analysis (26Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). More surprisingly, no in vivo phosphorylation of KARAP/DAP-12 can be detected when a single KARAP/DAP-12 tyrosine is mutated (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, analysis of Y-F Igβ single point mutants has revealed that Igβ tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on the presence of both Igβ ITAM tyrosines (36Pao L.I. Famiglieti S.J. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3305-3314PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that for some ITAM-bearing molecules, such as KARAP/DAP-12 and Igβ, the phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosine residues is a sequential process. In this model, upon engagement of the receptor, a SH2-bearing protein-tyrosine kinase (e.g. Lck, Fyn, and Lyn) phosphorylates a first ITAM tyrosine, which in turn interacts with the protein-tyrosine kinase through its SH2 domains, allowing the efficient phosphorylation of the second ITAM tyrosine residue. Such a mechanism is consistent with the analysis of the interaction between Lck and CD3ζ (37Koyasu S. Tse A.G.D. Moingeon P. Hussey R.E. Mildonian A. Hannisian J. Clayton L.K. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Lewis L.A. Chung C.D. Chen J.-Y. Parnes J.R. Moran M. Patel V.P. Miceli M.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2292-2300PubMed Google Scholar), as well as between the SH2-bearing protein-tyrosine kinase Hck and phosphorylated peptides (39Pellicena P. Stowell K.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A major contrast between KARAP/DAP-12 and all other ITAM-bearing polypeptides is the almost ubiquitous expression of KARAP, as judged by its transcription pattern (Fig. 4). KARAP/DAP-12 is the first ITAM-bearing polypeptide to be expressed outside of the hematopoietic compartment. The ubiquitous distribution of ITIM-bearing molecules and their activating counterparts is therefore consistent with the association of KARAP/DAP-12 with a variety of activating isoforms of ITIM-bearing molecules. In particular, the co-expression of SIRP-β molecules and KARAP/DAP-12 in the brain is suggestive of their association (40Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). However, the distribution of ZAP-70 and Syk has been reported to be restricted to the hematopoietic compartment (33Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore effector/adaptor molecules distinct from ZAP-70 and Syk might associate with phosphorylated KARAP/DAP-12 ITAMs. Along this line, thein vivo association of mouse and human KARAP/DAP-12 Y-F point mutants with a 50–60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (data not shown) suggests that mono-phosphorylated KARAP/DAP-12 ITAM might be involved in the transduction pathways engaged by KARAP/DAP-12-associated receptors. In this regard, a single Tyr → Phe point mutation of Igα ITAM C-terminal tyrosine can support the propagation of partial signals including p62 tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced calcium mobilization (36Pao L.I. Famiglieti S.J. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3305-3314PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that upon engagement of receptors associated with ITAM-bearing polypeptides (i.e. not only activating isoforms of ITIM-bearing polypeptides such as KARs, SIRP-β, PIR-A, ILT-1, NKG2C/CD94, Ly-49D, and Ly-49H molecules but also TCR, BCR, FcεRI, and FcγRIII complexes), mono-phosphorylated form of ITAM-bearing molecules can support the propagation of a partial activation sequence (37Koyasu S. Tse A.G.D. Moingeon P. Hussey R.E. Mildonian A. Hannisian J. Clayton L.K. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The extent of ITAM phosphorylation might integrate the “strength” of receptor engagement, which is a reflection of the receptor-ligand affinity (36Pao L.I. Famiglieti S.J. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3305-3314PubMed Google Scholar). Because physiological ligands of KARAP/DAP-12-associated receptors are still not fully characterized, the implications of KARAP/DAP-12 phosphorylation patterns remain to be unveiled.

Recently, we discovered that Bcl2 is phosphorylated at an evolutionarily conserved serine residue (Ser70) after treatment with the survival agonists IL-3 or bryostatin 1, a potent activator of protein kinase (Ito, T., Deng, X., Carr, B., and May, W. S. (1997)J. Biol. Chem.272, 11671–11673). In addition, an intact Ser70 was found to be required for Bcl2's ability to suppress apoptosis after IL-3 withdrawal or toxic chemotherapy. We now show that phosphorylation of Bcl2 occurs rapidly after the addition of agonist to IL-3-deprived cells and can be reversed by the action of an okadaic acid (OA)-sensitive phosphatase. A role for protein phosphatase (PP) 2A as the Bcl2 regulatory phosphatase is supported by several observations: 1) dephosphorylation of Bcl2 is blocked by OA, a potent PP1 and PP2A inhibitor; 2) intracellular PP2A, but not PP1, co-localizes with Bcl2; 3) the purified PP2Ac catalytic subunit directly dephosphorylates Bcl2 in vitro in an OA-sensitive manner; 4) the purified PP2Ac catalytic subunit preferentially dephosphorylates Bcl2 in vitro compared with PP1 and PP2B; 5) reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies indicate a direct interaction between PP2A and hemagglutinin (HA)-Bcl2; and 6) treatment of factor-deprived cells with bryostatin 1 dramatically increases the association between PP2A and Bcl2. Increased association between Bcl2 and PP2A occurs 15 min after agonist stimulation when Bcl2 phosphorylation has peaked and immediately before dephosphorylation. An agonist-induced increased association of PP2A and Bcl2 fails to occur in cells expressing the inactive, phosphorylation-negative S70A Bcl2 mutant, which indicates that an intact Ser70 site is necessary and sufficient for the interaction to occur. Functional phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 is proposed to be a dynamic process regulated by the sequential action of an agonist-activated Bcl2 kinase and PP2A. Interleukin 3 (IL-3) stimulates the net growth of murine factor-dependent NSF/N1.H7 and FDC-P1/ER myeloid cells by stimulating proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. Recently, we discovered that Bcl2 is phosphorylated at an evolutionarily conserved serine residue (Ser70) after treatment with the survival agonists IL-3 or bryostatin 1, a potent activator of protein kinase (Ito, T., Deng, X., Carr, B., and May, W.

Multipotential hematopoietic growth factors such as interleukin 3 (IL-3)1 mediate net cell growth by stimulating proliferation and suppressing apoptosis (1Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Taylor D.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Many of the molecular details concerning the mechanisms regulating signaling components necessary for cell proliferation have been determined. For example, the activation of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as the Janus-activated kinases and the coupling to signals generated by cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription and/or the RAS/RAF-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade have been demonstrated (2Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). However, relatively little is known about the signaling mechanism(s) involved in factor-induced suppression of apoptosis. The proto-oncogene Bcl2 is the prototype member of a critical new gene family that functions to suppress apoptosis in a variety of cell systems including factor-dependent lymphohematopoietic and neural cells (3Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams T.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar, 4Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Bcl2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, current evidence indicates that expression in the outer mitochondrial membrane is required for its potent antiapoptosis function (5Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Need J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). A compelling model predicts that Bcl2 functions by preventing the release of potent mitochondrial activators of the cytosolic death effector caspases that mediate the intracellular proteolysis that is characteristic of apoptosis (6Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the apoptosis-suppressing activity of Bcl2 (7Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). Bcl2 can heterodimerize with a proapoptotic binding partner, BAX, to neutralize its death effector properties. The binding of Bcl2 to the mitochondrial apoptosis-activating factor (Apaf-1) and/or the blockade of cytochrome C release from the mitochondria may prevent the activation of the two death proteases, caspases 9 and 3 (8Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmed M. Alnermi E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6259) Google Scholar, 9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Lin A. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Bcl2 also acts by modulating/slowing the collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential that occurs during apoptosis (6Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar), apparently by inhibiting the transition in mitochondrial membrane permeability (10Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Whereas any one or a combination of these potential functions of Bcl2 may operate to suppress apoptosis, the mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 may be regulated to preserve mitochondrial integrity has not been identified. Recently, we discovered that Bcl2 is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved serine site (serine 70), and that IL-3 induces and increases phosphorylation at this site (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Similar results have also been reported for nerve growth factor-induced phosphorylation of Bcl2, which is associated with the suppression of apoptosis in rat PC12W pheochromocytoma cells (13Horiuchi M. Hayashida W. Kambe T. Yamada T. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19022-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutational analysis of Bcl2 revealed that an intact serine 70 is required for phosphorylation as well as maximal and potent suppression of apoptosis (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation represents at least one important post-receptor signaling mechanism that may positively regulate the antiapoptotic function of Bcl2, at least in factor-dependent cells. However, others have reported an inability to easily detect Bcl2 phosphorylation under continuous growth conditions (14Gajewski T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for a Bcl2 phosphatase in reversing phosphorylation. Reversible phosphorylation is a well-understood mechanism for the rapid regulation of critical cell functions including metabolism, signal transduction, cell division, growth, and memory (15Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Mumby M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specifically, IL-3 signaling is a dynamic process that results in signal amplification characterized by the rapid phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of critical post-receptor components such as Janus-activated kinase 2, RAF1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (2Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Whereas protein kinase C (PKC), an IL-3 activated post-receptor kinase (2Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), can directly phosphorylate Bcl2 in vitro and possibly in vivo (1Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Spooncer E.

Studies were designed to test whether a protein phosphatase is involved in regulating Bcl2 phosphorylation in IL-3-dependent cells and to identify the mechanism(s) involved in regulating Bcl2 dephosphorylation. Bcl2 and BAX antisera were produced, characterized, and used as described previously (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol.

For PP2Ac, Bcl2, or HA epitope-tagged Bcl2, co-immunoprecipitation analysis and immunoprecipitations were performed on cell lysates in 0.25% instead of 1.0% Nonidet P-40 detergent buffer.

Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and incubated with 100 nm bryostatin 1 for 15 min.32P-labeled Bcl2 was immunoprecipitated as described above, and the beads were washed three times in detergent buffer and suspended in 100 μl of phosphatase buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (for PP1 and PP2A) or 50 mm Tris-HC1, pH 7.0, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1.0 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm calmodulin (for PP2B). Purified PP2Ac or 2 units each of commercial PP1, PP2A, or PP2B (Calbiochem) were added, and the samples were incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C as described previously (21Gong C.X.

The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-sample buffer, and the sample was boiled for 5 min before loading onto SDS-PAGE as described above. The activity of PP2A, PP1, and PP2B was verified by the serine/threonine phosphatase assay kit, following the recommended protocol (Promega). Subcellular localization of Bcl2 and PP2A was performed essentially as described previously (23Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were swelled in ice-cold hypotonic Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min, sheared by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 200 × gto pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g to pellet the heavy membrane fraction that contains the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet the light membrane fraction that contains the plasma membranes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The resulting supernatant contains the cytosolic fractions. The nuclei were further purified by centrifugation over a 2 m sucrose cushion as described previously (24Fields A.P. Pincus S.M. Kraft A.S. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21896-21901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty μg of total protein from each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. IL-3 and Bryo may inhibit apoptosis in IL-3-dependent myeloid NSF/N1.H7 and FDC-P1/ER cells by inducing the serine phosphorylation of Bcl2 (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism(s) of regulation of Bcl2 phosphorylation and whether a Bcl2 protein phosphatase might also be involved. Therefore, studies were performed to determine the kinetics and stability of Bcl2 phosphorylation after agonist addition to factor-deprived cells. The cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and stimulated for various times with a saturating concentration of IL-3 (1 μg/ml) or Bryo (100 nm) agonists to induce the survival signal(s) (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment, the cells were washed and lysed in detergent, and32P-labeled Bcl2 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described previously (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Both IL-3 and Bryo induce the phosphorylation of Bcl2, which becomes maximal by 15 or 30 min in NSF/N1.H7 or FDC-P1/ER cells, respectively (Fig.1). Interestingly, however, IL-3- or Bryo-induced hyperphosphorylation was found to be rapidly modulated, returning to a lower, steady-state baseline level by 60 min. Because the level of expression of Bcl2 does not vary significantly during agonist treatment, the transient nature of phosphorylation is concluded to result from the sequential action of a Bcl2 kinase and phosphatase. To assess whether the ubiquitously expressed PP1 and/or PP2A protein serine/threonine phosphatases may be involved, the cells were treated with okadaic acid (OA), a potent PP1 and PP2A inhibitor. After treatment for 120 min in the presence of IL-3, OA had completely prevented the dephosphorylation of Bcl2 as described above and resulted in a prolonged hyperphosphorylation of Bcl2 (Fig. 1 a). However, the hyperphosphorylation observed was temporally delayed compared with that seen after agonist addition (Fig. 1 b). Interestingly, both Bryo- and OA-induced Bcl2 hyperphosphorylation occurred at ser70 because S70A Bcl2 was unable to be phosphorylated (Fig. 2 a). Comparative tryptic peptide maps from Bryo- or OA-stimulated phosphorylation confirmed that the site was identical (Fig.2 b). These findings suggest that an IL-3-independent kinase may have been unmasked by the treatment with OA. Alternatively, OA, presumably by inhibiting a phosphatase, might indirectly activate a Bcl2 kinase. PP2A is the most abundant serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase expressed in mammalian cells (25Kremmer E. Ohst K. Kiefer J. Brewis N. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PP2A enzymatic activity is reported to be more potently inhibited by OA than by PP1, exhibiting an IC50 of 1 nm compared with an IC50of 10–15 nm for PP1 (26Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 27Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and PP2Ac can dephosphorylate Bcl2 in vitro in an OA-sensitive manner (Fig. 3 a). It has been shown in some cell types that even relatively high concentrations of OA can cause a selective inhibition of PP2A with little or no effect on PP1 (28Favre B. Turowski P. Hemings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Because a relatively low concentration of OA (5 nm) was used in the experiments, the results are consistent with but do not prove a primary role for PP2A or a PP2A-like phosphatase in dephosphorylating Bcl2 in intact myeloid cells. Therefore, additional studies were performed to determine which purified protein phosphatase could directly and most efficiently dephosphorylate Bcl2 in vitro. 32P-labeled Bcl2 was again used as a substrate for the commercial phosphatases tested. 2 units each of PP1, PP2A, or PP2B were added for the times indicated. Results reveal that only purified PP2A could more rapidly and completely dephosphorylate32P-labeled Bcl2 (Fig. 3 b, compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 6–9 and lanes 10–13). The findings indicate that PP2A is more efficient than either PP1 or PP2B and indicate that phosphorylated Bcl2 is a potential physiologic substrate for PP2A. Bcl2 is an integral membrane protein located mainly on the outer mitochondrial membrane (6Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 29Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar), ER, and nuclear membrane (30Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because a suppression of apoptosis by Bcl2 is thought to require mitochondrial localization (31Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 32Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Minotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), we reasoned that a physiologic Bcl2 phosphatase may co-localize with Bcl2. Therefore, subcellular fractionation studies were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results indicate that Bcl2 and the structural (A) and catalytic (C) subunits of the PP2A core complex (33Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) are co-localized in the heavy membrane fraction, which contains mitochondrial membranes, as well as in the ER and nuclear membrane fractions (Fig.4). By contrast, PP1 is not present in either the heavy or nuclear membrane fractions. Furthermore, whereas PP2B has been reported to be a Bcl2-interacting protein (34Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. Mckeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), this OA-insensitive protein phosphatase was found to be primarily localized in the cytoplasmic and ER fractions of IL-3-dependent cells, which contain very little Bcl2. Only very low levels of PP2B were associated with the mitochondrial membrane fraction (∼3% of total PP2B as determined by densitometry; Fig. 4) as previously reported (35Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar, 36Nagase T. Murakami T. Nozaki H. Inoue R. Nishito Y. Tanabe O. Usui H. Takeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings further support a role for PP2A as a physiologic Bcl2 phosphatase in vivo, at least in murine factor-dependent myeloid cells. Studies were performed to determine whether an OA-sensitive phosphatase may interact directly with Bcl2 to potentially bring about dephosphorylation after agonist addition. First, reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti-HA or anti-PP2A was performed. Parental NSF/N1.H7 IL-3-dependent cells that stably express HA-Bcl2 were produced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The HA-Bcl2-expressing cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and treated with Bryo for 30 min, a time at which Bcl2 phosphorylation is maximal (Fig. 1 b). After treatment, HA-Bcl2 or PP2Ac was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Results reveal that the HA antibody selectively immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled HA-Bcl2 (28 kDa) and a 35S-labeled 36-kDa band that was identified by Western analysis as the catalytic subunit of PP2A (Fig.5, lane 3). The same membrane filter was probed with BAX antisera (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to serve as a control, because BAX is known to heterodimerize with Bcl2 under detergent lysis conditions (Fig. 5, lane 3; Ref. 7Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BAX could only be co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, but not when the PP2A antisera was used, suggesting that the PP2A antibody may interrupt the Bcl2-BAX interaction under these conditions (Fig. 5,lane 2). Therefore, the finding that PP2Ac is co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl2 suggests a functional relationship. To confirm a specific interaction, native non-epitope-tagged p26 Bcl2 was labeled with 35S and tested. Results reveal that native Bcl2 was also co-immunoprecipitated by the PP2Ac antisera, confirming the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 5, lane 2). Second, a similar study was performed with cell lysates to test for an interaction between PP1 and Bcl2. Again, results indicate that HA-Bcl2 and PP2Ac, but not HA-Bcl2 and PP1, can be co-immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of growing cells (Fig.6, a and b). Because PP1 is expressed, as detected by the Western blotting of cell lysates (data not shown), these findings confirm that PP2A but apparently not PP1 may directly bind to Bcl2 and regulate phosphorylation. Interestingly, PP2A was also found to be associated with Bcl2, even after IL-3 deprivation for 2 h, although at significantly reduced levels. In this case, the addition of Bryo stimulated a rapid and dramatic increase in the association of Bcl2 and PP2A only after 15 min, a time by which Bcl2 phosphorylation has become maximal (Fig. 7). Because similar results were obtained for two different IL-3-dependent myeloid cell lines, these findings indicate that the Bcl2-PP2Ac interaction is not limited to a specific cell type (Fig. 7, a andb). This finding eliminates the possibility that the observed association results from an artifact of exogenous HA-Bcl2 expression.Figure 7Bryostatin treatment induces an increased association of PP2Ac with wt Bcl2 but not with S70A mutant Bcl2.FDC-P1/ER cells (a) expressing endogenous Bcl2 or NSF.N1/H.7 cells expressing either exogenous wt Bcl2 (b) or the loss of function S70A Bcl2 mutant protein (c) were deprived of IL-3 for 2 h, followed by the addition of bryostatin for various times up to 60 min. d, kinetics and quantitation of the association between PP2Ac and Bcl2, as determined by densitometry, are shown. Cells were lysed, and PP2Ac immunoprecipitates (α-PP2Ac IP) were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with antisera against PP2Ac or Bcl2 as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Increased PP2A association may functionally dephosphorylate Bcl2. Because agonist-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation occurs on Ser70 (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), a study was performed to assess whether an intact Ser70 phosphorylation site is required for the observed increase in Bcl2-PP2A association after agonist-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation. Cells stably expressing either endogenous wt (FDC-P1/ER) or recombinant wt (wt-Bcl H7) Bcl2 or the phosphorylation-negative S70A Bcl2 mutant (S70A-Bcl2-H7) were grown and deprived of IL-3 for 2 h, as described previously (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Bryostatin was added to induce Bcl2 phosphorylation, and any change in the interaction between Bcl2 and PP2A was assessed by immunoprecipitation after detergent lysis of the cells. Results indicate that both endogenous and recombinant wt Bcl2, but not the phosphorylation-negative S70A Bcl2 mutant, are able to support a time-dependent increase in association between Bcl2 and PP2Ac (Fig. 7). Increased association between Bcl2 and PP2A, however, does not occur until Bcl2 phosphorylation is maximal (i.e.15–30 min). Importantly, the increased association noted clearly precedes wt Bcl2 dephosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylated Ser70 may be required for any increase in functional association of PP2Ac and Bcl2. However, because the treatment of cells with OA to inhibit Bcl2 phosphatase activity does not interfere with agonist-induced association of Bcl2-PP2A (data not shown), these findings indicate that the increased association noted is independent of PP2Ac activity. We examined whether Bcl2 phosphorylation induced by IL-3 or the survival agonist bryostatin 1 is a static or dynamic process. Our findings indicate that Bcl2 phosphorylation is a dynamic process that can be regulated by the opposing actions of a Bcl2 kinase (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and a Bcl2 phosphatase (Figs. 1 and 5). Functionally, Bcl2 phosphorylation occurs rapidly (within 5 min) after the addition of IL-3 or bryostatin and becomes maximal by 15–30 min. Bcl2 then undergoes an appreciable but incomplete dephosphorylation to a lower steady-state level of phosphorylation by 60–120 min, which indicates the effect of a Bcl2 phosphatase. Previously, we determined that activated PKC can phosphorylate Bcl2 in vitro, and that the survival agonists IL-3, erythropoitin, or bryostatin 1 can induce phosphorylation at the identical Ser70 site, suggesting a functional role for PKC (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ruvolo P.R. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We have now discovered that reversible phosphorylation of Bcl2 may occur through the action of PP2A. Whereas agonist-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation is robust after 15 min, an even higher level of Bcl2 phosphorylation can be achieved (i.e. hyperphosphorylation) when the potent phosphatase inhibitor OA is added (Fig. 1, aand b), suggesting a role for an OA-sensitive phosphatase. Because PP2A but not PP1 is co-localized with Bcl2 in mitochondria where Bcl2 is known to function (Fig. 4; Refs. 31Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 32Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Minotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the level of Bcl2 phosphorylation may be directly regulated by the concerted action of a Bcl2 kinase(s) such as PKC and a targeted population of PP2A. Consistent with a direct role, PP2A but not PP1 or PP2B was found to be more efficient at dephosphorylating 32P-labeled Bcl2in vitro (Fig. 3 b). Furthermore, PP2A is stably associated with Bcl2, even when cells have been deprived of IL-3 for 2 h, a time by which no detectable Bcl2 phosphorylation is observed (Fig. 1 a, lane 0). Therefore, the persistent interaction between Bcl2 and PP2A observed under starvation conditions may account for the virtual absence of Bcl2 phosphorylation after IL-3 starvation. This would presumably render Bcl2 nonfunctional in its ability to potently suppress apoptosis (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and strongly suggests at least one mechanism by which factor withdrawal may facilitate apoptosis. However, once agonist is added, a rapid increase in Bcl2 phosphorylation is observed, which is followed by a compensatory increase in the association of Bcl2 and PP2A that requires phosphorylation on Ser70. This mechanism seems to function to regulate the level of agonist-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation and accounts for the lower but detectable steady-state level of phosphorylation observed under IL-3-replete growth conditions (Fig. 1). However, the toxic pharmacologic agent OA alone can induce stable hyperphosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 (Figs. 1 band 2). This suggests, at least in part, that dynamic agonist-stimulated Bcl2 phosphorylation may be important for cell survival, whereas OA-induced irreversible phosphorylation may interfere with Bcl2 function as suggested recently (37Halder S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 38Srivastava R.K. Srivastava A.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Nesterova M. Cho-Chung Y.S. Longo D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Presumably, a prolonged exposure of cells to OA would not only inhibit a Bcl2 phosphatase but would also inhibit other critical PP2A-regulated processes. This supports our earlier finding that Bcl2 phosphorylation, although required, is not sufficient for cell survival (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in support of a necessary role for the dynamic regulation of Bcl2 phosphorylation in survival, it has recently been found that nerve growth factor-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation can be reversed by angiotensin binding to rat PC12W pheochromocytoma cells that depend on nerve growth factor for survival (13Horiuchi M. Hayashida W. Kambe T. Yamada T. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19022-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Significantly, angiotensin was discovered to induce apoptosis even in the presence of nerve growth factor, apparently by activating a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP-1; Ref. 13Horiuchi M. Hayashida W. Kambe T. Yamada T. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19022-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that may also induce Bcl2 dephosphorylation either directly or indirectly. Collectively, these results confirm that reversing growth factor-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation and/or interfering with dynamic Bcl2 phosphorylation may have a negative effect on cell survival. The relative activity and/or access of a phosphatase will presumably determine the steady-state level of Bcl2 phosphorylation and function. Mechanistically, an intact Ser70 phosphorylation site, but not PP2Ac activity, seems to be required (Fig. 7). The enhanced interaction between PP2A and Bcl2 may result from either an increased availability of phosphorylated Ser70 or a potential conformational change in Bcl2 resulting from phosphorylation. Whatever the mechanism, the increased association between Bcl2 and PP2A may function to ensure the dynamic nature of Bcl2 phosphorylation and thereby maintain the appropriate physiological level of phosphorylation that is required under steady-state growth conditions. The results also suggest the potential involvement of an agonist-independent Bcl2 kinase in addition to IL-3 or Bryo-activated PKC (11May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Bcl2 can become hyperphosphorylated when OA is added in the absence of exogenous agonist (Fig. 1 b), which suggests that the inhibition of OA-sensitive phosphatase activity may allow a constitutively active protein kinase to phosphorylate Bcl2 (Fig.1 b). However, the identity of this potential agonist-independent Bcl2 kinase is not yet clear. Whereas PP2A has been closely associated with the regulation of various fundamental cell processes (16Mumby M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), virtually nothing is known about how mitochondrial PP2A may affect apoptosis. Our results suggest a mechanism for regulation of Bcl2 that involves PP2A. The findings also provide the first evidence for a novel population of PP2A that is associated with the mitochondrial membrane, possibly through an interaction with Bcl2. Targeting PP2A by direct protein interaction may specify PP2A function and play an important role in Bcl2 phosphorylation and function. In support of this notion, another example in which targeting specifies PP2A function involves the dephosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (39Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Ca2+ calmodulin serine/threonine phosphatase PP2B/calcineurin has also been reported to interact directly with and be sequestered by Bcl2 in Jurkat T cells (34Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. Mckeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This interaction apparently prevents the nuclear localization of NF-AT and facilitates T-cell survival. However, there is no evidence that PP2B is involved in the regulation of Bcl2 phosphorylation and function. Moreover, because PP2B is not sensitive to OA at the concentrations used and PP2B is not co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl2 after the agonist treatment of cells, a role for PP2B in Bcl2 phosphorylation seems unlikely, at least in factor-dependent myeloid cells. Therefore, the binding of either PP2A or PP2B to Bcl2 may have different functional consequences and points out the potential versatility of Bcl2 in interacting with and regulating other components involved in apoptosis. Finally, it has been reported that phosphorylation of Bcl2 is not detected in some tumor cells (14Gajewski T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Given our findings, it seems plausible that a failure to detect Bcl2 phosphorylation in some cells may reflect, at least in part, the increased activity of a Bcl2-associated phosphatase or the absence of a mitochondrial Bcl2 kinase (17Ruvolo P.R. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Thus, a low steady-state level of Bcl2 phosphorylation in some growing cells may be difficult to detect experimentally without also inhibiting an associated Bcl2 phosphatase activity. In summary, agonist-induced phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 can now be appreciated in dynamic terms, with the relative steady-state level of phosphorylation being tightly regulated by the concerted action of a Bcl2 kinase and PP2A. These findings help to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of Bcl2 phosphorylation, which is required for full and potent Bcl2 function (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this regulatory mechanism identifies a potential novel therapeutic target for antineoplastic drug development strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2041945352,"Upon sulfonation, carcinogenic hydroxyarylamines such as N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-2AAF) can be further activated to form ultimate carcinogens in vivo. Previous studies have shown that a SULT1C1 sulfotransferase is primarily responsible for the sulfonation of N-OH-2AAF in rat liver. In the present study, two novel human sulfotransferases shown to be members of the SULT1C sulfotransferase subfamily based on sequence analysis have been cloned, expressed, and characterized. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the human SULT1C sulfotransferase cDNA 1 reveal 63.7, 61.6, and 85.1% identity to the amino acid sequences of rat SULT1C1 sulfotransferase, mouse SULT1C1 sulfotransferase, and rabbit SULT1C sulfotransferase. In contrast, the deduced amino acid sequence of the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 2 cDNA displays 62.9, 63.1, 63.1, and 62.5% identity to the amino acid sequences of the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1, rat SULT1C1 sulfotransferase, mouse SULT1C1 sulfotransferase, and rabbit SULT1C sulfotransferase. Recombinant human SULT1C sulfotransferases 1 and 2, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near electrophoretic homogeneity, were shown to cross-react with the antiserum against the rat liver SULT1C1 sulfotransferase and exhibited sulfonating activities with N-OH-2AAF as substrate. Tissue-specific expression of these novel human SULT1C sulfotransferases were examined by employing the Northern blotting technique. The results provide a foundation for the investigation into the functional relevance of these new SULT1C sulfotransferases in different human tissues/organs.

N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene polymerase chain reaction 3-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]aminopropanesulfonic acid Expressed Sequence Tag. In vertebrates, the cytosolic sulfotransferases constitute a group of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a sulfonate group from the active sulfate, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, to a substrate compound containing a hydroxyl or an amino group (1Mulder G.J.

Conjugation-Deconjugation Reactions in Drug Metabolism and Toxicity. Springer-Verlag, Inc., Berlin1994: 45-78Google Scholar). These enzymes are generally thought to be involved in the inactivation and/or excretion of xenobiotics or endogenous compounds such as steroid and thyroid hormones, catecholamines, and bile acids (1Mulder G.J. Jakoby W.B. Mulder G.J. Conjugation Reactions in Drug Metabolism. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1990: 107-161Google Scholar, 2Falany C. Roth J.A. Jeffery E.H.

Conjugation-Deconjugation Reactions in Drug Metabolism and Toxicity. Springer-Verlag, Inc., Berlin1994: 45-78Google Scholar). For some carcinogenic compounds including hydroxyarylamines, arylhydroxamic acids, and benzyl alcohol derivatives, sulfonation, however, results in the formation of more highly reactive metabolic intermediates (4DeBaun J.R. Smith J.Y.R. Miller E.C. Miller J.A. Science. 1970; 167: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although unsulfonated hydroxyarylamines have previously been shown to be potent mutagens (5Andrews L.S. Hinson J.A. Gillette J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), they are relatively stable and require metabolic activation through, for example, sulfonation to form ultimate carcinogens/mutagens in vivo (6King C.M. Philips B. Science. 1968; 159: 1351-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Kadlubar F.F. Miller J.A. Miller E.C. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 2350-2359PubMed Google Scholar, 8Watabe T.

Sulfonated hydroxyarylamines, e.g. N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-2AAF),1 may spontaneously rearrange to release sulfate and generate a reactive electrophilic nitrenium cation (11Kadlubar F.F. Beland F.A. Harvey R. Polycyclic Hydrocarbons and Carcinogenesis. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1985: 341-370Google Scholar). Such an electrophilic cation can react with cellular nucleophiles, in particular DNA, thereby causing mutations in critical genes such as proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (12Glatt H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequences of the cytosolic sulfotransferases found in vertebrates, two gene families, the phenol sulfotransferase family (designated SULT1) and the hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase family (designated SULT2), have been classified (13Yamazoe Y. Nagata K. Ozawa S. Kato R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The phenol sulfotransferase family presently consists of four subfamilies, phenol sulfotransferases (SULT1A), dopa/tyrosine (or thyroid hormone) sulfotransferases (SULT1B), hydroxyarylamine (or acetylaminofluorene) sulfotransferases (SULT1C), and estrogen sulfotransferases (SULT1E) (14Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). With the recent discovery of two new human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases, 2C. Her, T. C., Wood, E. Eichler, H. W. Mohrenweiser, M. J. Siciliano, L. S. Ramagli, and R. M. Weinshilboum, GenBank accession numbers U92314 and U92315. the hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase family now comprises two subfamilies, SULT2A and SULT2B (cf. Fig. 3). Earlier studies have revealed the rat liver aryl sulfotransferase IV (SULT1A1) to display N-OH-2AAF sulfotransferase activity (17Sekura R.D. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that the SULT1C1 sulfotransferase may be primarily responsible for the sulfonation of hydroxyarylamines in rat liver (19Gong D.-W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biochem. 1991; 110: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Nagata K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimada M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study showed that, in rat liver, the primary translational products (subunits) of the dimeric SULT1A1 and SULT1C1 sulfotransferases may also interact to form a heterodimer consisting of one SULT1A1 subunit and one SULT1C1 subunit (21Kiehlbauch C.C. Lam Y.F. Ringer D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18941-18947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The hydroxyarylamine sulfotransferases in human tissues have been more poorly understood. A human cDNA encoding a sulfotransferase that displays 62% amino acid sequence identity to the rat liver SULT1C1 sulfotransferase has recently been reported (22Her C. Kaur G.P. Athwal R.S. Weinshilboum R.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties and functional relevance of this human SULT1C sulfotransferase (designated 1), however, remain unknown. A truncated cDNA (clone ID 302867; GenBank accession number W38522) encoding likely a new human SULT1C sulfotransferase (designated 2) has also been deposited in the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base (23Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). More recently, a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the 3′-terminal region of the open reading frame of, hypothetically, another new human SULT1C sulfotransferase (designated 3) has been detected through genomic cloning (24Nagata K. Yoshinari K. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Mutat. Res. 1997; 376: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). No information, however, is currently available with regard to the actual expression of the mRNA encoding this new SULT1C sulfotransferase in human tissues. We report here the molecular cloning, expression, and functional characterization of two novel human SULT1C sulfotransferases (designations 1 and 2) potentially involved in the activation of carcinogenic hydroxyarylamines. Dopamine, p-nitrophenol, aprotinin, thrombin, ATP, SDS, Hepes, Taps, Trizma (Tris base), dithiothreitol, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were products of Sigma. A chromatographically pure N-OH-2AAF was a generous gift from Dr. Danuta Malejka-Giganti at the VA Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN. Cyclist Exo- Pfu DNA sequencing kit, Prime-It II random primer labeling kit, Pfu DNA polymerase, pBluescript II SK(+), and XL1-Blue MRF′ Escherichia coli host strain were from Stratagene. I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clones ID 296479 (GenBank accession number W00984) and ID 302867 (GenBank accession numberW38522) were obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. Human mRNA master blot, human liver, kidney, lung, and brain total RNA, human fetal lung 5′-stretch cDNA library, and ExpressHyb solution were fromCLONTECH. AmpliTaq DNA polymerase andTaq dye primer cycle sequencing kits were products of Perkin-Elmer. T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and all restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. pGEX-2TK glutathioneS-transferase gene fusion vector, E. coli BL21, First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were products of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 5′-Full rapid amplification of cDNA ends core set was from Takara Shuzo Co. (Japan). TRI reagent was a product from Molecular Research Center, Inc. Hybond N+ nylon membrane and ECL Plus Western blotting detection system were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chromatogram cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates were products of Eastman Kodak Co. Carrier-free sodium [35S]sulfate was from ICN Biomedicals. [α-32P]dCTP (3, 000 Ci/mM) and [α-35S]dATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Rabbit antiserum against the rat liver SULT1C1 sulfotransferase was prepared as described previously (21Kiehlbauch C.C. Lam Y.F. Ringer D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18941-18947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest grades commercially available. The I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 302867, identified by searching through the EST data base, was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) and sequenced. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence obtained indicated that the cDNA encodes the C-terminal portion of a novel SULT1C sulfotransferase (designated 2). To prepare the probe for more efficient cDNA library screening for cDNA clones encompassing the entire open reading frame or its 5′-coding region, a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment was performed using the human brain total RNA as the template in conjunction with a gene-specific primer (Table I) designed based on an internal sequence of the cDNA clone number 302867. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was subsequently performed using two sets of sense and antisense primers based on the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone 302867 (Table I) according to manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products obtained were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) and transformed intoE. coli XL1-Blue MRF′. One resulting clone (designated 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-25), verified by nucleotide sequencing, was used as a probe to screen a human fetal lung 5′-stretch cDNA library. Approximately 2 × 106 plaques from the library were screened. Hybond N+ nylon membrane filter replicas of plaques/E. coli host cells grown on 150-mm Petri dishes, upon prehybridization for 2 h at 65 °C, were hybridized overnight at 65 °C with the probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (25Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Hybridized membranes were washed once with 2× SSC (1× SSC, 0.15 mNaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) plus 0.1% SDS and twice with 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, followed by autoradiography to reveal the positive cDNA clones. After two additional cycles of re-screening, seven positive cDNA clones were obtained and subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+). Serial deletional mutants of one of them (designated clone F-11) were prepared using Exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease (26Henikoff S. Gene. 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) and subjected to nucleotide sequencing.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplifications5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends primers5′-Phosphorylated reverse transcription primer5′-pCTTCTGGTAATCTTC-3′Sense-15′-TAGAAGAGATAGAGAATACGGT-3′Antisense-15′-TTCCCACCAATCCTTTCACATG-3′Sense-25′-CCACTCCATTTCTCCATTCA-3′Antisense-25′-AAAAGGGGCAGTGGGAGACT-3′PCR primers used for prokaryotic expression experimentsI.

The inserts of individual pBluescript clones prepared as described above were sequenced in both directions using T3 or T7 sequencing primer (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). Alternatively, automated cycle sequencing was performed usingTaq dye primer cycle sequencing kits with −21M13 or M13 reverse primer. The sequences obtained were analyzed using the E-mail server at NCBI for homology to the sequences stored in the GenBank data base. To amplify the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 sequence for subcloning into a prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2TK, a set of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers (Table I), based on 5′ and 3′ regions of the nucleotide sequence encoding the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 were synthesized with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites incorporated at the ends. With these two oligonucleotides as primers, a PCR in a 100-μl reaction mixture was carried out under the action of Pfu DNA polymerase using the I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 296479 as the template. Amplification conditions were 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The final reaction mixture was applied onto a 1.2% agarose gel and separated by electrophoresis. The discrete PCR product band, visualized upon ethidium bromide staining, was excised from the gel, and the DNA fragment therein was isolated by spin filtration. AfterBamHI/EcoRI digestion, the PCR product was subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-2TK and transformed into E. coli BL21. To verify its authenticity, the cDNA insert was subjected to nucleotide sequencing as described above. For the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 2, the nucleotide sequences encoding the N-terminal and C-terminal portions, as defined by an internal XbaI restriction site, were amplified using, respectively, the cDNA clone F-11 and the I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 302867 as the templates in conjunction with sequence-specific sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers shown in Table I. Experimental conditions for PCR amplifications, separation of PCR products, and subcloning into pGEX-2TK were the same as those described above, except that the two PCR products were subjected to, respectively,BamHI/XbaI and XbaI/EcoRI digestion before being tandemly subcloned into pGEX-2TK. The full-length SULT1C sulfotransferase 2 thus generated was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Competent E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with pGEX-2TK harboring the full-length cDNA encoding the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 or 2. The transformed cells, grown toA 600 nm ∼ 0.5 in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at room temperature, were collected by centrifugation and homogenized in 20 ml of ice-cold STE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) using an Aminco French press. The crude homogenate thus prepared was subjected to centrifugation at 10, 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant collected was fractionated using 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose, and the bound fusion protein was treated with 2 ml of a thrombin digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) containing 5 unit/ml bovine thrombin. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with constant agitation, 5 μg of aprotinin were added to inactivate thrombin, and the preparation was subjected to centrifugation. The recombinant enzyme present in the supernatant collected was examined with respect to its enzymatic and immunologic properties. Sulfotransferase activities of purified recombinant human SULT1C sulfotransferases were assayed using 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate as the sulfate donor. The standard assay mixture, with a final volume of 30 μl, contained 50 mm Taps-NaOH, pH 8.25, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 14 μm 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phospho[35S] (15 Ci/mmol), and 50 μmsubstrate (N-OH-2AAF, p-nitrophenol, or dopamine). The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme preparation and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of the reaction, the reaction mixture was directly spotted on a cellulose thin-layer chromatography plate and subjected to the analysis of [35S]sulfated product according to the thin-layer chromatography procedure previously established (28Liu M.-C. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3695-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant SULT1C sulfotransferases, solubilized in SDS sample buffer and heated for 3 min at 100 °C, were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The blotted membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and probed with 20 μl of anti-rat liver SULT1C1 sulfotransferase antiserum. After a 1-h incubation, the membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk, and processed using the ECL Plus nonradioactive detection system based on manufacturer's instructions. Autoradiography was then performed on the processed membrane. A human mRNA master blot (CLONTECH) was prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in the ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) and hybridized with the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 2 cDNA probe. The probe was random-primed-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (25Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) first and then hybridized to the blot. After an overnight hybridization at 65 °C, the membrane blot was washed once in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 1 h at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC for 45 min at 65 °C and subjected to autoradiography. 3′-Phosphoadenosine 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate (15 Ci/mmol) was synthesized from ATP and [35S]sulfate using ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus as described previously (30Fernando P.H.P.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels using the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Protein determination was based on the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Previous studies have demonstrated that N-hydroxylation under the action of cytochrome P-450 represents the first step in the metabolic activation of arylamines or arylamides (33Kato R. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1986; 16: 307-348Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar).N-Hydroxylated arylamines or arylamides that are formed can subsequently be sulfonated, generating products that are unstable and may degrade into highly carcinogenic/mutagenic electrophilic cations (6King C.M.

It has been demonstrated that the O-sulfonation activity in experimental animals correlated to the carcinogenic potency of N-OH-2AAF (34DeBaun J.R. Miller E.C. Miller J.A. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 577-595PubMed Google Scholar). Investigation into the responsible enzyme in rat liver first revealed the aryl sulfotransferase IV (SULT1A1) to display activity toward N-OH-2AAF (17Sekura R.D. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Ringer D.P. Norton T.R. Howell B.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5301-5307PubMed Google Scholar). A SULT1C1 sulfotransferase was later purified, characterized, and cloned from rat liver (19Gong D.-W. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant SULT1C1 sulfotransferase expressed in COS-1 cells was shown to exhibit a higher N-OH-2AAF-sulfonating activity than the SULT1A1 sulfotransferase (20Nagata K. Ozawa S. Miyata M. Shimada M. Gong D.-W. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24720-24725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to identify a homologous SULT1C1 sulfotransferase in human liver, however, have so far yielded no clear results (24Nagata K. Yoshinari K. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Mutat. Res. 1997; 376: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although the human SULT1C1 orthologue is still being sought after, two nucleotide sequences with high enough homology so as to be categorized in the SULT1C sulfotransferase subfamily (cf. Fig. 3) have been deposited in the EST data base (22Her C. Kaur G.P. Athwal R.S. Weinshilboum R.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,23Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Of these two new human sulfotransferase cDNAs (designated, respectively, 1 and 2), the SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 is a full-length clone, and the SULT1C sulfotransferase 2 is a truncated clone. In view of the potential differences between humans and rodents with regard to their constituent cytosolic sulfotransferases, we decided to clone these two novel human SULT1C sulfotransferases and express them for functional characterization. Analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 302867 revealed the cDNA to encode only the C-terminal portion of a novel SULT1C sulfotransferase. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we have prepared a DNA probe and used it to screen a human fetal lung cDNA library. A positive clone encompassing the 5′ region coding for the N-terminal portion was obtained. The nucleotide sequence determined for this latter cDNA clone, spanning nucleotide residues 1–1034 of the full-length sequence shown in Fig. 1, overlaps with that of the I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 302867, which spans nucleotide residues 849–2143. The authenticity of the full-length sequence was confirmed by the generation of a specific PCR product in a reverse transcriptase-PCR experiment using human fetal lung total RNA as the template in conjunction with sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the full-length sequence. As shown in Fig. 1, the open reading frame, beginning at base residue 330, encompasses 906 nucleotides and encodes a 302-amino acid polypeptide. The predicted molecular weight, 35,533, falls within the molecular weight range (33,000–36, 000) generally found for cytosolic sulfotransferase enzymes (1Mulder G.J. Jakoby W.B. Mulder G.J.

The termination codon, located at nucleotide residues 1,236–1,238, is followed by a 905-nucleotide 3′-untranslated sequence that includes a poly(A) tract.

Sequence analysis revealed the deduced amino acid sequence of this new human SULT1C sulfotransferase (designated 2) cDNA to display 62.9, 63.1, 63.1, and 62.5% identity to the amino acid sequences of the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 (22Her C.

In comparison with the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 2, the deduced amino acid sequence of the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 (cf.Fig. 2) displays 63.7, 61.6, and 85.1% identity to the amino acid sequences of the rat SULT1C1 sulfotransferase (16Saeki Y.

Based on the sequence analysis data presented above, these SULT1C sulfotransferases can now be categorized into distinct phylogenetic groups as shown in the dendrogram presented in Fig. 3. The full-length cDNAs encoding the human SULT1C sulfotransferases 1 and 2 were individually subcloned into pGEX-2TK, a prokaryotic expression vector, for the expression of recombinant enzymes in E. coli. As shown inpanel A of Fig. 4, recombinant human SULT1C sulfotransferases 1 and 2, cleaved from their respective fusion proteins fractionated from the E. coli homogenates using glutathione-Sepharose, were shown to migrate at, respectively, 34- and 35-kDa positions upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant enzymes thus prepared were examined with respect to the immunologic cross-reactivity toward the antiserum against the rat liver SULT1C1 sulfotransferase. As shown in panel B of Fig. 4, the 34-kDa recombinant human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 displayed a strong cross-reactivity toward the antiserum. The 35-kDa recombinant human SULT1C sulfotransferase 2, to a lesser extent, also displayed cross-reactivity toward the antiserum. The two recombinant SULT1C sulfotransferase enzymes were subjected to functional characterization with respect to their sulfotransferase activities. The activity data compiled in Table II revealed that both enzymes encoded by recombinant clones 1 and 2 catalyzed the sulfonation of p-nitrophenol but not dopamine. More importantly, the two enzymes displayed strong activities catalyzing the sulfonation ofN-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene. This marks the first time hydroxyarylamide or hydroxamic acid sulfotransferase activities have been shown to be associated with distinct human sulfotransferases.Table IISpecific activities of recombinant human SULT1C sulfotransferases 1 and 2 with different substrate compoundsSpecific activitySULT1C ST 1SULT1C ST 2pmol/min/mgp-Nitrophenol84.07 ± 1.1375.34 ± 3.09DopamineNDaNot detected.NDaNot detected.N-OH-2AAF28.61 ± 2.6847.50 ± 1.76Specific activity refers to activity/mg of purified recombinant enzyme.

The data shown represent the means ±S.E. derived from three experiments. To find clues to its functional involvementin vivo, the tissue-specific expression of the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 2 in different human tissues/organs was examined by employing the Northern blotting technique. It is pointed out that previous studies have demonstrated that human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 is expressed in adult human stomach, kidney, and thyroid, as well as fetal kidney and liver (22Her C. Kaur G.P. Athwal R.S. Weinshilboum R.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By employing the reverse transcriptase-PCR technique, we were able to amplify SULT1C sulfotransferase 1-specific sequence using total RNA from human liver, lung, or intestine as the template (data not shown). The tissue-specific expression of human SULT1C sulfotransferases 2 was examined using aCLONTECH human mRNA master blot with the cloned cDNA as probes. As shown in Fig. 5, among the poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 50 human tissues, SULT1C sulfotransferases 2 was found to be expressed at higher levels in fetal lung and kidney and at lower levels in fetal heart, adult kidney, ovary, and spinal cord. These results on the tissue-specific expression may provide a foundation for the future investigation into the functional relevance of these new SULT1C sulfotransferases in different human tissues/organs. Because the SULT1C sulfotransferase enzymes are hypothesized to be involved in the bioactivation ofN-hydroxylated metabolites of carcinogenic/mutagenic arylamines and arylamides (17Sekura R.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18941-18947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it will also be interesting to examine their relative abundance in normal versus tumor tissues. The results derived from the present study revealed that, in humans, there are multiple SULT1C sulfotransferases present in different tissues at possibly different developmental stages. These enzymes are likely to play essential, yet unknown, physiological roles at the developmental stages in the tissues where they are expressed. These enzymes, on the other hand, may also exhibit fortuitous sulfonating activities toward xenobiotic compounds such as arylamines or arylamides following their N-hydroxylation, thereby generating reactive intermediates that are capable of causing cytotoxic and genotoxic damage to cells in vivo. Such potential cytotoxic/genotoxic effects may pose a serious risk in view of the increasingly complex dietary food and the worsening environmental contamination. Another important issue is related to the species-specific differences in terms of the tissue specificity of the expression of the SULT1C sulfotransferase enzymes, which was first indicated indirectly by the differential O-sulfonating activities found in the livers of humans and experimental animals (38Abu-Zeid M. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One striking example is the difficulty in demonstrating the expression of the human orthologue of the rat liver SULT1C1 sulfotransferase. Futile attempts had previously been made to detect the specific mRNA in human liver, even though the sequence is now known to be present in the human genome (24Nagata K. Yoshinari K. Ozawa S. Yamazoe Y. Mutat. Res. 1997; 376: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). That the mouse SULT1C1 sulfotransferase is expressed in olfactory cells (39Miyawaki A. Homma H. Tamura H. Matsui M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) but not (at detectable level) in liver cells, 5Y. Sakakibara, K. Yanagisawa, J. Katafuchi, D. P. Ringer, Y. Takami, T. Nakayama, M. Suiko, and M.-C. Liu, unpublished results. seems to indicate possibly the differential tissue specificity of the expression of orthologous SULT1C1 sulfotransferases that function perhaps in distinct physiological context of individual animal species. On the other hand, however, the rabbit orthologue, with a similar organ (stomach) specificity of expression, of the human SULT1C sulfotransferase 1 investigated in the present study has recently been reported.3 More studies will be needed to clarify the similarities and differences between humans and other mammalian species in terms of their constituent sulfotransferase enzymes. Finally, it may be worthwhile mentioning that, compared with cytochromes P-450, cytosolic sulfotransferases, which were previously known as a group of Phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, have received considerably less attention, and much fewer of them have been identified to date. The advancement of sulfotransferase molecular biology has allowed the convenient identification of potential sulfotransferase enzymes by searching through, in particular, the EST data base for the signature sequences (23Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 37Hillier L. Lennon G. Becker M. Bonaldo M. Chiapelli B. Chissoe S. Dietrich N.

Underwood K. Wohldman P. Waterson R. Wilson R. Marra M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 807-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) found for all known sulfotransferases. As the EST project continues to progress, it is anticipated that new members of this group of enzymes, which play important roles in not only the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics but also the biotransformation of a variety of endogenous compounds, are bound to emerge. As exemplified by our present study, the major challenge then will probably be to elucidate the enzymatic characteristics and physiological involvements of these new sulfotransferase enzymes. We are grateful to Dr. Danuta Malejka-Giganti for the helpful advice and comments during the preparation of this manuscript and for providingN-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene."

Mutations that map to theKvLQT1 and minK genes account for more than 50% of an inherited cardiac disorder, the Long QT syndrome (Splawski, I., Tristani-Firouzi, M., Lehmann, M. H., Sanguinetti, M. C., and Keating, M. T. (1997) Nat. Genet.17, 338–340). Despite the importance of these channels to human cardiac function, the molecular basis of their uniquely slow gating properties as well as the stoichiometry and interaction sites of these two subunits are still unclear. We have constructed several fusion channel proteins to begin investigating the stoichiometry of these two subunits and the role of voltage-dependent subunit assembly in channel gating. Functional properties of these constructs were measured using whole cell patch clamp recordings of transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. The constructs we tested are as follows: MK24 (C terminus of MinK linked to N terminus of KvLQT1); KK40 (a tandem homodimer of KvLQT1); and MKK44 (C terminus of MinK linked to N terminus of KK40). In control experiments (no DNA, control DNA, or only MinK), no time-dependent K+ current was observed. Expression of KvLQT1 or KK40 produced currents that activate and inactivate in a voltage-dependent manner as reported by others for KvLQT1. In contrast, expression of MK24 and MKK44 elicited current with activation kinetics and voltage dependence very similar to native I sK and identical to currents expressed by cells co-transfected with independent MinK and KvLQT1 cDNA. Expression of MK24 plus additional MinK significantly slows current kinetics. Our data raise the possibility 1) of multiple MinK/KvLQT1 stoichiometries and 2) indicate that uniquely slow kinetics ofI sK channels is due to voltage-dependent conformational changes of the channel protein and not to assembly of channel subunits.

Key experiments in Xenopus oocytes suggested that the MinK protein was a regulator of expressed channel activity and not sufficient by itself to form functional I sK channels (11Attali B.

However, questions remain about the stoichiometry of the MinK/KvLQT1 channels as well as the molecular basis for the uniquely slow gating of the functionalI sK channels. I sK gating kinetics are affected by the amount of MinK cRNA injected into Xenopus oocytes, (12Blumenthal E.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Romey G. Attali B. Chouabe C. Abitbol I. Guillemare E. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Chemical cross-linking of I sK protein also results in alteration in activation and deactivation kinetics (20Varnum M.D. Maylie J. Busch A. Adelman J.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), supporting the above hypothesis. Here we report experiments in which we have created tandem multimer channel constructs in which the MinK and KvLQT1 proteins have been fused in different configurations. These fusion proteins were designed to restrict protein interactions and thus contained minimal peptide linkers between the subunits. The purpose of these experiments was to test directly the hypothesis that the slow gating kinetics of expressedI sK channels is due to voltage-dependent assembly of MinK and MinK-free KvLQT1 proteins and to determine whether functional I sK channels are formed by unique MinK/KvLQT1 stoichiometries. CHO cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding fusion proteins of MinK and KvLQT1. Our results show that the kinetics of the MinK-KvLQT1 fusion proteins are identical to those of channels expressed in cells co-transfected with MinK and KvLQT1 cDNAs. This strongly suggests that the unique I sK kinetics are not due to voltage-dependent assembly of channel subunits in the cell membrane and are not rate-limited by the amount of MinK-free KvLQT1 subunit in the membrane. Instead, voltage-dependent conformational changes of the MinK-KvLQT1 complex can account for I sK activation kinetics. However, we additionally find that the channels formed by MinK-KvLQT1 tandem constructs can be further modulated by co-expression with additional monomeric MinK protein. This observation supports the view that the assembled MinK-KvLQT1 complex can be modulated by MinK protein and that multiple stoichiometries may exist for these subunits. Thus our data suggest that the MinK subunit may act as an allosteric regulator of I sK channel kinetics. The restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Promega (Madison, WI). Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), was used in all PCR reactions to ensure sequence fidelity during amplification. Plasmid purification and fragment isolation kits were obtained from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA). The human cDNA clone KvLQT1 was a gift from Dr. M. Keating (Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah). The chemicals and reagents in the experiments were obtained from Sigma if not otherwise specified. A two-step PCR strategy was employed to construct human MinK-KvLQT1 fusion channel. All primer sequences are listed in Table I but described here. An oligonucleotide primer WFmK1 overlapping the C terminus of MinK and N terminus of KvLQT1 was paired with another oligonucleotide primer HRKv2 complementary to KvLQT1. These were used as primers in the first round PCR reaction to amplify the chimeric sequence MKv-1, composed of 27 base pairs of the C terminus of MinK (stop codon omitted) linked to the N terminus of KvLQT1 in frame. In the second round PCR, an equal molar mixture of MKv-1 and MinK was used as templates that were amplified by two outside primers, HFmNh3 and HRKv2. 10% Me2SO was added to all the reactions to overcome the high annealing temperature caused by higher GC contents in the sequences. The final product was cleaned up by “Wizard PCR Prep” (Promega).Table IThe oligonucleotides used in PCR and DNA sequencingWFmK1CACCTTCCTGAGACGAAGCCTTCCCCAATGGCCGCGGCCTCCTCCCCGCCAGGHRKv2CCGAAGAACACCACCAGCACGATHFmNh3AAGACTAGCCACCATGCCCAGGATGATCCTGTCTACCNheIWFKEc5TAGAATTCGCCACCATGGCCGCGGCCTCCTCCCCGCCCAGGEcoRIHRKBm6TTAGGATCCCTCATCGGGGCCCCTCCTGGGCABamHIWFkB17GATTGATCAATGGCCGCGGCCTCCTCCCCGCCAGGBclIHRKHi8AGATAAGCTTTCAGGACCCCTCATCGGGGCCCCTCCHindIII Open table in a new tab A three-way ligation was performed as the following: pCDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) was digested with NheI and BamHI; KvLQT1-pCDNA3 was digested with XhoI andBamHI, and the PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI. The three fragments were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:3:3 in the ligation reaction. Construction of KvLQT1 into its homodimer KK40 was similar to the above approach. The primer pairs for KvLQT1 amplifications were WFKEc5 and HRKBm6, WFkBl7 and HRKHi8. All the PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced by the chain termination method in the DNA Sequencing Facility at Columbia University. KK40 was digested with XhoI, and the 2-kb insert was gel-purified and ligated into the XhoI site of MK24. Ligation was designed to ensure the correct orientation to form MKK44, with one MinK linked in frame to two copies of KvLQT1. The nomenclature used reflects both the relative contribution of each subunit as well as the insert size in pCDNA3.1(−). Thus MK24 reflects MinK:KvLQT1 = 1:1; vector, pCDNA 3.1(−); insert size, 2.4 kb; and MKK44 reflects MinK:KvLQT1 = 1:2; vector, pCDNA 3.1(−); insert size, 4.4 kb. All constructs were sequenced using mutagenesis primers and sequencing primers mk02–mk07, and the sequences were confirmed with the original cDNA sequences. CHO cells (ATCC) were cultured in Ham's F12 medium and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE with and without LipofectAMINE-PLUS reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were passaged the day before transfection at 50–70% confluence in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks. Transfected cells were split and plated directly onto 35-mm plastic Petri dishes after 12–20 h and used for patch clamp analysis 48 h after transfection. Neonatal mouse ventricular cells were prepared and studied as previously reported by us (21Davies M.P. An R.H. Doevendans P. Kubalak S. Chien K.R. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1995; 78: 15-25Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). External solutions contained (in mm) the following: NaCl 132, KCl 4.8, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 1, glucose 5, HEPES 10, pH 7.4. The internal solution contained (in mm) the following: K+ aspartate 110, CaCl2 1, HEPES 10, EGTA 11, MgCl2 1, K2ATP 5, pH 7.3 (KOH). Activation ofI sK was studied using a series of 2- or 5-s depolarizing pulses from −40 mV to different test potentials in the range of −40 to +80 mV (20-mV increments). Activation curves were determined by measuring time-dependent activating (pulse) or deactivating (tail) currents. Data were collected, stored, and analyzed on IBM-compatible computers interfaced to Axopatch 200A amplifiers driven by pCLAMP software (version 6, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Graphical and statistical data analyses were carried out using ORIGIN (5.0) software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Recordings were carried out at room temperature. For comparison of multiple experiments, currents recorded during activation pulse sequences were normalized to the maximal current recorded (at +80 mV) and then averaged for each recording voltage. Where shown, averaged data are noted, and the number of experimental records averaged is indicated. The primary goal of our present study was to investigate the assembly and stoichiometry of the two channel subunits. In control experiments, we transfected CHO cells with no DNA (not illustrated), green fluorescent protein (22Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G. Howe J. Hughes T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A, n = 15), and MinK alone (Fig. 1 B, n = 14). For each condition, we found no time-dependent K+channel activity. Thus CHO cells do not have detectable endogenous KvLQT1 channel activity and constitute a feasible host system for this study. In contrast, CHO cells transfected with KvLQT1 cDNA (Fig.1 C) expressed time- and voltage-dependent current with properties similar to I KvLQT1 as described in the literature (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 23Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S.X.A.D. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). I KvLQT1activates in a voltage-dependent manner and kinetics of activation become faster with increasingly positive voltages. The kinetics of deactivation (tail kinetics) are characterized by hooks (arrow) that reflect the removal of inactivation that had occurred during the preceding voltage pulse (24Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Shaker family K+ channels are formed as homo- or heterotetramers (25MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 26Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) in which each subunit has six putative α-helical transmembrane segments and a consensus K+ pore region. Since KvLQT1 has the above predicted structure (23Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S.X.A.D. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), it should be possible to express I KvLQT1 by transfecting cells with cDNA encoding KvLQT1 fusion proteins of two or four KvLQT1 subunits. Currents expressed by cells transfected with KK40 were indistinguishable from currents encoded by KvLQT1 (Fig. 1 D), consistent with functional channels formed by multiples of the homodimers. These channels retain both the activation and inactivation (tail hook) properties of native KvLQT1 channels (compare Fig. 1,C and D). Thus, not surprisingly, the KvLQT1 channel structure resembles other Shaker K+channels. We next tested directly the functional properties of KvLQT1 and MinK multimers. First we constructed and studied the functional properties of the fusion channel proteins MK24 and MKK44. A general concern when such a fusion approach is adopted is whether the forced linkage ruptures the natural assembly of the channel, because the forced linkage may impose an unusual arrangement of the folding of and interactions between the domains of the channel and also influence expression of subunits (27McCormack K. Lin L. Sigworth F.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1740-1748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We were thus surprised to find that channels expressed from either MK24 and MKK44 strongly resemble wild type channel activity. Fig. 2 illustrates records for both constructs recorded in response to similar series of 2-s (upper row) and 5-s (lower row) voltage pulses and compares these with wild type MinK/KvLQT1 currents. Fig.3 summarizes voltage-dependent activation and kinetic properties of the constructs. As is the case for wild type MinK/KvLQT1, currents expressed by both fusion proteins activate slowly, and although the time course of activation becomes faster with depolarization, it never approaches that of the KvLQT1 channels (Fig. 3 B). Also consistent with co-expression of MinK and KvLQT1, channel activity expressed by the tandem multimers shows little evidence of inactivation either during voltage pulses or upon return to the holding potential (note lack of hook in deactivating tails).Figure 3Voltage dependence of activation and kinetics of channel constructs. The curves shown in these figures were determined from the normalized average data plotted in Figs. 1 and 2, and the numbers of experiments for each construct are indicated for those figures. Isochronal (2 s) activation curves, measured via analysis of current tails as described under “Experimental Procedures,” are shown in A. Currents were normalized to tail current measured after activation pulses to +80 mV for each construct. B, time to half-maximal time-dependent pulse current (measured as described under “Experimental Procedures”) versus activation pulse voltage. In both panels the following symbols are used: KvLQT1 (▪); KK40 (•); MinK + KvLQT1 (▴); MK24 (▾); and MKK44 (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) KK40 and KvLQT1 channels share identical voltage-dependent activation gating properties (Fig. 3 A), and co-transfection of MinK and KvLQT1 shifts the voltage dependence of expressed KvLQT1 channel activation to more positive voltages as has been reported by others (23Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S.X.A.D. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 28Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results indicate that the voltage dependence of activation and the kinetics of the tandem constructs are the same as that of channels expressed by the MinK/KvLQT-1 monomers (Fig. 3, A and B), i.e. shifted to positive voltages relative to activation of KvLQT1 or KK40. Notice also that even in response to these very prolonged voltage steps, MK24 and MKK44 currents do not reach steady state for any of the channel constructs. This very slow activation process, which is characteristic of native I sK channel activity recorded in cardiac cells (29Kass R.S. Morad M. Ebashi S. Trautweiin W. Kurachi Y. Molecular Physiology and Pharmacology of Cardiac Ion Channels and Transporters. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1996: 169-176Google Scholar), accounts for the failure of the 2-s isochronal activation curves for I sK and the tandem multimer constructs to saturate (Fig. 3 A). These findings support the view that the forced linkage does not grossly disrupt I sKheteromultimer channel formation. Additionally, the finding that the very slow activation gating kinetics of the expressed channel activity is conserved with the fusion proteins provides strong evidence that this characteristic of wild type I sK is not due to voltage-dependent assembly of MinK with MinK-free KvLQT1 proteins. The observation that MK24 and MKK44 equally resemble nativeI sK channels suggests that the stoichiometry of the two proteins may not be fixed in the assembled I sKchannel, an atypical scenario for channel subunit interactions in general (30Catterall W.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1499-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) but one previously suggested by others forI sK (31Cui J. Kline R.P. Pennefather P. Cohen I.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Romey G. Attali B. Chouabe C. Abitbol I. Guillemare E. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, it is highly possible that there is a minimal stoichiometry requirement for incorporation of MinK that modifies KvLQT1 gating such that expressed currents resembleI sK. This relationship would be supported by the expressed MKK44 channel activity. In support of this hypothesis is an earlier study in which 2 MinK monomers were suggested to associate with other, then unidentified, non-MinK subunits to form functionalI sK channels in Xenopus oocytes (33Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1303-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). How is it thus possible to detect multiple MinK and KvLQT1 stoichiometries? One approach is to test for changes in multimericI sK channel activity by co-expression with additional MinK protein. Thus, to investigate whether the fusion proteins MK24 and MKK44 could also be modulated by additional MinK, we co-expressed MinK with the above constructs and characterized the expressed channel activity. If MinK slows the kinetics of the fusion protein, this effect cannot be due to depletion of MinK-free KvLQT1 as previously suggested by others ((32, 34) but instead must be due to additional modulation of the assembled fusion protein. Co-transfection with additional MinK slows MK24 activation kinetics (Fig.4). In order to quantify this difference, we measured the time to attain half-maximal current (t 12) for each construct and each current measurement. Shown in Fig. 4 D is a summary of this analysis for the influence of MinK co-transfection on t 12for MK24 for measurements at +60 mV. Co-transfection with MinK causes a significant (p < 0.001) difference int 12 for MK24 channels. Interestingly, deactivation kinetics of MK24 are not affected by MinK co-transfection as is evidenced by deactivation tail records shown in Fig. 4, Band C. The slowing of MK24 activation kinetics illustrated at one voltage in Fig. 4 occurs over the entire range of activation (Fig.5 B). In addition, co-expression of MinK with MK24 further alters the voltage dependence of activation as evidenced by the MinK-induced changes in the isochronal activation curve illustrated in Fig. 5 A. These data indicate that additional MinK protein(s) are able to interact with the MinK-KvLQT1 fusion protein MK24, and this interaction specifically alters channel activation but not deactivation kinetics. Also shown for comparison in Fig. 5 are comparable activation (A) and kinetic (B) data for IsK measured in neonatal mouse ventricular cells (21Davies M.P. An R.H. Doevendans P. Kubalak S. Chien K.R. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1995; 78: 15-25Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These data, plotted asopen circles in both panels, are remarkably similar to MinK-KvLQT1 and the MK24 data but are distinct from MK24 + MinK data, strongly suggesting that native IsK channels in cardiac cells assemble with a minimum MinK-KvLQT1 stoichiometry. Our results clearly show that the unique functional properties conferred upon KvLQ1 by incorporation of MinK protein are due to differences in voltage-dependent conformational changes of the assembled MinK-KvLQT1 protein complex. Furthermore, we find that MinK can alter the voltage-dependent gating and kinetic properties of tandem multimer complexes strongly suggesting the existence of more than one MinK/KvLQT1 stoichiometry. Work by others has suggested that MinK lines the pore the of I sKchannel, modifying its permeability (18Tai K.K. Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1654-1658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Tai K.K. Goldstein S.N.

Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) of the expressed channels. Structural analysis of the potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans, which has sequence similarity to KvLQT1 in the P region, raises the possibility that MinK modulation may arise from interactions outside of the KvLQT1 pore (37Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5701) Google Scholar). In contrast, channel gating is a dynamic process, the basis for which structural data are not yet available. Our data showing that MinK modulates the MK24 fusion protein raise the interesting possibility that modulation of gating kinetics may involve interaction sites peripheral to the channel pore and that functional changes in channel activity are the result of allosteric modulation of the channel protein. How the MinK protein confers these properties upon the assembled channel and the identification of key interaction sites that underlie these functional changes remain to be determined. Future experiments in which we restrict the linkage to and size of the MinK construct should be very useful in identifying these residues as well as their biophysical roles. Drugs that target the KvLQT-1-MinK complex, blockers ofI sK, have been developed as Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs (38Kass R.S. Zipes D. Jalife J. Cardiac Electrophysiology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1994: 74-82Google Scholar). Recently, the action of these compounds has been found to be dependent on the interactions between KvLQT1 and MinK proteins (39Busch A.E.

Hence the fusion proteins developed in the present study should prove to be powerful tools in sorting out the molecular mechanisms of these drugs and modifying their activity by targeting key MinK/KvLQT1 interaction domains.

Folding Design. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Both basic protein science and biotechnological applications require that the overexpressed protein attain the correctly folded conformation. This requirement can be particularly daunting if the protein is initially obtained as inclusion bodies, a result that is common in bacterial expression systems. We have recently developed a protein folding strategy that was inspired by the naturally occurring chaperones, e.g. the prokaryotic GroEL/GroES system. Our strategy employs small molecules (“artificial chaperones”) to promote folding from the chemically denatured state (6Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3478-3487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 8Rozema D. Gellman S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15760-15771Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Artificial chaperone-assisted folding involves a two-step protocol, which is in some ways reminiscent of the two-step binding-release mechanism of the GroEL/GroES system (9Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 10Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the first step of the artificial chaperone protocol, a detergent is used to capture the nonnative protein upon dilution of the denaturant to nondenaturing concentrations. For proteins that are difficult to fold, denaturant dilution typically leads to hydrophobically driven protein aggregation rather than folding (1$$Google Scholar, 2$$Google Scholar, 3Jaenicke R.

Folding Design. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). When the artificial chaperone method is used, aggregation is prevented by the formation of protein-detergent complexes, in which hydrophobic regions of nonnative protein molecules are presumably shielded by detergent (6Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Biol.

In the second step of the artificial chaperone protocol, a cyclodextrin is added. The cyclodextrin initiates folding by stripping detergent from the protein-detergent complex. This method has been shown by Couthonet al. (11Couthon F. Cottes E. Vial C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to facilitate refolding of MM-creatine kinase, and an extension of the method allows generation of vesicles containing intact membrane proteins (12DeGrip W.J. VanOostrum J. Bovee-Gurts P.H.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As with most other studies of protein folding methodology, our studies have involved “refolding,” since the proteins employed are obtained commercially in the native state. It is generally assumed that refolding of proteins denatured from the native state should be comparable with folding of proteins solubilized by a denaturant from a misfolded form (e.g. inclusion bodies) (1$$Google Scholar, 2$$Google Scholar, 3Jaenicke R.

The artificial chaperone technique is mechanistically distinct from other methods that employ small molecules to promote protein refolding.

In this “dilution additive” strategy, interactions between the small molecule and the folding protein must be transient, sufficient to discourage protein aggregation but not so strong as to prevent proper folding. This transient interaction in the dilution additive strategy stands in contrast to the stable interaction between nonnative protein and the detergent in the artificial chaperone method.

Two groups have examined the ability of GroE chaperones to promote refolding of Gdm-denatured CS (20Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 21Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An attempt to achieve dilution additive assistance of CS refolding with a detergent was unsuccessful (21Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CS has no structural homology to CAB or lysozyme, and CS differs architecturally from these other two enzymes in requiring quaternary structure formation (homodimerization) for activity (22McEvily A.J. Harrison J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2593-2598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This requirement makes CS a particularly interesting target as we probe the versatility of the artificial chaperone refolding method. Porcine heart citrate synthase was purchased as a suspension in 3.2 m ammonium sulfate from Boehringer Mannheim; this material was used directly in all experiments described here. CTAB, ZW 3–14, POE(10)L, SDS, EDTA, DTT, acetyl-CoA, 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), and oxalacetate were purchased from Sigma. STS was purchased from Lancaster (Windham, NH). Sequanal grade GdmCl and urea were purchased from Pierce. CTAHS was purchased from Aldrich. Centricon concentrators were purchased from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Acetate filters (0.22 μm) were purchased from Fisher. Biobeads® SM-2 were purchased from Bio-Rad. Calbiosorb™ beads were purchased from Calbiosorb (La Jolla, CA). SDR HyperD® was purchased from Biosepra (Marlborough, MA). α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, methylated β-cyclodextrin, and β-cyclodextrin-epichlorhydrin copolymer were gifts from Amaizo, Inc. (Hammond, IN). α-Cyclodextrin and β-cyclodextrin were recrystallized from water. All other materials were used as obtained from suppliers. Protein concentration of commercial suspension was verified after dilution/dissolution by absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1.75 (mg/ml protein)−1 cm−1(23Bloxham D.P. Ericsson L.H. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3979-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The concentration of GdmCl solution was determined by measuring the refractive index (24Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). In a typical GdmCl denaturation/refolding study, 2.4 mg/ml CS (as a suspension in 3.2 m ammonium sulfate) was dissolved in 6m GdmCl and 40 mm DTT and allowed to stand for 1 h. The CS solution was then diluted by a factor of 70 with Tris-chloride buffer containing detergent and EDTA to give concentrations of 0.034 mg/ml CS, 0.57 mm DTT, 86 mm GdmCl, 143 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.71 mm EDTA, and 0.57 mm detergent. After 1 h, 30 μl of 16 mm β-cyclodextrin stock solution was added to 70 μl of the above solution to bring the final concentrations to 0.024 mg/ml CS, 0.4 mm DTT, 60 mm GdmCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mmdetergent, and 4.8 mm β-cyclodextrin. This solution also contained 100 mm ammonium sulfate from the original suspension; when CS was desalted before use, refolding yields were not substantially changed (desalted CS could not be stored for long periods). After sitting overnight, the solutions were assayed for enzymatic activity. In a typical urea denaturation/refolding study, 0.8 mg/ml CS (as a suspension in 3.2 m ammonium sulfate) was dissolved in 8m urea and 13.3 mm DTT and allowed to stand for 1 h. The CS solution was then diluted by a factor of 24 with Tris-chloride buffer containing detergent to give concentrations of 0.034 mg/ml CS, 0.57 mm DTT, 340 mm urea, 143 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.71 mm EDTA, and 0.57 mm detergent. After 1 h, 16 mmβ-cyclodextrin stock solution was added to bring the final concentrations to 0.024 mg/ml CS, 0.4 mm DTT, 240 mm urea, 100 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.4 mm detergent, 4.8 mmβ-cyclodextrin, and 100 mm ammonium sulfate. After sitting overnight, the solutions were assayed for enzymatic activity. For some studies, β-cyclodextrin was added in two parts. The first addition was 1 h after dilution with detergent solution, and the second addition was 10, 200, or 800 min after the first β-cyclodextrin addition. The total volume of β-cyclodextrin solution added was equal in all cases and resulted in solutions of 0.024 mg/ml, 0.4 mm detergent, and a β-cyclodextrin concentration that was optimal for the detergent in question (see Fig.4). CTAB requires 12 equivalents, ZW 3–14 requires 2 equivalents, and POE(10)L and Triton X-100 require 4 equivalents of cyclodextrin. Activity of the CS solutions was determined using an acetyl coenzyme A assay (25Srere P.A. Brazil H. Gonen L. Acta Chemica Scandinavica. 1963; 17: S129-S134Crossref Google Scholar) in which 20 μl of the final CS solution was added to 380 μl of a solution containing 158 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.023 mm acetyl-CoA, 0.5 mm oxalacetate, and 0.12 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid). The final solution contained 0.0012 mg/ml CS, 150 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.02 mm DTT, 3 mm GdmCl, 0.025 mm EDTA, 0.02 mm detergent, 0.024 mm β-cyclodextrin, 0.022 μm acetyl-CoA, 0.48 mm oxalacetate, and 0.11 mm5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid). After 10 s of mixing, the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was measured as a function of time. The absorbance of the solution was measured every 0.5 s for 30 s using a model 8452 diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Mountain View, CA). The initial rate of the change in absorbance was always linear. The yield of refolded CS was determined by comparing the resulting initial rate with the initial rate of native enzyme without additives (Table I).Table ICS refolding dataSampleRelative rateNo denaturationNative CS1.00+ β-cyclodextrin1.04 ± 0.06+ CTAB0.09 ± 0.04+ CTAB; then β-cyclodextrin0.56 ± 0.04+ ZW 3–140.93 ± 0.02+ ZW 3–14; then β-cyclodextrin0.93 ± 0.02+ POE(10)L1.19 ± 0.02+ POE(10)L; then β-cyclodextrin1.23 ± 0.02+ Triton X-1001.14 ± 0.02+ Triton X-100; then β-cyclodextrin1.19 ± 0.02No proteinTris-Cl buffer (pH 7.6)0.01 ± 0.01+ β-cyclodextrin0.01 ± 0.01+ CTAB0.01 ± 0.01+ ZW 3–140.01 ± 0.01+ POE(10)L0.01 ± 0.01+ Triton X-1000.01 ± 0.01Dilution from GdmClNo additive0.05 ± 0.02+ β-cyclodextrin0.04 ± 0.02+ CTAB0.07 ± 0.03+ CTAB; then β-cyclodextrin0.56 ± 0.04+ ZW 3–140.02 ± 0.05+ ZW 3–14; then β-cyclodextrin0.57 ± 0.05+ POE(10)L0.06 ± 0.04+ POE(10)L; then β-cyclodextrin0.62 ± 0.07+ Triton X-1000.01 ± 0.03+ Triton X-100; then β-cyclodextrin0.67 ± 0.07Dilution from ureaNo additive0.07 ± 0.02+ β-cyclodextrin0.06 ± 0.02+ CTAB0.06 ± 0.04+ CTAB; then β-cyclodextrin0.65 ± 0.02+ ZW 3–140.05 ± 0.02+ ZW 3–14; then β-cyclodextrin0.64 ± 0.04+ POE(10)L0.07 ± 0.03+ POE(10)L; then β-cyclodextrin0.59 ± 0.08Activity was judged in terms of relative initial catalytic rates, using a reported assay; all values were normalized to the initial catalytic rate of native CS. CS, 2.4 mg/ml, was denatured for 1 h in 6m GdmCl and 40 mm DTT. The CS solution was then diluted by a factor of 70 with Tris chloride buffer containing detergent and EDTA to give concentrations of 0.034 mg/ml CS, 0.57 mm DTT, 86 mm GdmCl, 143 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.71 mm EDTA, and, when indicated, 0.57 mm detergent.

These solutions stood overnight before assay for enzymatic activity. For the “no denaturation” experiments, samples were assembled in the same way, but no GdmCl was added. Open table in a new tab Activity was judged in terms of relative initial catalytic rates, using a reported assay; all values were normalized to the initial catalytic rate of native CS. CS, 2.4 mg/ml, was denatured for 1 h in 6m GdmCl and 40 mm DTT. The CS solution was then diluted by a factor of 70 with Tris chloride buffer containing detergent and EDTA to give concentrations of 0.034 mg/ml CS, 0.57 mm DTT, 86 mm GdmCl, 143 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.71 mm EDTA, and, when indicated, 0.57 mm detergent. After 1 h, 30 ml of 16 mmβ-cyclodextrin stock solution was added to 70 ml of the above solution to bring the final concentrations to 0.024 mg/ml CS, 0.4 mm DTT, 60 mm GdmCl, 100 mmTris-Cl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm detergent, and 4.8 mm β-cyclodextrin. These solutions stood overnight before assay for enzymatic activity. For the “no denaturation” experiments, samples were assembled in the same way, but no GdmCl was added. A 62A DS CD spectrophotometer (AVIV) was used for CD analysis. For far UV (200–260 nm), 1-mm path length cells were used. For near UV (260–320 nm), 10-mm path length cells were used. Spectra were obtained with one scan, 10-s averaging time, at room temperature. For all samples analyzed by CD, the final Tris-Cl concentration was reduced to 30 mm to minimize absorbance of the buffer at low wavelengths. Control studies showed that the lower buffer concentration did not significantly alter the refolding results. For each sample, a CD spectrum of a reference sample containing Tris-Cl buffer, detergent, and cyclodextrin was subtracted. Light scattering was measured using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Inc., Naperville, IL). Samples were prepared from stock solutions that had been filtered through a 0.22-μm acetate filter. Irradiation and detection wavelengths were 350 nm, and a 3 × 3-mm cuvette was used. The CMC of each detergent under refolding conditions was determined by rocking solid orange OT in a 0.3-ml aliquot containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm EDTA and various concentrations of the detergent (37Eriksson A.E. Jones T.A. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 274-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). After 2 days, a cotton plug was used to filter off the undissolved orange OT. The filtrate was diluted by a factor of 4 with ethanol. The absorbance was measured at 500 nm in a 10-mm path length cuvette. The absorbance was plotted as a function of detergent concentration. Two linear regions were observed, the intersection of which was taken to define the CMC of the detergent. CS was isolated after refolding by filtering 1.0 ml of CS solution through a 0.22-μm acetate filter to remove aggregated proteins. The filtrate was then concentrated to a volume of 0.5 ml with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Centricon filter. Refolded CS solutions were then compared with native CS solutions by absorbance at 280 nm and specific activity. A stirred solution of 4-tert-octylphenol (0.56 g, 2.7 mmol) in dry CH3OH (15 ml) was treated with KOH (1.218 g, 22 mmol). After 15 min, all volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in dry CH3CN (35 ml) and treated with 3-bromo-1-propanol (0.25 ml, 2.8 mmol) followed by overnight stirring. Removal of solids by filtration and chromatographic purification (silica; 30% EtOAc/hexane, R F = 0.2) gave 3-(4-tert-octylphenoxy)-1-propanol as a clear oil (0.63 g, 88%). This alcohol (0.58 g, 2.2 mmol) and CBr4 (0.96 g, 2.9 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) and treated dropwise with a solution of PPh3 (0.73 g, 2.9 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (30 ml). The removal of solids by filtration after overnight stirring and chromatographic purification of the residue after solvent removal (silica; 10% EtOAc/hexane,R F = 0.9) gave 1-bromo-3-(4-tert-octylphenoxy)propane as a clear oil (0.44 g, 62%). 1-Bromo-3-(4-tert-octylphenoxy)propane (4.56 g, 13.9 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (120 ml) was treated with an excess of Me2NH in tetrahydrofuran (10 ml). After 24 h, the reaction mixture was washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed, and the residue was purified on silica gel (6% NH3-saturated MeOH in CHCl3, R F = 0.2) to giveN-(3-(4-tert-butylphenoxy)-N,N-dimethylamine as a clear oil (3.52 g, 87%). Overnight reflux of this amine (1.1 g, 4.7 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (8 ml) with 1,3-propanesultone (0.39 ml, 4.5 mmol) gave the desired detergent as a white solid, isolated by filtration under N2. Recrystallization from acetone/2-propanol gave 1 as white prisms (1.1 g, 69%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD3OD) δ 7.30 (m, 2H), 6.86 (m, 2H), 4.08 (t, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 3.56 (m, 4H), 3.14 (s, 6H), 2.88 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 2.28 (m, 4H), 1.27 (s, 9H); 13C NMR (75.4 MHz, CD3OD) δ 157.6 (C), 145.0 (C), 127.3 (CH), 115.1 (CH), 65.6 (CH2), 63.8 (CH2), 63.1 (CH2), 51.50 and 51.45 and 51.40 (triplet, quaternary CH3), 48.6 (CH2), 34.9 (C), 32.0 (CH3), 25.2 (CH3), 23.9 (CH2), 19.9 (CH2). Compound 2 was prepared by an analogous procedure:1H NMR (300 MHz, CD3OD) δ 7.28 (m, 2H), 6.85 (m, 2H), 4.08 (t, J = 6.5 Hz, 2H), 3.58 (m, 4H), 3.14 (s, 6H), 2.88 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 2.26 (m, 4H), 1.73 (s, 2H), 1.33 (s, 6H), 0.69 (s, 9H); 13C NMR (75.4 MHz, CD3OD) δ 157.6 (C), 143.7 (C), 128.3 (CH), 114.9 (CH), 65.5 (CH2), 64.7 (CH3), 63.9 (CH2), 63.1 (CH2), 58.0 (CH2), 51.55 and 51.50 and 51.45 (triplet CH3), 48.6 (CH2), 38.9 (C), 33.1 (C), 32.4 and 32.3 (CH3), 25.3 (CH3), 24.0 (CH2), 19.9 (CH2). Both structures were verified by x-ray crystallography. The results of CS refolding experiments and the appropriate controls are shown in Table I in terms of enzymatic activity (initial catalytic rates). All measurements were normalized to native CS activity. When 2.4 mg/ml CS was denatured with 6m GdmCl or 8 m urea and 40 mm DTT for 1 h and then diluted 100-fold, only 5–7% of the original CS activity was recovered. Light scattering analysis indicates that extensive protein aggregation occurs under these conditions. Thus, denaturation effectively inactivates CS, and simple dilution of chemically denatured protein leads to very little unassisted refolding, which is consistent with previous reports (20Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 21Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, dilution in the presence of detergent, followed by the addition of cyclodextrin to the CS-detergent complexes provides approximately 60% recovery of native CS activity. Light scattering studies indicate that some of the protein aggregates upon the addition of cyclodextrin to CS-detergent complexes, which would account for the incomplete regain of native activity. Thus, stripping of detergent from the nonnative protein initiates a competition between proper refolding and aggregation. The optimal CS refolding yield is lower than optimal yields obtained for CAB (7Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3478-3487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and lysozyme (8Rozema D. Gellman S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15760-15771Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) at similar concentrations with the artificial chaperone method. It is noteworthy that CS refolding is successful with detergents from several classes, including cationic (CTAB), zwitterionic (ZW 3–14) and nonionic (POE(10)L and Triton X-100), because CAB (7Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3478-3487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and lysozyme (8Rozema D. Gellman S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15760-15771Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) refolding require ionic or zwitterionic detergents for success. Nonionic detergents initially appeared to be optimal for CS refolding, with CTAB decidedly inferior (6Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We have subsequently discovered that CTAB is indeed a successful artificial chaperone for CS if sufficient cyclodextrin is used at the stripping step; CTAB requires proportionally more cyclodextrin than do nonionic detergents (this point is discussed further below). Anionic detergents SDS and STS are successful artificial chaperones for refolding of urea-denatured CAB 2Hanson, P. E., and Gellman, S. H. (1998)Folding & Design, in press. ; however, neither SDS nor STS is an effective artificial chaperone for urea-denatured CS (data not shown). (These anionic detergents cannot be used with Gdm-denatured proteins because the guanidinium-alkylsulfate salts precipitate.) We prepared two new zwitterionic detergents, 1 and2 (Scheme FS1), for evaluation as artificial chaperones. Detergent 1 contains thep-t-octylphenyl unit that is found in Triton X-100; 2 contains a p-t-butylphenyl unit for enhanced aqueous solubility relative to 1. We have previously reported that anionic and cationic derivatives of Triton X-100 can promote CAB (7Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3478-3487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and lysozyme (8Rozema D. Gellman S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15760-15771Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) refolding (the anionic derivative is now commercially available from Calbiochem). The susceptibility of CS to refolding assistance with other zwitterionic detergents provided an opportunity to complete our series ofp-t-butylphenyl-based detergents. CMC values of ∼0.6 mm for 1 and ∼1.5 mm for2 in water were estimated by the orange OT solubilization method (28Schott H. J. Phys. Chem. 1964; 68: 3612-3619Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The similarity of CMC values contrasted with a profound difference in aqueous solubilities (∼5 mm for1 versus 1.4 m for 2). Neither of these new detergents assisted CS refolding in the artificial chaperone mode. Control studies demonstrate that CS refolding is not promoted by either detergents or cyclodextrins via the dilution additive mechanism under the conditions we employ for artificial chaperone-assisted refolding. Data in Table I show that simply diluting chemically denatured CS in the presence of detergents gives only 2–7% regained enzymatic activity, i.e. that there is no improvement relative to dilution in the absence of detergent. These results are consistent with the findings of Zhi et al. (21Zhi W. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Srere P.A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), who were unable to promote refolding of chemically denatured CS with lauryl maltoside as a dilution additive. It has been reported that refolding of Gdm-denatured CAB can be enhanced by using high concentrations of cyclodextrin as a dilution additive (16Karuppiah N. Sharma A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We find a maximum of 25% regain of CS activity when the dilution buffer contains 100 mm methylated β-cyclodextrin, and this regain diminishes to 16% for 25 mm methylated β-cyclodextrin (protein concentration, buffer, etc. as described in Table I). The very modest CS refolding efficacy of cyclodextrin in the dilution additive mode parallels our earlier findings with CAB (7Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3478-3487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cleland et al. (18Cleland J.L. Builder S.E. Swartz J.R. Winkler M. Chang J.Y. Wang D.I.C.

In addition to its function as a regulatory molecule in organisms ranging from humans to slime molds, nitric oxide possesses potent and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (1Fang F.C. J. Clin.

A growing body of evidence indicates that bacteria are capable of inducing protective enzymes in the presence of NO and other reactive nitrogen intermediates, a process recently termed the nitrosative stress response (2Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The SoxRS system, which is activated by superoxide generators, will stimulate antioxidant genes in reaction to NO⋅ and defend Escherichia coli from the NO-dependent bactericidal activity of macrophages (3Nunoshiba T.

OxyR, a transcription factor involved in stimulation of peroxide detoxification genes, is directly modified by NO viaS-nitrosylation and assists in protecting the bacterium from the NO donor S-nitrosocysteine (2Hausladen A.

Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C, one of the enzymes influenced by OxyR, has been shown to protect Salmonella typhimurium from another NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) (4Chen L. Xie Q.-W.

Genet. 1991; 226: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although the promoter activities of some flavohemoglobins are influenced by oxygen availability (7LaCelle M. Kumano M. Kurita K. Yamane K. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Crawford M.J. Sherman D.R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6991-6996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), nitrogen oxides are known to induce the transcription of these proteins in other organisms. Flavohemoglobin in the fungus Fusarium oxysporum is present only during denitrification, an anaerobic electron transport pathway that reduces nitrate to dinitrogen via nitrogen oxide intermediates (10Takaya N. Suzuki S. Matsuo M. Shoun H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A flavohemoglobin mutant strain of the denitrifying bacteriumAlcaligenes eutrophus is deficient in the transient production of nitrous oxide (N2O), an intermediate that is immediately downstream of NO⋅ in the denitrification pathway (11Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7349-7354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many other flavohemoglobin-containing organisms do not have the denitrifying capability of F. oxysporum or A. eutrophus. Some, such as E. coli and B. subtilis, will reduce nitrite to ammonia or ammonium rather than nitric oxide (12Cole J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ogawa K. Akagawa E. Yamane K. Sun Z.W. LaCelle M. Zuper P. Nakano M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1409-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, purified NO⋅ was found to be a major inducer of flavohemoglobin (hmp) promoter activity in E. coli (14Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). An hmp/lacZ operon fusion was stimulated approximately 20-fold by 20 μmnitric oxide, while requiring 8 mm nitrite and 40 mm nitrate to give similar results. Unlike the nitrite and nitrate effects, which are escalated anaerobically, the NO⋅induction is largely independent of O2 concentration. TheB. subtilis hmp is also induced by comparable levels of nitrite, but the influence of nitric oxide was not reported (7LaCelle M. Kumano M. Kurita K. Yamane K. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, purified E. coli flavohemoglobin was demonstrated to oxidize NO⋅ to the less toxic nitrate (15Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), thus assigning an enzymatic activity to the nitrosative stress protection shown by phenotypic analyses (5Crawford M.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12543-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The elements responsible for the NO⋅-dependent expression of flavohemoglobins are not known. Although the ResDE two-component system accounts for some of the anaerobic expression ofhmp in B. subtilis, factors contributing to the nitrite induction were not elucidated (7LaCelle M. Kumano M. Kurita K. Yamane K. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains harboring null alleles of narL and narP, which regulate nitrate and nitrite reductases, do not substantially alterhmp expression (14Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). FNR, a transcription factor known to positively regulate a flavohemoglobin homolog in the bacteriumVitreoscilla as well as many denitrification enzymes in other species, actually represses anaerobic expression of the E. coli hmp (14Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Joshi M. Dikshit K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The NO⋅ expression is also largely independent of the SoxRS system in E. coli (14Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition to nitrogen oxides, the iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl significantly enhances E. coli hmp expression. This induction was tentatively attributed to deactivation of FNR, which requires iron for function (14Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that the S. typhimurium hmpgene expression is induced by the NO donors and that the transcriptional repressor Fur is the primary factor responsible forhmp regulation. Nitric oxide causes a general derepression of other Fur-regulated genes, suggesting a new mechanism of NO action on bacterial gene expression. Spermine NONOate (2,2′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazono)bisethanamine) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). MacConkey agar and LB broth were acquired from Difco. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was made as described previously (18Stamler J.S. Loscalzo J. Anal. Chem. 1992; 64: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The strains in this study are listed in Table I. To obtain an integrated hmp/lacZ operon fusion, a 1-kilobase pairSalI/SmaI DNA fragment containing approximately 950 base pairs of hmp upstream sequence was isolated from pMC71 and ligated into the SmaI site of pFUSE, a suicide plasmid that harbors the promoterless lacZYA operon (19Baumler A. Tsolis R. van der Velden A. Stojiljkovic I. Anic S. Heffron F. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid was propagated in E. coli strain S17-1 lpir (20Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar) and transformed into S. typhimurium14028s, making MCS38. Integration at the hmp locus was confirmed by Southern blot (not shown). Transductions of various transcription factor null alleles into MCS38 were performed using bacteriophage P22 (21Sternberg N.L. Maurer R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 18-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Details on the construction of plasmids pSKO1/2 and pSKO3/4, used in the Fur titration assay, were described previously (5Crawford M.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab All liquid cultures were grown in LB broth. When necessary, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: 100 mg/ml ampicillin, 50 mg/ml kanamycin, 25 mg/ml chloramphenicol, 15 mg/ml tetracycline. For SPER/NO growth curves, 250 ml of bacteria from an overnight culture was inoculated into a 125-ml culture flask containing 25 ml of medium. The bacteria were then allowed to grow at 37 °C for 1 h with 225 rpm shaking before the introduction of 1 mm SPER/NO. Turbidities were followed using a Klett colorimeter. For gene expression studies, overnight cultures were diluted 1/100 into test tubes containing 2 ml of medium and were shaken at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Unless otherwise indicated, 1 mm SPER/NO or 0.2 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl was introduced, and the cultures were allowed to incubate for another 2 h. To stop gene expression, 300 mg/ml spectinomycin was added 5 min before harvesting. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in Z buffer (23Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar), and permeabilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate and chloroform. β-Galactosidase activities, which were assayed in triplicate, are expressed as Miller units (23Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times with two independently isolated clones. For the Fur titration assay, bacteria from overnight cultures were streaked onto MacConkey agar with ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C (24Stojiljkovic I. Baumler A. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To facilitate gene expression studies on hmp, we used an S. typhimurium strain harboring a single copy of an hmp/lacZ operon fusion. The expression construct contains 920 base pairs of hmp upstream sequence fused to the promoterless lacZYA operon in the suicide plasmid pFUSE (19Baumler A. Tsolis R. van der Velden A. Stojiljkovic I. Anic S. Heffron F. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As confirmed by Southern as well as by phenotypic analyses using NO donors (not shown), the endogenous hmp gene was not affected by this integration event. Spermine NONOate (SPER/NO), a well characterized NO⋅ donor (25Hirasaki A. Jones K. Perkins W. Warner D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1269-1275PubMed Google Scholar, 26Maragos C. Wang J. Hrabie J. Oppenheim J. Keefer L. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 564-568PubMed Google Scholar), was employed to determine sensitivities of wild-type and hmp − strains as well as hmp promoter activity in response to nitric oxide. Using 1 mm SPER/NO, a growth delay is observed for both strains but is much more pronounced in the hmp −mutant (Fig. 1). Addition of SPER/NO induces the hmp promoter approximately 20-fold (Fig.2). We examined the transcription factors known to respond to nitric oxide (SoxS and OxyR) or to influencehmp transcription in E. coli (Fnr) for their contribution to aerobic hmp expression in S. typhimurium (2Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 15Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc.

Immun. 1995; 63: 794-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains harboring null alleles ofsoxS, oxyR, and fnr are still able to respond to SPER/NO (Fig. 2), indicating that a previously uncharacterized pathway is responsible for the NO⋅-dependent expression of flavohemoglobin.Figure 2The hmp/lacZfusion is induced by SPER/NO independently of SoxS, OxyR, and FNR. Strains carrying an integrated hmp/lacZ operon fusion were assayed for reporter expression in exponentially growing cultures with or without 1 mm SPER/NO. Shown are β-galactosidase-specific activities of strains MCS38 (WT), MCS41 (soxS), MCS43 (oxyR), MCS45 (fnr). Results are means ± S.E. for three experiments, all done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Low iron conditions increase expression of E. coli hmp (14Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide is known to react with transition metals and may therefore perturb cellular iron levels (28Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SPER/NO effect on the hmp promoter is specific or due to a more general phenomenon of iron metabolism, we also tested iroAand iroC reporter fusions, which were originally isolated because of their induction under low-iron conditions (19Baumler A. Tsolis R. van der Velden A. Stojiljkovic I. Anic S. Heffron F. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Foster J.W. Hall H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4317-4323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to induction by the iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl, the β-galactosidase activity driven by these promoters is also stimulated by 1 mm SPER/NO (Fig. 3). Therefore, NO appears to cause widespread alteration of iron-regulated gene expression in S. typhimurium. The iroA andiroC promoters are repressed by the Fur protein, a global transcriptional regulator that is active when bound to ferrous iron (19Baumler A. Tsolis R. van der Velden A. Stojiljkovic I. Anic S. Heffron F. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Foster J.W. Hall H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4317-4323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether a fur null allele could influence the hmp/lacZ fusion. Complete derepression occurs in the fur background, which cannot be augmented with the addition of 2,2′-dipyridyl and/or SPER/NO (Fig.4). To determine if the hmppromoter is capable of binding Fur, a fur titration assay (FURTA) was performed (24Stojiljkovic I. Baumler A. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this assay, a high copy number plasmid carrying a putative Fur-binding element is introduced into a strain that carries a Fur-repressed lacZ fusion. If the plasmid is capable of binding Fur, a titration of this repressor will occur, leading to expression of the lacZ reporter. A plasmid containing 213 base pairs upstream of the hmp start codon is able to derepress the iroC/lacZ fusion (Fig.5) on MacConkey plates, whereas a plasmid with an insert containing a portion of the hmp open reading frame is not positive by FURTA. There is a sequence (5′-TCTAATGATGTATATCAAA-3′) found over the transcription start site in the hmp promoter that can be aligned to the consensus “Fur box” (5′-GATAATGATAATCATTATC-3′) (24Stojiljkovic I. Baumler A. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This level of identity to the consensus (10/19 matches) is equivalent to that of another FURTA-positive clone (pFTE-1) found during a general screen for Fur-regulated genes in S. typhimurium (30Tsolis R. Baumler A. Stojiljkovic I. Heffron F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4628-4637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Fur is capable of binding the hmppromoter in vivo. A Fur titration assay (24Stojiljkovic I. Baumler A. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was performed using high copy number plasmids harboring thehmp promoter region (pSKO1) (a) or a portion of the hmp open reading frame transformed into AJB27 (b), which harbors the Fur-repressed iroC/lacZfusion. The resultant strains (MCS32 and MCS33) are plated on MacConkey agar with ampicillin, which will turn red (dark) upon the expression of β-galactosidase. c, to confirm that the color observed is dependent on the integrated reporter and not on the plasmid, pSKO1 was also transformed into wild-type S. typhimurium 14028 (MCS34).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The finding that Fur, well characterized for its regulation of iron scavenging (31Bagg A. Neilands J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also influences the expression ofhmp raises the possibility that flavohemoglobin may function in the processing of intracellular iron. Consequentially, we tested the effects of 2,2′-dipyridyl on growth and hmp/lacZ activity in the hmp − strain. No differences in growth rates between wild-type and hmp − strains could be demonstrated for any concentration of the iron chelator (not shown). Also, the expression of the hmp/lacZ fusions as a function of 2,2′-dipyridyl concentration is equivalent in both wild-type andhmp − strains (Fig.6 a). In contrast, induction of the hmp/lacZ reporter in the hmp −strain is more sensitive to SPER/NO than wild type (Fig.6 b). S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), another nitric oxide donor that causes an accentuated growth deficiency in thehmp − strain (5Crawford M.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12543-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), is able to induce thehmp/lacZ fusion and provides a more dramatic (approximately 10-fold) decrease in the quantity needed for hmp gene induction in the hmp mutant background when compared with wild type (Fig. 6 c). GSNO also causes a greater relative growth impairment in the hmp − strain than SPER/NO (not shown). With increasing concentrations of NO donors, expression begins to decline after maximal gene induction (Fig. 6). This phenomenon is likely the result of toxicity to the strains, since cell growth diminishes at these concentrations. It is interesting to note that GSNO does not achieve the induction levels seen with SPER/NO. This may be due to the more complex chemistry of the nitric oxide species coming from GSNO. Unlike SPER/NO, which should provide a relatively pure source of the NO⋅ radical (32Ramamurthi A. Lewis R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), GSNO will donate both NO⋅as well as the nitrisonium ion (NO+) (33Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Therefore, NO⋅ may be the major form of nitric oxide regulatinghmp gene expression. In addition to its role in iron acquisition, Fur is postulated to regulate general metabolic processes as well as adaptation to acid stress (24Stojiljkovic I. Baumler A. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 29Foster J.W. Hall H.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4317-4323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here on the regulation ofS. typhimurium flavohemoglobin demonstrate that the influence of Fur extends to the nitrosative stress response. We show that nitric oxide will derepress other iron-regulated promoters. The role of NO in control of iron metabolism has precedent in mammalian systems, although at a different level of regulation (34Drapier J. Hirling H. Weitzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kuhn L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 35Weiss G. Goossen W. Doppler D. Fuchs K. Pantopolous G. Werner-Felmayer H. Wachter H. Hentze M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The translation factors IRP-1 and IRP-2, which are thought to sense iron levels through the gain or loss of Fe-S clusters, control protein expression from several mRNAs involved in the uptake of iron. Nitric oxide is thought to mimic or cause iron deficiency by destruction of these clusters or by complexing with free iron, leading to depletion of the cellular iron pool (36Pantopolous K. Weiss G. Hentze M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A similar situation may occur in a bacterial cell under nitrosative stress. NO could induce the conversion of Fe-Fur to an inactive Fur by modification of the iron or protein moiety. Alternatively, iron can react with nitric oxide to form dinitrosyl iron complexes, which may effectively sequester cellular iron in an unusable form. The formation of these complexes occurs in macrophages upon induction of nitric oxide synthase (37Pellat C. Henry Y. Drapier C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Lancaster J. Hibbs J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and is thought to assist in creating the low iron environment found in these cells (39Vanin A. Mordvintcev P. Hauschildt S. Mulsch A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1177: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have shown that the hmp promoter is capable of binding Fur in vivo, and a putative Fur box is found over the start site of hmp transcription. We were, however, unable to find anything resembling a Fur box in either the E. coli or B. subtilis hmp promoters. Therefore, if Fur is influencing hmp expression in these organisms, it might be through a novel binding site or by indirect means. Sensitivity to nitric oxide (or NO donors) is the only known growth or gene expression difference between wild-type andhmp − strains (5Crawford M.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12543-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 15Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Thehmp − strain is no more sensitive than wild type to iron chelation, bolstering the hypothesis that Hmp is involved with nitrosative stress protection rather than with general iron maintenance. Control of iron uptake, however, is an elaborate and complex process (40Crosa J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We currently cannot rule out the possibility that flavohemoglobin is involved with an aspect of iron metabolism that is particularly sensitive to nitric oxide. Like flavohemoglobin, the expression of superoxide dismutase, an enzyme involved in oxidative stress protection, is regulated by Fur (41Niederhoffer E. Naranjo C. Bradley K. Fee J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1930-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to SoxRS and OxyR (2Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Nunoshiba T. DeRojas-Walker T. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas reactive oxygen intermediates will undergo Fenton chemistry with iron to create highly toxic metabolites (42Halliwell B. Gutterridge J. Biochem.

Despite the induction of superoxide dismutase, the E. coli fur mutant is hypersusceptible to oxygen metabolites and cannot grow aerobically without an efficient DNA repair mechanism (43Touati D.

It will prove interesting to assess the contribution of intracellular iron levels to nitrosative stress and the role that Fur and Hmp play in this process.

In fibroblastic cells, activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ha-Ras or its effector kinase, c-Raf-1, initiates a signaling pathway that blocks integrin activation (10Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W.

This suppressor activity correlates with the activation of the ERK MAP1 kinase pathway and does not require mRNA transcription or protein synthesis. The downstream effectors or regulators of this integrin suppression pathway remain to be identified. Integrin activation is readily measured by the binding of activation-dependent ligands, which can be used as a selective marker in expression cloning schemes. One such scheme (10Hughes P.E.

Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar) uses a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (αβpy cells) stably expressing a chimeric integrin (αIIbα6Aβ3β1) that contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains of αIIbβ3 fused to the cytoplasmic domains of α6Aβ1. This chimeric integrin has the ligand binding properties of αIIbβ3, and its activation state is regulated through the α6Aβ1 cytoplasmic domains. Consequently, flow cytometry (FACS) can be used to assess the activation state of the chimeric integrin by measuring the binding of fibrinogen or the ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibody, PAC1. To elucidate Ras-induced integrin suppression, we modified this scheme to identify proteins that prevent Ras suppression. Specifically, we used Ras to suppress integrin activation in αβpy cells and isolated co-transfected cDNAs that blocked this suppression. Here we report that PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched inastrocytes), a small death effector domain (DED)-containing protein, blocks Ras suppression downstream of MAP kinase via a pathway blocked by a dominant interfering mutant of a distinct small GTPase, R-Ras. αβpy cells are a CHO cell line that expresses the polyoma large T antigen and a constitutively active recombinant chimeric integrin (αIIbα6Aβ3β1) (12Baker E.K.

Expression cloning was done using αβpy cells. αβpy cells were divided into 18 subconfluent 100-mm plates and co-transfected with Tac-α5 (2 μg/plate), Ha-RasG12V (3 μg/plate) and a CHO-K1 library (4 μg/plate) using LipofectAmineTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and stained for FACs analysis with antibodies PAC1 and 7G7B6 as described previously (9O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Cells that bound high levels of both PAC1 and 7G7B6 were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSTAR, Becton Dickinson). Plasmid DNA was extracted from collected cells by Hirt Supernatant (20Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). This plasmid DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli MC1061/P3 cells. Bacterial colonies were grown, stored, and pooled into groups of 16 for plasmid purification (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and analysis. To isolate single cDNAs that reverse Ras suppression of PAC1 binding, groups of cDNAs were transfected into αβpy cells along with Ha-RasG12V and Tac-α5. Transfectants were screened by two-color flow cytometry (FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson) as described above. A group containing cDNAs that reverse Ras suppression was identified and divided into groups of four for further screening. Positive groups were finally screened as single cDNAs. An HA-tagged PEA-15 lacking the 3′-UTR was created by PCR of CHO PEA-15-pcDNA1 clone using pfu polymerase (New England Biolabs). The amplified product was subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3. HA-tagged DED and C-terminal domains of PEA-15 were similarly constructed by PCR. PEA-15(D74A) was constructed using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene). DD-PEA-15 was constructed by splice-overlap PCR with pcDNA3-FADD and CHO PEA-15-pcDNA1 as templates. The insert was subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3. Mutations were verified by sequencing. Analytical two-color flow cytometry was done as described (9O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In transiently transfected αβpy cells, PAC1 binding was determined for transfected cells (cells positive for the co-transfected Tac-α5 as measured by 7G7B6 binding). Integrin activation was quantitated as an activation index (AI) defined as 100 × (F −F r)/(F LIBS6 −F r) in which F is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding; F r is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of competitive inhibitor (Ro43-5054, 1 μm); andF LIBS6 is the median fluorescence intensity in the presence of anti-LIBS6 (2 μm). From this we calculated the percent inhibition as 100 × (AI − AIS)/AI, in which AI is the activation index of control cells and AIS is the activation index in the presence of a transfected suppressing cDNA. For ERK kinase assays, αβpy cells were transfected with HA-ERK2 (2 μg) along with test cDNA such as pcDNA3-PEA15 (3 μg) using LipofectAmineTM (20 μl/plate, Life Technologies, Inc.). In instances where more than one test plasmid is used, the amount of DNA transfected was standardized by addition of pcDNA1 control vector. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in ice-cold M2 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 3 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). ERK2 activity was measured by an immune-complex assay (from 100 μg of cell lysate protein) using myelin basic protein as a substrate (18Renshaw M.W. Lea-Chou E. Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ERK2 activity was determined by autoradiography. To elucidate the mechanism of Ras-mediated suppression of integrin activation, we used an expression cloning strategy to identify proteins that prevent Ras suppression (Fig.1 A). αβpy cells were co-transfected with activated Ha-Ras and a CHO cell cDNA library. We used flow cytometry to isolate cells that still bound the activation-specific anti-αIIbβ3 antibody, PAC-1, despite transfection with activated Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 B,left panel, box). Seventy-nine cDNAs were recovered from isolated cells. One of these cDNAs, R36, restored PAC1 binding in cells transfected with activated Ras (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). Indeed, R36 transfection resulted in FACS profiles similar to those observed in the absence of Ras suppression (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Ras expression levels in the PEA-15 transfected cells remained comparable to cells transfected with Ras alone (Fig.1 C). Thus, the reversal of Ras suppression was not due to a loss of Ras expression. R36 contained 1,700 base pairs encoding an open reading frame of 130 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number AF080001). A BLAST data base search indicated that the 130-amino acid sequence is 99% identical to mouse phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes (PEA-15, Fig.2 A) (21Danziger N. Yokoyama M. Jay T. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1016-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The first 80 amino acids of PEA-15 correspond to the canonical DED sequence found in proteins that regulate apoptotic signaling pathways (22Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar, 23Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,A and B). In fact, the PEA-15 DED is more similar to that of FADD than that of the viral DED-containing protein MC159 (Fig. 2 B). The remaining 50 amino acids contain a serine (Ser-104) that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (25Araujo H. Danziger N. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5911-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a serine (Ser-116) phosphorylated by calcium calmodulin kinase II (26Kubes M. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Girault J.A. Chneiweiss H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). No function has yet been ascribed to PEA-15. The sequence of R36 also contained a predicted 1190-base pair 3′-UTR containing a polyadenylation signal and poly(A) tract. The final 1050 bases of this region are 70% identical to MAT1, a transforming cDNA isolated from a lithium-induced mouse mammary tumor (27Bera T.K. Guzman R.C. Miyamoto S. Panda D.K. Sasaki M. Hanyu K. Enami J. Nandi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9789-9793Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 3′-UTR is necessary for the reversal of Ha-Ras integrin suppression, we tested a construct without this sequence and found that it functioned like the full-length cDNA (data not shown). More than half of the PEA-15 protein consists of a conserved DED (Fig. 2,A and B). This domain, to date, is associated with proteins involved in apoptosis (28Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Arnold E. Varfolomeev E.E. Brodianskii V.M. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29Hu S. Vincenz C. Buller M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 31Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). To determine if the DED of PEA-15 is necessary or sufficient for PEA-15 reversal of Ras suppression, we overexpressed mutant forms of PEA-15 in αβpy cells in this assay. Overexpression of only the DED of PEA-15 did not reverse Ras suppression (Fig. 2 C). It is therefore not sufficient for this function. Mutants of PEA-15 lacking the DED (C-Term) were also unable to reverse Ras suppression (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, a conserved aspartate is present in a RxDLL sequence in all DEDs (32Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar) (asterisk in Fig. 2 B). Mutation of this aspartate (D74A) prevented PEA-15 reversal of Ras suppression (Fig.2 C). The structure of the DED is similar to that of the death domain (DD) of FADD (33Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Substitution of the DD of FADD for the DED of PEA-15 yielded a chimeric molecule incapable of reversing Ras suppression (Fig. 2 C). In all cases, mutant PEA-15 constructs were expressed (Fig. 2 D). The DED of PEA-15 is therefore necessary, but not sufficient, for reversal of Ras suppression. Additionally, substitution of the DED of PEA-15 with the DED of FADD resulted in a chimeric protein that induced apoptosis (data not shown). This indicates that the DED of PEA-15 is functionally distinct from that of FADD and contains primary sequence information required for PEA-15 function. Thus, our studies define a new function for DEDs. Ras suppresses integrin activation by activating a MAP kinase pathway (10Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). When activated Ras (RasG12V) and PEA-15 were co-expressed, the integrins were not suppressed although the activated variant of Ras was present. Consequently, we assessed the effect of PEA-15 on other activated components of the MAP kinase pathway. Exchange factor mediated GTP loading, and activation of Ras initiates the MAP kinase pathway (34Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar,35Robinson M.J. Cheng M. Khokhlatchev A. Ebert D. Ahn N. Guan K.L. Stein B. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29734-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Active Ras recruits and thus activates Raf kinase. We found that PEA-15 could reverse suppression initiated by an activated Raf (RafCAAX, Fig. 3 A), indicating that its site of action is distal to Raf activation. Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn activates ERK. PEA-15 also rescued suppression mediated by activated MEK (MEK2 222/226D, Fig.3 A) and did not block ERK activation (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that PEA-15 function is distal to ERK. PEA-15 might reverse Ras suppression by activating effectors that oppose Ras signaling to integrins. R-Ras is a Ras-related GTP-binding protein that activates integrins (19Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and reverses Ha-Ras suppression of integrin activation. 2T. Sethi, M. Ginsberg, J. Downward, and P. Hughes, submitted for publication. Like PEA-15, R-Ras does not affect Ha-Ras activation of Erk. Consequently, we asked if the capacity of PEA-15 to reverse suppression depends on R-Ras. A dominant-negative R-Ras (R-RasT43N) blocked the ability of PEA-15 to reverse suppression by activated Ha-Ras (Fig.4 A). Cells expressing the dominant-negative R-RasT43N had moderately reduced expression of PEA-15 and Ha-Ras (Fig. 4 B); however Ha-Ras expression levels remained sufficient to suppress integrin activity (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the reduced expression levels of Ha-Ras do not account for the effects of dominant-negative R-Ras. Furthermore, activated R-Ras still reversed suppression when co-expressed with the dominant-negative R-RasT43N (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, the effect of R-RasT43N was upstream of R-Ras. These results indicate that PEA-15 inhibition of Ha-Ras suppression is impaired by expression of a dominant-negative R-Ras construct. Because R-Ras and Ha-Ras are similar (36Lowe D.G. Capon D.J. Delwart E. Sakaguchi A.Y. Naylor S.L. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1987; 48: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), they may share some of the same guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (37Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but R-Ras is also regulated by effectors and activators distinct from those that control Ha-Ras (38Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative form of R-Ras we used probably sequesters GEFs (39Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). Consistent with this site of action, DN-R-Ras failed to affect rescue mediated by an activated variant of R-Ras (G38V). Furthermore, a DN-Ha-Ras construct did not affect PEA-15 reversal of suppression. Hence, the DN-R-Ras acts by blocking events specific for R-Ras and not ones common to both Ha-Ras and R-Ras. Similarly, dominant-negative constructs of the small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42, Rac, and Rho did not prevent PEA-15 reversal of Ras suppression (data not shown), further suggesting that the effect is R-Ras-specific. R-Ras activates integrins (19Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and reverses Ha-Ras suppression of integrin activation (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, PEA-15 may reverse Ras suppression via an R-Ras-dependent mechanism. The proteins involved in R-Ras regulation remain unclear (40Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that PEA-15 could be a novel upstream regulator of R-Ras activity. Alternatively, the effects of the dominant-negative R-Ras construct may be due to interference with the closely related protein TC21/R-Ras2 (41Graham S.M. Cox A.D. Drivas G. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4108-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42Chan A.M. Miki T. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to analyze the potential interplay between PEA-15 and R-Ras. In summary, we used an expression cloning scheme to identify proteins that prevent Ha-Ras suppression of integrin activation. We report that the DED-containing protein, PEA-15, blocks Ras suppression. PEA-15 does not inhibit Ras activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway, but rather blocks Ras suppression via a pathway inhibited by a dominant-negative form of R-Ras. Finally, the DED of PEA-15 is necessary, but not sufficient, for the reversal of Ras suppression. Hence, these data provide evidence that DED-containing proteins can regulate integrin activation as well as apoptosis.

Here, regulation by tyrosine kinase (TK) activity was investigated for inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir2.1) channels that control membrane excitability in many central neurons. In mammalian tsA-201 cells, the membrane-permeable protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, perorthovanadate (100 μm), suppressed currents through recombinant Kir2.1 channels by 60 ± 20%. Coapplication of the TK inhibitor genistein (100 μm) completely abolished this effect. Native Kir2.1 channels in rat basophilic leukocytes were affected by manipulation of the TK and protein tyrosine phosphatase activity in a qualitatively similar manner. Site mutation of a tyrosine consensus residue for TK phosphorylation in the C-terminal domain of Kir2.1 generated channel properties indistinguishable from wild-type Kir2.1 channels. However, Kir2.1Y242F channels were no longer suppressed following exposure to perorthovanadate, indicating that the channel is a direct substrate for TKs. After coexpression of nerve growth factor receptor with Kir2.1 channels in tsA-201 cells andXenopus oocytes, the activity of Kir2.1 was rapidly suppressed by applied nerve growth factor (0.5 μg/ml) by 31 ± 10 and 21 ± 15%, respectively.

Protein phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues modulates the activity of a variety of ion channels and consequently alters the excitability patterns of many central neurons (1Levitan I.B.

Usually, neurotransmitters and neurohormones exert this effect by binding to metabotropic, G protein-coupled receptors, which in turn trigger a specific cascade of events that result in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the target protein. Acute electrical signaling in the central nervous system via this type of receptor stimulation alters the probability of the channel protein being in the open state and alters the activation/inactivation kinetics or induces different conductance levels of channel proteins. In contrast, phosphorylation by cytosolic or receptor TKs1 is generally associated with long term cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and oncogenesis. Protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residues has only lately been found to acutely modulate neurotransmitter receptors (3Smart T.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and ion channels (4Siegelbaum S.A. Curr.

Interestingly, evidence has been presented recently that voltage-dependent Kv1 channels themselves are the likely substrates of the soluble Src TK (9Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J.

In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of K+ channels has also been shown to be stimulated by growth factors via their specific receptors with TK activity, e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (9Holmes T.C.

From their general function of stabilizing the membrane potential and fine tuning the excitability of neurons following synaptic input, it appears as a logical consequence that inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels may also be under the modulatory control of cellular TKs. In this report, we demonstrate that strongly rectifying Kir2.1 channels are inhibited by direct TK phosphorylation at a single site in the C terminus and that stimulation of growth factor receptors may mimic this effect. cDNAs of rat Kir2.1 subunits (19Wischmeyer E.

For expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, cDNAs were subcloned into the polyadenylating transcription vector, pSGEM. Capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts from linearized cDNA were synthesized and injected into defolliculated oocytes in constant amounts of Kir2.1 subunits (∼6 ng) together with receptor cRNA (∼15 ng). Oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4–7.5), supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and assayed at 72 h postinjection. Two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed with a Turbo Tec-10 C amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany) and sampled through an EPC9 (Heka Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) interface using Pulse/Pulsefit software (Heka). For rapid exchange of external solutions, oocytes were placed in a small volume perfusion chamber with a constant flow of ND96 or “high K+” solution (96 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4–7.5). Rat basophilic leukocytes (RBL-1; ATCC cell repository line 1378) were cultured as described before (19Wischmeyer E. Lentes K.U. Karschin A. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mammalian tsA-201 cells, a subclone of the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 that expresses SV40 T large antigen, were a gift of Dr. G. Eaholtz (Seattle, WA). Both tsA-201 and COS-7 cells were transfected with 0.8 μg/ml (Kir2.1) and 0.4 μg/ml (receptors) of expression plasmid cDNAs using LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Whole cell recordings were performed at room temperature 48–72 h post-transfection in a bath solution consisting of 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Kimble Products, Sussex, United Kingdom) and heat-polished to give input resistances of 4–6 megaohms. The pipette recording solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2ATP, 100 μm cyclic AMP, 100 μm GTP, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Currents were recorded with an EPC9 (Heka) patch-clamp amplifier and low pass-filtered at 1–2 kHz. Stimulation and data acquisition were controlled by the Pulse/Pulsefit software package (Heka) on a Macintosh computer, and data analysis was performed with Igor software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. (number of cells). Because of their well balanced basal tyrosine phosphorylation level, mammalian tsA-201 cells were selected in most experiments to demonstrate TK phosphorylation of transfected Kir2.1 channels. Western blots with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that the phosphotyrosine levels in tsA-201 cells strongly increased after a 5-min treatment with 1 mm membrane-permeable PTP inhibitor, perorthovanadate (data not shown). This analysis demonstrated that, in tsA-201 cells under basal conditions, the activity of endogenous TKs was dominated by the action of PTPs. When measured 48 h after transfection, Kir2.1 cDNA gave rise to inwardly rectifying I Kir2.1 currents with large amplitudes that averaged 1.97 ± 1.12 nA (n = 10) measured in the patch-clamp-whole cell configuration at −120 mV and in elevated (25 mm) extracellular K+([K+]e; Fig.1). In regard to their biophysical properties, these currents were indistinguishable fromI Kir2.1 in native cells (19Wischmeyer E. Lentes K.U. Karschin A. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following incubation with perorthovanadate, i.e. when TK substrates were allowed to become and remain phosphorylated, Kir2.1 currents declined to a new sustained level with a time constant of ∼1–2 min (Fig. 1). Measured after 10 min, 100 μm perorthovanadate selectively suppressed I Kir2.1 an average of 60 ± 20% (n = 9). When the specific TK inhibitor genistein (100–300 μm) was simultaneously applied together with perorthovanadate at the beginning of the experiment (Fig.2), no inhibition ofI Kir2.1 was observed (102 ± 20% of control; n = 6). In contrast, once a saturating level of Kir2.1 inhibition by perorthovanadate was reached, coapplied genistein was unable to reverse this action (n = 8), suggesting that in these cells no further tyrosine phosphorylation was necessary to maintain the closed state of Kir2.1 channels. The appropriate control experiments, i.e. application of genistein alone (99 ± 2%; n = 6) or identical concentrations of the oxidant H2O2 and catalase (see legend to Fig. 1; 108 ± 29, n = 4), did not result in a significant change of the basal level ofI Kir2.1 currents (see Fig. 5).Figure 2Inhibition of Kir2.1 currents by perorthovanadate is abolished by the TK inhibitor, genistein.

Illustrated are the effects on WT Kir2.1 channels and mutant Kir2.1Y242F channels of 100 μm perorthovanadate, 100 μmperorthovanadate + 100 μm genistein, and 100 μm genistein alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inhibitory effects of perorthovanadate antagonized by genistein could also be demonstrated for native Kir2.1 channels present in cultured RBL-1 cells, which have been previously shown to express mainly large endogenous I Kir2.1 currents (19Wischmeyer E. Lentes K.U. Karschin A. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It was interesting to note that in certain batches of these cells, the onset of inhibition by perorthovanadate was much faster (τOn = 0.56 ± 0.2 s, n = 7) compared with recombinant Kir2.1 channels in tsA-201 cells (Fig.3). Also, the dose-dependent inhibition (K D, ∼5 μm) was quickly reversible upon removal of perorthovanadate (τOff = 6.3 ± 1.5 s, n = 7). In RBL-1 cells in which perorthovanadate treatment was effective, this block averaged 91 ± 4% (n = 7). When the channels were fully closed after perorthovanadate application (but not when blocked by the open channel blocker Ba2+), genistein partially relieved this block (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that endogenous TK activity in RBL-1 cells was more efficient in closing Kir2.1 channels compared with tsA-201 cells and that continued phosphorylation was necessary to maintain this closed state. Thus, suppression of PTP activity in tsA-201 and RBL-1 cells induced closure of Kir2.1 channels, likely caused by phosphorylation of the channel protein or an intermediate signaling component by endogenous TKs. To answer the question of whether the channel itself is a TK substrate, we analyzed the primary amino acid sequence of Kir2.1 and detected several consensus sequences for recognition by TKs (22Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The consensus site with the highest level of phosphorylation, however, is present around a tyrosine residue at position 242 in the C-terminal domain of Kir2.1, preceded by glutamate residues at positions −1 and −3 and followed by an isoleucine at position +1. Interestingly, this site is present only in Kir2.1–Kir2.4 subunits at equivalent positions, but not in subunits of any other Kir channel subfamily. Consequently, a mutant Kir2.1 subunit (Kir2.1Y242F) was engineered in which the tyrosine was replaced by a phenylalanine residue. When transfected into tsA-201 cells and measured under the conditions described above, Kir2.1Y242F channels gave rise to strongly rectifying I Kir currents that were indistinguishable from WT currents with respect to current amplitude, activation potential and kinetics, dependence on [K+]e, and blocking by extracellular cations (data not shown). However, unlike WT channels, Kir2.1Y242F channels were not subject to suppression by 100 μmperorthovanadate (96 ± 3% of WT current, n = 6) even after prolonged administration (10 min). Thus, mutant channels lacking the TK phosphorylation site remained unaffected by the endogenous TK activity in tsA-201 cells (Figs.4 and5). Because the nature of the endogenous TK in tsA-201 cells was unknown, we tested whether heterologously expressed receptor TKs would also substitute in translocating the phosphate moiety to the tyrosine residue. For this purpose NGFR, the receptor TK that binds nerve growth factor (NGF) and is abundantly expressed in central nervous system neurons, was cotransfected with Kir2.1 into tsA-201 cells. In 5 of 17 cotransfected cells tested, but in none of the control cells, 0.1–0.5 μg/ml NGF generated a significant and reversible reduction ofI Kir2.1 currents by 31 ± 10%. In search of a cellular environment with optimal growth factor receptor channel signaling, experiments were also conducted in mammalian COS-7 cells. After cotransfection of both NGFR and EGFR, which binds epidermal growth factor (EGF), application of receptor ligands (0.5 μg/ml) suppressed Kir2.1 current to a similar extent as in tsA-201 cells (n = 7; Fig.6 A), but only in ∼20% of the cells. Application of NGF also failed to significantly suppress current amplitudes of mutant Kir2.1Y242F channels in 29 potentially cotransfected cells (Fig. 6 A). For more reliable coexpression, Kir2.1 and growth factor receptor cRNAs were also injected in different concentrations into X. laevis oocytes. Given the opportunity to precisely control the amount of injected cRNA, we observed a specific, long term down-regulation of Kir2.1 currents by NGFR cRNA injections. Reduction of amplitudes was ∼90% with equimolar cRNA concentrations and ∼30% using a 1:10 NGFR/Kir2.1 cRNA ratio. Apparently this effect was not mediated by a receptor-induced TK phosphorylation process (see “Discussion”). In the further acute inhibition of Kir2.1 channels by TK, phosphorylation was measured with NGFR/Kir2.1 ratios <1:10. Although the cellular phosphotyrosine content in Xenopus oocytes appeared to differ from tsA-201 cells, and perorthovanadate itself did not exert any inhibitory effects on Kir2.1 (indicating low endogenous TK activity), signaling between Kir2.1 and NGFR could be demonstrated. Fig. 6 B shows the rapid and dose-dependent inhibition of Kir2.1 currents by the receptor ligand NGF in an oocyte measured 48 h after injection with Kir2.1/NGFR at −80 mV. Under these conditions, both 0.5 μg/ml NGF and EGF (after EGFR injection) within <10 s decreasedI Kir2.1 by 22 ± 15% (n = 6) and 11 ± 2% (n = 4), respectively, in a fraction of the oocytes (Fig. 6 B). Kir2.1 channels also served as targets for signaling by other neurotrophic growth factors of the NGF family, e.g. current amplitudes were similarly reduced following exposure to neurotrophin-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We did not investigate, however, whether these substances cross-reacted with NGFR or bound to other endogenous Trk receptors (23Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 24Dechant G. Rodrı́guez-Tébar A. Barde Y.-A. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the absence of exogenously expressed growth factor receptors, 2 μm insulin was found to robustly suppress I Kir2.1 by 74 ± 14 (n = 5) in a fraction of oocytes with a distinct biphasic time course (Fig. 6 C). This effect was most likely mediated by endogenous insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptors, because their presence and developmental role is well documented in both Xenopus oocytes and embryos (25Scavo L. Shuldiner A.R. Serrano J. Dashner R. Roth J. De Pablo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6214-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The slow inhibition by growth factor receptor ligands and the ensuing suppression of endogenous PTP activity, which is absent in site-mutated channels, indicate that Kir2.1 channels are negatively controlled by a tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation process. It appears that the tyrosine residue (Tyr-242) in the C terminus, ∼60 amino acids downstream of the second α-helical domain, is a crucial determinant of this effect. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Kir channels have been demonstrated to function as substrates for direct TK phosphorylation. Although all Kir channels, like other K+ channels, harbor various putative TK phosphorylation sites in their primary sequence, the tyrosine residue is present only in members of the Kir2 subfamily at the equivalent position. The reconstitution of signaling by NGFR and modulation by perorthovanadate, for instance, have not been achieved for Kir3 (G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK)) channels, 2E. Wischmeyer, unpublished observations. and one might anticipate that neither are other Kir channels lacking this site affected by TKs. How exactly the translocation of a phosphate moiety from ATP to the tyrosine residue results in channel closure is not clear. Mechanistically, parallels may be drawn to the protein kinase A- and protein kinase C-dependent serine/threonine phosphorylation and subsequent closure of Kir2.1 channels (26Wischmeyer E. Karschin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this case, both the cytosolic N- and C-terminal portions of Kir2.1 in their phosphorylated state were suggested to serve as the closing gate for the channel pore. A similar mechanism may be postulated for Kv1.2 (12Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) and Kv1.3 (9Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) channels in which a single homologue residue is crucial in mediating rapid current inhibition. With a TK phosphorylation site identified in the channel, this study still raises several unsolved questions about the signaling cascade(s) that connect growth factor receptors and the Kir conductance. Although, intuitively, a direct interaction of growth factor receptors with K+ channels may appear less likely, direct phosphorylation of β2 receptors by insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin receptors has indeed been reported (27Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fairly rapid rate of channel closure following NGF stimulation in our experiments (0.1–0.3 s−1) at least would not contradict this hypothesis. Stimulated and autophosphorylated growth factor receptors, however, are better known for their binding to Src, Janus kinases, phospholipase C-γ, GTPase-activating protein, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and other soluble signaling proteins characterized by the presence of Src homology 2/3 domain (SH2/3) recognition motifs (28Schlessinger J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20465-20469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and direct SH3 interaction domains have been identified for Kv1.5 (10Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Additionally, a reduction of Kv1.5 amplitudes by platelet-derived growth factor or fibroblast growth factor receptor was reported to involve increased activity of phospholipase C-γ1 (18Timpe L.C. Fantl W.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kir2.1 channels, on the other hand, appear to be directly phosphorylated at residue 242 in their C termini but lack SH2/3 recognition motifs; further biochemical and electrophysiological studies will be required to determine the nature of cellular TK (the action of which is revealed by perorthovanadate) as well as its precise interaction with the channel protein. It is notable in this study that cotransfected growth factor receptors and Kir2 channels couple with fairly moderate efficiency (20–30%) in mammalian cells. Considered together with a generally reduced success rate in cotransfection experiments, this could be the result of an inadequate protein density in the membrane or a lack of other regulatory proteins that facilitate the assembly of receptors and channels into functional signaling cascades. We have also occasionally observed substantial variability in Kir2.1 regulation, particularly in response to TK inhibitors and PTP inhibitors expressed in different host cells. Considering that TK phosphorylation (and hence the functional state of Kir2.1) is usually under the antagonistic control of specific PTPs, this variability may be the result of a cell- or differentiation-specific variation in the phosphotyrosine level. This balance, in fact, may be so delicate that following NGF stimulation in oocytes, Kir2.1 current oscillations of 2–4 s−1 have occasionally been observed that were affected in frequency by applied TK and PTP inhibitors. 3A. Karschin, unpublished observations. In general, Xenopus oocytes appeared most unsuitable for our studies because of their highly variant (genistein) or absent (perorthovanadate) modulation of the cellular TK level. After cRNA coinjection, we also observed a severe chronic down-regulation of Kir2.1 currents by NGFR coexpression. However, coinjection of a ΔNGFR deletion mutant lacking TK activity, as well as the absence of a receptor ligand or continued exposure to the TK inhibitor genistein, also suppressed Kir2.1 currents, demonstrating that this type of long term suppression was apparently not mediated by a TK phosphorylation process; it was therefore not further regarded as a subject of our study. What functional consequences are to be expected from the acute TK-mediated closure of Kir channels in native cells? Kir2.1 channels are abundantly expressed in the embryonic and adult central nervous system (32Karschin C. Dissmann E. Stühmer W. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3559-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Karschin C. Karschin A. Mol. Cell.

Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). It goes beyond the scope of this study to speculate about all of the potential TK-mediated interactions, e.g. cytokine (34Ihle J.N.

Trophic factors such as NGF may exert their action by regulating the abundance and distribution of K+ channels (39Sharma N. D'Arcangelo G. Kleinklaus A. Halegoua S. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and even the differential expression of alternatively spliced K+ channel isoforms (40Liu S.J. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On a shorter time scale, during neurogenesis in the central and peripheral nervous system, a scenario in which the activity of NGF receptors reduces current flow through Kir2 channels would have an intriguing consequence. As a prime determinant of cell input resistance and stabilization of the resting potential, a large K+conductance through constitutively open Kir2 channels is likely to shunt current fluxes following synaptic input. Following channel closure during periods of high levels of released growth factors, cell impedance increases, and the cells are more efficiently depolarized, not having to overcome this K+ conductance. In this way, neurons become more vulnerable to synaptic input, a prerequisite of the dynamic and flexible systems that follow Hebbian rules of synapse consolidation (41Lewin G.R. Barde Y.-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Independently of the precise molecular mechanism, our study provides yet another example of the overlap between two signaling systems present in all excitable cells. TK phosphorylation of Kir channels may provide an interesting link between signal transduction from growth factors to cell proliferation and differentiation on the one hand to rapid changes of cell excitability elicited by neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels on the other hand (42Bourne H.R.

The ribonuclease H (RNase H)1 family consists of ubiquitous, metal-dependent enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of RNA in RNA·DNA hybrids (for review, see Ref. 1Hostomsky Z. Hostomska Z. Matthews D.A. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 341-376Google Scholar). RNases H are unusual among well studied ribonucleases in that they require active-site divalent metals for activity, a property commonly observed in deoxyribonucleases. RNases H are also unusual in their specificity for leaving free 3′-hydroxyl products after phosphodiester hydrolysis. By contrast, the more familiar RNase A or RNase T1 leaves 3′-phosphate products, using the RNA 2′-hydroxyl as a nucleophile. RNases H are thought to employ an hydroxyl ion (activated water) as the attacking nucleophile, but the manner in which RNases H use active-site metal(s) to catalyze this specific ribonuclease reaction remains unclear. RNases H and related enzymes have emerged as important therapeutic targets because RNase H activity is absolutely required for proliferation of HIV and other retroviruses. Mutations in the RNase H domain of HIV reverse transcriptase that reduce activity result in a loss of virulence (2Tisdale M. Schulze T. Larder B.A. Moelling K. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), making RNase H an attractive target for anti-HIV therapies. Understanding the cofactor requirements for RNase H should therefore aid in the development of such drugs. Moreover, the three-dimensional structures of a number of proteins with structural homology to RNase H have recently been solved by x-ray analysis, all with metal-dependent nucleic acid-modifying functions (reviewed in Refs. 3Yang W.

Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These enzymes have homologous active sites and therefore are likely to share a common mechanism for catalysis. Hence, an understanding of the metal dependence of the RNase H mechanism should aid in understanding the mechanism of other members of this superfamily. Two classes of catalytic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the metal-dependent nature of the RNase H reaction, a one-metal (15Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Migashiro H. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11535-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36Oda Y. Yoshida M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a two-metal mechanism (8Davies J.F. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The one-metal RNase H mechanism is similar to that proposed for DNase I (17Suck D. Oefner C. Nature. 1986; 321: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), with amino acid side chains serving as both a general base and proton shuttle and with a single divalent metal stabilizing the hydrolysis intermediate. Alternatively, the two-metal RNase H mechanism is analogous to the proposed mechanism for the Klenow fragment 3′-5′-exonuclease domain (18Beese L. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 19Derbyshire V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), where one metal serves to stabilize the phosphorane intermediate and a second metal assists in activating the nucleophilic water (generalized in Ref. 20Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Neither the one-metal nor the two-metal mechanism, however, can entirely explain the wealth of structural and mutagenic information that has been compiled for the RNase H family of enzymes. Mechanistic analyses of the RNase H family of enzymes have been complicated by the use of different divalent metals ions in functional studies and by the assumption that different metals affect the enzyme in the same way. While it has been known for over 20 years that either Mg2+ or Mn2+ can activate RNase H (21Berkower I. Leis J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5914-5921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there are significant differences between the effects of these two divalent metals. First, mutagenesis studies on the RNase H domains of retroviral reverse transcriptases have shown that some active-site mutations result in a complete loss of Mg2+-dependent activity but only a specific reduction in Mn2+-dependent activity (22Cirino N.M. Cameron C.E. Smith J.S. Rausch J.W. Roth M.J. Benkovic S.J. Le G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9936-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Blain S.W. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1448-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Second, the HIV RNase H domain is inactive when expressed independently of the rest of reverse transcriptase, but a variety of mutations that activate the isolated domain do so in a strictly Mn2+-dependent manner (24Evans D.B. Brawn K. Deibel Jr., M.R. Tarpley W.G. Sharma S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20583-20585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J.

Third, inhibitors of HIV RNase H activity affect Mg2+- and Mn2+-dependent activities differently, implying a mechanistic difference in the presence of different divalent metals (28Zhan X. Tan C.K. Scott W.A. Mian A.M. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, whereas two Mn2+ ions bind to HIV RNase H (8Davies J.F. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), only one Mg2+ ion binds Escherichia coliRNase HI (6Katayanagi K. Miyagawa M.

With these results in mind, we have initiated studies using E. coli RNase HI as a model system to probe the general metal requirements of the family as well as the distinctions between Mg2+- and Mn2+ -dependent RNase H activities. E. coli RNase HI requires significantly lower concentrations of Mn2+ than Mg2+ for activation and is inhibited upon the further addition of Mn2+ (29Keck J.L. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19883-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Tech. Protein Chem. 1997; 8: 409-416Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). One interpretation consistent with these data is that, in the presence of Mn2+, E. coli RNase HI is activated by a single metal but can be inhibited upon subsequent binding of a second metal, an “activation/attenuation” model. In this paper we demonstrate that this model is supported by a panel of E. coli RNase HI mutant proteins designed to impair the putative second metal-binding site. Furthermore, we note that the activation/attenuation model is consistent with the previous structural observations of both one and two metals binding to RNases H. All buffer components were from Sigma or Fisher unless specified. Ribonucleotides (Boehringer Mannheim), [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), guanidine HCl (Pierce), and restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) were used in accordance with the suppliers' recommendations. Synthetic oligonucleotides were made on an Applied Biosystems 392 RNA/DNA synthesizer. PurifiedE. coli RNA polymerase was kindly provided by Michael Chamberlin (University of California, Berkeley). MnCl2stock solutions were made by serial dilution of a 1 mMnCl2 stock solution (in 1% nitric acid), with final diluted stocks in 0.1% nitric acid. pJK502 is a T7 overexpression, low copy plasmid vector that bears a synthetic gene encoding the wild type E. coliRNase HI sequence (30Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Tech. Protein Chem. 1997; 8: 409-416Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations of pJK502 were made by standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, with a mismatched mutagenic oligonucleotide and a universal primer used to amplify a portion of the gene. These polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the E. coli RNase HI gene, resulting in the creation of specific point mutants of the gene (plasmid names and mutations are listed in Table I). All genes were sequenced by standard methods.Table IPanel of E. coli RNase HI mutant proteinsPlasmidMutation in E. coli RNase HIpJK502Wild type enzymepJK510His-124 → Ala (H124A)pJK515Asp-134 → Asn (D134N)pJK516Asp-134 → His (D134H) Open table in a new tab Overexpression and purification of wild type and mutant RNase H proteins were performed identically. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells transformed with the specified plasmid (see Table I) were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium plus 200 μg of ampicillin and 25 μg of chloramphenicol per ml. Cells at mid-log phase (A 600 ∼0.5) were induced to overexpress RNase H with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and were harvested after an additional 3 h of growth. Cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C followed by thawing via resuspension in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) with 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and were further lysed by sonication. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a heparin affinity chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and developed with a linear NaCl gradient from 20 to 420 mm. Fractions with significantly enriched amounts of RNase H were pooled and diluted with buffer A to reduce the concentration of NaCl to less than 50 mm. The pooled fractions were then applied to a Source S FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A and eluted with a 20 to 220 mm NaCl gradient. Pure fractions (as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled and stored at −20 °C. Typical yields for E. coli RNase HI and mutants were 10–20 mg of purified protein per liter of cell growth. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring A 280in 6.0 m guanidine HCl (1A 280 nm, 6 m GdnHCl = 0.493 g/liter E. coli RNase HI (31Dabora J.M. Marqusee S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). Purified Thermus thermophilus RNase HI was a gift from Julie Hollien. Synthesis and purification of radiolabeled RNA·DNA hybrid substrate was performed as described previously (27Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RNase H assays were performed at 37 °C in standard reaction conditions (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 μm BSA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 1–1000 μm MnCl2, 1 μm (base pairs) RNA·DNA hybrid) unless otherwise specified. Enzymes were diluted from concentrated stocks in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, ∼100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol to their final stock concentrations in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 μm BSA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol just prior to assaying for activity. Typical reaction assay enzyme concentrations were from 0.01 to 5 nm. At specified time intervals, 20-μl reaction aliquots were quenched by adding 50 mm EDTA and 200 μg/ml Torula RNA (final concentration) on ice. The remaining substrate was precipitated by the addition of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate (final concentration), followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Precipitated substrate was pelleted for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, and the acid-soluble radioactivity of 90% of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Given that no activity is observed if exogenous metal is not added, our purified enzyme stocks appear free of contaminating metals. In the reaction conditions used in our assay, EPR measurements indicate that [Mn2+]free is greater than 75% of [Mn2+]total at low metal concentrations (5–100 μm), and at higher concentrations (1000 μm) greater than 90% of the Mn2+ is free (data not shown). Hence, BSA and the nucleic acid used in the assay do not greatly alter the metal available to the enzyme. Velocity (units/mg) was determined by measurement of the slope of multiple assay time points in the linear range of enzymatic activity. One unit of RNase H activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to generate 1 μmol of acid-soluble product in 15 min under our reaction conditions. Initial reaction velocities were determined at a variety of substrate and Mn2+concentrations for both wild type and H124A RNase H activity. Each velocity point is determined from the linear slope of at least three assay time points, usually with less than ∼30% of substrate converted to product. Simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics were assumed, and fits of the substrate concentration versus initial reaction velocity were performed to extrapolate bothK m and k cat values using LEONORA version 1.0 (32Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 133-189Google Scholar). A comparison of the Mn2+-binding sites observed in the HIV RNase H domain crystal structure with the crystal structure of E. coli RNase HI demonstrated that two metals could, in principle, bind the E. coli homolog in an analogous fashion to the binding mode observed in the HIV RNase H domain (Fig.1). One metal-binding site is formed by Asp-10 and Glu-48, as seen in the Mg2+ co-crystal ofE. coli RNase HI (33Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The exact placement of the metal ion bound by Asp-10 and Glu-48 varies by ∼1 Å between the E. coli Mg2+ co-crystal and the HIV Mn2+co-crystal, and we have not drawn any conclusions on which site represents the true metal positioning during catalysis. In our model, we propose that a second metal-binding pocket is formed by the conserved residues Asp-134 and possibly His-124, perhaps with contributions from Asp-10. To test whether Asp-134 and His-124 form a second metal-binding site, we constructed point mutants of E. coli RNase HI that served to partially neutralize Asp-134 (mutating it to His or Asn) or completely neutralize His-124 (mutating it to Ala) (TableI). These mutations were chosen to impair affinity at the putative second metal-binding site. Plasmids encoding the mutant enzymes were constructed, and RNase H variants were overexpressed and purified to apparent homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of these mutants have been studied previously but only in the presence of Mg2+(35Haruki M.

X-ray crystallography (of D134H, D134N) and circular dichroism studies (of H124A) have shown very minimal deviations in these mutant proteins from the topology and stability of the wild type enzyme (35Haruki M.

Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Wild type E. coli RNase HI activity shows strong inhibition in the presence of Mn2+ at concentrations greater than 5 μm (Fig. 2), consistent with our previous observations of Mn2+-dependent E. coli RNase HI activity (29Keck J.L. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19883-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Keck J.L. Marqusee S. Tech. Protein Chem. 1997; 8: 409-416Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In order to test the activation/attenuation model, we examined the dependence of RNase H activity on Mn2+concentration for these mutant enzymes. Upon mutation of Asp-134 to either His or Asn, the Mn2+ dependence of activity changes significantly (Fig. 2 A). Both variants are activated by Mn2+ similarly to the wild type enzyme (requiring very low micromolar concentrations), but the inhibition observed at higher concentrations of Mn2+ is clearly diminished upon mutation of Asp-134. Reduced Mn2+ inhibition leads to a shift in the concentration of MnCl2 required for maximal activity (5, 30, and 100 μm Mn2+ for wild type, D134H, and D134N, respectively). The degree to which these mutations relieve inhibition correlates with the expected decrease in polarity at the δ-position of the side chain: Asp (−0.706 electronic units (e.u.)) < His (−0.527 e.u.) < Asn (−0.470 e.u.) (34Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4847) Google Scholar). The H124A mutation has previously been shown to lowerk cat values ∼100-fold with an increase inK m values ∼3-fold in a Mg2+-dependent RNase H assay (36Oda Y. Yoshida M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In low Mn2+ concentrations, we find a similar reduction in activity (∼80-fold) (Fig. 2 B), and the amount of Mn2+ required for activation of H124A is comparable to that for wild type RNase H. In contrast to the other RNase H variants tested, inhibition of H124A is not observed in higher Mn2+concentrations. The activity of H124A at 1 mmMnCl2 is equivalent to the attenuated form of the wild type protein. In the presence of Mg2+, where presumably only one metal binds (as suggested by extensive affinity studies (33Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38Huang H.W. Cowan J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), we observed slight increases in the amounts of Mg2+ required to activate the mutant RNases H relative to wild type (data not shown). Similar effects in Mn2+ activation are apparent in D134N and H124A (Fig. 2), and hence, slight alterations in the structure and electrostatic environment of the active site likely account for these changes. To probe the mechanism of inhibition in high Mn2+ concentrations, we determined the kinetic parameters for catalysis by RNase H assuming steady-state kinetics. In the simplest case, Mn2+ could attenuate activity by either inhibiting substrate binding (an increase in K m) or slowing catalysis at the level of the rate-limiting step (a decrease ink cat). In 3 μm Mn2+(approximately the optimum for activity), the observedk cat is 321 min−1 for wild type with a K m of 0.030 μm (Fig.3 A). Upon addition of inhibitory concentrations of Mn2+,k cat and K m are reduced to values of 13 min−1 and 0.003 μm, respectively. Given the striking differences between the Mn2+ dependence of wild type and H124A RNase H activities (Fig. 2 B), we wanted to determine the effects of Mn2+ concentration onK m and k cat in H124A. Fig.3 B shows that although higher concentrations of Mn2+ lead to a reduction in K m,k cat remains constant in all Mn2+concentrations for the H124A mutant. Reduction of theK m for H124A is ∼2-fold from 3 to 10 μm MnCl2. These data are in contrast to that of the wild type where both K m andk cat are reduced in high Mn2+concentrations. We attempted to determine Mn2+ binding constants for E. coli RNase HI using titration calorimetry to compare the concentration requirements for activation and inhibition in vitro. However, at pH values greater than 7.5, Mn2+ causes enzyme precipitation at high protein concentrations (data not shown), thus precluding the possibility of accurate determination of stoichiometry or affinity constants. High concentrations of Mn2+ had no effect on the enzyme concentration dependence of the activity assays, however, demonstrating that inhibition in our activity assays did not occur by a trivial mechanism such as enzyme precipitation (data not shown). Currently, the mechanism by which the RNase H family of enzymes utilizes divalent metal to catalyze the hydrolysis of RNA in RNA·DNA hybrids is unclear. Although E. coli RNase HI can utilize both Mg2+ and Mn2+ as cofactors, we have observed considerable differences in the optimal concentrations needed for activity (∼1 mm for Mg2+ and ∼5 μm for Mn2+ (29Keck J.L. Marqusee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19883-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). The crystal structures of two homologous RNase H enzymes have been solved with divalent metals bound at their active sites as follows: E. coli RNase HI with a single Mg2+ ion (33Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the HIV RNase H domain with two Mn2+ ions (8Davies J.F. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Using these structural observations, two models for RNase H activation have been proposed. The first model for RNase H activation is a one-metal mechanism analogous to the proposed mechanism for DNase I activity (17Suck D. Oefner C. Nature. 1986; 321: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this model, a single divalent metal is bound by the conserved residues Asp-10 and Glu-48 (15Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S.

Generation of a nucleophilic hydroxyl ion is hypothesized to occur by deprotonation of water, with Asp-70 acting as a general base. In further analogy to the proposed DNase I mechanism, deprotonation of Asp-70 is thought to be facilitated by a proton transfer to His-124 which then rapidly loses the proton into bulk solvent (35Haruki M. Noguchi E. Nakai C. Liu Y.Y. Oobatake M. Itaya M. Kanaya S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This mechanism is supported by extensive mutagenesis and structural experiments utilizing Mg2+ as a cofactor for activity (16Oda Y. Nakamura H. Kanaya S. Ikehara M. J. Biomol.

The second model for RNase H activation is a two-metal mechanism similar to the proposed mechanism of the Klenow fragment 3′-5′-exonuclease domain (8Davies J.F. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this model, two metals are required for RNase H activation as follows: the first metal stabilizes the phosphorane intermediate (as in the single-metal mechanism), and the second metal orders and activates the water that serves as the attacking nucleophile in hydrolysis (generalized in Ref. 20Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The first metal is positioned in an analogous position to the single metal observed in"

STAT5A and STAT5B are activated by a broad range of cytokines and growth factors. Although they can be differentially activated, the functional difference between these two molecules relative to their structure is not known. Here we demonstrated that STAT5A and STAT5B homodimers have distinct DNA binding preferences. Chimeric STAT5 molecules allowed us to identify a region between amino acid 420 and 545 responsible for the DNA binding specificity. This region is located in the previously characterized DNA binding region of STAT proteins. Sequence comparison between STAT5A and STAT5B from different species showed a difference of 5 amino acids in the region 420–545 between STAT5A and STAT5B. Substitution of these amino acids demonstrated that a glycine residue at position 433 in STAT5B and a glutamic residue at a similar position in STAT5A determined the DNA binding specificity.

Cytokines activate intracellular signaling pathways during growth and differentiation responses. One of the signal transduction pathways activated by these ligands involves the family of STAT (signal transducer and activator oftranscription) proteins.

Dimers of STAT migrate to the nucleus, bind to specific DNA sequences, and activate or repress the transcription of target genes. Functional domains involved in DNA binding and activation of transcription have been defined.

The role of STAT5 in cell proliferation and differentiation as well as in suppression of apoptosis has been examined in different cell lines, but conflicting results emerged from these studies.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the specific function of these two proteins has not yet been determined. In this report, we analyzed the DNA binding properties of STAT5A and STAT5B homodimers. STAT5A or STAT5B and the prolactin receptor expression vectors were transfected in COS cells. After stimulation with prolactin, DNA binding activities of STAT5A and STAT5B were compared on STAT sequences known to bind distinct members of the STAT family. We found that STAT5A and STAT5B had distinct DNA binding specificities. By using chimeric STAT5A/STAT5B molecules, we next identified that the regions responsible for this property were located between amino acids 420 and 545 in the DNA binding regions of STAT5A and STAT5B. Comparison of the sequences of these regions showed a 5-amino acid difference between STAT5A and STAT5B. Substitution of these amino acids demonstrated that a glycine residue at position 433 in STAT5B and a glutamic acid residue at a similar position in STAT5A were crucial for the differential DNA binding of STAT5A and STAT5B. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. COS7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of STAT5 and 3 μg of prolactin receptor expression vectors using the calcium phosphate method as described (24Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 854-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated 1 h with ovin prolactin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma). The expression vectors for m-STAT5A (pXM-STAT5A), m-STAT5B (pXM-STAT5B), and the long form of the murine prolactin receptor have been described previously (43Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The chimeric constructs STAT5AB1 and STAT5BA1 were generated by ligation of aSalI-XhoI fragment (amino acids 1 to 545) of pXM-STAT5A into the SalI-XhoI sites of pXM-STAT5B and vice versa. For the constructs STAT5AB2 and STAT5BA2 a fragment BamHI-XhoI (from amino acids 180 to 545) from STAT5B cDNA was cloned into BamHI-XhoI sites of pXM-STAT5A and vice versa. The other chimeric constructs, STAT5AB3, STAT5BA3, and A, B, C, D, E, F were generated by ligation with polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments. A first set of polymerase chain reactions was used to create chimeric junctions or mutations in STAT5AB3, STAT5BA3, A, B, C, D, E, F with the respective following oligonucleotides and their overlapping antisense: 5′-CTCAGCGCCCACTTCAGAAACATG-3′, 5′-CGAATCAAGAGGGCCGACCGCCGT-3′, 5′-AAGTTCACGGTCCTGTTTGACTCA-3′, 5′-TTCAGCGTCGGTAGCAACGAGCTG-3′, 5′-GGCAGCCAGGACCACAATGCCACA-3′, 5′-CGCCTGGGGGCAGAGTCAGTAACG-3′, 5′-GGCGTGGTGCAGGGTCGGTGACG-3′. The final polymerase chain reactions were performed with an upper primer that contains the BamHI site (with the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GCCTGCGGATCCAAGCTCAG-3′) and a lower primer containing the restriction site XhoI (with the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GTTGTAGTCCCTCGAGGTGGTT-3′). These polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned in the corresponding vector (see Fig.3). The sequences of the chimeric constructs have been verified. The antiserum against STAT5 was generated in rabbit using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids position 350–480 of human STAT5A as an antigen (12Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The fragment was produced in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. An anti-Stat5 antibody that recognizes the SH2 domain of STAT5A and STAT5B was also used (Transduction Laboratories). The phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from UBI. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an epi-chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear extracts were prepared by suspending cell pellets in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 μm sodium ortho-vanadate. After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added (final concentration: 0.6%). Lysates were centrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C and 14000 rpm. The pellets were extracted with a buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0,4 NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μmortho-vanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The samples were vigorously rocked for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 14000 rpm. The supernatants were recovered for the band shift or Western blotting experiments. Equal amounts of proteins as judged by expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT5 molecules in Western blot were used in the band shift experiments. The protocol for the band shift assays has been described elsewhere (24Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 854-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in the band shift experiments were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of 8000 cpm/fmol. It is generally admitted that the core DNA sequence recognized by STAT5 proteins contains the motif TTC(NNN)GAA (26Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L.A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT5A and STAT5B homodimers preferred different STAT binding sites, we analyzed their DNA binding properties on 8 oligonucleotide probes that bind distinct STAT members (including STAT1, STAT3, STAT6, STAT4) (TableI). COS cells were transfected with expression vectors for STAT5A or STAT5B and the prolactin receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT5A and STAT5B by prolactin in transfected COS cells have already been reported and proved to be a useful system to study their DNA binding properties (43Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared in the absence or presence of prolactin and assayed in band shift experiments (Fig.1). Differences were clearly observed among these probes. Seven probes were bound by STAT5B homodimers although with different affinities. Strong DNA binding activities were observed with the β-casein (−105), APRE, IRF-1, and Bcl-x probes (lanes 4, 12, 16, and 28) whereas β-casein(−150), Iε, and Cis2 probes gave weak and intermediate signals (lanes 8, 20, and24). In the case of STAT5A homodimers, a strong DNA binding activity was only observed with the β-casein(−105) (lane 2). IRF-1, Cis2, and Bcl-x probes were also bound by STAT5A but with an overall lower affinity as judged by the intensity of the binding signal and with a lower mobility (lanes 14,22, and 26). No DNA binding of STAT5A homodimers was observed with β-casein(−150), APRE, or Iε probes (lanes 6, 10, and 18). The SIEm67 probe did not bind to STAT5A or STAT5B homodimers (data not shown). Thus the two closely related STAT5A and STAT5B differ in their ability to recognize natural STAT binding sites.Table ISequences of the DNA probesβ-Casein(−150)5′-CCCCAGAATTTCTTGGGAAAGAAAATAGAA-3′β-Casein(−105)5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAATCC-3′APRE (α2-macroglobulin)5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTA-3′SIEm67(c-fos)5′-CATTTCCCGTAAATC-3′IRF-15′-GATCCATTTCCCCGAAATGA-3′Iɛ5′-GTCAACTTCCCAAGAACAGAA-3′Cis25′-GCTGCTTCCGGGAAGGGCT-3′Bcl-x5′-GCATTTCGGAGAAGACGGGG-3′The STAT sequences are shown in boldface.

Expression and activation of STAT5A and STAT5B proteins from COS cell extracts were analyzed in immunoblot with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2). STAT5A and STAT5B were indifferently tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to prolactin (lanes 2 and 4). These tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were not detected in COS cells transfected with the prolactin receptor expression vector alone (data not shown). Reprobing the membranes with an anti-STAT5 antibody that recognizes STAT5A and STAT5B evidenced a similar level of expression of both proteins. Thus, the differential DNA binding activity of STAT5A and STAT5B did not reflect a differential expression or tyrosine phosphorylation of the two proteins. We proceeded to use the distinct DNA binding specificities of STAT5A and STAT5B to the APRE element to identify protein regions required for this differential DNA binding. The DNA binding regions of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 have been identified in the NH2-terminal part of these proteins, and amino acids between residues 400 and 500 determine the DNA binding site specificity (9Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 10Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To identify the protein region that discriminates between STAT5A and STAT5B DNA binding activities, gene fusions were constructed that encode STAT5 proteins containing the NH2-terminal region of STAT5A fused to STAT5B or vice versa (Fig.3). STAT5A, STAT5B, and chimeras were transfected with the prolactin receptor expression vector in COS cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared in the absence or presence of prolactin and assayed in band shift experiments with the APRE probe (Fig.4 A). A chimeric STAT5 protein containing the first 545 amino acids of STAT5A and the COOH terminus of STAT5B (AB) did not bind to the APRE probe behaving like STAT5A (lanes 2 and 8), and the complementary chimera with the NH2-terminal 545 amino acids of STAT5B fused to the COOH terminus of STAT5A (5BA) had the recognition property of STAT5B, that is, it bound well to APRE probe (lanes 4 and 6). Thus, the differential DNA binding activity of STAT5A and STAT5B was localized in the amino-terminal 545 amino acids. Additional chimeras were constructed containing the region from 182 to 545 of STAT5A substituted in STAT5B (BA2) and vice versa (AB2) and analyzed. Like STAT5A and the chimera AB, the recombinant molecule BA2 did not recognize the APRE probe (lane 12) whereas the complementary chimera AB2, like STAT5B, did (lane 10). To further dissect this region we finally replaced the region from 420 to 545 of STAT5B by the same region in STAT5A (BA3). This recombinant molecule failed to bind to the APRE probe (lane 16). The complementary chimera in which the 420–545 amino acid sequence of STAT5A was replaced by the same region of STAT5B (AB3) bound well to the APRE probe. Analysis of expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of the different chimeric molecules by Western blot with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and an anti-STAT5 antibody showed that the levels of expression and activation of all chimeras were similar (Fig. 4 B). We concluded that the amino acids that determine the DNA binding specificity of STAT5A and STAT5B lie in this 125-amino acid segment between residues 420 and 545. Sequence alignment of the region 420–545 of STAT5A and STAT5B from human and mouse species showed a conserved divergence of 5 amino acids between the two molecules (Fig. 5). We suspected that one or more of these amino acids were crucial for the differential DNA binding of STAT5A and STAT5B to the APRE probe. The 5 amino acids present in the region 420–545 of STAT5B were individually replaced by the amino acid residues present at identical positions in STAT5A. These 5 STAT5B mutants were transfected with prolactin receptor expression vector in COS cells, and nuclear extracts prepared from prolactin-stimulated or nonstimulated cells were tested on the APRE probe (Fig. 6 A). Like with STAT5A, no signal was detected with the mutant E after prolactin stimulation (lanes 2 and 8) indicating that the substitution Gly → Glu (residue 433 in STAT5B) dramatically affected DNA binding of STAT5B on the APRE probe whereas the 4 other substitutions corresponding to mutants A, B, C, and D had weak or no effect (lanes 6, 10, 12, and 14). Levels of expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5B and the STAT5B mutants as judged by Western blot analysis were found to be similar (Fig. 6 B). Thus the glycine residue at position 433 is important for the binding of STAT5B to the APRE probe. To ascertain whether this residue might be crucial for the observed effect, we substituted the glutamic acid residue at position 433 in STAT5A by the glycine residue. This STAT5A mutant (mutant F) was transiently expressed in COS cells (Fig.7 A). Mutant F and STAT5B bound to the APRE probe (lanes 4 and 8) indicating that substitution Glu → Gly in mutant F allowed the recovery of DNA binding of STAT5A to the APRE probe. Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-STAT5 antibodies revealed that STAT5A, STAT5B, F (STAT5A(E → G)), and E (STAT5B(G → E)) were expressed and activated by prolactin. Level of expression and activation of mutant F was even lower (Fig. 7 B). We concluded that a glutamic acid residue in STAT5A at position 433 and a glycine residue in STAT5B at a similar position determine the DNA binding specificities of STAT5A and STAT5B.Figure 6DNA binding of the point-mutated STAT5B molecules.

These proteins differ at their COOH terminus, a region highly variable among other STAT proteins that is thought to be involved in transcriptional activation. Despite their homology, a recent report has shown that STAT5A and STAT5B can be differentially activated suggesting that they might have distinct functions. However, no evidence has yet been presented that defines functional differences in relation to the structure of these two STAT proteins. In this report we showed that STAT5A and STAT5B homodimers have distinct DNA binding specificities. We found that the APRE, the β-casein(−150), and the Iε elements are bound by STAT5B homodimers but not by STAT5A homodimers while Stat5A bound well but STAT5B bound with a higher affinity to the β-casein(−105), the STAT5 optimum sequence. This did not reflect a change in the expression or tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins in response to prolactin. STAT5A and STAT5B also have different affinities for the three STAT5 binding sites of the β-lactoglobulin gene promoter (49Philp J.A.C. Burdon T.G. Watson C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In COS cells transfected with a β-casein-luciferase construct STAT5B but not STAT5A stimulates the basal activity of the promoter in the absence of prolactin (43Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Similar observations were done with a multimerized STAT5 response element reporter construct in hematopoietic cells (12Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is possible that the respective levels of STAT5A and STAT5B homodimers may determine the selective expression of genes that are regulated by both factors. Interestingly, STAT5B bound to the β-casein(−105) and the β-casein(−150) sequences. Occupancy of both sites was observed in extracts from lactating mammary gland but not in extracts from glands of pregnant mice (50Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Ball R.K. Groner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggesting that activation of different STAT dimers might contribute to the β-casein gene transcription. Changes in the levels of STAT5A and STAT5B homodimers during mammary epithelial cell differentiation may be responsible for this selective gene activation (51Cella N. Groner B. Hynes N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). STAT5A and STAT5B bound also to the Cis and Bcl-x elements with different affinities, and expression of both genes is regulated by STAT5 in hematopoietic cells (52Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). 2S. Dumon, S. Santos, F. Debierre-Grockiego, V. Gouilleux-Gruart, L. Cocault, V. Boucheron, P. Mollat, S. Gisselbrecht, and F. Gouilleux, unpublished results. In STAT5A−/− mice, regulation of Cis gene expression by GM-CSF in macrophage is affected (47Feldman G.M. Rosenthal L.A. Liu X. Hayes M.P. Wynshaw Boris A. Leonard W.J. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we don't know yet if these genes are differentially regulated by STAT5A and STAT5B The most striking difference in the DNA binding properties of STAT5A and STAT5B was observed with the APRE binding site. The core sequences of the APRE and the β-casein(−105) are very similar. Only one nucleotide differs between the two core sequences. It is probable that this minor change dramatically affects binding of STAT5A although the core sequences of IRF-1, Cis, and Bcl-x, which are less related, still bound to STAT5A. It is also possible that nucleotides in the flanking sequences might be important for binding to the APRE probe. Nucleotides adjacent to the core element have been shown to modulate STAT DNA binding (53Lamb P. Seidel H.M. Haslam J. Milocco L. Kessler L.V. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). APRE (acute phase response element) originally had been described as an IL-6 response element in the α2-macroglobulin gene promoter that interacts with STAT3 and STAT5B but not STAT5A in rat liver after induction of an acute phase response despite the expression and activation of STAT5A (54Ripperger J.A. Fritz S. Richter K. Hocke G.M. Lottspeich F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,55Dajee M. Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Hocke G.M. Fey G.H. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These data are in agreement with our observation that STAT5A did not bind to the APRE element. However, DNA binding of STAT5A to the APRE element was observed in ovarian granulosa cells after induction with prolactin (55Dajee M. Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Hocke G.M. Fey G.H. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The probe used in this study contained two copies of the APRE element. It is possible that the presence of two STAT sequences allowed cooperative binding of two STAT5A dimers. DNA binding of STAT5A as a tetramer on a duplicated sequence which did not bind or weakly bound these elements individually were observed for the CD25 gene, the cis gene, and the spi2.1 gene (21Meyer W.K. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Soldaini E. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31821-31828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Verdier F. Rabionet R. Gouilleux F.

Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We recently showed that purified active STAT5A binds as a tetramer on such duplicated sites in the Cis gene promoter while STAT5B binds preferentially as a dimer (22Verdier F. Rabionet R. Gouilleux F. Beisenherz-Huss C. Varlet P. Muller O. Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Chretien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus it is reasonable to think that STAT5A also forms a tetramer when the APRE site is duplicated. Weak DNA binding of STAT5B was observed on the Iε and the β-casein(−150) probes which did not contain the core sequence TTCNNNGAA but did contain TTCNNNNGAA. Spacing between TTC and GAA has been reported to control specific binding of different STAT members (56Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that STAT6 binds preferentially to such 4 base-spacing elements. β-Casein and Iε gene expression are known to be regulated by IL-4, a cytokine that specifically induces activation of STAT6 (57Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 58Messner B. Stutz A.M. Albrecht B. Peiritsch S. Woisetschlager M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3330-3337PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, STAT5B can bind to STAT6 specific elements. However, no evidence has been provided that STAT5B can regulate the expression of STAT6 target genes. We used chimeric STAT5A/STAT5B molecules to identify the regions that confer DNA binding specificity to STAT5A and STAT5B. This region located between amino acids 420 and 545 of STAT5A and STAT5B is contained in the DNA binding region previously characterized for STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 (9Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 10Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Within these 125 amino acids, STAT5A and STAT5B differ only by 5 amino acids. We showed that a glycine residue at position 433 is crucial for the DNA binding of STAT5B and of the STAT5A(E → G) mutant to the APRE element while a glutamic acid residue at the same position dramatically affected the DNA binding of STAT5A and of the STAT5B(G → E) mutant. Interestingly, these two amino acids are located close to the motif VTEE conserved in the DNA binding regions of all STAT members and found to be crucial for DNA binding of STAT proteins. Mutations in the VTEE sequence (EE → AA) dramatically reduced DNA binding of STAT3 whereas the same mutations in STAT5 increased its DNA binding activity (9Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 59Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is possible that these neighboring residues might influence the secondary structure of the VTEE sequence increasing or decreasing the DNA binding affinity. The crystal structures of the DNA complexes of STAT1 and STAT3 homodimers have been determined. Interestingly, a glutamic acid residue at position 421 close to the VTEE sequence of STAT1 and the valine residue of the VTEE sequence of STAT3 make contact with DNA (60Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 61Becker S. Groner B. Muller C. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Thus it is probable that the same regions of STAT5A and STAT5B are required for this interaction. Crystallographic structure of the DNA binding regions of STAT5A and STAT5B will help to define important amino acids that are involved in contact with DNA. One important question that results from the present study is the identification of genes that are specifically regulated by STAT5A and STAT5B. Inactivation of STAT5A and STAT5B genes demonstrated the essential role of the two STAT5 proteins in the physiological responses to growth hormone or prolactin (62Teglund S. McKay C.

Regulation of some liver proteins like MUP (major urinary protein), the testosterone 15α-hydroxylase (CYP2A4), and testosterone 16α-hydroxylase (CYP2D9) that are expressed in a sexually dimorphic pattern was impaired in STAT5B−/− but not in STAT5A−/− mice (62Teglund S.

Level of serum IGF-1 was also reduced in STAT5B−/− but not in STAT5A−/− mice. It is possible that the genes encoding these proteins are under the specific control of STAT5B. Characterization of the promoter regions of these genes and the use of specific dominant-negative forms of STAT5B will help to identify the specific target genes of STAT5B. This study supports a functional difference between STAT5A and STAT5B and increases the number of potential target genes of STAT5 that can be regulated commonly or specifically by STAT5A and STAT5B.

The vaccinia RNA triphosphatase is optimal with magnesium, is 12% as active in manganese, and is inactive with cobalt. In contrast, the vaccinia NTPase is fully active with cobalt, manganese, or magnesium (26Shuman S. Surks M. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Baculovirus LEF-4 hydrolyzes the γ phosphate of RNA and NTPs; the LEF-4 NTPase is activated by manganese or cobalt, but not by magnesium (22Gross C.H. Shuman S. J.

A highly purified yeast capping enzyme consisted of two major polypeptides: (i) a 52-kDa guanylyltransferase identified as the 459-amino acid Ceg1 protein (11Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Hagata S. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9521-9528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) an RNA triphosphatase component with an apparent electrophoretic mobility of 80 kDa (29Itoh N.

This would suggest that the yeast RNA triphosphatase has metazoan-like substrate specificity for RNA triphosphate ends yet exploits a virus-like catalytic mechanism that depends on metal-assisted cleavage of the phosphoanhydride bond. Here, we report that purified recombinant Cet1p is a highly active NTPase. Thus, it is not specific for RNA substrates. Cet1p resembles the vaccinia and baculovirus triphosphatases in that its NTPase function is activated by manganese and cobalt. We discerned three collinear sequence motifs that are shared by yeast Cet1p, vaccinia D1, and baculovirus LEF-4. Mutational analysis establishes that conserved glutamate and arginine side chains within these motifs are essential for Cet1p function in vitro and in vivo.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the yeast RNA 5′-triphosphatase Cet1p hydrolyzes the γ phosphate of nucleoside triphosphates. The NTPase of Cet1p is activated by manganese and cobalt. This is a property shared with the triphosphatase components of the vaccinia D1 and baculovirus LEF-4 capping enzymes. The turnover number of the yeast enzyme in ATP hydrolysis (25 s−1) is similar to the values reported for the baculovirus (30 s−1) and vaccinia virus (10 s−1) triphosphatases, although the affinity of the yeast enzyme for ATP (K m = 2.8 μm) is significantly higher than that of either LEF-4 (K m = 43 μm) or vaccinia triphosphatase (K m= 800 μm) (21Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar).We propose that Cet1p is the prototype of a previously unrecognized family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that includes the DNA virus and yeast RNA triphosphatases involved in cap formation. A common structural basis for catalysis by members of this enzyme family is suggested by the conservation of collinear motifs A, B, and C. Conserved amino acid residues within the motifs likely comprise part of the active site. As shown here and by Yu et al. (19Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), single alanine substitutions within the three motifs abrogate or severely diminish the triphosphatase activity of yeast Cet1p and vaccinia D1. The essential residues identified by alanine scanning include the two alternating glutamates in motif A, an arginine residue in motif B, and either two (in the poxvirus capping enzymes) or three (in Cet1p and African swine fever virus capping enzyme) alternating glutamates in motif C. The effects of alanine cluster mutations in baculovirus LEF-4 are concordant with the findings for Cet1p and D1, to wit, manganese-dependent NTPase and RNA triphosphatase activities are eliminated or drastically reduced by simultaneous replacement of both motif A glutamates by alanine, by single alanine substitution for the motif B arginine, or by simultaneous replacement of the two glutamates of motif C (EYEFD) by alanine (23Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar).The marked decrease in affinity for ATP elicited by the R454A mutation of Cet1(201–549)p suggests a role for this motif B residue in substrate binding. We speculate that the arginine side chain interacts with the negatively charged 5′ triphosphate moiety. Elimination of the glutamate side chains in motifs A and C profoundly inhibited ATPase activity, even at very high substrate concentrations, which suggests a role for these residues in phosphohydrolase reaction chemistry. The glutamates in motif A and C may coordinate the essential divalent cation(s). An additional role for the proximal glutamate of motif C in substrate binding is inferred from the 9-fold increase inK m for ATP caused by the E492A mutation of Cet1(201–549)p.The sequence similarity between Cet1p and the DNA virus-encoded RNA triphosphatase/NTPases appears to be limited to motifs A, B, and C. Cet1p possesses triphosphatase activity only, whereas LEF-4 and D1 also have guanylyltransferase activities. In the baculovirus and vaccinia capping enzymes, the triphosphatase motifs are located amino-terminal to the six conserved motifs that comprise the guanylyltransferase active site (19Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The vaccinia D1 protein cannot be truncated to less than 545 amino acids without loss of its triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities. The minimum functional domains of the 464-amino acid baculovirus LEF-4 triphosphatase/guanylyltransferase have not yet been defined. The 305-amino acid Cet1p truncation mutant, Cet1(245–549)p, which retains full triphosphatase activity in vitro, is the smallest functional domain that has been identified for the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family. Additional candidates for membership in this family may emerge as genome sequencing uncovers new polypeptides containing motifs A, B, and C. For example, the 320-amino acid polypeptide encoded by the S. cerevisiae YMR180C open reading frame is homologous to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cet1p and includes all six of the amino acids in motifs A, B, and C that are important for NTP hydrolysis (Fig.4). Preliminary characterization of recombinant YM180C protein indicates that it possesses magnesium- and cobalt-dependent ATPase activity. 2C. K. Ho, unpublished observations. The function of YMR180C is unknown; this enzyme may well catalyze phosphohydrolase reactions unrelated to mRNA capping.In summary, there is now clear evidence for at least two mechanistically and structurally distinct classes of RNA 5′ triphosphatases: (i) the divalent cation-dependent RNA triphosphatase/NTPase family (exemplified by yeast Cet1p, baculovirus LEF-4, and vaccinia D1), which require motifs A, B, and C for activity, and (ii) the divalent cation-independent RNA triphosphatases,e.g. the metazoan cellular enzymes and the baculovirus enzyme BVP (30Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which require the HCxAGxGR(S/T)G phosphate-binding motif. The existence of additional classes of RNA 5′-triphosphatases is likely, given that the candidate capping enzymes of several RNA viruses and trypanosomatid protozoa lack the defining motifs of the two known RNA triphosphatase families (32Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Silva E. Ullu E. Kobayashi R. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4612-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hence, the triphosphatase components of the capping apparatus provide attractive targets for the identification of specific antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoal drugs that will block capping of pathogen mRNAs but spare the mammalian host enzyme. The m7GpppN cap of eukaryotic mRNA is synthesized by three enzymatic reactions: (i) the 5′ triphosphate end of nascent pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase, (ii) the diphosphate end is capped with GMP by GTP:RNA guanylyltransferase, and (iii) the GpppN structure is methylated by AdoMet:RNA-(guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 101-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The architecture of the capping apparatus differs between metazoans, fungi, and DNA viruses. Metazoan species encode a two-component capping system consisting of a bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase polypeptide and a methyltransferase polypeptide (2Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F.

Chem. 1980; 255: 11588-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the divalent cation cofactor specificities are distinct. The vaccinia RNA triphosphatase is optimal with magnesium, is 12% as active in manganese, and is inactive with cobalt. In contrast, the vaccinia NTPase is fully active with cobalt, manganese, or magnesium (26Shuman S. Surks M. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Baculovirus LEF-4 hydrolyzes the γ phosphate of RNA and NTPs; the LEF-4 NTPase is activated by manganese or cobalt, but not by magnesium (22Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Itoh et al. (28Itoh N. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13930-13936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a yeast capping enzyme containing both RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities. The yeast RNA triphosphatase, which was magnesium dependent, could not hydrolyze ATP or GTP (28Itoh N. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13930-13936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A highly purified yeast capping enzyme consisted of two major polypeptides: (i) a 52-kDa guanylyltransferase identified as the 459-amino acid Ceg1 protein (11Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Hagata S. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9521-9528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) an RNA triphosphatase component with an apparent electrophoretic mobility of 80 kDa (29Itoh N. Yamada H. Kaziro Y. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1989-1995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tsukamoto et al. (13Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M.

We independently isolated CET1 as a multicopy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1p (14Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CET1 gene is essential for yeast cell growth (13Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M. Nakamura A. Gotoh H.

This would suggest that the yeast RNA triphosphatase has metazoan-like substrate specificity for RNA triphosphate ends yet exploits a virus-like catalytic mechanism that depends on metal-assisted cleavage of the phosphoanhydride bond. Here, we report that purified recombinant Cet1p is a highly active NTPase. Thus, it is not specific for RNA substrates. Cet1p resembles the vaccinia and baculovirus triphosphatases in that its NTPase function is activated by manganese and cobalt. We discerned three collinear sequence motifs that are shared by yeast Cet1p, vaccinia D1, and baculovirus LEF-4. Mutational analysis establishes that conserved glutamate and arginine side chains within these motifs are essential for Cet1p function in vitro and in vivo. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the yeast RNA 5′-triphosphatase Cet1p hydrolyzes the γ phosphate of nucleoside triphosphates. The NTPase of Cet1p is activated by manganese and cobalt. This is a property shared with the triphosphatase components of the vaccinia D1 and baculovirus LEF-4 capping enzymes. The turnover number of the yeast enzyme in ATP hydrolysis (25 s−1) is similar to the values reported for the baculovirus (30 s−1) and vaccinia virus (10 s−1) triphosphatases, although the affinity of the yeast enzyme for ATP (K m = 2.8 μm) is significantly higher than that of either LEF-4 (K m = 43 μm) or vaccinia triphosphatase (K m= 800 μm) (21Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11945-11952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar).We propose that Cet1p is the prototype of a previously unrecognized family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that includes the DNA virus and yeast RNA triphosphatases involved in cap formation. A common structural basis for catalysis by members of this enzyme family is suggested by the conservation of collinear motifs A, B, and C. Conserved amino acid residues within the motifs likely comprise part of the active site. As shown here and by Yu et al. (19Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), single alanine substitutions within the three motifs abrogate or severely diminish the triphosphatase activity of yeast Cet1p and vaccinia D1. The essential residues identified by alanine scanning include the two alternating glutamates in motif A, an arginine residue in motif B, and either two (in the poxvirus capping enzymes) or three (in Cet1p and African swine fever virus capping enzyme) alternating glutamates in motif C. The effects of alanine cluster mutations in baculovirus LEF-4 are concordant with the findings for Cet1p and D1, to wit, manganese-dependent NTPase and RNA triphosphatase activities are eliminated or drastically reduced by simultaneous replacement of both motif A glutamates by alanine, by single alanine substitution for the motif B arginine, or by simultaneous replacement of the two glutamates of motif C (EYEFD) by alanine (23Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar).The marked decrease in affinity for ATP elicited by the R454A mutation of Cet1(201–549)p suggests a role for this motif B residue in substrate binding. We speculate that the arginine side chain interacts with the negatively charged 5′ triphosphate moiety. Elimination of the glutamate side chains in motifs A and C profoundly inhibited ATPase activity, even at very high substrate concentrations, which suggests a role for these residues in phosphohydrolase reaction chemistry. The glutamates in motif A and C may coordinate the essential divalent cation(s). An additional role for the proximal glutamate of motif C in substrate binding is inferred from the 9-fold increase inK m for ATP caused by the E492A mutation of Cet1(201–549)p.The sequence similarity between Cet1p and the DNA virus-encoded RNA triphosphatase/NTPases appears to be limited to motifs A, B, and C. Cet1p possesses triphosphatase activity only, whereas LEF-4 and D1 also have guanylyltransferase activities. In the baculovirus and vaccinia capping enzymes, the triphosphatase motifs are located amino-terminal to the six conserved motifs that comprise the guanylyltransferase active site (19Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The vaccinia D1 protein cannot be truncated to less than 545 amino acids without loss of its triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities. The minimum functional domains of the 464-amino acid baculovirus LEF-4 triphosphatase/guanylyltransferase have not yet been defined. The 305-amino acid Cet1p truncation mutant, Cet1(245–549)p, which retains full triphosphatase activity in vitro, is the smallest functional domain that has been identified for the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family. Additional candidates for membership in this family may emerge as genome sequencing uncovers new polypeptides containing motifs A, B, and C. For example, the 320-amino acid polypeptide encoded by the S. cerevisiae YMR180C open reading frame is homologous to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cet1p and includes all six of the amino acids in motifs A, B, and C that are important for NTP hydrolysis (Fig.4). Preliminary characterization of recombinant YM180C protein indicates that it possesses magnesium- and cobalt-dependent ATPase activity. 2C. K. Ho, unpublished observations. The function of YMR180C is unknown; this enzyme may well catalyze phosphohydrolase reactions unrelated to mRNA capping.In summary, there is now clear evidence for at least two mechanistically and structurally distinct classes of RNA 5′ triphosphatases: (i) the divalent cation-dependent RNA triphosphatase/NTPase family (exemplified by yeast Cet1p, baculovirus LEF-4, and vaccinia D1), which require motifs A, B, and C for activity, and (ii) the divalent cation-independent RNA triphosphatases,e.g. the metazoan cellular enzymes and the baculovirus enzyme BVP (30Gross C.H.

A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which require the HCxAGxGR(S/T)G phosphate-binding motif. The existence of additional classes of RNA 5′-triphosphatases is likely, given that the candidate capping enzymes of several RNA viruses and trypanosomatid protozoa lack the defining motifs of the two known RNA triphosphatase families (32Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virology. 1997; 236: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Silva E. Ullu E. Kobayashi R. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell.

Hence, the triphosphatase components of the capping apparatus provide attractive targets for the identification of specific antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoal drugs that will block capping of pathogen mRNAs but spare the mammalian host enzyme. We have shown that the yeast RNA 5′-triphosphatase Cet1p hydrolyzes the γ phosphate of nucleoside triphosphates. The NTPase of Cet1p is activated by manganese and cobalt.

The human SHBGproximal promoter was analyzed by DNase I footprinting, and the functional significance of 6 footprinted regions (FP1–FP6) within the proximal promoter was studied in human HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells. Two footprinted regions (FP1 and FP3) contain binding sites for the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4). In experiments where SHBG promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs were co-transfected into HepG2 cells with COUP-TF and/or HNF-4 expression vectors, HNF-4 markedly increased transcription, whereas COUP-TF suppressed this probably by displacing HNF-4 from their common FP1-binding site. This COUP-TF/HNF-4-binding site within FP1 includes a TTTAA sequence, located at nucleotides −30/−26 upstream of the transcription start site, which fails to interact with human TFIID, TATA-binding protein in vitro. When this sequence was replaced with an idealized HNF-4-binding site, the transcriptional activity of the promoter increased in HepG2 cells. Taken together, these data imply that an interplay between COUP-TF and HNF-4 at a site within FP1 regulates human SHBG expression and that HNF-4 controls transcription from this TATA-less promoter by somehow substituting for TATA-binding protein in the recruitment of a transcription preinitiation complex.

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)1 is a plasma glycoprotein that transports sex steroid hormones and regulates their access to target cells (1Hammond G.L. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford1993: 1-25Google Scholar). It is produced by hepatocytes, and blood levels of SHBG in humans are influenced by a variety of hormones, as well as several nutritional and metabolic regulators, including sex steroids (2Anderson D.C.

Chem. 1986; 32: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Low plasma levels of SHBG are associated with several sex steroid hormone-dependent diseases (2Anderson D.C. Clin. Endocrinol. 1974; 3: 69-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) and have been reported to be an early indicator of the onset of Type II diabetes (8Lindstedt G. Lundberg P.-A. Lapidus L. Lundgren L. Bengtsson C. Björntorp P. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 123-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cardiovascular disease (7Lapidus L. Lindstedt G. Lundberg P.-A. Bengtsson C. Gredmark T. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The gene encoding SHBG is also expressed in the Sertoli cell of the testis. When the same transcription unit responsible for hepatic production of plasma SHBG is utilized in Sertoli cells, the protein product is most often referred to as the testicular androgen-binding protein. Testicular androgen-binding protein has the same primary structure and steroid-binding properties as plasma SHBG and is thought to control androgen-dependent sperm maturation events in the male reproductive tract (1Hammond G.L. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford1993: 1-25Google Scholar, 9Joseph D.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 197-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In rodents, the testis appears to be the major site of SHBG expression in adult animals, but the gene is also expressed transiently in the fetal rat liver, and this may serve to influence the differentiation of reproductive tissues during late fetal development (10Becchis M. Sullivan P.M. Ordronneau P. Petrusz P. Joseph D.R. Steroids. 1996; 61: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The regulation of SHBG production has been studied using human HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells (11Rosner W. Aden D.P. Khan M.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1984; 59: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Loukovaara M. Carson M. Adlercreutz H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1995; 80: 160-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the molecular control of SHBG expression in the liver. Recently, genomic DNA fragments encompassing human and rat SHBG have been introduced into the mouse genome (13Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Reventos J. Sullivan P.M. Joseph D.R. Gordon J.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the temporal and spatial expression of these transgenes generally reflects the species-specific patterns of expression associated with these genes. In essence, a rat SHBG transgene, which included an ∼1.5-kb sequence flanking the major transcription start site in the rat testis, was expressed in the mouse testis at high levels, but no expression could be detected in the livers of adult transgenic mice (14Reventos J. Sullivan P.M. Joseph D.R. Gordon J.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By contrast, a human SHBG transgene comprising the entire transcription unit encoding SHBG together with ∼0.9 kb of 5′-flanking sequence was expressed in the fetal 2M. Jänne and G. L. Hammond, unpublished observations. and adult mouse livers, as well as in the adult mouse kidney (13Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Little, if any, expression of this human SHBG transgene was detected in the testis, and differences in the cis-acting regulatory sequences within the human and rat SHBG promoters most likely contribute to the distinct tissue specificity of SHBGexpression in these species. To address this issue, and to learn more about how the gene-encoding plasma SHBG is regulated in the liver, we compared the human and ratSHBG proximal promoter sequences that flank the transcription units for human SHBG in the liver and rat androgen-binding protein in the testis, and we used mouse liver nuclear protein extracts and human hepatoblastoma cells to identify possible targets for transcriptional regulators within the human SHBGpromoter. By assessing how various cis-elements identified in this way contribute to transcriptional activation, we have found that hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) plays an important role in regulating the transcription of human SHBG in liver cells. The human SHBGproximal promoter spanning nucleotides (nts) −803 to +7 (−803/+7) relative to the liver- and kidney- specific transcription start site (13Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from an 11-kb genomicHindIII DNA fragment isolated from a cosmid vector (15Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The forward primer spanned the human SHBG sequence from nts−810/−792, and the reverse primer was complementary to nts+7/−14 with a sequence (GAATGAAGCTT) for aHindIII-site at its 5′-end (Fig. 1). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and HindIII and was subcloned into the promoterless pGL2 Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega Corp., Madison WI). This gave a −803/+7SHBG proximal promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene. A−299/+7SHBG-luciferase reporter plasmid was obtained by digesting the −803/+7SHBG with XbaI andHindIII and inserting this into pGL2Basic. Several 5′-deletion fragments of the SHBG promoter were also PCR-amplified using the 11-kb human SHBG HindIII fragment as the template. The 5′-primers for these constructs corresponded to the following SHBG sequences relative to the transcription start site in the liver: nts −137/−120, nts−94/−77, and nts −62/−45 (Fig. 1). In each case, a sequence GTTTCTAGA (XbaI site) was added to the 5′-ends of these primers for subcloning. The reverse primer was the same as that used to generate the −803/+7SHBG fragment. A minimal SHBG promoter/luciferase reporter was constructed by digesting the −803/+7SHBG-luciferase construct withSmaI followed by religation to excise nts−803/−41. Mutations within footprint 1 (FP1) were created by PCR amplification of the −137/+7SHBG region with mismatch 3′-primers spanning nts −37/+7 and containing an additional sequence GAATGAAGCTT (HindIII site) at their 5′-ends. The region between nts −41/+7 of an FP1 mutant, in which the TTTAAC sequence was converted to TCCCAC, was subcloned into aSmaI-HindIII-digested pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then linked as aSmaI-ClaI fragment to nts −803/−41of the SHBG promoter in pSP72 (Promega). The−299/+7SHBG promoter fragment was subcloned between theXbaI-HindIII sites of pSELECT (Promega) for site-directed mutagenesis of footprint 3 (FP3). An SHBGpromoter fragment in which both FP1 and FP3 were mutated was constructed by replacing nts −299/−41 (XbaI-SmaI) of the FP1-mutated −803/+7SHBGsequence in pSP72 with the corresponding region of the SHBGpromoter with a mutated FP3. The mutated SHBG promoter sequences were all subcloned as XbaI-HindIII fragments into pGL2Basic for comparison with the corresponding wild type SHBG promoter-luciferase reporter construct. All PCR-generated and mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a commercially available kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Expression plasmids pRSCOUP-TF and pLEN4S for the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) and HNF-4 were kindly provided by Dr. M.-J. Tsai and Dr. F. M. Sladek, respectively. TheBamHI fragment containing the HNF-4 cDNA was excised from pLEN4S and subcloned back into the same vector in reverse orientation (pLEN4A). Nuclear proteins were isolated from adult mouse liver (16Sierra F. Azzi A. Polak J.M. Saluz H.P. BioMethods: A Laboratory Guide to In Vitro Transcription. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar), and the protein content of the extracts was determined by Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were prepared by linearizing plasmids containing the wild type or mutated−299/+7SHBG promoters and end-labeling with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP. To obtain a coding strand probe, the plasmid was linearized withHindIII. Labeled DNA was run through a Sephadex G-50 column to remove unincorporated radiolabeled nucleotides. The radiolabeled probes were released from the plasmids by digesting withXbaI and were purified by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, FPLC pure) was used at a 1:50 dilution (0.45 units/20-μl reaction) to digest approximately 20,000 cpm of end-labeled probe in an in vitrofootprinting assay (16Sierra F. Azzi A. Polak J.M. Saluz H.P. BioMethods: A Laboratory Guide to In Vitro Transcription. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). The DNase I digestions were terminated, and the products were treated with proteinase K and analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide/urea DNA sequencing gel followed by exposure to an x-ray film. A DNase I footprinting experiment with the human TFIID, TATA-binding protein (TBP), and radiolabeled wild type and mutated −137/+7 SHBG fragments, was performed as recommended by the TBP manufacturer (Promega). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as radiolabeled probes and/or unlabeled competitors. The lowercase letters indicate additional sequences that were filled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP (16Sierra F. Azzi A. Polak J.M. Saluz H.P. BioMethods: A Laboratory Guide to In Vitro Transcription. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated with or without an excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide in the presence of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 10 min on ice, 25 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature. For antibody supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated (as above) on ice for 10 min before, and 15 min after, addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Aliquots (1 μl) of antiserum or normal rabbit serum were then added and the complexes were further incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The COUP-TF antiserum (provided by Dr. M.-J. Tsai) was used undiluted and the HNF-4 antiserum (provided by Dr. F. M. Sladek) was diluted 1:5 in physiological saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from the free probe by native 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.45m Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film against an intensifying screen at −80 °C. All cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Canada). Human HepG2 hepatoblastoma and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were grown initially in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections of human SHBG promoter reporter plasmids together with a pCMVlacZ control plasmid were carried out using LipofectAMINE® reagent according to Life Technologies, Inc. In trans-activation experiments, the reporter plasmids (1 μg) were mixed with 100 ng of COUP-TF and/or HNF-4 expression plasmids and a pCMVlacZ control plasmid (200 ng). In these experiments, similar amounts of pLEN4A containing the HNF-4 cDNA in the antisense orientation, or pBR322, were used in the absence of pLEN4S and pRSCOUP-TF, respectively, to correct for DNA amounts, and 5 or 10 mm sodium butyrate was included in the culture medium for HepG2 and HeLa cells, respectively, to ensure efficient HNF-4 production from pLEN4S. 3F. M. Sladek, personal communication. Approximately 48 h after the start of transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing. Appropriate aliquots of cell extracts were used for measurements of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity, as recommended by Promega. To correct for transfection efficiency, light units from the luciferase assay were divided by the OD reading from the β-galactosidase assay. To map regulatory elements within the human SHBG promoter, and to identify transcription factors that regulate SHBG expression in hepatocytes, we PCR-amplified the human SHBG promoter region from nts −803 to +7 relative to the transcription start site in the liver (13Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed differences when compared with the published SHBG sequence (15Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), including a 113-bp region that was missing from the GenBankTMM31651 sequence. These discrepancies were confirmed by resequencing the corresponding region from an 11-kbHindIII human SHBG genomic fragment excised from a cosmid clone (15Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The additional 113-bp sequence includes anXbaI site at position −299, which was previously mapped by Gershagen et al. (18Gershagen S. Lundwall A. Fernlund P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9245-9258Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The revised human SHBGpromoter sequence aligned with the corresponding region of ratSHBG (GenBankTMM19993) is shown in Fig.1. The 5′-end of the human sequence shown here contains part of an Alu sequence (15Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and does not align with the rat SHBG proximal promoter sequence (19Joseph D.R. Hall S.H. Conti M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To identify binding sites for trans-acting factors, we performed a DNase I-footprinting assay using the−299/+7SHBG promoter region as template. Nuclear proteins were isolated from adult mouse liver because this tissue expresses human SHBG transgenes at a high level (13Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). At least six regions within this SHBG promoter fragment are recognized by mouse liver nuclear proteins and are protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 2): footprint 1 (FP1) spans nts−41/−18; footprint 2 (FP2) spans nts −61/−52; footprint 3 (FP3) spans nts −88/66; footprint 4 (FP4) spans nts −114/−96; footprint 5 (FP5) spans nts−152/−134; and footprint 6 (FP6) spans nts−200/−177. Sites that are hypersensitive to digestion can also be seen between these footprinted regions (Fig. 2). Other footprints further upstream of FP6 were observed in similar experiments, but these were not defined further because maximal activity of the human SHBG proximal promoter in HepG2 cells is associated with a region encompassed by footprints 1–4 (see below). To assess the functional importance of footprints 1–6 identified in Fig. 2 and to define the minimal requirements for human SHBG promoter activity in hepatocytes, we constructed a series of 5′-deletion mutants of −803/+7SHBG fused to a luciferase reporter gene. TheXbaI site in this promoter sequence was used to create a−299/+7SHBG promoter reporter construct, and both FP5 and FP6 were eliminated from it by removing the SHBG sequences −299/−137, whereas footprints 1–4 were removed individually by further 5′-deletions. The 3′-end of these deletion mutants was maintained at nt +7 relative to the transcription start site (Fig.3). These promoter deletion constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells that produce SHBG (20Khan M.S. Knowles B.B. Aden D.P. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1981; 53: 448-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The results indicate that footprints 1–4 are required for transcriptional activity in these cells and that the region upstream of nt −299 contains elements that suppress transcription, as evidenced by a 2-fold increase in promoter activity when these sequences are deleted (Fig. 3). Each human SHBG promoter deletion fragment was also analyzed in the context of a luciferase reporter gene in HeLa cells to assess the cellular specificity of its transcriptional activity (not shown). Although the promoter was active in this cell line, the reporter gene expression was lower than in HepG2 cells and regulation at each of the footprinted regions was not observed. The footprinted region (FP1) closest to the hepatic transcription start site spans theSHBG promoter sequence from nts −41/−18 and includes a TTTAAC sequence starting at position −30. Since there is no distinct TATA box in the human or rat SHBG promoters (15Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,19Joseph D.R. Hall S.H. Conti M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether this TATA-like sequence is recognized by the transcription initiation complex. This TTTAAC sequence is also conserved between the rat (19Joseph D.R. Hall S.H. Conti M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), mouse,2and human SHBG promoters (Fig. 1) and was therefore thought to represent an important element for basal transcription. Since a reporter construct containing only 137 bp upstream of theSHBG transcription start site had the maximal activity among the constructs tested in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3), we modified this promoter fragment to study the TTTAA sequence in FP1. Sequences that deviate from the canonical TATA element have been shown to bind TFIID, and mutations within such elements generally abolish the activity of a given promoter (21Hobson G.M. Molloy G.R. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6533-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Innis J.W. Moore D.J. Kash S.F. Ramamurthy V. Sawadogo M. Kellems R.E. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We therefore produced two different mutations by PCR amplification of the −137/+7SHBGregion with mismatch 3′-primers, and we analyzed these mutated promoter fragments in the context of a luciferase reporter gene. When the TTTAAC sequence was altered to TCCCAC, the promoter activity was reduced by 80% in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4 A). The same sequence was also converted into an ideal TATA sequence, TATAAA, because this was expected to increase the affinity of TFIID for this sequence and to thereby increase the transcriptional activity of the promoter (26Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5814-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, this mutation again reduced the activity of the SHBG promoter by approximately 24% (Fig.4 A), and this suggested that a factor other than TFIID recognizes the TTTAA sequence within FP1 in hepatoblastoma cells. This was confirmed by DNase I footprinting wild type and mutated−137/+7SHBG fragments with the TBP of TFIID, which showed that the wild type SHBG sequence between nts −30/−25 is very poorly protected by TBP when compared with the mutant that contains an optimal TATA sequence in this position (Fig.4 B). The two FP1 mutants were also tested in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). In these cells, an optimal TATA sequence at −30 increased the promoter activity by almost 3-fold, and these data suggest that TFIID can recognize a TATA box in this promoter context in HeLa cells but not in HepG2 cells. Although a sequence within FP1 (GGGCAACCTTTAACCCT) also resembles a binding site for the liver-enriched transcription factor, HNF-1, an oligonucleotide corresponding the HNF-1 site in the rat albumin promoter (27Herbomel P. Rollier A. Tronche F. Ott M.-O. Yaniv M. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4750-4758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to displace complexes from an FP1 probe in a competition EMSA, and this indicated that the protein that binds FP1 in the human SHBG promoter was not related to HNF-1 (data not shown). Further analysis using MatInspector (28Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) Release 2.1 revealed some similarities between a sequence within FP1 (CAACCTTTAACCCT) and the consensus HNF-4-binding site (29Kimura A.

By contrast, a consensus binding site (GGGTCAAGGGTCA) for COUP-TF (30Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), which is known to share binding sites with HNF-4 in several promoters (29Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was readily identified within FP3. To analyze the protein-DNA interactions at these elements, we performed EMSAs with mouse liver nuclear proteins and double-stranded oligonucleotides as radiolabeled probes. Fig.5 shows the complexes that form between nuclear proteins and FP1 (nts −41/−18) and FP3 (nts−88/−66). The specificity of these DNA-protein interactions was demonstrated by preincubating the nuclear extract with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides, which compete the nuclear proteins from their respective complexes (lanes 3 and4, and 13 and 14), whereas unrelated sequences (SP-1 consensus or human SHBG FP4) are unable to do this (lanes 7–10 and 17–20). Oligonucleotides specific for FP1 and FP3 also compete with each other (lanes 5 and 6 and 15 and16), and this indicates that the same DNA-binding protein(s) recognize both elements. This competition assay also indicates that FP3 has a higher affinity for these factors than does FP1 (see Fig. 5,lanes 5 and 6 versus 15 and16). Antisera specific for COUP-TF and HNF-4 were used to confirm the identities of proteins that bind to FP1 and FP3 in the humanSHBG promoter. In an EMSA, antisera against mouse COUP-TF or rat HNF-4 partially supershift the complexes, and the supershifts are essentially complete when these antisera are used in combination (Fig.6). Thus, these two sites, which are separated by only 23 bps in the human SHBG promoter, are recognized by both COUP-TF and HNF-4 in liver nuclear extracts. From these data, it also appears that FP1 is occupied preferentially by COUP-TF (Fig. 6, lane 3 versus lane 4), whereas FP3 is bound by COUP-TF and HNF-4 at essentially similar levels when the same nuclear extract is used (Fig. 6,lane 8 versus lane 9). Site-specific mutations that interfere with the binding of COUP-TF and HNF-4 to FP1 and FP3 in the human SHBGpromoter were used to analyze these DNA-protein interactions in greater detail. The alteration of the TTTAAC sequence to either TCCCAC or TATAAA within FP-1 reduced the transcriptional activity of the −137/+7SHBG promoter in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4 A), and the same alterations within an FP1 oligonucleotide abolished any protein binding in an EMSA (not shown). The two consensus thymidines within the COUP-TF-binding site in FP3 were changed to cytosines by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.7 A), and this also abolished protein binding in an EMSA (not shown). When these mutations (Fig. 7 A) were introduced either individually or together into the −299/+7SHBG promoter, the altered FP1 and FP3 were not protected from DNase I digestion in anin vitro footprinting assay (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, these mutations appear to disrupt protein binding to FP1 and FP3 without disturbing the binding of other nuclear"

In the present work we evaluated the regulation and kinetics of the 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated SOC influx in chick muscle cells. Stimulation with 10−9m 1,25(OH)2D3 in Ca2+-free medium resulted in a rapid (40–60 s) but transient [Ca2+]i rise, which correlated with sterol-dependent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production.

PPI-PLC blockade prior to 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation suppressed both the [Ca2+]i transient and the SOC influx. 1,25(OH)2D3-induced SOC entry was markedly increased after 3 min of treatment (30% above basal) and then rapidly reached a steady-state level. The sterol-stimulated SOC influx was prevented by protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase inhibitors but unaffected by blockade of the protein kinase A pathway.

The steroid hormone 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D3(1,25(OH)2D3)1modulates calcium homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells by two modes of action: a classical genomic one (long term responses) involving high affinity binding to an intracellular vitamin D receptor followed by association of the steroid-vitamin D receptor complex with vitamind-responsive elements to elicit control of gene expression (1Minghetti P. Norman A.W. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3043-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and a nongenomic (rapid responses) mechanism that implies direct membrane effects of the hormone (2Boland R.

Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the proposal that 1,25(OH)2D3 activation of second messenger systems in muscle cells involves the existence of a putative cell surface receptor for the hormone (3Boland R. de Boland A.R. Marinissen M. Santillan G. Vazquez G. Zanello S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 114: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), as proposed for this and other steroids in various cell types (15Welshons W. Grady L.H. Judy B.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Blackmore P.F. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 521-538Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol.

However, the existence of such a membrane receptor still remains as an open question. Recently, in a preliminary communication we examined the regulatory action of 1,25(OH)2D3 on cytosolic Ca2+levels in skeletal muscle cells (13Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The hormone triggers a complex [Ca2+]i response that involves an initial rapid sterol-induced Ca2+ mobilization from thapsigargin-sensitive internal stores followed by cation influx from the extracellular milieu. This hormone-induced Ca2+ influx was shown to be contributed not only by the well establishedl-type VDCC-mediated Ca2+ entry but also by a store-operated Ca2+ influx (SOCE) pathway, thus introducing a novel aspect into the mechanism of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane of muscle cells. SOCE has been observed in most cells that have been specifically examined, including both nonexcitable as well as excitable cell systems (19Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Despite the plethora of messenger systems that have been related to SOCE regulation (20Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 21Putney J.W. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), mobilization and/or depletion of Ca2+ from endogenous (both IP3-sensitive and -nonsensitive) stores seems to be an almost unavoidable step in activation of SOC channels. In the present work we further evaluated SOC-mediated Ca2+influx in avian muscle cells by fluorimetry to analyze both the kinetics and regulation of the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced SOCE pathway in these cells. Sterol-induced activation of PPI-PLC seems to be a prerequisite for Ca2+ influx through SOC channels to occur, apparently by mobilization and/or depletion of IP3-sensitive stores. Evidence points to a role for both PKC and tyrosine kinase (TK) activities but not the cyclic AMP/PKA cascade in the regulation of the sterol-dependent SOCE pathway. Interestingly, although a thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store apparently accounts for the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced, IP3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, different signaling mechanisms appear to be responsible for activation and/or regulation of sterol- and thapsigargin-dependent SOC influx. 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 was kindly provided by Dr. L.

Undifferentiated, myogenic chick skeletal muscle cells (myoblasts) were isolated from the breast muscle of 13-day-old white leghorn chick embryos essentially as described before (14Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar), seeded at appropriate density (120,000 cells/cm2) in Petri dishes (80 mm) for IP3 measurements or onto glass coverslips (24 × 6 mm) for intracellular calcium measurements, and cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere (air/5% CO2). Cells were allowed to grow until confluence (4–6 days after plating) before use. Under these conditions, myoblasts proliferate within the first 48 h and at the fourth day become differentiated into myotubes expressing both biochemical and morphological characteristics of adult skeletal muscle fibers. 2D.

Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cell dye loading was achieved by incubating the cells in buffer A containing (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 Hepes (pH 7.35), 1.5 CaCl2, plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 μm Fura-2/pentaacetoxymethyl ester, and 0.012% pluronic F-127 in the dark during 45–60 min at room temperature. Unloaded dye was washed out, and cells were stored in buffer B (buffer A without bovine serum albumin, Fura-2/pentaacetoxymethyl ester, and pluronic F-127) in the dark at room temperature for at least 40 min prior to use. The coverslips were then placed into quartz cuvettes containing buffer B and introduced into the thermostatized (37 °C) sample compartment of a SLM Aminco 8100 spectrofluorimeter (Spectronics Inc., Urbana, IL) under constant stirring. Fura-2 intracellular fluorescence intensity was monitored at an emission wavelength of 510 nm (8-nm band pass) by alternating the excitation wavelength between 340 and 390 nm with a dual excitation monochromator (4-nm band pass). Signals from short and long wavelength were divided (r = 340/390), and calibration to calculate [Ca2+]i was performed for each coverslip essentially as described previously by us (13Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Maximal (R max) and minimal (R min) values were determined by adding 5 μm ionomycin plus 3 mm Ca2+ and 10 mm EGTA (pH 9.0), respectively. Under these conditions the dissociation constant (K d) for the Ca2+-Fura-2 complex is assumed to be 225 nm, and [Ca2+]iderives from (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): [Ca2+]i =K d (R −R min)/(R max −R) × β, where R is the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence at the selected wavelengths, R maxand R min represent ratios from Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-free intracellular dye, respectively, and β is the ratio between the specific fluorescence of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms of the dye at the longer wavelength (Sf2/Sb2). In some experiments, a Ca2+-free extracellular medium was used (free Ca2+ concentration near 1 nm) by preparing a nominally Ca2+-free buffer B (see composition above) plus 1 mm EGTA. Free Ca2+ levels were calculated by using the WinMaxc program (version 1.7; Ref. 23Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Nuccitelli R. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press, New York1994: 21-28Google Scholar), with the association constants and K d for the EGTA-Ca2+ complex corrected for pH, temperature, and ionic strength of the buffer (24Bers D. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Harrison M. Bers D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All buffers and saline solutions used were prepared with deionized water. Fura-2 loaded cells were exposed to 1,25(OH)2D3 or thapsigargin, and variations in [Ca2+]i were monitored from the 340/390 fluorescence ratio. When [Ca2+]istabilized, dual wavelength excitation was changed to single wavelength excitation at 360 nm, and Mn2+ influx was initiated (zero time for cation influx) by addition of 1 mmMnCl2 to the medium. When the rate of Mn2+influx was measured, fluorescence quenching by Mn2+precluded calibration of the signals to calculate [Ca2+]i. Maximal quenching (100%) at each condition was obtained by adding 0.05% Triton X-100. To compensate for differences in absolute fluorescence between experiments, the Mn2+ influx was expressed as a percentage of quenching related to maximal cytosolic quenching. The cells were equilibrated in Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 10 mmglucose for 20 min at 37 °C. Then 30 mm LiCl was added, and the incubation proceeded for an additional period of 10 min. The medium was aspirated, and vehicle (<0.1% ethanol) or 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−9m) was added for the indicated times. Treatment was stopped by aspirating the medium and immediately freezing the cells in liquid air. Monolayers were then scraped off and transferred to plastic tubes, and ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration) was added. Samples were left on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 1,000 × g(10 min, 4 °C). Trichloroacetic acid was extracted four times with 5 volumes of water-saturated diethylether. IP3 was quantitated by a radioreceptor assay (26Bredt D. Mourey R. Snyder S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 976-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using a commercially available kit. Statistical significance of data was evaluated using Student's t test (27Snedecor G. Cochran W. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1967: 59-62Google Scholar), and probability values below 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered significant. Quantitative data are expressed as the means ± S.D. from the indicated set of experiments. Stimulation of chick muscle cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 triggers a specific and rapid increase in [Ca2+]i that stays elevated as long as the cells are exposed to the hormone (Fig.1 and Ref. 13Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The plateau phase of this [Ca2+]i response is due to Ca2+influx, partially contributed by a SOCE pathway. We next examined whether sterol-induced activation of PPI-PLC was needed for occurrence of such hormone-dependent SOC influx. When skeletal muscle cells were stimulated with 10−9m1,25(OH)2D3 in Ca2+-free extracellular medium, the hormone produced a rapid (40–60 s) but transient [Ca2+]i rise (Fig.2 A) that was entirely due to mobilization from endogenous stores without contribution of cation influx, as there were no significant differences in average peak [Ca2+]i when Ca2+ (1.5 mm; Fig. 1) or VDCC blockers (see Table I in Ref. 13Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were present in the bath. Moreover, this sterol-induced Ca2+transient was totally blocked by pretreatment with the PPI-PLC inhibitors U73122 and neomycin (Fig. 2 B) but not by U73343(not shown), an analogue of U73122 without effect on PPI-PLC (28Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick S.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar), and was temporally correlated with the hormone-dependent monophasic generation of IP3, which peaked at 60 s with a 2.3-fold induction over basal values (Fig.3). To evaluate the hormone-dependent SOC influx we used the Ca2+readdition protocol, which has been shown to be a sensitive procedure to measure changes in Ca2+ influx through the SOCE pathway (29Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 30Xu X. Kitamura K. Lau K. Muallem S. Miller T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29169-29175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fura-2 loaded cells were stimulated with 1,25(OH)2D3 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+; once the rapid and transient elevation in [Ca2+]i occurred, Ca2+ readdition (1.5 mm) was performed after [Ca2+]ifell down to levels equal or close to basal. At this point, readdition of Ca2+ resulted in a fast (30–60 s) and sustained [Ca2+]i rise (about 1.8–2.2- fold over basal), thus evidencing Ca2+ influx from the outside through a preactivated pathway (Fig. 2 A, right arrow). Ca2+ readmission to cells not previously exposed to the sterol resulted in no detectable Ca2+ influx (not shown). Functional isolation of a SOC entry pathway in excitable cells requires suppression of the large Ca2+ influx that normally occurs through VDCCs. We achieved this by adding either nifedipine or verapamil at concentrations known to effectively block VDCC-mediated Ca2+ influx in our cell system (5Morelli S. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar) after the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced [Ca2+]i transient but 2 min prior to Ca2+ readmission. This did not affect the Ca2+influx that normally follows Ca2+ readdition (Fig.4); however, it was fully inhibited by La3+ (10 μm) and Ni2+ (2 mm), which are known to block SOC influx in nonexcitable cell systems (31Pandol S.J. Schoeffield M.S. Fimmel C.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16963-16968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kwan C.Y. Takemura H. Obie J.F. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1006-C1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+ entry observed by the Ca2+-free/Ca2+ readdition protocol mainly reflects Ca2+ entering the cell via SOC channels. Because Ca2+ entry through a SOCE pathway is proportional to the degree of depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ store (33Llopis J. Kass G.E. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the magnitude of SOC entry measured by the Ca2+ readdition protocol, which imposes store depletion without chance of refilling until the cation is added back to the bath, is exacerbated when compared with that of the total (VDCC plus SOC) Ca2+ influx observed under physiological stimulation with the sterol (see plateau phase in Fig. 1). Incubation of muscle cells with U73122 or neomycin after the sterol-induced [Ca2+]i transient had no effect on the SOCE pathway (Fig. 4). However, addition of these PPI-PLC inhibitors prior to 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation not only suppressed the sterol [Ca2+]i response (Fig.2 B) but also the SOC influx (not shown).Figure 21,25(OH)2D3-induced mobilization of Ca2+ from endogenous stores: sensitivity to PPI-PLC inhibitors U73122 and neomycin.

Theright arrow indicates Ca2+ (1.5 mm) readdition to the medium to show the existence of a preactivated (store-operated) Ca2+ influx pathway.

Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mn2+ is a good Ca2+ surrogate, because it is not pumped out of the cell and can be considered a selective tracer for Ca2+ entry (34Suh B.C. Song S.K. Kim Y.K. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32753-32759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, VDCCs share very low permeability for Mn2+ (35Lundgren T. Linde A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Densmore J.J. Haverstick D.M. Szabo G. Gray L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1494-C1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, for a more close estimation of influx through the sterol-dependent SOCE pathway, the Ca2+ readdition protocol was used, but Mn2+ (1 mm) was added instead of Ca2+. The resultant Mn2+-induced quenching of intracellular Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at the isosbestic (Ca2+-insensitive) wavelength of the dye, associated to SOC channel activity (37Fasolato C. Hoth M. Matthews G. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3068-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated cells, the Fura-2 signal was quenched at a rate 2.5–3 times faster than in control cells (Fig.5 A). We previously observed that depletion of endogenous Ca2+ stores by pretreating the cells with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin effectively blocks the response to the sterol (13Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present conditions, thapsigargin (1 μm), similarly to the hormone, markedly increased Mn2+ influx (3–5-fold over control, p < 0.001). As expected, the sterol-activated Mn2+ entry was totally suppressed by both La3+(10 μm) and Ni2+ (2 mm) but unaffected by VDCC or PPI-PLC blockers (Fig. 5 A). These results are similar to those observed with the Ca2+readdition protocol, thus indicating that the pathways of sterol-induced Mn2+ entry and SOC influx are the same. To follow both the kinetics and time course of such cation entry activation, a set of experiments were performed in which Mn2+ was simultaneously added with 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 5 B). As shown, 1,25(OH)2D3-induced SOC influx was not significantly stimulated until at least 2–3 min of hormone treatment had elapsed, but once activated, it rapidly reached a steady-state level (45% above basal) with a half-time constant (t 12) to peak of 0.5 min. These results show that a lag time exists between 1,25(OH)2D3 coupling to its putative membrane receptor and SOC channel activation. To address the possibility that PKC, PKA, and TK could play a role in the modulation of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced SOC influx, we assessed the effect of specific inhibitors of these signaling cascades on the hormone-regulated process by using the Mn2+quench technique. All the inhibitors used were added into the incubation medium after occurrence of the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced [Ca2+]i transient, and 2 min later Mn2+ was added. It is pertinent to note that pretreatment of muscle cells with either of these inhibitors completely suppressed any [Ca2+]i change due to sterol stimulation (see under “Discussion” for extensive considerations on this point). Bisindolylmaleimide I and calphostin C, cell-permeable, highly specific PKC inhibitors (39Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Akajane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E.

Commun. 1989; 548: 1989-1995Google Scholar), were used to evaluate the involvement of this kinase on the 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent SOCE pathway. Fig. 6 A shows that these two PKC inhibitors dose-dependently suppressed hormone-stimulated Mn2+ influx in chick muscle cells, a complete inhibition being achieved at 50 and 100 nm for bisindolylmaleimide and calphostin, respectively. Notoriously, the thapsigargin-induced Mn2+ influx was insensitive to these inhibitors (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−9m) after the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i transient occurred or, conversely, thapsigargin (1 μm) added after the sterol-dependent [Ca2+]itransient took place did not affect the subsequent corresponding SOC influxes (data not shown). The involvement of PKA in the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry was investigated by testing the effect of a specific adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ22,536 (41Iannone M.A. Wolberg G. Zimmerman T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20177-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to effectively block cyclase activation by the sterol in chick muscle cells (7Vazquez G. Boland R. de Boland A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In consequence, SQ22,536 precludes PKA activation by suppressing 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levels. We observed here that SQ22,536 (0.5 mm) did not alter the SOCE pathway activated either by the sterol or thapsigargin (Fig. 6). Finally, the possible involvement of tyrosine kinase activity was examined by using the TK inhibitor genistein (42Liu Y. Bhalla K. Hill C. Priest D.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, genistein (50–100 μm) completely prevented Mn2+ influx in response to the sterol but not that induced by thapsigargin. The observed effects of the inhibitor are highly probable to be specific because the concentrations used here do not alter the activi"

We studied the effects of IFN-γ on Rab5a, a GTPase involved in both endocytosis and phagocytosis. IFN-γ induced the synthesis of Rab5a in mononuclear cells as detected by immunoprecipitation and by Western blotting. Rab5a messenger RNA levels were also increased. Elevated protein expression was detected as early as 6 h following IFN-γ and was maximal at 24 h. Following IFN-γ, membrane association of Rab5a:GTP was substantially increased. Rab5b and Rab5c, as well as Rab7 and Rab11, Rab GTPases localized in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, were unaffected by IFN-γ. Moreover, Rab5a expression in non-macrophages was unaltered by IFN-γ. Rab5a is a prenylated protein, and newly synthesized Rab5a was rapidly processed following IFN-γ. However, elevated geranylgeranylation was not Rab5a-specific since all the Rab5 isoforms were more rapidly prenylatedin vitro using cytosol from IFN-γ-treated cells. Last, guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab5a was elevated about 3-fold in the presence of cytosol from IFN-γ-treated cells. The selective effect of IFN-γ on Rab5a, synthesis, processing, and nucleotide exchange suggests that Rab isoforms have closely associated but not identical functions and that selective enhancement of membrane trafficking may play a key role in intracellular killing.

At least one Rab5 GTPase activating protein (GAP) has been described that putatively acts on membrane-bound Rab5 to enhance GTP-hydrolysis (11Xiao G.H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemi E.A. Yeng R.S. J.

Rab5 isoform messengers are ubiquitously expressed, and the three proteins have overlapping intracellular distributions.

Human and mouse recombinant IFN-γ (Genzyme) were used at 100–200 units/ml. Cells were lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10 nm α-PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 nmpepstatin-A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm NaF followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, for 45 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were precleared overnight at 4 °C by incubation with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-A-Sepharose beads. The supernatants were then incubated with antibodies for 4–5 h at 4 °C, and at 1 h prior to washing, 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added. Beads were washed with lysis buffer, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; lysis buffer, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 500 mm NaCl and 1/20 lysis buffer, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Elution was performed in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 1 h at room temperature. For Western blots, 30 μg of total protein (measured by the BCA method, Pierce Chemicals, IL) was loaded per lane, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in PBS, 5% nondairy milk for at least 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 45 min at room temperature using a 1:10,000 dilution. HMφs at 5 × 106/ml were treated with hIFN-γ (100 units/ml) for different periods of time (0, 1, 2, 8, and 18 h). Total RNA was isolated from the Mφs by the phenol/guanidine thiocyanate procedure using TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, OH). Complementary DNA was synthesized with a Perkin-Elmer kit using the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA in RNase-DNase free autoclaved water was mixed with 3 μl of oligo(dT)15primer, heated for 15 min at 65 °C. After cooling on ice, the following reagents were added: 4 μl of 5× first strand buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μl of reverse transcriptase (20 units/ml), 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (20 units/ml), 2 μl of dNTPs (30 mm each). The mixture was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, heat-inactivated for 5 min at 95 °C, and stored at −20 °C. Limiting dilution PCRs were performed as described previously (15Schwan W.R. Goebel W. Proc.

Prenylation was performed as described previously (4Barbieri A.M. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 8 μg of GST-Rab5a, GST-Rab5b, or GST-Rab5c were incubated in 40 μl of 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Nonidet-P40, 1 mm DTT containing 12 μm[3H]GGPP for 30 min in the presence of control cytosol or cytosol obtained from HMφs treated with IFN-γ (150 units/ml for 18 h). Reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were exposed to film for 4 days to quantitate incorporated radiolabel. Protocol was performed as described (16Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of GST-Rab5a was incubated with 10 μm[3H]GDP for 20 min at 37 °C in HBE-loading buffer (HBE containing 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 40 μg/ml BSA). A 10-fold excess of HBE-exchange buffer (HBE-loading buffer containing 1 mm GTP-15 mmMgCl2) was added together with 5 μl of cytosol (Sephadex G-25 filtered; 0.5 mg/ml) obtained from control macrophages or cytosol from HMφs treated with IFN-γ (18 h, 150 units/ml). GDP/GTP exchange was determined at RT by removing 5-μl aliquots at different times (0, 5, 15, and 30 min) and passing the samples through nitrocellulose filter disks coupled to a vacuum system. Filters were washed twice in ice-cold HBE-washing buffer (HBE containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2) and dried. Radioactivity was determined in a β-counter. Phagosomes were isolated from HMφs with or without IFN-γ treatment (18 h, 150 units/ml), following phagocytosis of Listeria monocytogenes (LM), as described earlier with minor modifications (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Alvarez-Dominguez C. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 731-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, crude phagosomal fractions were loaded onto an 8.8–20-40% discontinuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 45 min. LM containing phagosomes were recovered from the 20–40% interface and lower 20% sucrose fraction. Phagosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 25 min. IFN-γ induces the synthesis of a wide variety of proteins in mononuclear cells leading to activation and enhanced intracellular killing (1Bach E.A. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Because Rab GTPases are essential for membrane trafficking events leading to phagosome lysosome fusion, we examined the effect of IFN-γ on intracellular levels of Rab5. Incubation of human macrophages (HMφs) with IFN-γ (100–200 units/ml) increased both newly synthesized Rab5a protein and Rab5a mRNA levels (Fig.1). Newly synthesized Rab5a (Fig. 1,panel A) was detected after metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with a Rab5a-specific monoclonal antibody 4F11 (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,14Bucci C. Wandinger-Ness A. Lutcke A. Chiarello M. Bruni C.B. Zerial M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and mRNA levels were recorded by limiting dilution RT-PCR using primers for hRab5a (Fig. 1 B). β-Actin message levels remained unaltered following IFN-γ. Induction of Rab5a mRNA was detected 1 h after IFN-γ, whereas the increase in Rab5a protein synthesis was first observed after 2 h. Rab5a mRNA levels remained higher in cells treated with IFN-γ for up to 8 h. After 18 h, Rab5a mRNA levels returned to a basal state approximating that found in untreated cells. Enhanced biosynthesis of Rab5a remained high for at least 18 h. The lack of coincidence of apparent mRNA synthesis and Rab5a protein synthesis may be because of the combination of a rapidly responsive but short lived RNA and a long lived protein. Interferon-γ is known to regulate a number of rapidly responsive genes. The experiments also revealed that, in addition to enhancing the synthesis of Rab5a (5–8-fold), IFN-γ had a pronounced effect on the post-translational processing of the protein. A shift in the migration of newly synthesized Rab5a was observed following SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitated Rab5a. This shift was discernible after 4 h of IFN-γ treatment and was clearly evident after 6–8 h. Rapid post-translational processing of Rab5a in untreated macrophages was not detected. Rab5a has two potential geranylation sites at the C terminus of the molecule. Because Rab5a is prenylated in both control and treated macrophages, the rapid shift in migration of Rab5a, as detected by SDS-PAGE following IFN-γ treatment, may be because of the addition of two prenyl groups. Previous reports showed that following transient expression of Rab5a, the newly synthesized ∼25-kDa polypeptide is processed by post-translational modification via C-terminal isoprenylation, resulting in a decreased molecular mass (∼23 kDa) (7Li G. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Peter M. Chavrier P. Nigg E.A. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 857-865PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate the effect of IFN-γ on Rab5a synthesis in the absence of processing, we inhibited geranylgeranylation with lovastatin (10 μm), a specific inhibitor of isoprenylation (7Li G. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). Lovastatin had no effect on IFN-γ induction of Rab5a synthesis. However, compared with cells not exposed to the inhibitor, the processing of Rab5a to an apparent lower molecular mass form was prevented. These data suggest that processing events leading to a mature form of Rab5a are either because of prenylation or occur after prenylation. They also suggested that IFN-γ signaling results in enhanced prenylation of Rab5a. This conclusion was confirmed by examining the prenylation of the GST-Rab5a fusion protein in the presence of cytosol obtained from control HMφs or cells treated with IFN-γ (18 h, 150 units/ml). As shown in Fig.1 D, there is a substantial increase in GST-Rab5a prenylation in the presence of cytosol from IFN-γ-treated HMφs. Rab5 is expressed as three isoforms. The IFN-γ effect on Rab5 synthesis was highly specific for Rab5a since none of the other Rab5 isoforms were affected by IFN-γ treatment either at the mRNA level (Fig. 1 B) or at the protein level (Fig.2 A). RT-PCRs with primers specific for each isoform (i.e. primers that fail to amplify the other isoforms (data not shown)), showed that mRNA levels of Rab5b and Rab5c remain unaltered by IFN-γ treatment (Fig.1 B). Metabolic labeling of HMφs and immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies that exclusively recognize a single isoform (12Bucci C. Lutcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Chiarello M. Bruni C.B. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) showed that IFN-γ treatment had no effect on Rab5b or Rab5c (Fig. 2 A) synthesis. However, cytosol from cells treated with IFN-γ, when incubated with GST-Rab5b or GST-Rab5c (Fig.1 D), resulted in elevated levels of prenylation on all three Rab5 isoforms. These data indicate that the increase in prenylation is not specific for the Rab5a isoform. It is interesting to note that Rab5a appears to be a significantly better substrate for the induced prenyltransferase activity compared with Rab5b or Rab5c. It is possible that other Rab5a-specific factors are induced that allow Rab5a to be more rapidly prenylated. Rab7 and Rab11, GTPases acting downstream of Rab5 and localized in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway (18Feng Y. Press B. Wandiger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 19Mukhopadhyay A. Barbieri A.M. Funato K. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), were not induced by IFN-γ treatment as shown by Western blot assays of whole cell lysates (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, nonphagocytic cell types such as A431 human epithelial cells, fibroblasts (L929 mouse cell line), or B cells (mouse A20 cell line), which express IFN-γ receptors, were unaffected (Fig. 2 C) (1Bach E.A. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). However, in macrophage-cell lines such as J774E clone, IFN-γ clearly induced the synthesis of Rab5a. In Mφs, the effects of IFN-γ are principally associated with clearance of intracellular pathogens (1Bach E.A. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 3Higginbotham J.N. Lin T.L. Pruet S.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 88: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Membrane trafficking pathways leading to phagosome-lysosome fusion would be obvious targets of IFN-γ action (2Kielian M.C. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 153: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Higginbotham J.N. Lin T.L. Pruet S.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 88: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To delineate the effects of IFN-γ on Rab5a function, we examined the intracellular localization of Rab5a following IFN-γ treatment. Metabolically labeled HMφs were homogenized in HBE (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.2) and fractionated by sedimentation. Rab5a was then immunoprecipitated from membrane and cytosol fractions. Fig.3 A shows that most of the newly synthesized Rab5a following IFN-γ induction is localized to the membrane fraction (m). Indeed, the membrane/cytosol (m/c) ratio of immunoprecipitated Rab5a after IFN-γ increased from four in untreated macrophages to nine in IFN-γ-treated cells. Increased membrane association may be because of accelerated geranylgeranylation of newly synthesized Rab5a as shown in Fig. 1 D. Taken together these data demonstrate that IFN-γ specifically enhances Rab5a synthesis and processing (i.e.isoprenylation) in mononuclear cells, including translocation of newly synthesized Rab5a to intracellular membranes. Similar to most low molecular weight GTPases, Rab5 is active in the GTP form (4Barbieri A.M. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). As a first approximation of the effects of IFN-γ on Rab5 function, we examined the guanine nucleotide status of Rab5a on phagosomal membranes. HMφs were incubated overnight with [32P]orthophosphate. The cells were then pulsed for 10 min with L. monocytogenes, an intracellular pathogen efficiently internalized by Mφs. Listeria containing phagosomes were isolated by differential sedimentation (6Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Alvarez-Dominguez C. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 731-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab5a was rapidly immunoprecipitated following solubilization of the phagosomal membranes. [32P]guanine nucleotides were released from the immunoprecipitates and were separated by thin layer chromatography to allow estimation of the GTP:GDP ratio. As shown in Fig.3 B, the GTP:GDP ratio of membrane-bound Rab5a increased by 2-fold in response to IFN-γ (from 0.83 to 1.66). We conclude that IFN-γ not only induces Rab5a expression and processing but also guanine nucleotide exchange or hydrolysis or both. The GEFs that mediate exchange of GDP for GTP (9Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and GAP that promotes the GTP hydrolysis (11Xiao G.H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemi E.A. Yeng R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) are two key activities that regulate the Rab5 GDP/GTP cycle. Membrane ruffling caused by guanine nucleotide exchange on Rho GTPases has recently been shown as the target of a factor produced by Salmonella typhimurium (16Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (664) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of IFN-γ on guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab5a, we used a guanine nucleotide release assay employed by Hardt et al.(16Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (664) Google Scholar). GST-Rab5a was preloaded with [3H]GDP by incubating the protein and [3H]GDP in the presence of low levels of Mg2+. Pre-loaded Rab5a was then incubated with cytosol from control cells and from cells pretreated with IFN-γ (18 h, 150 units/ml). Increased levels of Mg2+ and GTP were added, and the release of [3H]GDP was monitored. Analysis of the GDP/GTP exchange rate showed that the cytosol obtained from HMφs treated with IFN-γ specifically increased the intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange rate of GST-Rab5a (Fig. 3 C) by a factor of 3 compared with the rate observed in the presence of control cytosol. It is not clear from our studies how IFN-γ enhances nucleotide exchange on Rab5. Rabex-5 has been shown to possess Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange activity. This protein may account for the enhanced activity observed in IFN-γ-treated cytosol (21Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In summary, IFN-γ induces Rab5a and at least two activities that are coupled to Rab5a function, Rab5a prenylation activity and Rab5a guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Enhanced prenylation activity is clearly not Rab5a-selective although Rab5a is a superior substrate for prenylation following IFN-γ treatment. Prenyltransferases and molecules that interact exclusively with Rab5 (e.g. GEF or GAP) may be responsible for the selective retention of Rab5a in the membrane fraction. We speculate that enhanced Rab5a levels and function accelerates the rate of phagosome maturation and intracellular killing that accompanies IFN-γ treatment. The selective effect of IFN-γ on Rab5a suggests that each Rab5 isoform regulates a different function along the phagocytic-endocytic pathway. Subdomains of the endocytic-phagocytic pathway were first suggested by the discovery and localization of different Rab GTPases. Our study suggests that this concept can now be extended to a newer level of refinement. Moreover, the results presented in this study constitute the first report that small GTPase action can be modulated by lymphokine signaling. The technical support of A. Zheleznyak, C. Adles, A. Monniae, and E. Peters is enormously appreciated. C.A-D. thanks E. Carrasco-Marin for ongoing suggestions. R. D. Schreiber, G. Li, and A. M. Barbieri are acknowledged for critical advice, and M.

Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) is a key enzyme in DNA synthesis because it catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, a reaction assisted by a protein-bound or a 5′-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin-derived free radical. Primarily based on the nature of this radical, the ribonucleotide reductases are divided into three classes where most of the eukaryotic and some of the prokaryotic ones belong to class I. The enzymes in this class are heterodimers formed from two large (R1) and two small (R2) polypeptides. The R1 protein binds substrates and allosteric effectors, whereas the R2 protein contains a tyrosyl radical essential for enzyme activity. The radical can be scavenged by the one-electron reductant hydroxyurea, a drug that has been in clinical use against leukemias (3Nocentini G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1996; 22: 89-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Except those from the Herpesviridae family (4Averett D.R. Lubbers C. Elion G.B. Spector T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9831-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all ribonucleotide reductases studied are allosterically regulated. The nonviral class I enzymes have two types of allosteric effector binding sites called the activity site (lacking in certain bacterial ribonucleotide reductases specifically called class Ib) and the specificity site (2Reichard P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The activity site determines the overall activity of the enzyme by binding either ATP (positive effector) or dATP (negative effector), whereas the specificity site determines which will be reduced of the four substrates. With dATP (at such a low concentration that it does not bind to the activity site) (5Eriksson S. Gudas L.J. Clift S.M. Caras I.W. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10193-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or ATP bound to the specificity sites, CDP and UDP are reduced, whereas dTTP and dGTP gives GDP and ADP reduction, respectively. X-ray diffraction of R1 protein crystals containing substrates and effectors (7Eriksson M. Uhlin U. S R. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.M. Eklund H. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) has revealed that the effectors control specificity by mediating small conformational changes of the protein rather than being in direct contact with the substrate. Binding of effectors also greatly stimulate R1/R2 protein interaction, explaining the low activity observed in the absence of effectors (8Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although ribonucleotide reductase has a central role in keeping the deoxyribonucleotide levels balanced inside the cell, it is not the only system. Because CDP and UDP require the same effectors for their reduction, ribonucleotide reductase cannot balance the level of dCTPversus dTTP. In mammalian cells only a small fraction of the dTTP in a cell comes from UDP reduction as explained by the lowV max/K m of ribonucleotide reductase for UDP compared with the other substrates (9Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Instead, the majority of the dTTP formed has gone through dCMP deamination. The enzyme that performs this job, dCMP deaminase, is activated by dCTP and inhibited by dTTP (10Mathews C.K. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. The Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Redwood City, CA1990: 763Google Scholar). A third level of regulation can also be found in the equilibrium with the extracellular medium between uptake and excretion of deoxyribonucleosides. Deoxyribonucleoside kinases and 5′-nucleotidases (11Arner E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), the former ones often allosterically regulated, directs the primary control of these processes. It is not known whetherT. brucei contains a dCMP deaminase, and the only information available about its deoxyribonucleoside kinases is a thymidine kinase that has been partially purified and characterized (12Chello P.L. Jaffe J.J. J. Parasitol. 1972; 58: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similar to the mammalian thymidine kinase, the one from T. brucei is inhibited by dTTP. Recently, an expressed sequence tag from T. brucei identified as a thymidine kinase was released in the GenBank data base (accession number AA098695). We have earlier cloned, expressed, and characterized the ribonucleotide reductase from T. brucei (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and studied its CDP reduction. A major difference compared with the mammalian ribonucleotide reductase was that dATP did not inhibit CDP reduction. Now, we have made a thorough investigation of how the allosteric effectors influence theK m and V max for all the four ribonucleoside diphosphate substrates, a study that confirmed that dATP does not inhibit enzyme activity but instead is the primary positive effector for CDP and UDP reduction. The experiments made on the enzyme level were complemented with studies on the NTP and dNTP pools in trypanosomes grown in culture. We found that the deoxyribonucleotide metabolism of T. brucei in many aspects is unique, not only in the allosteric regulation of ribonucleotide reductase but also in the properties of the deoxyribonucleoside kinases. The finding of an uncontrolled salvage of deoxyadenosine should be helpful for the development of nucleoside analogue therapies against sleeping sickness. Another unexpected finding from our studies of the NDP, NTP, and dNTP pools in T. brucei was that the CDP and CTP levels were extremely low, a situation that is not reflected on the dCTP pool. How the T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase copes with the low CDP substrate pool will be discussed. The bloodstream form of T. brucei (strain 221) (kindly supplied by Fred Opperdoes, ICP, Trop 7439, avenue Hippocrate 74, B-1200, Brussels, Belgium) was maintained at 37 °C and 7.2% CO2 in Hirumi's modified Iscoves Medium (HMI)-9 medium (14Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) lacking thymidine and Serum Plus but containing 10% fetal calf serum. The omission of thymidine did not affect the growth of the parasites. Trypanosomes (200 ml), harvested in late logarithmic phase, were chilled on ice for 5 min before being collected at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and collected at 20,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The NTP, NDP, and dNTP pools were not affected by the time on ice (varied between 5 and 15 min), the centrifugation time (varied between 5 and 15 min), the centrifugation speed (varied between 2,000 and 20,000 × g) or how many washings in culture medium that were made (varied between 1 and 3 times). After the medium wash, the collected trypanosomes were disintegrated by pipetting them up and down in 500 μl of ice-cold 0.6m trichloroacetic acid containing 15 mmMgCl2. One nmol of unlabeled dITP was added at this step to monitor the losses during the preparation. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was extracted twice with 1.1× the volume of Freon (78% v/v)-trioctylamine (22% v/v) (15Khym J.X. Clin. Chem. 1975; 21: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). One-tenth of the sample was evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac (Savant) and dissolved in 100 μl of water. This fraction was used for quantification of ribonucleoside triphosphates by a 4.6 × 125-mm Partisphere SAX-5 HPLC column (Whatman) and run isocratically in 0.5 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.4, and 2.5% (v/v) acetonitrile at 1.5 ml/min. The nucleotides were quantified by measuring the peak heights and comparing them to a standard curve. The remaining 90% of the sample was pH-adjusted with 25 μl of 1m NaHCO3, pH 8.9, and the deoxyribonucleotides were separated from the ribonucleotides by boronate affinity chromatography (Affi-Gel-601, Bio-Rad) as described by Shewach (16Shewach D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The flow-through (2 ml), containing deoxyribonucleotides, was adjusted to pH 3.4 by approximately 20 μl of 3 m HCl, vortexed for 30 s to get rid of the evolving CO2, and finally separated by HPLC (the same conditions as described for the nucleoside triphosphates). The acidified sample (maximally 1 ml could be loaded to the column without changing the performance of the peaks) was always added to the column without delay to avoid potential depurination. We confirmed with nucleotide standards that there were no losses if the sample was kept on ice and not stored for more than 1 h. CTP and dCTP have the same retention time during the HPLC chromatography and in contrast to other organisms studied, they are also in comparable levels. Therefore, the CTP level was obtained by subtracting the amount of dCTP from the first determined CTP peak. NDPs were quantified using five times more sample than for the NTPs and a gradient chromatography procedure of buffer A (10 mmammonium phosphate, pH 3.4, 3.75% (v/v) methanol) and buffer B (0.55m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.4, 3.75% (v/v) methanol). An isocratic run of buffer A for 5 min was followed by a 40-min linear gradient to 100% buffer B and finally, a 20 min isocratic run of buffer B. The column was allowed to equilibrate with buffer A for 20 min between each run. NTPs could also be resolved in the gradient, whereas unknown peaks in the trypanosome extract impeded the quantification of NMPs. The NDP peaks were identified from theirA 280/A 260 and from the retention times of standard nucleotides mixed with trypanosome extracts. Although the R2 protein was expressed and purified as described earlier (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a previously unnoticed protein impurity forced us to modify the original R1 protein purification protocol. The recombinant R1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, the bacteria was disintegrated, and the protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate as described previously (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in a volume of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3 (this concentration and pH was used throughout the protocol), sufficient to give a conductivity of 80 millisiemens/cm or lower (typically 100 ml, if starting from bacteria grown in 6 liter of Terrific Broth). The protein solution was applied to a dATP-Sepharose column (4 ml) that subsequently was washed with 20 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 20 ml of 0.5 mm ADP + Hepes, 20 ml of Hepes, 20 ml of 0.2m KCl + Hepes, 20 ml of Hepes, and 20 ml of 1 mm ATP + Hepes. An elution rate of 0.5 ml/min was used throughout all steps. Finally, the R1 protein was eluted with 10 mm ATP + Hepes using the same pump speed as the washing steps. The first two-thirds of the eluate was precipitated with ammonium sulfate as described earlier (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and equilibrated on a Sephadex G-50 column with 10% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The inclusion of 10% glycerol increased the stability of the protein during freezing and thawing. However, because it was not completely stable, the solution was aliquoted and never frozen and thawed more than once. [8-3H]dGTP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, diluted in unlabeled dGTP to a specific activity of 230 cpm/pmol, and stored as a neutral solution at −20 °C. Protein R1 (10 μg) was incubated for 5 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 6.4 μmMgCl2, 4.5 μm tritiated dGTP, and varying amounts of competing cold nucleotides. In those cases where the total nucleotide level exceeded 3 mm, the MgCl2concentration was increased to constitute twice the level of nucleotides. The amount of bound and free nucleotide was determined by scintillation counting of aliquots of the solution before and after centrifugation through a membrane (17Ormö M. Sjöberg B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Enzyme, substrates, and effectors were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a buffer described earlier (18Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The concentrations of effectors used were 1.6 mm ATP, 1.6 mm ATP + 500 μm dTTP, 1.6 mm ATP + 500 μmdGTP, or 100 μm dATP. The amount of R2 was always 1.5 μg, whereas the R1 concentration was chosen so that not more than 10% of the substrate was converted during the assay and so that the R2 protein was in at least 5 times molar excess over the R1 protein. The substrates used were [5-3H]CDP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), [2-14C]UDP (kindly supplied by Peter Reichard, Karolinska Institute, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden), [8-14C]GDP (Moravek Biochemicals), and [8-14C]ADP (NEN Life Science Products). They were diluted with unlabeled nucleotides from Sigma into specific activities of 37,000, 3,320, 3,570, and 1,400 cpm/nmol, respectively. All substrates except CDP were purified by DEAE-Sephadex as described (19Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent to the enzymatic reaction, the assay mixture was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged, and the protein pellet was discarded. A 1 msolution of NH4HCO3, pH 8.9, was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the products were separated from the substrates by boronate affinity chromatography as described for the dNTP pool determination. One ml of the flow-through (totally 2 ml) was mixed with 50 μl of 3m HCl and 10 ml of Instagel Plus (Packard) before counting. The cpm of a blank containing all assay ingredients except enzyme was subtracted from all values. With CDP as the substrate, we originally used an alternative protocol (18Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) involving Dowex-50 chromatography to separate products from substrates. However, the low sensitivity of this method combined with the low K m for CDP with ATP and dATP as effectors made us choose the boronate affinity chromatography when these effectors were used. The results from all assays were plotted as enzyme activity versus substrate concentration (taken on both sides of the K m value), andV max and K m were determined by fitting the curves to a hyperbola by the PRISM version 2.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Hydroxyurea (Sigma) was dissolved in water and stored as a 0.5 m solution at −20°. Tetrahydrouridine (Calbiochem) was dissolved in water, flushed with argon gas, sealed under airtight conditions, and stored as a 20 mm solution at −20 °C. When used in combination with deoxycytidine, cytidine, or cytosine, the trypanosomes were preincubated for 30 min with 40 μm tetrahydrouridine before the addition of nucleoside/base. Coformycin (Calbiochem) was stored as a 3 mm aqueous solution at −20 °C. Initially we followed an extraction protocol proposed by Khym (15Khym J.X. Clin. Chem. 1975; 21: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and optimized by Van Haverbeke and Brown (20Van Haverbeke D.A. Brown P.R. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1978; 1: 507-525Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In that scheme, the cells are disintegrated by ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, the debris was discarded, and the nucleotide containing solution was extracted with a Freon-trioctylamine mix to remove the acid. Like Van Haverbeke and Brown, we observed significant losses of nucleotides during the Freon-trioctylamine step (up to 40% of the dITP, which we used as an internal control in the trypanosome extract). However, inclusion of 15 mm MgCl2 in the trichloroacetic acid reduced these losses effectively (99% recovery of dITP). Similar improvements were obtained if standard nucleotide solutions in 10% trichloroacetic acid were used instead of trypanosome extracts. We also observed that without MgCl2, the losses affected dITP and dGTP much more than dATP, dTTP, and dCTP. Extracted nucleotides were separated directly by HPLC for quantification of NTPs or run through a boronate affinity column before the HPLC step for quantification of dNTPs. The boronate matrix absorbs the ribonucleotides under alkaline conditions, pH 8.9. Because the ribonucleotides, with the exception of CTP, have slightly different retention times than the deoxyribonucleotides when run on HPLC, we could observe that 99.9% of the UTP, ATP, and GTP in the trypanosome extracts were removed during this step. As judged from standard nucleotide solutions, CTP is as efficiently removed during this step as the other NTPs. We decided to relate the dNTP pools to the total nucleoside triphosphate pool (determined to be 2300 ± 530 nmol/109 cells) rather than the amount of cells or DNA content because we found less variation in the results using this parameter. However, we routinely checked the amount of cells to ensure that the conditions of exposure did not alter the total nucleoside triphosphate pool. An average of 19 experiments showed the relative levels of nucleotides to be 1.2 ± 0.4% CTP, 12 ± 2% UTP, 68 ± 1% ATP, 16 ± 2% GTP, 0.41 ± 0.09% dCTP, 0.85 ± 0.2% dTTP, 0.44 ± 0.07% dATP, and 0.15 ± 0.03% dGTP (Fig. 1, A–B). Given that the mean volume of 109 trypanosomes has been reported to be 58 μl (21Byers T.L. Casara P. Bitonti A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we could calculate that the average intracellular concentrations of the nucleotides are 26 μmCTP, 280 μm UTP, 1600 μm ATP, 380 μm GTP, 9.4 μm dCTP, 19 μmdTTP, 10 μm dATP, and 3.5 μm dGTP. We were immediately struck by the extremely low CTP content in the trypanosomes. The relative CTP level was nearly 10 times lower than in the mouse fibroblasts, Balb/3T3, which we used as control (Fig.1 A). On top of that, the CTP level was further reduced to only 30% of its original value when the trypanosomes were grown into stationary phase and harvested 24 h later. Because ribonucleotide reductase uses ribonucleoside diphosphates as substrates, we wanted to measure them as well. Crucial for these experiments is that the much larger NTP pools are not degraded to NDPs. We ensured that no degradation of NTPs occurred during the harvesting of trypanosomes by checking if varying the length and conditions of each individual step had any influence on the NDP and NTP/dNTP pools (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). We also checked with standard NTP/dNTP solutions that no degradation occurs during the trichloroacetic acid treatment and beyond. The result from the NDP quantification is shown in Fig. 1 C. Similar calculations as for the NTP and dNTP pools give average intracellular concentrations of 4 μm CDP, 23 μm UDP, 270 μmADP, and 120 μm GDP. The pyrimidine NDP pools, particularly the CDP pool, are very low, a situation that is not reflected in the pyrimidine dNTP pools, which are not lower than the purine ones (Fig. 1 B). The CDP pool is in fact less than half of the dCTP pool, indicating the high efficiency of ribonucleotide reductase for CDP reduction. We discovered that the purified R1 protein from before (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) gave two closely spaced bands when run on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (14-cm separation gel). The two bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and individually sequenced from the N terminus. The lower band had the N-terminal sequence of the R1 protein, whereas the upper band was identified as ClpB. This is a chaperone protein in E. colithat has a protein-stimulated ATPase activity (22Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that the ATPase activity is inhibited by ADP that most probably binds to the same site as ATP, the affinity chromatography of the R1 protein on dATP-Sepharose was supplemented with a 0.5 mm ADP washing step. This improvement reduced the ClpB content to virtually undetectable levels, leaving a homogenous R1 protein. Subsequently, the R1 protein was kept in a buffer containing 10% glycerol to compensate for the loss of stability toward freezing and thawing that followed the removal of ClpB. Previously (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we have shown that the R1 protein has two different binding sites for dATP. We could repeat this result with the pure R1 protein as well (data not shown). We also wanted to investigate the binding of ATP and dCTP to the specificity sites because it was not made in our earlier work (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ATP, dCTP, and dATP (as a comparison) were allowed to compete with tritiated dGTP for binding to the R1 protein. As seen in Fig. 2 A, the binding of ATP and dCTP is very low, with ATP needed in 5,000 times and dCTP in 10 times higher concentration than dATP to have a corresponding effect on dGTP binding. In our previous paper (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we concluded that the specificity and activity nucleotide effector sites together determine the substrate affinity of the T. bruceiribonucleotide reductase. Because the activity site can be in 3 different states (empty, dATP-bound, or ATP-bound) and the specificity site in 6 states (empty or binding ATP, dATP, dGTP, dTTP, or dCTP), 18 different combinations of effectors can be imagined. We have simplified this complex situation by selecting those combinations we considered physiologically most important, namely 1.6 mm ATP (the physiological concentration), 1.6 mm ATP + 0.5 mm dGTP, 1.6 mm ATP + 0.5 mm dTTP, and 0.1 mm dATP. At these concentrations ATP saturates the activity sites, dGTP and dTTP saturates the specificity sites, and dATP saturates both sites as judged from our previous nucleotide binding results (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The rational behind making the dGTP and dTTP experiments in the presence of ATP was that we wanted to have the activity sites at physiological status while we determined the function of the specificity sites. We tested dATP alone because it can bind both types of allosteric sites and therefore would give a situation hard to interpret if combined with ATP. Previously (13Hofer A. Schmidt P.P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we determined the allosteric regulation of CDP reduction using a constant substrate concentration of 0.5 mm. At this high concentration, the amount of substrate is close to saturating levels, and therefore, our experiments predominantly showed how the effectors controlV max. Because the allosteric effectors may influence K m as well, we found it necessary to expand these results using varied substrate concentrations. In Fig.2 B, we have plotted the enzyme activity versussubstrate concentration. At high substrate levels, the regulation is, as expected, very similar to what we described previously with dTTP as the optimal effector. However, at low substrate concentration dATP and ATP are considerably better effectors than dTTP. The data used for Fig.2 B were fitted to a hyperbola by nonlinear regression andK m, and V max was calculated. These results as well as the corresponding ones from UDP, GDP, and ADP reduction are presented in Table I. As seen in this table, the K m for CDP with dATP or ATP as effector is more than a magnitude less than with dTTP. The values from Table I were used to construct Fig. 2 C, where we have plotted how the catalytic efficiency,K cat/K m, is influenced by the effectors. We can conclude that CDP reduction is directed by dATP (and to some extent ATP), UDP reduction is directed by dATP, GDP reduction is directed by dTTP, and ADP reduction is directed by dGTP.Table IEffects of the different nucleotide effectors on the Km and Vmax of the T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase for its four substratesSubstrateEffectoraThe concentrations of the effectors were 1.6 mm ATP, 100 μm dATP, 500 μmdTTP + 1.6 mm ATP, and 500 μm dGTP + 1.6 mm ATP.K mV maxbnmol of substrate converted/min and mg of R1 protein.μmCDPATP3.2 ± 0.5511 ± 0.33dATP4.0 ± 0.5826 ± 1.0dGTP/ATP91 ± 9.414 ± 0.5dTTP/ATP140 ± 966 ± 2.0UDPATP72 ± 1518 ± 1.4dATP9.6 ± 1.425 ± 0.9dGTP/ATP91 ± 350.76 ± 0.09dTTP/ATP62 ± 115.8 ± 0.5GDPATP500 ± 8418 ± 1.4dATP410 ± 1013 ± 0.15dGTP/ATP840 ± 674.6 ± 0.23dTTP/ATP10 ± 1.732 ± 0.9ADPATP480 ± 9720 ± 1.7dATP860 ± 27045 ± 7.8dGTP/ATP33 ± 5.550 ± 3.3dTTP/ATP260 ± 3252 ± 2.5a The concentrations of the effectors were 1.6 mm ATP, 100 μm dATP, 500 μmdTTP + 1.6 mm ATP, and 500 μm dGTP + 1.6 mm ATP.b nmol of substrate converted/min and mg of R1 protein.

https://openalex.org/W2068732219,"A family of antiapoptotic regulators known as inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) was initially identified and functionally described in baculoviruses, and IAP homologues are now known in insects, birds, and mammals. Baculovirus andDrosophila IAPs inhibit apoptosis induced byDrosophila proapoptotic proteins Reaper, HID, and GRIM and physically interact with them through their baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) region. Here we examined the functional importance of BIR and RING finger motifs of Orgyia pseudotsugata nuclear polyhedrosis virus Op-IAP and D-IAP1 in binding to and inhibiting HID. In the absence of both the BIR1 and RING motifs, the BIR2 regions of Op-IAP and D-IAP1 were able to associate with HID and block HID-induced apoptosis. Mutation of conserved amino acid residues within the BIR and RING finger motifs revealed that the conserved residues within BIR2 were essential for Op-IAP to inhibit apoptosis. However, most of the conserved residues of the BIR2 were not required for HID binding. A region at the carboxy-proximal end of BIR2 was essential for the association of Op-IAP with HID. Thus binding to HID is necessary but not sufficient to block HID-induced apoptosis: the conserved residues within BIR2 must have an additional role in blocking apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that the region encompassing a single BIR of Op-IAP and D-IAP1 can be sufficient for physical interaction with and inhibition of apoptosis induced by HID. A family of antiapoptotic regulators known as inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) was initially identified and functionally described in baculoviruses, and IAP homologues are now known in insects, birds, and mammals. Baculovirus andDrosophila IAPs inhibit apoptosis induced byDrosophila proapoptotic proteins Reaper, HID, and GRIM and physically interact with them through their baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) region. Here we examined the functional importance of BIR and RING finger motifs of Orgyia pseudotsugata nuclear polyhedrosis virus Op-IAP and D-IAP1 in binding to and inhibiting HID. In the absence of both the BIR1 and RING motifs, the BIR2 regions of Op-IAP and D-IAP1 were able to associate with HID and block HID-induced apoptosis. Mutation of conserved amino acid residues within the BIR and RING finger motifs revealed that the conserved residues within BIR2 were essential for Op-IAP to inhibit apoptosis. However, most of the conserved residues of the BIR2 were not required for HID binding. A region at the carboxy-proximal end of BIR2 was essential for the association of Op-IAP with HID. Thus binding to HID is necessary but not sufficient to block HID-induced apoptosis: the conserved residues within BIR2 must have an additional role in blocking apoptosis.

Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). Programmed cell death is also employed by host cells as a defense strategy against viral invasion (2Shen Y. Shenk T.E.

The second class of baculovirus apoptotic inhibitors, IAPs1 (inhibitors of apoptosis), were first isolated from two other baculoviruses, CpGV and OpNPV, by their ability to block apoptosis induced duringp35-mutant A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus infection (11Crook N.E.

Although p35 blocks active Sf-caspase-1, an execution-style caspase that is activated by A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus infection, Op-IAP blocks the processing of the pro-form of Sf-caspase-1 to its active form (21Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13606-13611Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Members of the IAP family are characterized by the presence of at least one and usually two or three tandem baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) motifs located at the amino-terminal and central portions of the protein, and most of them have a carboxyl-terminal RING finger motif. Homologues of the IAP family have also been found in animal genomes, and many appear to have antiapoptotic activity. Neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, one of the human IAPs, is linked to the progression of spinal muscular atrophy, which involves neuronal cell death (22Roy N. Mahadevan M.S. McLean M. Shutler G.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), but they also physically interact with RPR, HID, and GRIM and alter their subcellular localization to punctate perinuclear locations, which coincide with IAP localization in Sf-21 cells (14Vucic D.

RPR, HID, and GRIM share only a limited amount of sequence similarity: a stretch of 14 amino acids at the amino terminus of each protein. The amino-terminal 37 residues of HID are necessary and sufficient for the induction of apoptosis and for its binding to IAPs (15Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The region of Op-IAP containing two tandem BIR motifs, known as BIR1 and BIR2, is necessary and sufficient for binding to RPR, HID, and GRIM (15Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 35Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of D-IAP1, the BIR-containing region is not only sufficient for binding but also sufficient for blocking apoptosis (15Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar); the RING finger motif of this IAP appears to act as a negative regulator of its activity (17Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the BIR regions and the RING finger regions of the baculovirus IAPs were found to be important for their anti-apoptotic activity in the context of baculovirus infections (13Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and to block apoptosis induced by actinomycin D or Doom (36Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), another apoptotic inducer of Drosophila (16Harvey A.J. Bidwai A.P. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expression of only the BIR region of Op-IAP and Cp-IAP induces apoptosis in Sf-21 cells, although induction occurs relatively slowly (36Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the contribution of the BIR and RING finger motifs of Op-IAP to its ability to block HID-induced apoptosis. We also examined the importance of individual amino acid residues within these motifs that are conserved among IAP family members. We demonstrate that, under optimal conditions, the BIR2 of Op-IAP alone is able to block HID-induced apoptosis and associate with HID. We show that conserved residues within BIR2 are essential for anti-apoptotic activity but not inducer binding. Instead, a stretch of 17 amino acids on the carboxy-proximal end of BIR2 was found to be an essential region for both anti-apoptotic activity and physical interaction with HID. We also show that the region encompassing the second BIR of D-IAP1 is sufficient for inhibiting HID-induced apoptosis and binding HID. Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: noctuidae) IPLB-Sf-21 (Sf-21) cells were maintained in TC-100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY) and 0.26% tryptose broth as described previously (37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). All the plasmids are derived from pHSP70PLVI+CAT, a plasmid expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene underDrosophila hsp70 promoter (13Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing nontagged p35 or cat, Flag-tagged hid, and HA.11 HA-epitope (epi)-tagged Op-iap, Op-BIR, Op-RING, D-iap1, D-iap1-BIR, and D-iap1-RING were previously described (13Clem R.J.

A plasmid expressing epi-tagged Op-IAP-BIR1 was constructed by introducing a frameshift mutation at the NotI site of Op-iap, which is located between the two BIRs. This frameshift mutant codes for 20 amino acids of nonsense before the stop codon. A plasmid expressing epi-Op-IAP-BIR2, pHSEpi-Op-IAP-BIR2VI+, was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification with Pfu polymerase using the primers OpIAPBIR2 (CGCGGATCCCCCGGGCCCCGCCGGCGCGGTCGGCC) and T3 with pHSOpBIRNruI (16Harvey A.J. Bidwai A.P. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as a template. epi-OpBIR2-RING was constructed by replacing the NotI fragment of pHSEpi-Op-IAP-BIR2VI+ with the NotI fragment from pHSEpiOpIAPVI+. pHSP70PLVI+EpiD-IAP1 and pHSP70PLVI+EpiD-IAP1-BIR were digested with EcoRV and PstI, and the smallest fragments were subcloned into the PspAI andPstI sites of pHSEpiOpIAPVI+ to generate pHSP70PLVI+EpiD-IAP1-BIR2-RING and pHSP70PLVI+EpiD-IAP1-BIR2, expressing the D-IAP1 BIR2 region with or without the RING finger, respectively. The sequence encompassing the BIR1 of D-IAP1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with Pfu polymerase and the primers FLNDIAP1 (CACTCGAGACCCGGGATTTAAACCGCGAG) and CD1B1 (GCTCTAGATTAGGCGTATTCGGGATACTG). The resulting product was digested with PspAI and XbaI and subcloned intoPspAI and PshAI sites of pHSEpiOpBIRVI+ to generate pHSP70PLVI+EpiD-IAP1-BIR1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pHSEpiOpIAPVI+ with the CLONTECHTransformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using selection primer KPNRPRNHE (CAGCAGAGTCGCTAGCGATGTAAA CGATGG) and the following mutagenic primers: OPIAPR21A (CAAAGCCGCGGCCCTAGGCACGTACAC), OPIAPG42A (CCGCATGGCCGCTAGCGCGTTCTACTAC), OPIAPC54A (CGAGGTGCGCGCCGCGTTTTGC), OPIAPW64A (GATTACGAATGCCGTACGGGGCGACGAC), OPIAPR114A (GGAAGCCGCGGCTTTGCGCACC), OPIAPC148A (GCGACAAGACCCGGGCCTTTTGCTGC), OPIAPH168A (GACGACGCGCCATGGCAGCAAGCCGCCCGCTG), OPIAPK182A (GCTGCTCGTCGCCGGCCGCGAC) to generate single and double mutations in the first and second BIRs of EpiOpIAP; OPIAPΔ106–109 (GGTCGGCGGCCTGCGCACACGGAAGCCG), OPIAPΔ132–142 (CAGCGGCCCGAAGAGCAGGGCGACAAGACGCG), OPIAPΔ143–155 (CGGATTCTTTTACACGTGCAAGGATTGGGAACCC), OPIAPΔ157–173 (GACGGCGGTCTGAAGCGCTGCGAGTACGTGC), OPIAPΔ174–190 (GCCCGCTGGTACGACGTCATGACTGAGGCGTGTG), and OPIAPBIR1RING (GCCACACGACCGCGCCCGCGACGCGGACAACG) to generate deletions within Op-iap; OPIAPC221A (GATGACCGGCTGGCCAAGATTTGCC), OPIAPH238 (GCCCTGCGGCGCCGTGGTGTGGCG), OPIAPR256A (CCCCGTTTGCGCCGGCCAGTTAG), OPIAPY266A (GGTGCGCATGGCCCAAGCGTAAC) to generate mutations in the RING of Op-iap. epi-Op-IAP-(Δ154–199) was constructed by the removal of the PshAI and NruI fragment in pHSEpiOpIAPVI+. All mutations and truncations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sf-21 cells plated at a density of 0.5 × 106/per 35-mm dish were transfected with recombinant plasmids. At 18 h posttransfection, cells were heat-shocked, and 8 h after heat shock, the medium was aspirated off each plate and replaced with 500-ul of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.2) containing 0.04% trypan blue. Viable intact cells were counted from four different fields of view at 400× magnification. The percent of nonviable cells was calculated as the difference between the number of viable cells in the cat-only transfected control (100%) and the number of viable cells in the test transfected cells. The data plotted represent three experiments ±S.D. All were performed as described recently (15Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 35Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The PileUp program of the Genetics Computer Group software aligned the BIR and RING finger domains with a gap penalty of 3.0 and a gap extension penalty of 0.10. The shading of similar and identical residues was performed with the Boxshade program. GenBank/EMBL accession numbers for the sequences used were L22564 for Op-IAP, L05494 for Cp-IAP, L22858 for A. californica IAP, L49440 for D-IAP1, L49441 for D-IAP2, AF008592for Ch-IAP1, U32974 for human X-IAP, U45878 for C-IAP1, U45879 for C-IAP2, and U19251 for neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein. To determine the minimal region of Op-IAP sufficient for inhibiting HID-induced apoptosis, we constructed a series of truncations within Op-IAP (Fig.1 A) and tested whether these truncations retained the ability to block HID-induced apoptosis. An HA.11 epitope-tagged version of Op-IAP, epi-Op-IAP, protected cells from apoptosis induced by HID as well as nontagged Op-IAP (data not shown) and was used as a template for generating truncations and other mutations of Op-IAP. Sf-21 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing HID in a 1:1 ratio with plasmids expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase,epi-Op-IAP, or one of the epi-Op-IAP truncations. Gene expression was induced by heat shocking at 18 h posttransfection, and at 8 h after heat shock, viable cells were counted using the trypan blue exclusion method.epi-Op-IAP-BIR1, epi-Op-IAP-BIR1-RING, andepi-Op-IAP-RING did not protect cells from HID-induced apoptosis, but epi-Op-BIR2 and epi-Op-IAP-BIRs reduced HID-induced cell death by 17% (Fig. 1 B).epi-Op-BIR2-RING showed the strongest inhibitory activity of all tested Op-IAP truncations and reduced HID-induced apoptosis by more than 2-fold (Fig. 1 B). To better differentiate the anti-apoptotic abilities of the Op-IAP truncations, the ratio of transfected HID-expressing plasmid to IAP- or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-expressing plasmids was changed from 1:1 to 1:4. The protective ability of epi-Op-IAP-BIRs andepi-Op-IAP-BIR2 became more apparent under these optimized conditions, and epi-Op-IAP-BIR2-RING was almost as efficient in blocking HID-induced apoptosis as epi-Op-IAP (Fig.1 B). Thus, all subsequent viability assays presented in this study were conducted at a 1:4 ratio of inducer to inhibitor. We have reported previously that the region of Op-IAP containing both BIR1 and BIR2 binds HID (15Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To determine which BIR(s) of Op-IAP can physically interact with HID, we coexpressed HID-Flag withepi-Op-IAP truncations, and coimmunoprecipitated, with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody, the IAP truncations that retained the ability to bind HID. We found that all Op-IAP constructs containing BIR2 coimmunoprecipitated with Hid-Flag (Fig. 1 C, top panel). epi-Op-IAP-RING, epi-Op-IAP-BIR1, and epi-Op-IAP-BIR1-RING did not coimmunoprecipitate with Hid-Flag (Fig. 1 C, top panel), although they were efficiently expressed (Fig. 1 C, middle panel). Expression for all HA-tagged and HID-Flag constructs were confirmed in the cell lysates (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, the BIR2 region of Op-IAP is necessary and sufficient for binding HID and inhibiting HID-induced apoptosis. Amino acid sequence alignments of the BIR motifs of baculovirus, vertebrate, and invertebrate IAPs reveal six rigorously conserved residues in BIR motifs (Fig.2 A). To assess the importance of conserved amino acid residues within BIR motifs to the ability of Op-IAP to block HID-induced apoptosis, we generated a series of single- and double-point mutants as well as deletion mutants (see Fig.2 A) by site-specific mutagenesis and tested their protective activity in viability assays. Expression of the mutants was confirmed in Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 C). The four mutations in BIR1 (R21A, G42A, C54A, W64A) reduced the protective potency ofepi-Op-IAP by approximately 2-fold (Fig. 2 D). However, mutations R114A, C148A, or H168A in BIR2 completely abrogated the ability of Op-IAP to block HID-induced apoptosis (Fig.2 D). Constructs that combined mutations in BIR1 and BIR2 (R21R114A, C54C148A) (Fig. 2, A and C) also failed to block HID-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 D). Although the BIRs show significant homology to each other, the carboxy-proximal BIR of all IAPs differ from the more amino-proximal BIRs in that there is a conserved lysine seven amino acids downstream of the last cysteine of the consensus motif (Fig. 2 A). Mutation of that lysine to alanine, K182A, did not affect the anti-apoptotic ability of epi-Op-IAP (Fig. 2 D). One region of conserved homology between the baculovirus andDrosophila IAPs found outside the BIRs is a PXYA motif located only eight amino acids upstream of the BIR2 of Op-IAP (not shown in Fig. 2 A). A mutant with a deletion of these four amino acids in epi-Op-IAP, Δ(106–109), failed to block HID-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 D). Because the BIR2 of Op-IAP was observed to interact with HID, we also constructed an additional series of contiguous deletions spanning the length of the BIR2 (Fig. 2 A). These deletion mutants did not block HID-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 D). All deletions and point mutations within BIR2 other than K182A abrogated the ability ofepi-Op-IAP to block HID-induced apoptosis. Alignments of the RING finger motifs found in IAPs reveal 11 rigorously conserved amino acid residues. Four point mutations were generated within the RING finger of epi-Op-IAP (Fig. 2 B). We mutated the conserved amino acid residues important for the cross-brace structure believed to coordinate two zinc ions, Cys-221 and His-238, to alanine (Fig. 2 B). We also mutated R256 to alanine; this amino acid residue is conserved in RING fingers of all IAPs except X-IAP (Fig. 2 B). Finally, we chose to mutate Y266, a conserved (Tyr or Phe) amino acid found in IAPs with a RING finger, to alanine (Fig. 2 B). The ability of C221A, H238A, and R256A mutants to block HID-induced apoptosis was reduced 2-fold (Fig. 2 D) and was comparable with epi-Op-IAP-BIRs lacking the entire RING finger motif (Fig. 1 B). The Y266A mutation, which changed an amino acid residue with no apparent importance in metal ion coordination, had the most severe effect on the antiapoptotic activity of epi-Op-IAP (Fig.2 D). To determine whether the point mutations or deletions within Op-IAP affect the ability of Op-IAP to physically interact with HID, we coexpressed all deletions and point mutations with HID-Flag and determined if anti-Flag antibodies could coimmunoprecipitate the epi-Op-IAP mutants. All of the point mutations in BIR1 or the RING finger coprecipitated with HID-Flag (Fig.3 and data not shown). Despite their inability to block HID-induced apoptosis, all point mutations in the BIR2 also coprecipitated with HID-Flag (data not shown). We also tested mutants of epi-Op-IAP that possess mutations in both BIRs (R21R114A, C54C148A) (Fig. 2 A) and found that these double mutants of epi-Op-IAP associated with HID-Flag as well (Fig.3). We then tested whether or not epi-Op-IAP with deletions within the BIR2 could coprecipitate with HID. Deletions Δ132–142, Δ143–155, and Δ157–173 retained the ability to physically interact with HID-Flag, but deletion Δ154–198 and the smaller deletion of Δ174–190 did not coimmunoprecipitate with HID-Flag, suggesting that amino acids 174 to 190 represent a region of Op-IAP essential for the physical interaction with HID. To determine the region of D-IAP1 responsible for inhibiting HID-induced apoptosis, we created a series of truncations within epi-D-IAP1 (Fig.4 A) and tested whether these truncations of epi-D-IAP1 were still able to block HID-induced apoptosis. As expected, epi-D-IAP1 andepi-D-IAP1-BIRs inhibited HID apoptosis (Fig.4 B). The constructs expressing the first BIR of D-IAP1 and the spacer region between BIR1 and BIR2 (epi-D-IAP1-BIR1) and the construct expressing the RING finger of D-IAP1 and most of the spacer region between BIR2 and the RING finger (epi-D-IAP1-RING), did not block HID-induced cell death (Fig. 4 B). The constructs expressing BIR2 and the flanking spacer regions of epi-D-IAP1 (epi-D-IAP1-BIR2) or this region with the RING finger attached (epi-D-IAP1-BIR2-RING) were efficient in blocking HID-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 B). We have reported previously that the region encompassing both BIRs of D-IAP1 can bind HID (15Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To further narrow the region of interaction, we coexpressed HID-Flag with HA.11 epitope-tagged versions of the D-IAP1 truncations and coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies the epi-D-IAP1 truncations that retained the ability to bind HID. All epi-D-IAP1 constructs containing BIR2 coimmunoprecipitated with Hid-Flag (Fig. 4 C). D-IAP1-BIR1 and D-IAP1-RING did not coimmunoprecipitate with HID-Flag, although they were efficiently expressed (Fig. 4 C). Expression for all HA-tagged and HID-Flag constructs were confirmed in the cell lysates (Fig. 4 C). Because most of the flanking regions contained within the BIR2 construct are also contained in either BIR1 or the RING finger constructs that do not bind HID, it appears that the BIR2 region of D-IAP1 is responsible for binding HID and inhibiting HID-induced apoptosis. We have investigated the functional importance of individual BIRs and the RING finger motif of baculovirus Op-IAP andDrosophila D-IAP1 in interacting with and inhibiting apoptosis induced by HID. Our findings demonstrate that the region encompassing the second BIR of both Op-IAP and D-IAP1 is sufficient for association with HID and for inhibition of HID-induced apoptosis. Despite its extensive amino acid sequence similarity to BIR2, the BIR1 of Op-IAP and D-IAP1 was dispensable for their interaction with HID and antiapoptotic activity. Similar studies have shown that the BIR2 is the minimal caspase-binding and -inhibiting region of X-IAP (38Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In addition, Survivin, a human IAP family member with a single BIR is capable of suppressing apoptosis in human tissues (23Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar). The purpose for multiple tandem BIRs is not clear, but individual BIRs within each IAP may have different binding specificities and functions. Like its cellular counterparts, our results show that the BIR region of baculovirus Op-IAP is capable of inhibiting apoptosis in the absence of the RING finger motif. Previous studies found that the RING finger was important in blocking baculovirus-induced apoptosis (13Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and, when expressed individually, the BIR regions of baculovirus IAPs were unable to inhibit apoptosis induced by actinomycin D and Doom (36Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that the BIR region of Op-IAP was efficient in blocking HID-induced apoptosis under optimal conditions. Because the BIR region of Op-IAP induces apoptosis by 24 h after induction of expression (36Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we examined its protective ability at earlier times, when HID-induced apoptosis was at its peak (8 h). We also optimized the conditions of viability assays by adjusting the amounts of inducer (HID) to inhibitor (IAPs) to the levels where the protective activity of various Op-IAP truncations were more pronounced. Similar studies indicate that the BIR2 of Op-IAP can also block RPR- and Grim-induced apoptosis when tested under the same conditions (data not shown). However, attempts to rescue p35-mutant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus with the BIR region of Op-IAP were unsuccessful, and Op-IAP-BIRs was also unable to block apoptosis induced by actinomycin D (data not shown). Similarly, D-IAP1-BIRs were unable to or were inefficient at blocking actinomycin D-induced cell death in Sf-21 cells (36Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that these pro-apoptotic signals are too potent for Op-IAP-BIRs or interact with Op-IAP in a different manner than HID, RPR, or Grim. Our mutational analysis examined the importance of conserved amino acid residues within BIR and RING finger motifs for the anti-apoptotic activity of Op-IAP. Mutations of conserved amino acid residues in BIR2 of Op-IAP completely abrogated the ability of Op-IAP to suppress cell death initiated by HID, suggesting that the integrity of the conserved structure of BIR2 is essential for Op-IAP to serve as an inhibitor of apoptosis. Even though BIR1 and the RING finger did not protect Sf-21 cells from HID-induced apoptosis or bind HID in the absence of BIR2, mutations of conserved residues in BIR1 and the RING finger diminished the anti-apoptotic activity of Op-IAP. BIR1 and the RING finger of Op-IAP may enhance the activity of BIR2 by strengthening the association with HID or other factors. Point mutations in the RING finger and BIR1 did not disrupt the ability of Op-IAP to interact with HID. Surprisingly, all point mutations generated in BIR2 retained the ability to associate with HID even though most of these BIR2 mutants completely failed to block HID-induced apoptosis. Therefore, binding to the inducer alone is probably not sufficient for Op-IAP to prevent HID from delivering its apoptotic signal to downstream effectors of the cell death machinery. A series of contiguous deletions in BIR2 revealed that the majority of BIR2 is not required for HID binding but that a region at the carboxy-proximal end of BIR2, amino acids 174–190 of Op-IAP are essential for the association of Op-IAP with HID. These residues may constitute the HID-interaction region or deletion of these 17 amino acids might alter the structure of Op-IAP in such a way as to prevent its association with HID. How the phylogenetically conserved residues of the remainder of the BIR2 contribute to the anti-apoptotic activity of IAPs remains to be determined. We have previously shown that IAPs redirect HID, RPR, and Grim to distinct perinuclear locations (15Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 35Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and it may be that conserved BIR residues participate in this or other steps in silencing inducer signaling.

In order to investigate the transcriptional response of the mouse CgA (mCgA) promoter to gastrin stimulation, we studied a 4.8-kilobase mCgA promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct in transiently transfected AGS-B cells. 5′-Deletion analysis and scanning mutagenesis of mCgA 5′-flanking DNA showed that a Sp1/Egr-1 site spanning −88 to −77 base pairs (bp) and a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) at −71 to −64 bp are essential for gastrin-dependent mCgA transactivation. Gastrin stimulation increased cellular Sp1 protein levels and Sp1-binding to the mCgA −88 to −77 bp element, as well as binding of CREB to its consensus motif at −71 to −64 bp.

In the stomach, enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells) of the corpus mucosa, which are responsible for synthesis, storage, and release of histamine controlling gastric acid secretion, have been identified as the main source for CgA expression (4Cetin Y.

Therefore, to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in gastrin-dependent CgA gene expression, we have analyzed the regulatory elements and transcription factors involved in the control of the CgA promoter by gastrin. We find that gastrin transactivates the mCgA promoter dose and time dependently in AGS-B gastric carcinoma cells and GH3 pituitary cells. Conventional 5′-deletion analysis, in combination with scanning mutagenesis of the mCgA core promoter region, demonstrate that a DNA-stretch spanning mCgA −93 to −62 bp represents the gastrin-responsive region of the mCgA promoter. Furthermore, we show that two elements located in this region are necessary for full gastrin responsiveness: an Sp1/Egr-1 motif located at −88 to −77 bp and a CRE-like element at −71 to −64 bp. Our study demonstrates that the mCgA gene is regulated by gastrin on a transcriptional level through binding of two separate transcription factors to their consensuscis-acting elements.

In order to study the characteristics of potential mCgA regulatory elements in a heterologous promoter system, the region mCgA −93 to −62 bp was subcloned either adjacent or 1.2 kb away from the enhancerless herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) viral promoter into the plasmid pTK-Luc (26Wu H.

Nuclear extracts from AGS-B cells were prepared as described (15Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol.

In brief, double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP and EMSAs were performed with 5 μg of nuclear extracts in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dA-dT), and 10% glycerol. Mixtures were incubated with 10 fmol of double stranded oligonucleotide probes for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25 × TBE at a constant current of 15 mA. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR films at room temperature. Gel shift assays required 10 μmZnSO4 for complete Sp1 binding. For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with a 100-fold excess of double-stranded competitor oligos at room temperature for 10 min before addition of radiolabeled probes. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl of anti-Sp1 or anti-CREB antibodies for 10 min at room temperature, followed by an incubation period of 20 min at 4 °C prior to addition of radiolabeled probes. Preparation of cell lysates and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis was performed as described previously (16Höcker M. Zhang Z. Henihan R. Rosewicz S. Riecken E.O. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J.

In brief, AGS-B cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 30 mmNaCl, 2% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride. 50 μg of the lysates were electrophoresed on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for detection of Sp1 or CREB proteins, respectively. After gel separation, proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) method according to the instructions of the manufacturer using a 1:1000 dilution of antibodies. In AGS-B cells, gastrin stimulated mCgA promoter activity time and dose dependently (Fig. 1), whereas activity of pTK-Luc was not significantly influenced (not shown). Essentially identical kinetics were found for gastrin activation of the mCgA4.8kb-Luc construct in pituitary GH3-B cells (data not shown). Since activation of the mCgA promoter by cAMP-mediated pathways has been established in bovine medullary cells, we investigated the interaction of this signaling route with gastrin- and PMA-activated pathways. In AGS-B cells, dibutyryl-cAMP stimulated mCgA promoter activity 2–3-fold, and co-stimulation with gastrin or PMA and db-cAMP showed additive responses (Fig. 2). 5′-Deletion analysis of mCgA 5′-flanking DNA revealed that 100 bp upstream of the mCgA cap site (+1) are able to confer full responsiveness to gastrin, and that further 5′-deletion to mCgA −77 abrogated gastrin responsiveness (Fig. 3 A). To further characterize the region downstream of mCgA −77 functionally, a dense series of scanning mutants was employed in transient transfection experiments. Analysis of scanning mutants demonstrated that two mCgA promoter regions (mutants M6 and M13) are essential for gastrin-dependent transactivation: a DNA-stretch spanning −88 to −77 bp, comprising putative binding sites for Sp1 and Egr-1, and the region between −71 and −64, bp which represents a consensus CRE element (Fig. 3 B).Figure 2mCgA promoter activity after stimulation of different intracellular signaling pathways. AGS-B cells transiently transfected with the mCgA4.8kb-Luc construct (0.5 μg/well) were incubated with or without 10−8m forskolin (Fors.), 10−5m dibutyryl (db)-cAMP, 10−8m gastrin, 10−8m PMA, or a combination of these compounds. Luciferase activity is expressed as a fold increase relative to unstimulated controls and results represent the mean ± of four separate experiments. All stimulated groups showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with unstimulated controls using Student's ttest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Analysis of mCgA 5′-deletion mutants and “scannining mutagenesis” of the mCgA core promoter in AGS-B cells. A, AGS-B cells were transiently transfected with mCgA 5′-deletion mutants of different length (0.5–1.0 μg/well) and incubated with or without gastrin (10−8m) for 24 h. B, a dense series of scanning mutants of the core promoter region (−100 to −49 bp) was generated by an polymerase chain reaction-based approach (using the construct PxP100-Luc as a template) and transiently transfected into AGS-B cells (0.5–1.0 μg/well). After transfection, gastrin stimulation was performed for 24 h and cell lysates were subsequently analyzed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity is expressed as a fold increase relative to unstimulated controls and represents the mean ± of four separate experiments. Please note: the mutation in mCgA-M14 converts the mCgA-CRE element to a consensus CRE site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether the region mCgA −93 to −62 bp is able to confer gastrin responsiveness to a gastrin-insensitive heterologous promoter system, we employed the pTK-Luc construct. In this construct, expression of the luciferase reporter gene is under control of the enhancerless herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter. When constructs in which the mCgA −93 to −62 bp region was subcloned either adjacent or 1.2 kb away from the TK promoter were transfected into AGS-B cells, gastrin stimulation elicited a 2.5–4.5-fold increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 4). EMSA analysis revealed that in AGS-B cells two nuclear complexes appear to bind to mCgA −93 to −62 bp, the complete element able to confer gastrin responsiveness to a heterologous promoter system. The “A” probe, which represents the complete sequence of this element, is bound by 2 major complexes (Fig.5 B). In experiments using an upstream (“B” probe, mCgA −93 to −73 bp) or downstream probe(“C” probe, mCgA −76 to −62 bp), the transcription factor in complex A was identified as Sp1 (Fig. 5 C), whereas in complex B the probe is bound by CREB (Fig. 5 D). EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts obtained from AGS-B cells after 10 min of gastrin or PMA stimulation revealed that this treatment increased the binding of Sp1 to its upstream binding site (Fig. 5 C). Since CREB-dependent transactivation is generally brought about by phosphorylation of the transcription factor at residue serine 133, we performed EMSA supershift experiments employing an anti-phospho-CREB antibody, which is directed against the serine 133 epitope and exclusively recognizes phosphorylated CREB. We found enhanced binding of phosphorylated CREB in response to gastrin and PMA after 10 min of treatment (Fig. 5 D). A similar picture emerged when supershift experiments were performed with an antibody identifying CREB proteins also in the unphosphorylated state (Fig. 5 D). To investigate whether increased binding of Sp1 and CREB to the CgA promoter is accompanied by elevated cellular levels of both factors, we analyzed basal and gastrin-stimulated CREB and Sp1 abundance in AGS-B cells by Western blot analysis. We found that gastrin dose dependently stimulated Sp1 abundance, having a pronounced effect as early as 5–10 min after stimulation (Fig.6 A). Similar results were obtained when total lysates from gastrin-stimulated AGS-B cells were analyzed for the abundance of phophorylated CREB (Fig. 6 B). Maximal elevation in the abundance of phophorylated CREB was observed after 10 min of gastrin stimulation. To demonstrate that elevation of cellular Sp1 and CREB levels has functional impact on the transcriptional activity of the CgA promoter, we transiently overexpressed Sp1 or phosphorylated CREB by transfection of appropriate expression vectors into AGS-B cells. Phosphorylation of transfected CREB was achieved by co-transfection of pCMV-CREB with an expression construct for the catalytic subunit (C) of protein kinase A. This strategy has been shown to result in effective phosphorylation of recombinant CREB proteins encoded by the CREB expression construct (20Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). When increasing amounts of these constructs were co-transfected with mCgA100-Luc into AGS-B cells, reporter gene activity was dose dependently stimulated (Fig.7 B). Similarily, mCgA reporter gene activity was dose dependently stimulated by transfecting increasing amounts of a full-length human Sp1 expression construct (23Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) together with mCgA4100-Luc (Fig. 7 A). When Sp1 and CREB overexpression was performed in cells transfected with the mCgA −93 to −62 bp TK-Luc construct, coexpression of both factors was more effective than expression of either factor alone, indicating positive cooperative action of Sp1 and CREB in the regulation of the mCgA promoter (Fig. 7 C). After EMSA and Western blot analysis demonstrated that gastrin stimulation of AGS-B cells results in increased abundance of Sp1 and phosphorylated CREB, we next investigated the effect of gastrin on CREB- or Sp1-dependent transactivation in the Gal4/Gal4–5xLuciferase system. The Gal4-CREB transactivator plasmid contains the regulatory sequence of CREB, which comprises the serine 133 residue, critical for its phosphorylation. In the Gal4-CREB/A construct, the serine residue at position 133 is replaced by an arginine which cannot be phosphorylated. The Gal4/Sp1 transactivator plasmid has previously been described (20Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). After co-transfection of Gal4-transactivator and Gal4-reporter plasmids, binding of Gal4-CREB or Gal4-Sp1 fusion proteins encoded by the transactivator plasmids to the Gal4-binding domain of the reporter plasmid depends on the phosphorylation state of subcloned CREB or Sp1 sequences. In the reporter plasmid 5xGal4-Luciferase, expression of the luciferase reporter gene is under control of a multimer (five copies) of the Gal4-binding domain. Stimulation of AGS-B cells transfected with Gal4-CREB or Gal4-Sp1 transactivator constructs together with the reporter construct Gal4/5xGal4-Luc resulted in a 2.5- or 1.6-fold increase in reporter gene activity, respectively (Fig.8). Gastrin had no effect on Gal4-CREB/A-dependent transactivation. These results demonstrate that in AGS-B cells, gastrin stimulates CREB-dependent transactivation through enhanced phosphorylation of CREB. Using the Gal4-Sp1 system, we found that gastrin also had a modest stimulatory effect on Sp1-dependent transactivation, raising the possibility of post-translational modification of Sp1 in response to gastrin. The purpose of this study was to characterize the regulatory effect of gastrin on the mCgA promoter, along with thecis-regulatory elements and transcription factors mediating the actions of gastrin. We found that gastrin transactivates the mCgA promoter dose and time dependently in both AGS-B gastric carcinoma cells and GH3 pituitary cells. Conventional 5′-deletion analysis, in combination with scanning mutagenesis of the mCgA proximal core promoter region, demonstrated that a DNA-stretch spanning −93 to −62 bp represents the gastrin-responsive region of the mCgA promoter, and that two regulatory elemen"

During staurosporine (STS)-induced cell death, β-catenin and PS1-CTF undergo a caspase-mediated cleavage. After 12 h of STS treatment, the β-catenin·PS1-CTF interaction is abrogated. While PS1-CTF immunoprecipitated with all caspase-cleaved species of β-catenin, β-catenin holoprotein did not co-immunoprecipitate with the “alternative” caspase-derived PS1-CTF (PS1-aCTF). Thus, the abrogation of the β-catenin·PS1-CTF complex was due to caspase cleavage of PS1-CTF. β-Catenin co-immunoprecipitated with PS1-NTF, but only when PS1-NTF was associated with PS1-CTF. Even though PS1-NTF·CTF complex stability was not altered by caspase cleavage, its ability to bind β-catenin was abolished. Thus, while the PS1-NTF·CTF complex is preserved after caspase cleavage, it may no longer be fully functional. β-Catenin has previously been shown to interact with presenilin 1 (PS1) in transfected cells.

Another series of studies reported that PS1 and PS2 are highly homologous with Sel-12, a protein that facilitates the Notch pathway inCaenorhabditis elegans (14Levitan D. Greenwald I.

To further elucidate the biological function of presenilins, efforts have been made to identify molecules that interact with presenilins. A recent study has shown that PS1 interacts with ∂-catenin, a homologue of β-catenin. In addition, β-catenin has been shown to bind full-length PS1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells overexpressing PS1 (16Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. NeuroReport. 1997; 8: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that plays a key role in the Wingless pathway and in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion (for review see Ref. 17Barth A.I. Näthke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is able to bind directly to E-cadherins and connects the adherens junctions to the actin cytoskeleton via interaction with α-catenin. The cytoplasmic level of β-catenin is highly regulated. β-Catenin is degraded by the proteasome following phosphorylation. In the steady state, glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylates β-catenin at its N terminus. When the Wingless pathway is activated, glycogen synthase kinase 3β is inhibited, resulting in an increase in the cytoplasmic level of β-catenin and making the protein available for transportation to the nucleus where it can bind the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family of transcription factors. β-Catenin degradation is also activated by various negative regulators of the Wingless pathway. For example, the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product binds and down-regulates β-catenin. Recently it has been shown that during apoptosis, β-catenin undergoes caspase-mediated cleavage (18Brancolini C. Lazarevic D. Rodriguez J. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The execution phase of apoptosis involves the cleavage and activation of a cascade of caspases that are responsible for the cleavage of various “cell death” substrates (for review see Ref. 19Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Caspase cleavage of β-catenin occurs at the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein resulting in the disruption of β-catenin·α-catenin binding. Since α-catenin binds actin, caspase cleavage of β-catenin affects the organization of actin filaments and contributes to dismantling actin anchorage of cells during apoptosis (18Brancolini C. Lazarevic D. Rodriguez J. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, the PS1-CTF and PS2-CTF also undergo caspase-mediated “alternative” cleavage resulting in the production of smaller fragments (PS1-aCTF and PS2-aCTF) (20Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 21Kim T.-W. Tanzi R.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The presence of FAD missense mutations in overexpressed PS2 has recently been shown to lead to increased production of PS2-aCTF (20Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Since a previous report showed that β-catenin could be co-immunoprecipitated with PS1 in transfected cells, one of the aims of this study was to determine whether β-catenin also interacts with endogenous PS1-CTF in native human neuroglioma H4 cells. Moreover, we set out to determine whether, during apoptosis, caspase-mediated cleavage affects the interaction between PS1 and β-catenin and complex formation between PS1-NTF and CTF. We used two different anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibodies identified as anti-β-cateninC-100raised against the last 100 aa of the C terminus of β-catenin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and anti-β-catenin571–781 raised against aa 571–781 of the C terminus of β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories).

For the induction of apoptosis, cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells for each 150-mm Petri dish. After 48 h, the cell layer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the standard medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 1 μm staurosporine (STS) (Calbiochem). A time course experiment was performed: H4 cells were collected at time 0, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 of STS treatment. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. For apoptosis inhibition cells were incubated with 100 μm zVAD-FMK (Enzyme System Products) and 1 μm STS or STS only for 16 h in serum-free DMEM and collected as before. Cells were treated with zVAD for 1 h before STS addition. The characterization of apoptotic process in naive H4 cells in response to STS treatment including various parameters such as cell death measurement by trypan blue exclusion, caspase 3 activation, and PARP cleavage has been shown previously (20Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Cell pellets from each time point following treatment with STS were detergent-extracted on ice using IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, and total proteins were quantitated by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For Western blot analysis, 100 μg of total protein of each sample were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–20% gradient Tris/glycine gels under reducing conditions (Novex). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semi-dry electrotransfer system (Hoefer). The blots were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.15% Tween 20) for 1.5 h, incubated with primary antibodies (anti-β-catenin:horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRPO), 1:1000 in 5% non-fat dry milk TBST; αPS1 Loop, 1:2500 in TBST) for 1 and 1.5 h, respectively and incubated with secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies, 1:5000 (Pierce)) in 5% non-fat dry milk TBST for 1 h. Between steps, the blots were washed with TBST for 30 min. The blots were visualized using the ECL or ECL plus Western blot detection system (Amersham). For immunoprecipitation (IP), 2 mg of total proteins for each sample were used. For quantitative co-IP experiments, increasing amounts of total protein were used (0.375 mg, 0.750 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg). For co-immunoprecipitation of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF cell pellets from time point 0 and 24 of STS treatment were detergent-extracted on ice using IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% digitonin). The samples were precleared either with protein A (15 μl) or goat anti-mouse-IgG magnetic bead-conjugated (45 μl) (Perceptive Diagnostics) overnight in the cold room. For immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG magnetic bead-conjugated were precoated using 2 μg of anti-β-cateninC-100 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), 1.5 μg of anti-β-catenin571–781 (Transduction Laboratories), 4 μg of APS18, 4 μg of APS26 for each sample. After preclearing, the magnetic beads were collected using a magnetic bead collector and then discarded; the precleared lysates were collected and incubated with anti-mouse-IgG magnetic beads-conjugated precoated with the monoclonal antibodies listed above, or with 1 μl of αPS1 Loop or αPS2 Loop polyclonal antibody or Ab14 antibody, and incubated overnight in the cold room. The samples immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies were further incubated with Protein A magnetic beads-conjugated for 2 h in the cold room. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in IP buffer then collected using a magnetic bead collector, heated at 50 °C for 10 min in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using anti-β-catenin HRPO, 1:1000, or αPS1 Loop, 1:2500, αPS2 Loop, 1:2500, or 4627 antibody, 1:2500, Ab14 antibody, 1:2500. In this study, we set out to examine whether endogenous forms of PS1-CTF interact with β-catenin in H4 human neuroglioma cells and whether caspase-mediated cleavage affects this interaction. Detergent lysates prepared from H4 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using two different monoclonal antibodies: anti-β-cateninC-100 and anti-β-catenin571–781 (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and2, respectively). Western blot analysis performed with anti-β-catenin HRPO antibody detected β-catenin in both immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2) and in the straight lysate (lane 3). When the same blot was immunostained with αPS1 Loop antiserum, endogenous PS1-CTF was detected as a doublet of ∼20 kDa and ∼23 kDa, as previously reported in H4 cells (20Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A, lower panel, lanes 1and 2). Thus, both β-catenin antibodies were able to co-IP the PS1-CTF. To confirm the binding between β-catenin and PS1-CTF, we carried out the reverse experiment using two different antibodies raised against different epitopes of the large hydrophilic loop of PS1: a monoclonal antibody, APS 18, and a polyclonal antiserum, αPS1 Loop. PS1-CTF was immunodetected in both immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A, lower panel, lanes 4and 5) and in the straight lysate (lane 6). The presence of β-catenin in PS1 immunoprecipitates was shown by immunostaining the same blot with anti-β-catenin antibody (Fig.1 A, upper panel, lanes 4 and 5).Figure 2Analysis of β-catenin and PS1 cleavage during apoptosis in H4 cells. H4 cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporine. Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer at the time points indicated. Upper panel, Western blot analysis of β-catenin using anti-β-catenin antibody HRPO. Note that after 6 h of treatment, β-catenin full-length (FL) was cleaved into ∼90- and ∼65-kDa fragments (indicated by arrows). The ∼65-kDa fragment becomes the predominant species during later points in the time course.Lower panel, Western blot analysis of the PS1-CTF using αPS1 Loop antibody. Note that the PS1-aCTF can be detected after 8 h and increases in amount during the time course coinciding with the increased appearance of the ∼65-kDa cleavage product of β-catenin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate the specificity of the interaction between β-catenin and PS1-CTF, we performed the same co-IP experiment using several antibodies as negative controls. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with two different antibodies raised against the large hydrophilic loop of PS2, ASP 26 (monoclonal) and αPS2 Loop (polyclonal) and with anti-β-tubulin and anti-low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) antibodies. Although PS2-CTF was successfully immunoprecipitated by both PS2 antibodies as shown in the Western blot with αPS2 Loop antibody (Fig. 1 B, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2), β-catenin was not immunodetected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B,upper panel, lanes 1 and2), but was present in the straight lysate (Fig.1 B, upper panel, lane 3). In negative control experiments, LRP and β-tubulin antibodies did not co-immunoprecipitate with β-catenin (data not shown). To further test the specificity of the binding between β-catenin and PS1-CTF, we performed a quantitative co-IP experiment (Fig. 1 C). As increasing amounts of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin antibody, increasing amounts of β-catenin were detected when immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-β-catenin antibody (Fig. 3, upper panel). Developing the same blot with αPS1 Loop antibody, we were able to show that increasing amounts of PS1-CTF co-immunoprecipitated with correspondingly increasing amounts of β-catenin (Fig. 3 C, lower panel). Taken together, these data demonstrate a specific interaction between endogenous β-catenin and endogenous PS1-CTF in H4 cells. Since it has been previously reported that both β-catenin (18Brancolini C. Lazarevic D. Rodriguez J. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and the presenilins (20Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) are substrates for caspases, we investigated the effects of apoptosis on the processing of β-catenin and PS1 in our cellular model. Apoptosis was induced by treating H4 cells with staurosporine, and time course experiments were performed. When Western blot analysis of cell lysates from different time points was carried out with anti-β-cateninC-100antibody, β-catenin was not detected after 6 h of STS treatment (data not shown). We next reprobed the blot using anti-β-catenin571–781 antibody and detected fragments of different sizes (∼90 kDa, ∼65 kDa, and intermediate species; Fig.2, upper panel, time points 6–24 h). Thus, during the progression of STS-induced cell death, β-catenin holoprotein undergoes sequential cleavage by caspases at multiple sites, resulting in the appearance of an ∼90-kDa species at the 6-h time point, because of the removal of a fragment of ∼2 kDa from the C terminus of β-catenin. The 90-kDa species is then further cleaved into a smaller fragment of ∼65 kDa that becomes the prevalent species in the latest time points (12–24 h), as described previously (26Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 701-706Crossref Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Thus, during apoptosis, β-catenin is sequentially cleaved in H4 cells in the same type of pattern that was described previously for NIH3T3 fibroblasts and Madin-Darbin canine kidney cells. When the same blot was probed with αPS1 Loop antibody, PS1-CTF and PS1-aCTF were immunodetected (Fig. 2, lower panel). PS1-aCTF was only detected after 8 h of STS treatment. During the course of STS-induced cell death, the amount of PS1-aCTF increased (time points 8–24) while PS1-CTF, which serves as a caspase substrate, was decreased in amount. While some of the light extra bands were nonspecific, the slightly higher molecular mass bands have previously been identified as phosphorylated PS1-CTF by protein kinase C (6Seeger M. Nordstedt C. Petanceka S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K. Hahne S. Fraser P. Levesque L. Czernik A.J. St. George-Hyslop P. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Tanzi R.E. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5090-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As expected, staurosporine, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, which was used to induce apoptosis in these cells, decreased and even eliminated these bands during the time course, as it also inhibits protein kinase C. These data show that both β-catenin and PS1-CTF are substrates for caspases and exhibit different temporal patterns of caspase-mediated cleavage. These data also suggest the involvement of different species of caspase, given that the PS1 caspase site does not contain the caspase 3 consensus sequence (DXXD) (in contrast to the caspase cleavage sites of β-catenin). Since both β-catenin and PS1 are cleaved during apoptosis, we next investigated the effects of caspase-mediated cleavage on β-catenin·PS1-CTF binding. For this purpose, we performed co-IP experiments from cell lysates corresponding to each time point of the STS time course experiments, using anti-β-catenin571–781antibody (Fig. 3, A andC), APS18, and αPS1 Loop (Fig. 3, B andD, respectively). When cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin571–781 antibody, PS1-CTF was immunodetected by both αPS1 Loop (Fig. 3 A,lower panel) and by 4627 antibody (Fig.3 C, lower panel) at time points 0, 6, and 8. Neither PS1-CTF nor PS1-aCTF co-immunoprecipitated with β-catenin at time points 12, 16, or 24. Immunodetection of β-catenin in the same blot (Fig. 3, A and C,upper panel) showed that all caspase-cleaved species were immunoprecipitated in the same temporal pattern that we previously observed in Western blot analyses (Fig. 2, upper panel). To further confirm that β-catenin·PS1-CTF binding is abolished after 12 h of STS treatment, we performed complementary co-IP experiments using two different antibodies raised against the large hydrophilic loop of PS1 in the same set of experiments. When PS1-CTF was immunoprecipitated using APS18, all species of β-catenin were immunodetected at time points 0, 6, and 8 but not at 12, 16, and 24 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). Western blot analysis performed using αPS1 Loop detected only PS1-CTF in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). Since APS18 did not immunoprecipitate PS1-aCTF, we used cell lysates from the same time points to immunoprecipitate with αPS1 Loop antibody (Fig.3 D). αPS1 Loop antibody was able to pull down both PS1-CTF and PS1-aCTF as detected by the 4627 antibody (Fig. 3 D,lower panel). Again, β-catenin co-immunoprecipitated with the PS1-CTF, but only at time points 0, 6, and 8 (as observed when the same blot was developed with anti-β-catenin HRPO antibody, Fig. 3 D, upper panel). These data show that the binding between β-catenin and PS1-CTF was not detected in lysates from cells treated with STS for 12 h or longer. This suggests that caspase-mediated cleavage occurs at the binding site of one or both proteins and abrogates the interaction of these proteins. Since β-catenin holoprotein (Fig. 3, A andB, lower panels, time 0) and all β-catenin caspase-cleaved species, including the ∼65-kDa fragment of β-catenin, which became the predominant species in the later time points, were able to co-immunoprecipitate with PS1-CTF (Fig. 3,A and B, lower panels, time 6 and 8) and vice versa (Fig. 3, B andD, upper panels, same time points), it is unlikely that the β-catenin binding site is lost at the later time points. Conversely, no binding was observed at time points 12, 16, and 24, when the amount of PS1-CTF decreased and the amount of PS1-aCTF increased. At the same time points, PS1-CTF was still detectable (Fig.3, B and D, lower panel) but probably may have been insufficiently abundant to immunoprecipitate and detect β-catenin. In addition, PS1-aCTF did not co-immunoprecipitate with any of the β-catenin caspase-cleaved species. If the abrogation of β-catenin·PS1-CTF complex was due to the caspase-mediated cleavage of the β-catenin binding site of PS1-CTF and not to the caspase-mediated cleavage of β-catenin, β-catenin holoprotein, which was not present in the later time points, should have co-immunoprecipitated with PS1-CTF but not with PS1-aCTF. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated β-catenin in a sample containing lysates from both time point 0 and time point 24. Thus, the mixed sample contained β-catenin holoprotein, PS1-CTF (from time point 0 lysate, Fig. 4 A,lane 1), β-catenin caspase-cleaved species, and PS1-aCTF (from time point 24 lysate, Fig. 4 A, lane 2). As expected, β-catenin holoprotein co-immunoprecipitated with PS1-CTF at time point 0 (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) and at time point 24, the prevalent ∼65-kDa β-catenin fragment did not co-immunoprecipitate with either PS1-CTF or PS1-aCTF (Fig.4 A, lane 4). In the mixed sample, β-catenin holoprotein co-immunoprecipitated with PS1-CTF, but not with PS1-aCTF (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). These data show that the abrogation of the β-catenin·PS1 binding after 24 h of STS treatment (Fig.4 A, lane 4) was due to caspase-mediated cleavage of PS1-CTF. Since it has previously been shown that PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF form an oligomeric complex (6Seeger M. Nordstedt C. Petanceka S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K. Hahne S. Fraser P. Levesque L. Czernik A.J.

PS1-NTF was not detected in immunoprecipitates from lysates extracted with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 4 A,middle panel). Therefore, we first determined appropriate detergent conditions for co-immunoprecipitating PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF. For this purpose, we used as a detergent 1%, 0.5%, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1% digitonin, or 0.25% dodecyl-d-maltoside. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using Ab14, and the reverse experiment was performed using APS18 for immunoprecipitation. The optimal detergent conditions for co-immunoprecipitating PS1-NTF with PS1-CTF and PS1-NTF with β-catenin was 1% digitonin (data not shown). H4 cells from time points 0 and 24 of STS treatment were incubated in lysis buffer containing 1% digitonin, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with Ab14 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blot analysis using αPS1 Loop antibody (Fig.4 B, lower panel). PS1-NTF co-immunoprecipitated with PS1-CTF at time 0 (Fig. 4 B,lower panel, lane 1), and PS1-NTF was also able to bind both PS1-CTF and PS1-aCTF at time point 24 (Fig.4 B, lower panel, lane 2). When the same blot was immunostained with anti-β-catenin HRPO antibody, β-catenin was co-immunoprecipitated by Ab14 at time 0, but the binding was lost at time point 24, even though PS1-NTF could be successfully immunoprecipitated in both samples (Fig. 4 B,middle panel, lanes 1 and2). PS1-NTF co-immunoprecipitated with β-catenin only in detergent conditions that allowed PS1-NTF·PS1-CTF binding. In addition, when PS1-CTF was cleaved by caspases, not only was the binding between β-catenin and PS1-CTF abolished, the β-catenin·PS1-NTF binding was also lost. Moreover, binding of β-catenin to PS1-CTF did not require the presence of PS1-NTF. Collectively these data show that β-catenin binds to PS1-NTF but only via its interaction with PS1-CTF. It should also be noted that caspase-mediated cleavage of PS1-CTF did not interfere with the stability of the PS1-NTF·PS1-CTF complex. In fact, PS1-NTF was still able to interact with PS1-aCTF. To test whether the disruption of the β-catenin·PS1 interaction was actually caused by caspase cleavage, we blocked caspase activation using a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (zVAD-FMK) and performed co-IP experiments. Protein extracts from cells treated with STS in the presence or absence of zVAD for 16 h (Fig. 4 C,lanes 1 and 2, respectively) were subjected to Western blot analysis and immunodetected either with anti-β-catenin HRPO antibody (Fig. 4 C, upper panel) or αPS1 Loop. zVAD treatment was able to completely inhibit both β-catenin and PS1 cleavage (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1and 2). The same lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin antibody, and immunoprecipitates were detected with αPS1 Loop. PS1-CTF co-immunoprecipitated with β-catenin in zVAD plus STS-treated cell extract (Fig. 4 C, lower panel, lane 3), but not in the cells treated with STS alone (Fig. 4 C, lower panel,lane 4), although β-catenin species were present in both samples as demonstrated by Western blot analysis using an anti-β-catenin antibody (Fig. 4 C, upper panel). Thus, inhibition of caspase-mediated cleavage of PS1 and β-catenin by zVAD treatment preserves the β-catenin·PS1-CTF interaction. Collectively, these data indicate that β-catenin binds the normal PS1-CTF in H4 cells, while caspase-mediated cleavage abolishes this interaction. The initiation of the cell death program includes the proteolytic activation of caspases which, through autoactivation and activation of other caspases, results in the cleavage of a large set of cell death substrates (19Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Caspase-mediated cleavage events promote the “execution” stage of apoptosis by disrupting several types of interactions. These include DNA·transcription factor-DNA (e.g. SAF-A, Sp1; Refs. 22Gohring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O.

Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) interactions. Since β-catenin has been shown to play a role in the Wingless pathway and in cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion, diverse physiological functions of β-catenin may be mediated by different molecular interactions. It has previously been reported that caspase-mediated cleavage of β-catenin abrogates its interaction with α-catenin, thereby disrupting actin organization in the apoptotic cell (18Brancolini C. Lazarevic D. Rodriguez J. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Alterations in the actin cytoskeleton lead to the loss of cell-cell adhesion and changes in cell shape that are associated with anchorage-related apoptosis or anoikis (26Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 701-706Crossref Scopus (988) Google Scholar). We now show that the β-catenin·PS1 interaction is also abrogated by caspase activation. It is possible that the abrogation of β-catenin·PS1 binding might also contribute to the cytoskeleton alterations that lead to cellular changes that are essential for the execution of apoptosis. Moreover, since it has been shown that during apoptosis there is an increase in the production of PS1-aCTF in cells expressing FAD-linked mutant forms of PS1, 2D. M. Kovacs, R. Mancini, J. Henderson, S. Na, T-W. Kim, and R. E. Tanzi, submitted for publication. it is possible that in Alzheimer's patients with PS1 mutations the β-catenin·PS1-CTF interaction could be adversely affected by the increased production of PS1-aCTF, thereby leading to cellular changes that make neurons more susceptible to programmed cell death. Interestingly, in contrast, caspase cleavage did not abolish the PS1-NTF·CTF complex. However, following caspase cleavage, the PS1-NTF·CTF complex can no longer bind β-catenin. Thus, while the PS1-NTF·CTF complex is preserved after caspase cleavage, it may no longer be fully functional. Future studies will be necessary to explore how caspase-mediated effects on presenilin interactions may contribute to AD pathogenesis. We thank Drs. S. Gandy and M.

Velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients demonstrates that heterologous AQPcic expressed in yeast orXenopus oocytes behaves as an homotetramer when extracted by n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) and as a monomer when extracted by SDS. We performed an analysis of GlpF solubilized from membranes of Escherichia coli or of mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. The GlpF protein extracted either by SDS or by nondenaturing detergents, OG and Triton X-100, exhibits sedimentation coefficients only compatible with a monomeric form of the protein in micelles. We then substituted in loop E of AQPcic two amino acids predicted to play a role in the functional/structural properties of the MIPs. In two expression systems, yeast and oocytes, the mutant AQPcic-S205D is monomeric in OG and in SDS. The A209K mutation does not modify the tetrameric form of the heterologous protein in OG. This study shows that the serine residue at position 205 is essential for AQPcic tetramerization. Because the serine in this position is highly conserved among aquaporins and systematically replaced by an acid aspartic in GlpFs, we postulate that glycerol facilitators are monomers whereas aquaporins are organized in tetramers. Our data suggest that the role of loop E in MIP properties partly occurs through its ability to allow oligomerization of the proteins.

The MIP1 family is a rapidly growing group of currently 150 proteins that have been widely identified from bacteria to man. Functional characterization data have distinguished two major subgroups of specific channels: aquaporins (AQPs), which transfer water, and glycerol facilitators (GlpFs), which transfer small neutral solutes. In the aquaporin subgroup, the eukaryotic AQP0 (1, 2), AQP1 (3Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I.

Scheuring S. Agre P. Engel A. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 33-34Crossref Google Scholar). The role for assembly of AQPs in tetramers is unclear but may be required for stability and function (8van Hoek A.N.

According to the projection map of AQP1 obtained by electron crystallography, the protein in its tetrameric native form possesses six transmembrane domains surrounding a high density zone (12Walz T.

Biol. 1998; 121: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This density area is likely constituted by loops B, C, and E that fold into the membrane through hydrophobic interactions with the transmembrane helical domains according to the “hourglass model” proposed for AQP1 (14Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the domains involved in aquaporin tetramerization have not yet been identified. It has been shown that some mutations introduced in aquaporin loops affect water channel function (14Jung J.S.

(14Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that following expression in Xenopus oocytes, mutants in loop E sedimented with s values slightly higher than native AQP1 suggesting an importance of this loop in oligomerization and water channel function. The second subgroup of proteins in the MIP family is constituted by the glycerol facilitators (20Muramatsu S. Mizumo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4378-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the structural feature of one aquaporin is known (12Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heyman J.B. Mitsouka K. Fujiyosi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 13Heymann J. Agre P. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), no data are yet available about the three-dimensional structure and oligomerization state of GlpFs. However, based on the similarities in their amino acid sequences and hydrophobicity profiles, the monomers of glycerol facilitators and of water channels likely exhibit similar three-dimensional structural organizations. A topological model for MIPs and a comparison of sequences in loop E between an aquaporin, AQPcic of Cicadella viridis, and the GlpF of Escherichia coli are shown in Fig. 1. We recently detected five amino acid positions that distinguish clearly two groups in MIPs (21Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These amino acids have been designated as “discriminant.” Interestingly, these two groups correspond to the two functionally different groups within MIPs, namely aquaporins and glycerol facilitators. One of these positions is located in loop C and the four others are found in or close to loop E. To study the oligomerization state of MIPs, we analyzed the behavior on sucrose density gradients of wild type or mutated AQPcic and of GlpF. We show that the heterologous AQPcic is tetrameric whereas GlpF is in a monomeric form either in OG or in Triton X-100 micelles. Moreover, we demonstrate that the substitution of a conserved amino acid of the aquaporin by a conserved amino acid of GlpF leads to the passage of AQPcic from a tetrameric to a monomeric form. pSP-AQPcic corresponds to the full-length AQPcic coding sequence subcloned into plasmid pXβG-ev1 (22Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pY60-AQPcic contains the AQPcic cDNA coding sequence placed under control of a GAL10-CYC promoter and a phosphoglycerate kinase terminator (19Lagrée V. Pellerin I. Hubert J.F. Tacnet F.

The AQPcic mutants were obtained by performing a two-step polymerase chain reaction using pSP-AQPcic as a template and sets of appropriate primers that overlap in the region of the mutation (23Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-248Google Scholar). The mutated AQPcic cDNAs were cloned either into plasmid pXβG-ev1 (constructions are named pSP-AQPS205D, pSP-AQPA209K, and pSP-AQPS205D/A209K) or into the yeast expression vector pYeDP60 (constructions are named pY60-AQPS205D, pY60-AQPA209K, and pY60-AQPS205D/A209K). The constructs pSP-AQPC134S and pY60-AQPC134S were described in Ref. 19Lagrée V. Pellerin I. Hubert J.F. Tacnet F. Le Cahérec F. Roudier N. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Deschamps S. J. Biol.

The coding region of E. coli glpF was amplified from the pglpF vector, a generous gift of Dr. Mizumo (20Muramatsu S. Mizumo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4378-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), by polymerase chain reaction and cloned either into the bacterial plasmid pUC18 (pUC-glpF) or into pXβG-ev1 (pSP-glpF). Yeast cells (W3031B strain) were transformed with pY60-AQPcic, pY60-AQPS205D, pY60-AQPA209K, pY60AQPS205D/A209K, and pY60-AQPC134S. Expression of wild type or mutated forms of AQPcic was then performed as described previously (19Lagrée V. Pellerin I. Hubert J.F. Tacnet F. Le Cahérec F. Roudier N. Thomas D. Gouranton J.

For the production of GlpF in bacteria, the E. coli strain GD236 (JM103 (24Sweet G. Gandor C. Voegele R. Winttekindt N. Beuerle J. Truniger V. Lin E. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 175: 1087-1094Google Scholar)) was transformed with pUC-glpF and was grown at 37 °C in LB with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). At midlog phase (A 600 ∼0.6), expression of GlpF was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the culture medium for 30 min. Production of proteins in Xenopus oocytes and subsequent water and glycerol transport assays were achieved as described (22Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After protein expression, total membrane fractions from yeast cells were prepared as described previously (25Centeno F. Deschamps S. Lompré A-M. Anger M. Moutin M-J. Dupont Y. Palmgren M.G. Villalba J.M. Møller J.V. Falson P. le Maire M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bacteria and Xenopusoocyte membranes were prepared as described in Refs. 26Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol.

Membranes were incubated in TB buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2% OG or 1% Triton X-100 for 12 h at 4 °C or 1% SDS for 12 h at room temperature. Insoluble materials were eliminated by a 100,000 × g centrifugation for 45 min at 15 °C. Linear 2–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradients were prepared from 2 and 20% sucrose stock solutions in TB buffer containing 2% OG, 1% Triton X-100, or 0.1% SDS. Solubilized proteins (1–10 μg) were layered on top of gradients, and ultracentrifugation to equilibrium was performed at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 5 °C. 20 fractions were then collected from the bottom of each gradient and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (28Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AQPcic immunodetection was performed using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the native C. viridis protein (5Beuron F. Le Cahérec F. Guillam M-T. Cavalier A. Garret A. Tassan J-P. Delamarche C. Schultz P. Mallouh V. Rolland J-P. Hubert J-F. Gouranton J. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17414-17422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GlpF was detected using a polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbit against a synthetic COOH-terminal peptide of GlpF (NH2-CVVEEKETTTPSEQKASL-COOH coupled to KLH) (Neosystem, France). Western blotting analysis was performed as described (22Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Blots were first incubated with either anti-AQPcic or anti-GlpF antibodies (1/1000). Autoradiographic films were scanned and analyzed using molecular analyst software (Bio-Rad). Curves were obtained using Excel software (Microsoft Corp.). The presence of wild type and mutant proteins in membrane cells was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.2 A, yeast cells transformed by appropriate vectors express AQPcic (lane 2), AQPcic-S205D (lane 3), and AQPcic-A209K (lane 4) although no signal is detected in membranes of control yeast (lane 1). In membranes of cRNA-microinjected Xenopus oocytes, AQPcic (lane 6), AQPcic-S205D (lane 7), and AQPcic-A209K (lane 8) are clearly detected and absent in control oocytes (lane 5). Fig. 2 B shows that the anti-GlpF antiserum reveals a 28-kDa protein in bacteria transformed by pUC-glpF vector (lane 2) and in glpF cRNA-microinjected oocytes (lane 4). No band is detected in control extracts (lanes 1 and 3). The presence of this specific immunoreactive 28-kDa band demonstrates that the GlpF protein is correctly expressed in membranes of both oocytes and bacteria. In addition to the 28-kDa GlpF protein, we observe a 30-kDa protein in bacteria membrane extracts. The presence of this 30-kDa additional immunoreactive protein results from the expression of an additional in-frame sequence corresponding to GlpF cDNA and the NH2 termini of LacZ cDNA in the pUC-glpF vector. To determine the functionality and specificity of exogenous proteins, swelling assays were performed on oocytes microinjected with wild type or mutants of AQPcic and GlpF cRNA (Fig. 2 C). Osmotic water permeability (Pf) is increased 15–20-fold in wild type AQPcic oocytes when compared with control oocytes. No significant increase of water osmotic permeability is observed in AQPcic-S205D, AQPcic-A209K oocytes, or GlpF oocytes. The functionality of AQPcic-C134S has been previously demonstrated in proteoliposomes (19Lagrée V. Pellerin I. Hubert J.F. Tacnet F. Le Cahérec F. Roudier N. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Deschamps S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12422-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, apparent glycerol permeability (P′gly) is increased about 10-fold in GlpF-expressing oocytes, whereas no modification of glycerol permeability is observed in oocytes expressing AQPcic, AQPcic-S205D, and AQPcic-A209K. In addition, in vivo uptake assays of radiolabeled glycerol have demonstrated that the GD236 E. coli strain (glpF−) transformed with pUC-glpF plasmid expresses a functional glycerol channel (data not shown). We previously demonstrated that the native AQPcic is a homotetramer in OG and in Triton X-100 and that SDS extraction from insect membranes induces monomerization of the protein (5Beuron F. Le Cahérec F. Guillam M-T. Cavalier A. Garret A. Tassan J-P. Delamarche C. Schultz P. Mallouh V. Rolland J-P. Hubert J-F. Gouranton J. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17414-17422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus we used the same approach to analyze and compare recombinant AQPcic and mutants of AQPcic and GlpF. To determine the oligomeric form of the proteins in the nondenaturing or denaturing detergents, membrane extracts from oocytes, yeast, or bacteria were analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation, and localization of proteins in fractions was revealed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the OG-solubilized AQPcic protein peaks at sedimentation fractions 9–10. This corresponds to a 6.8 S apparent sedimentation coefficient mean value and fits with the homotetrameric form of AQPcic (5Beuron F. Le Cahérec F. Guillam M-T. Cavalier A. Garret A. Tassan J-P. Delamarche C. Schultz P. Mallouh V. Rolland J-P. Hubert J-F. Gouranton J. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17414-17422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When AQPcic solubilization is performed in SDS, sedimentation occurs at fractions 14–15 (mean value of 2.8 S) that correspond to the monomeric form of the protein. These results show that heterologous AQPcic expressed either in yeast or in Xenopus oocytes exists in the same tetrameric state as the native protein. We then analyzed on sucrose gradients the 28-kDa GlpF protein overexpressed in E. coliand oocyte membranes. In both expression systems, GlpF detergent complexes sediment in OG or in SDS at an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S in fractions 14–15 (Fig. 3 B). This result is representative of three independent experiments. An identical sedimentation profile is obtained when the experiment is performed onE. coli GlpF extracted by Triton X-100 (Fig.3 B). The effect of discriminant amino acid substitution in loop E on oligomerization of MIPs was then analyzed. We substituted the serine 205 or the alanine 209 of AQPcic with the amino acids located in the corresponding positions in GlpF, an aspartic acid and a lysine, respectively (Fig. 1). Density gradient sedimentation analysis of these mutants expressed in yeast and in Xenopus oocytes is shown in Fig. 4. In both expression systems, the AQPcic-S205D mutation leaves the protein in a monomeric state in OG, whereas the mutation A209K in AQPcic does not modify the tetramer in the same nondenaturing detergent. We have also demonstrated that both AQPcic-S205D and AQPcic-A209K mutants are monomeric in SDS and that the double mutant AQPcic-S205D/A209K is monomeric in OG and in SDS (data not shown). In contrast, in yeast membrane extracts solubilized in OG, the mutant AQPcic-C134S, which is a functional aquaporin (19Lagrée V. Pellerin I. Hubert J.F. Tacnet F. Le Cahérec F. Roudier N. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Deschamps S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12422-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), is found tetrameric. In the present work, we studied the oligomerization state of representative proteins of the two functional subgroups of the MIP family. For this purpose, we analyzed the insect aquaporin AQPcic expressed in yeast or in Xenopus oocytes and the glycerol facilitator of E. coli expressed in bacteria or in oocytes. We also determined the oligomerization state of AQPcic when characteristic residues of aquaporins are substituted with characteristic residues of the glycerol facilitator family and showed that the amino acid in position 205 is involved in tetramerization or stability of the AQPcic tetramer. The native tetrameric state has been previously demonstrated for AQP0 (1Aerts T. Xia J.Z. Slegers H. de Block J. Clauwaert J. J. Biol.

Thus we performed protein extraction and sedimentation gradient analysis in 2% OG or 1% Triton X-100, values above critical micellar concentrations, and in 1% SDS, a percentage of the denaturing detergent sufficient to monomerize native AQPcic (5Beuron F.

We previously showed that AQPcic is a functional water channel when expressed in oocytes (22Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M-T. Thomas D. Gouranton J.

The present study demonstrates that in both heterologous expression systems, the functional wild type aquaporin AQPcic is tetrameric. In yeast, the functional aquaporin mutant AQP-C134S is also tetrameric. To analyze GlpF oligomerization, we used the same technique as for AQPcic. We verified the functionality of the protein following expression inXenopus oocytes and in bacteria. By oocyte swelling assays, the specific glycerol transport through GlpF has been demonstrated. The monomeric state of GlpF that we have observed in oocytes is not likely to correspond to a mistargeted form of the protein. Furthermore, uptake assays in bacteria expressing GlpF strengthen our statement about a monomeric GlpF protein. To analyze the relationship between the sedimentation coefficient and the oligomerization state of a membrane protein in detergent micelles, the amount of bound detergent should be known. Although the amount of OG bound to GlpF in our samples remains undetermined considering the highly conserved hydrophobicity profiles of MIPs, we assume that OG has the same behavior on GlpF as on other members of the MIP family. Moreover, exposure of hydrophobic transmembrane regions to the detergent should likely induce the monomeric forms of MIPs to bind more detergent/protein (w/w) than the homotetrameric forms in detergent micelles. The amount of OG bound to AQP0 was found from 0.71 to 0.80 g/g of protein (1Aerts T. Xia J.Z. Slegers H. de Block J. Clauwaert J. J. Biol.

For AQPcic, we previously determined an OG binding of 0.87 g/g of protein (5Beuron F. Le Cahérec F. Guillam M-T. Cavalier A. Garret A. Tassan J-P. Delamarche C. Schultz P. Mallouh V. Rolland J-P. Hubert J-F. Gouranton J. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17414-17422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, if GlpF was in a dimeric or trimeric form in OG micelles, with an assumed amount of OG bound of 0.80 g/g of protein, the averaged molecular mass of the complex should be at least 90–100 kDa. This value is incompatible with the 2.8 S sedimentation coefficient measured in sucrose gradients for GlpF-OG micelles, and only fits with a monomer of the protein with bound detergent. We also observe that in yeast membranes, the wild type or the mutants of AQPcic are expressed in quite identical amounts, and no significant variations in the OG/protein ratio could have interfered with the results. Extraction of GlpF was performed with two nondenaturing detergents from membranes of two different organisms; we nevertheless always observe that GlpF is in monomeric form. Additionally, the mutation S205D systematically induces monomerization of AQPcic. All together, these data support our hypothesis that the monomeric state of GlpF is not a detergent-induced phenomenon. The archetypal aquaporin AQP1 had been previously shown to solubilize in Triton X-100 as heterotetramers presumably constituted by one glycosylated and three nonglycosylated molecules (9Preston G. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Schulte and van Hoek (30Schulte D.J. van Hoek A.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Comp. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 118: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) recently obtained OG heterodimers of AQP1 and glycosylated AQP1 from various mammals. The authors mention that different qualitative and quantitative glycosylation states could influence the behavior of some aquaporins in nondenaturing detergents. In the present work, we studied AQPcic, which is a nonglycosylated aquaporin, 2M. T. Guillam and J-F. Hubert, unpublished results. and GlpF for which no report exists concerning any sugar association. For that point, our Western blots using the anti-GlpF antiserum did not evidence any high molecular mass putatively glycosylated forms of GlpF inE. coli or in oocyte membranes. Interestingly, this study shows that the serine residue in position 205 of the putative loop E in the aquaporin AQPcic might be essential for tetramerization, whereas both Ser-205 and Ala-209 residues are found essential for the water transfer function. The AQPcic-S205D mutant does not increase oocyte swelling in response to an osmotic shock. This lack of apparent functionality could be attributed to the change in the oligomerization state in the plasma membrane or to a mistargeting process. The mutation S205D was designed following our previous sequence analysis of MIPs (21Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The 205 and 209 positions correspond, respectively, to a negatively and a positively charged residue for the glycerol facilitators and two small uncharged amino acids for the aquaporins (Fig. 1). The failure of AQPcic-S205D to form a tetramer can be attributed to the presence of the negatively charged aspartate residue in position 205 rather than the small uncharged serine. The mutation S205D modifies the net charge of loop E, and this single point could explain the structural changes. However, in the same experimental conditions, the mutation A209K that also changes the net charge of loop E did not modify the tetrameric form of the heterologous protein. On the basis of the structural map of AQP1 determined by electron crystallography (12Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heyman J.B. Mitsouka K. Fujiyosi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), in the tetrameric native form of aquaporins, the six transmembrane domains surround a zone that is attributed to some infoldings of loops B, C, and E. In this model, the serine 205 and the alanine 209 localized in loop E likely do not reside at the interacting site between monomers. We do not have enough information to understand how the S205D mutation affects oligomerization and why the A209K substitution does not. The intracellular folding, assembly, and transport of MIPs and the pathway for tetramer formation of aquaporins in various cell types have to be better understood. In the present data, we demonstrate that the substitution of a single amino acid in an aquaporin by the residue located at the same position in GlpF induces the aquaporin to adopt the oligomerization state of GlpF. Because the serine and the aspartic acid in this position are highly conserved in aquaporins and in GlpFs, respectively, we postulate that glycerol facilitators are monomers in membranes, whereas aquaporins are organized in tetramers. Our results further suggest that loop E plays a major structural and functional role in the MIP family proteins. We thank Jacky Commandoux for rabbit immunization."

The efficiency of enzymatic catalysts is a source of continued interest and inspiration as molecular scientists strive to design new catalysts. A distinguishing characteristic of enzymic catalysts is that they bind to their substrates (1Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. McGraw-Hill, New York1969Google Scholar, 2Hansen D.E. Raines R.T. J. Chem. Educ. 1990; 67: 483-489Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding energy is necessary to compensate for the loss of translational and rotational entropy and for any destabilization of the substrate required to reach the transition state (3Page M.I. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1977; 16: 449-459Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Jencks W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Multivalent contacts between an enzyme and substrate provide much of this required binding energy. Indeed, many enzymes that cleave polymeric substrates have subsites that interact with monomeric units of the substrate. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A;1 EC 3.1.27.5) is a classic model for revealing the physical, chemical, and biological properties of enzymes (5Cuchillo C.M. Vilanova M. Nogués M.V. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 271-304Crossref Google Scholar, 6Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). RNase A is a 13.7-kDa endoribonuclease that binds RNA in a cationic cleft and cleaves on the 3′-side of pyrimidine residues. The cleft contains subsites (B1, B2, and B3) that interact specifically with bases and subsites (P0, P1, and P2) that interact with phosphoryl groups (7Nogués M.V. Vilanova M. Cuchillo C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Nogués M.V. Moussaoui M. Boix E. Vilanova M. Ribó M. Cuchillo C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The specificity of RNase A for pyrimidine bases is because of exclusion of the larger purine bases from the B1 subsite (9delCardayré S.B. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The B2 and B3 subsites prefer to bind purine bases. His-12, His-119, and Lys-41 of the P1 subsite are the residues most central to the catalytic function of the enzyme. The amino acid residues that comprise the P0 (Lys-66) and P2 (Lys-7 and Arg-10) subsites increase the affinity with which the substrate binds to the enzyme and participate indirectly in catalysis (10Boix E.

Some data portend the existence of additional RNase A binding sites beyond those characterized previously. Three-dimensional structures derived from x-ray diffraction analyses reveal a line of cationic residues stretching well beyond the active site and known subsites (13McPherson A. Brayer G. Cascio D. Williams R. Science. 1986; 232: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In addition, cation titration suggests that RNase A can occlude eleven nucleotides of a single-stranded nucleic acid (16Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7198-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that binding involves seven coulombic interactions (17Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Here, we search for additional RNase A subsites that interact with bound substrates. We determine the steady-state kinetic parameters for RNA cleavage by the wild-type enzyme and variants in which Lys-37, Arg-39, Arg-85, and Lys-104 are replaced individually by an alanine residue. We also dissect the role of Arg-85 in nucleic acid binding by comparing the affinity of different oligonucleotides for wild-type RNase A and the R85A variant. The results enable us to define a new subsite that interacts with a particular phosphoryl group of a bound nucleic acid. All Escherichia coli strains, plasmids, enzymes, and reagents were obtained as described elsewhere (11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ultraviolet and visible absorbance measurements were made with a Cary Model 3 spectrophotometer equipped with a Cary temperature controller from Varian (Sugar Land, TX). RNase A concentrations were determined by assuming that ε0.1%= 0.72 at 277.5 nm (18Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Harrington W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An electrostatic surface potential map created from a crystalline structure of wild-type RNase A (Brookhaven National Laboratory Protein Data Bank entry 1RPH, Ref.19) highlights the cationic cleft in the enzyme that interacts with a bound nucleic acid (Fig. 1). The active site of the enzyme comprises His-12, His-119, and Lys-41 (and also known as the P1 subsite) and is located in the center of the cleft. The cationic residues that reside closest to the active site are Lys-7 and Arg-10 (P2 subsite) on one side and Lys-66 (the P0 subsite) on the other side. The roles of Lys-7, Arg-10, and Lys-66 have been characterized in detail (11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Fisher B.M. Schultz L.W. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (in press)Google Scholar). Arg-85 and Lys-104 are the next closest cationic residues to Lys-66, and Lys-37 and Arg-39 are the next closest cationic residues to Lys-7 and Arg-10. Hence, we reasoned that one or more of these residues could play a role in catalysis by RNase A. To test this hypothesis, we created variants of RNase A in which Lys-37, Arg-39, Arg-85, and Lys-104 were substituted individually with an alanine residue. pBXR is a plasmid that directs the expression of wild-type RNase A in E. coli (20delCardayré S.B.

Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) was performed on single-stranded pBXR isolated from E. coli strain CJ236. To produce DNA coding for the K37A, R39A, R85A, and K104A variants, the codon for lysine or arginine was replaced with one for alanine (reverse complement in bold; new restriction endonuclease sites underlined) using oligonucleotides: JG5, CACTGGCTTGCAACGATCCGCGGTCAGGTTCCG; JG1, CACTGGC TTGCATGCTTTGGTCAGG; JG4, GGGGTACTTGGAGGATCCGGTCTCCGCGCAGTCGGTG; and JG3, GTTTCCCTCGCATGCCACATTGATGTGGGCATTCGCCTG, respectively. Mutagenesis reactions were transformed into competent DH5α cells, and cDNA sequences from isolated transformants were determined with an ABI 373 automated sequencer. Wild-type RNase A and the K37A, R39A, R85A, and K104A variants were produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) as described elsewhere (11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Peak symmetry on chromatography elution profiles, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, andA 280/A 260 ratios greater than 1.8 indicated that the proteins were >99% pure. Purified proteins were dialyzed exhaustively against H2O, lyophilized, and stored at −70 °C. Stabilities of the wild-type and variant proteins were determined by thermal denaturation studies in 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, as described elsewhere (22Eberhardt E.S. Wittmayer P.K. Templer B.M. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1697-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric assays were used to determine steady-state kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly(C). The Δε for this reaction is 2380m−1 cm−1 at 250 nm (9delCardayré S.B. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Concentrations of poly(C) were determined by assuming that ε = 6200m−1 cm−1 per nucleotide at 268 nm (23Yakovlev G.I. Moiseyev G.P. Bezborodova S.I. Both V. Sevcik J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 25 °C in 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m), poly(C) (30 μm −1.6 mm), and enzyme (0.75 pm−3.1 nm). Values of k cat,K m, andk cat/K m were determined from initial velocity data with the program HYPERO (24Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy assays were used to quantitate the binding of single-stranded DNA to wild-type RNase A and the R85A variant. DNA is a useful analog of RNA because RNase A binds to but does not cleave DNA (25Walz F.G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2156-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fluorescein (Fl), incorporated during the final coupling step of DNA synthesis, was attached to the 5′-end of two oligonucleotides via a six-carbon spacer. These oligonucleotides, Fl∼d(AUAA) and Fl∼d(UAA), were designed to test for the existence of an additional phosphoryl group subsite on the 5′-side of the scissile bond (SchemeFS1). Fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides were obtained in purified, desalted form from Promega. The oligonucleotide concentrations were determined by assuming that ε = 66250 m−1cm−1 at 260 nm for Fl∼d(AUAA) and ε = 60300m−1 cm−1 at 260 nm for Fl∼d(UAA) (26Wallace R.B. Miyada C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy was measured at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) in 0.020 m MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.025 m) and oligonucleotide (2.5 nm) on a Beacon Fluorescence Polarization System (Panvera, Madison, WI) as described elsewhere (11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to Eq. 5 of Ref. 11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar to obtain values of K d. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly(C) by wild-type RNase A and the K37A, R39A, R85A, and K104A variants are listed in Table I. Also listed in this table are the values of T m for the five proteins. These values indicate that the kinetic parameters determined at 25 °C are indeed those of the native proteins.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly(cytidylic acid) by wild-type ribonuclease AaData from Ref. 11., K37A ribonuclease A, R39A ribonuclease A, R85A ribonuclease A, and K104A ribonuclease AbData were obtained at 25 °C in 0.10 mMES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m), enzyme (0.75–3.1 nm), and poly(C) (30 μm–1.6 mm).Ribonuclease A (Tm)cValues of T m are reported ± 2 °C.k catK Mk cat/K M° Cs−1mm106m−1Wild Type (62)507 ± 150.089 ± 0.0095.7 ± 0.5K37A (61)539 ± 100.071 ± 0.0047.6 ± 0.4R39A (62)541 ± 280.096 ± 0.0025.7 ± 1.1R85A (62)659 ± 801.42 ± 0.300.46 ± 0.04K104A (62)281 ± 50.042 ± 0.0046.4 ± 0.5a Data from Ref. 11Fisher B.M.

Open table in a new tab Of the four residues investigated in this study, Arg-85 has the most dramatic effect on the kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly(C). The k cat value is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, but the K m value differs dramatically, being >15-fold higher than that for the wild-type enzyme. The value of k cat/K mfor poly(C) cleavage by R85A RNase A is 10-fold lower than that for the wild-type enzyme. Replacing Lys-37, Arg-39, or Lys-104 with alanine has little change on the kinetic parameters for cleavage of poly(C). Thek cat, K m, andk cat/K m values for poly(C) cleavage by K37A RNase A and R39A RNase A are virtually indistinguishable from those of wild-type RNase A. Thek cat and K m values for poly(C) cleavage by K104A RNase A are both 2-fold lower than those for the wild-type enzyme, and thek cat/K m value is similar. The specific interaction between Arg-85 and single-stranded DNA was evaluated by fluorescence anisotropy assays. These assays employed two fluorescein-labeled DNA oligonucleotides that differ only by an adenosine 5′-phosphate. The ligands, Fl∼d(UAA) and Fl∼d(AUAA), were modeled after d(ATAAG), which forms a complex with known three-dimensional structure (PDB entry 1RCN; Ref. 15Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21526-21531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single pyrimidine in d(ATAAG) (and presumably in Fl∼d(UAA) and Fl∼d(AUAA)) binds to RNase A specifically in the B1 subsite. Data for the binding of Fl∼d(UAA) and Fl∼d(AUAA) to wild-type RNase A is shown in Fig. 2 A. Data for the binding of Fl∼d(UAA) and Fl∼d(AUAA) to R85A RNase A is shown in Fig. 2 B. Although the anisotropy values of the bound (A max) and unbound oligomer (A min) varied slightly between experiments, the total change in anisotropy (ΔA) remained constant for all experiments. This value (ΔA = 120 mA) is consistent with that seen previously for the binding of Fl∼d(AUAA) (11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Fl∼d(UAA) (27Kelemen B.R. Raines R.T. Marshak D.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VIII. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 565-572Google Scholar) to wild-type RNase A. As shown in Fig. 2, Fl∼d(AUAA) binds to wild-type RNase A to form a complex with a K d value of 3.0 μm. This value is 8-fold lower than that for the complex of Fl∼d(UAA) and wild-type RNase A. This result suggests that there are specific interactions between RNase A and the 5′-phosphoryl group or adenine base of the bound nucleic acid. Fl∼d(AUAA) binds to the R85A variant to form a complex with a K d value of 9.6 μm. This value is 2.4-fold lower than the wild-type RNase A·Fl∼d(UAA) complex, again suggesting that RNase A interacts specifically with the additional adenosine 5′-phosphate. Fl∼d(UAA) binds to wild-type RNase A and the R85A variant with similar affinity. The active site and several other subsites of RNase A have been well characterized (5Cuchillo C.M. Vilanova M. Nogués M.V. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 271-304Crossref Google Scholar, 6Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The goal of this work is to identify additional subsites in RNase A that interact with the RNA substrate during catalysis. Using both kinetic and thermodynamic assays, we find that the side chain of Arg-85 interacts with the phosphoryl group of a bound substrate. In addition, we show that Lys-37, Arg-39, and Lys-104 do not, at least individually, comprise RNase A subsites. Thirty years ago, Takahashi (1968) proposed roles for Arg-39 and Arg-85 based on a loss of ribonucleolytic activity upon covalent modification of these residues (28Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent affinity labeling and molecular modeling studies led Cuchillo and co-workers (29de Llorens R. Arús C. Parés X. Cuchillo C.M. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to predict that Lys-104 and Lys-37 comprise an additional phosphoryl group subsite on the 5′- and 3′-side, respectively, of the scissile bond. After determining the crystalline structure of the RNase A·d(ATAAG) complex, Cuchillo and co-workers (15Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21526-21531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) included Arg-85 as a possible subsite residue. The oligonucleotide in the crystalline complex lacked a 5′-phosphoryl group, and no interaction between Arg-85 or Lys-104 and d(ATAAG) was apparent. Likewise, disorder in the crystalline complex precluded detection of new interactions on the 3′-side of the P2 subsite. Still, an electrostatic potential map of the RNase A surface concurred with prior speculations—Lys-37, Arg-39, Arg-85, and Lys-104 were good candidates for additional enzymic subsites (Fig.1). Replacing Lys-37 or Arg-39 with an alanine residue has little effect on the kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly(C). As listed in Table I,k cat, K m, andk cat/K m are all within 2-fold of the values for wild-type RNase A. Despite the proximity of Lys-37 and Arg-39 to the P2 subsite and their cationic side chains, which could interact with a phosphoryl group of RNA, these data suggest that Lys-37 and Arg-39 do not contribute to catalysis. Lys-37 is not conserved by evolution. Of the 41 pancreatic ribonucleases of known sequence, only those from bovine, eland, rat, and guinea pig have a lysine residue at position 37 (30Beintema J.J. Life Chem. Rep. 1987; 4: 333-389Google Scholar) (glutamine is most prevalent at this position). Likewise, Arg-39 is not conserved. Of the 41 pancreatic ribonucleases of known sequence, only 30 have an arginine residue at position 39 (30Beintema J.J. Life Chem. Rep. 1987; 4: 333-389Google Scholar). Replacing Lys-104 with an alanine residue has a small effect on catalysis. Although the value of bothk cat and K m for K104A RNase A are 2-fold lower than those of the wild-type enzyme, the change to the value of k cat/K m is not significant. These results suggest that Lys-104 has little importance in the RNase A-catalyzed cleavage of RNA. The similarity in the kinetic parameters for poly(C) cleavage by K104A RNase A and the wild-type enzyme was not anticipated from a consideration of phylogenetics. In contrast to Lys-37 and Arg-39, Lys-104 is conserved highly. The side chain of residue 104 is cationic in 39 of 40 pancreatic ribonucleases whose sequences have been determined, with all but four of these residues being lysine (30Beintema J.J. Life Chem. Rep. 1987; 4: 333-389Google Scholar). Residue 85 is the most conserved residue of the four investigated herein. An arginine is present at position 85 in 40 of 41 pancreatic ribonucleases (30Beintema J.J. Life Chem. Rep. 1987; 4: 333-389Google Scholar). The single exception is mouse pancreatic ribonuclease, which has a histidine at this position. Based on its conservation by evolution and its proximity to the active site, Arg-85 appeared likely to play a role in substrate binding. The impaired kinetic parameters for the cleavage of poly(C) by R85A RNase A suggest a significant role for residue 85. Although the value of k cat for poly(C) cleavage remains essentially unchanged, those of K m andk cat/K m differ dramatically (Table I). Interestingly, the >15-fold increase in the value ofK m is larger than that for K41A RNase A, which has the largest K m value observed previously for an RNase A variant. 2J. M. Messmore and R. T. Raines, unpublished results. In addition, the value ofk cat/K m for poly(C) cleavage by R85A RNase A is 10-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Thus, Arg-85 makes a uniform contribution toward binding the ground state and the rate-limiting transition state during catalysis. Coulombic interactions can form between the cationic side chains of a protein and the anionic phosphoryl groups of a nucleic acid. The driving force for complex formation is the release of cations from the nucleic acid upon complex formation (17Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Accordingly, proteins often bind more strongly to nucleic acids in solutions that have a lower concentration of cations. Indeed, the affinity of Fl∼d(AUAA) for RNase A increases with decreasing sodium concentration (11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The K d values for the RNase A·Fl∼d(AUAA) and RNase A·Fl∼d(UAA) complexes in the solution used in the poly(C) cleavage assays (0.10 m MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m)) are 88 μm (11Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and 130 μm (27Kelemen B.R. Raines R.T. Marshak D.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VIII. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 565-572Google Scholar), respectively. TheseK d values differ by only 1.5-fold. Yet, in the low salt concentration solution used in our binding experiments (0.020m MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.025m)), the K d values for the RNase A·Fl∼d(AUAA) and RNase A·Fl∼d(UAA) complexes are 3.0 and 24 μm, respectively, differing by 8-fold (Figs.2 and 3). These salt-concentration effects are consistent with the existence of a coulombic interaction between the cationic side chain of Arg-85 and the additional anionic phosphoryl group of Fl∼d(AUAA). Why is the affinity of R85A RNase A for Fl∼d(AUAA) greater than that for Fl∼d(UAA)? In the crystalline RNase A·d(ATAAG) complex (15Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21526-21531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the side chain of Arg-85 is directed toward the 5′-hydroxyl group of d(ATAAG), which is in the position that would be occupied by the 5′-phosphoryl group of Fl∼d(AUAA). This interaction is removed upon replacing Arg-85 with alanine. Still, Cβ and Cγ of Pro-42 make van der Waals contact with the 5′-adenine base of d(ATAAG). This interaction could be responsible for the additional binding energy upon complex formation with the longer oligonucleotide. The cationic residues of RNase A that are known to interact with RNA are distributed evenly about the active site (Fig. 4). Arg-85 and Lys-66 are on the 5′-side, and Lys-7 and Arg-10 (P2) are on the 3′-side. In contrast to the substrate, the products of RNA cleavage each interact with only two of these four residues. This symmetric disposition of the phosphoryl group binding subsites is thus optimal for maximizing the binding of substrate while minimizing the binding of products. RNase A has known subsites that enable the multivalent interaction with the bases (B1, B2, and B3) and phosphoryl groups (P0, P1, and P2) of an RNA substrate. The results of kinetic and thermodynamic experiments indicate that Arg-85 has an important role in nucleic acid binding by RNase A. Based on the proximity of Arg-85 to the P0 subsite, the dramatic change in the K m value for poly(C) cleavage, and the differential binding affinities of Fl∼d(AUAA) and Fl∼d(UAA) for the wild-type protein and R85A variant, we conclude that the side chain of Arg-85 constitutes a new enzymic subsite, which we call “P(−1)” (Fig. 4)."

These functional and structural studies lead us to conclude that Glu-312 does not fulfil the role of proton donor during catalysis, but it is required for proper binding of the nicotinamide ring of NADP(H).

Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR)1 from plants and cyanobacteria fulfils the role of electrical switch between one- and two-electron transfer processes during NADP+ photoreduction in the photosynthetic electron transport chain (1Zanetti G. Aliverti A. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 305-315Google Scholar, 2Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). FNR became the structural prototype of a large family of structurally related flavoenzymes since the resolution of its three-dimensional structure, which highlighted a novel flavin binding fold (3Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Indeed, FNR-like modules are building blocks for constructing both simple and complex flavoproteins with the most varied biological functions not only in prokaryotes and plants but also in animals (4Correll C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Karplus P.A. Bruns C.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Generally, the members of the family are highly specific either for NAD+or NADP+, whereas they are more permissive with respect to the electron acceptor. The non-physiological reactions catalyzed in vitro by FNR can be divided into two half-reactions corresponding to transfer of a hydride between NADPH and FAD, and transfer of single electrons between reduced FAD and electron carriers (A), such as Fd (cytochromec), ferricyanide, and presumably INT, according to Scheme 1. FNRox+NADPH→FNRred+NADP+(reductive half­reaction)FNRred+nAox→FNRox+nAred(oxidative half­reaction)Scheme 1 The stoichiometric coefficient n can be 1 or 2, depending on the type of electron acceptor. The reductive half-reaction of FNR and other FNR family members occurs in discrete steps, which involve two Michaelis complexes (MC) and two charge-transfer complexes (CT) (6Batie C.J. Kamin H. J.

Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), our group and others have carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the five conserved residues surrounding the isoalloxazine ring in the active center of FNR: Tyr-95, Ser-96, Cys-272, Glu-312, and Tyr-314 (spinach numbering). It was shown by changing Cys-272 to Ser that this residue, conserved in all the members of the family, is required for productive interaction of the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ with the flavin to facilitate hydride transfer between C-4 of nicotinamide and N-5 of the isoalloxazine (13Aliverti A. Piubelli L. Zanetti G. Lübberstedt T. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6374-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Replacement of Ser-96 with Gly or Val clearly interfered with the proper binding of the nicotinamide and with the stabilization of the transition state during hydride transfer between NADPH and FAD (8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Substitution of Phe for Tyr-95, which interacts with the si face of the isoalloxazine and makes a H-bond to the ribityl 4′-OH group, did not alter significantly the physico-chemical properties of the enzyme (14Aliverti A. Pandini V.E. Sternieri F.A. Corrado M.E. Karplus P.A. Zanetti G. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. II.

Zanetti, unpublished results. Mutation of the C-terminal Tyr-314, whose side chain covers the re face of the isoalloxazine, was done for pea FNR, where it could be replaced by Trp or Phe with only a 50% decrease in k cat, indicating that it probably did not have a direct chemical role in catalysis (15Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Carrillo N. Ceccarelli E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19267-19273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we study the role of Glu-312, a residue that hydrogen-bonds to Ser-96 and has been hypothesized to play a role as proton donor during the one-electron reduction of FNR by ferredoxin (11Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This residue is conserved in all the members of the FNR family, except cytochrome b 5 reductase and nitrate reductase (3Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Here we replaced Glu-312 with Asp (conserving charge), Gln (conserving shape and polarity), Leu (conserving space but removing polarity), and Ala (removing the side chain and allowing replacement by water). Complete kinetic characterization of the four mutants and the three-dimensional structures of three of them lead to the conclusion that Glu-312 does not play a key chemical role as the proton donor, but rather is required for nicotinamide proper positioning in the active site. Preliminary results have been presented elsewhere (16Zanetti G. Aliverti A. Ravasi D. Curti B. Zhan D. Karplus P.A. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins.

Horse heart cytochrome c, INT, NADP(H), and NADP+ analogs (2′-P-ADP-ribose, thio-NADP+, 3-AcPADP+, and 3-AmPADP+) were obtained from Sigma. Factor Xa was from Pierce. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from either Life Technologies, Inc. or Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Site-directed mutagenesis of the FNR gene construct was carried out according to the phosphorothioate-based method (17Sayers J.R. Schmidt W. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The single-stranded template was obtained by recloning the wild-type FNR gene in M13mp9 as described (18Aliverti A. Lübberstedt T. Zanetti G. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17760-17763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the four synthetic oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis is reported in TableI. In addition to the base changes in the GAA triplet encoding Glu-312, designed to introduce the desired amino acid replacements at this position, the mutagenic primers carried a second, silent mutation in the following triplet (GTC → GTT), designed to disrupt a restriction AccI site, in order to facilitate subsequent screening steps. The presence of the desired mutation and the lack of second-site mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis of the mutagenized genes. DNA sequencing was performed according to the chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified from E. coli (host strain RRIΔM15) essentially as described elsewhere (8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), with the only difference that FPLC on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as the last step instead of chromatography on phosphocellulose. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gel slabs. The C-terminal sequence of the FNR-E312Q mutant was determined using a Hewlett-Packard G1009A C-terminal protein sequencing system. Absorption spectra were recorded with the Hewlett-Packard 8452 or 8453 diode array spectrophotometers. The extinction coefficient of the protein-bound flavin was determined by resolving the FAD from the apoprotein and spectrophotometrically quantitating the released FAD, according to the procedure described in (8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein and flavin fluorescence were monitored on a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer. FNR reduction was achieved by one-electron donation from the 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone produced by light irradiation, EDTA serving as the final electron source (20Massey V. Hemmerich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5612-5614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photoreduction was performed both in the absence and in presence of NADP+. Reactions were carried out at 15 °C in an anaerobic cuvette on 15–18 μm FNR samples in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, in the presence of 15 mm EDTA and 1–1.2 μm 5-deazariboflavin. When present, NADP+ was at a concentration of 17 μm. Reaction solutions were made anaerobic by successive evacuation and flushing with O2-free N2. Each mutant was subjected to successive short times of illumination to finally reach full reduction of enzyme flavin. Absorption spectra were recorded before and after successive periods of irradiation with a 150-watt light source. The spectrum obtained at each time may be a mixture of the three redox states of the enzyme FAD (oxidized, semiquinone, and hydroquinone). Steady-state kinetics were performed as described previously (13Aliverti A. Piubelli L. Zanetti G. Lübberstedt T. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6374-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rapid-reaction kinetics were studied with a Hi-Tech SF-61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer interfaced with a MacIntosh computer using the KISS program (Kinetic Instruments, Inc). Hydride transfer between NADPH and FNR was studied by mixing 100 μm NADPH with 30–40 μm oxidized FNRs in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, at different temperatures, as reported previously (8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Aliverti A. Piubelli L. Zanetti G. Lübberstedt T. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6374-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The K d values of the complexes of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes with oxidized Fd were determined by titrating the reductase protein fluorescence with Fd in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 (at 15 °C), essentially as described in Ref. 8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. To measure the K d of the complexes of the mutant FNRs with NADP+ and thio-NADP+, the proteins were spectrophotometrically titrated with the ligands. FNR samples were diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7 (at 15 °C), to a final concentration of about 20 μm. Absorption spectra were recorded before and after successive additions of nucleotide. Difference spectra were computed subtracting from each spectrum the spectrum recorded in the absence of ligand, corrected to account for dilution. Data at several different wavelengths were fitted as described in Ref. 8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. FNR samples were diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7 (at 15 °C), to a final concentration of about 20 μm. Two successive additions of ligand (NADP+, 2′-P-ADP-ribose, thio-NADP+, 3-AmPADP+, and 3-AcPADP+) were then made to ensure saturation conditions. Difference spectra were computed as above. Crystals of FNR mutants E312A, E312L, and E312Q grew under conditions similar to those for wild-type FNR (3Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 11Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These crystals were isomorphous, belonging to space group C2, with unit cell parameters a= 90.7 Å, b = 57.9 Å, c = 68.2 Å, and β = 99.5° for E312A; a = 91.2 Å,b = 58.0 Å, c = 68.2 Å, andβ = 99.9° for E312L; a = 90.8 Å,b = 58.0 Å, c = 68.1 Å, andβ = 99.7° for E312Q. Under similar conditions, the E312D mutant failed to produce single crystals. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a San Diego Multiwire System area detector (21Hamlin R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 416-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode (Cu-Kalfa) as described (11Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The data were merged using SCALEPACK (Z. Otwinowski, University of Texas, Dallas, TX), and crystallographic refinement was carried out using X-PLOR version 3.1 (22Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The wild-type FNR structure (Ref. 11Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry number 1fnb) was employed as starting model, with residue 312 changed from Glu to the appropriate residue, and residue 269 changed from Val to Phe (23Jansen T. Reiländer H. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Curr. Genet. 1988; 23: 517-522Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Initial difference electron density maps also indicated that some residues surrounding Phe-269 (such as Leu-262) move slightly away from Phe-269, as was seen in the S96V mutant structure (Ref. 8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; PDB entry number 1frn). These models were then refined against their corresponding diffraction data between 10 Å and the highest resolution limit, using conventional positional refinement and then restrained B-factor refinement, followed by manual adjustment guided by 2Fo −Fc(αc) andFo −Fc(αc) maps. Several rounds of refinement yielded the final models. The data collection statistics, crystallographic refinement statistics and the final model quality are shown in Table II. Since the wild-type structure was refined using TNT version 5a (11Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), a control experiment was performed by refining this model against the same data using X-PLOR.

The presence of the desired mutations was verified by DNA sequencing and further confirmed by checking the mobility of the mutated enzymes in nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Indeed, only the FNR-E312D, as expected, showed the same mobility of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the other three mutants, having each lost a negative charge, were slightly retarded. The correct sequence of the E312Q mutant was confirmed by protein sequencing from the C terminus (-Q-V-Y). All mutants exhibited the typical absorption spectrum of the wild-type enzyme. Extinction coefficients at 458 nm were determined to be 9.65, 9.62, 9.62, and 9.8 mm−1 cm−1, for E312D, E312Q, E312A, and E312L mutants, respectively. The flavin fluorescence was quenched in the mutants as in the wild-type enzyme. Small but significant differences were observed in the visible absorbance spectra of the oxidized forms of the mutant FNRs with respect to the wild-type enzyme. These changes are qualitatively similar to those elicited by replacement of Ser-96 with Val or Gly (8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but of lower intensity. The E312L mutant is unique in that it has the 380-nm band increased but not red-shifted (16Zanetti G. Aliverti A. Ravasi D. Curti B. Zhan D. Karplus P.A. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1996: 509-512Google Scholar). Crystallization was attempted with all four E312 mutants, but only three crystallized (FNR-E312A, FNR-E312L, FNR-E312Q). Structures of the Ala, Leu, or Gln mutants reveal no global perturbation of the protein structures has occurred. Instead, only subtle changes are observed around the active sites (Fig.1). Generally, the extent of these shifts is smaller than those observed in S96V mutant structure (8Aliverti A. Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Compared with the wild-type structure, the isoalloxazine ring of FAD in FNR-E312A shifts slightly toward residue 312, with its C-7 atom moving about 0.5 Å. The hydroxyl group of Ser-96, which ordinarily hydrogen bonds to Glu-312 in the wild-type structure, moves about 0.4 Å away from FAD. In FNR-E312L, unlike FNR-E312A, the dimethylbenzene ring of FAD moves away from residue 312, with the C-7 atom shifting about 0.3 Å. The hydroxyl group of Ser-96 moves about 0.3 Å away from the isoalloxazine ring. Water 407 also shifts 0.3 Å in the same direction, so that the distance between the Oγ atom of Ser-96 and water 407 remains unchanged. Also, the side chain and main-chain atoms of Leu-312 move slightly away from FAD, compared with the wild-type structure. In FNR-E312Q, the shift of the isoalloxazine ring is very small (<0.2 Å). The side chain atoms of Gln-312 swing away from Ser-96 by as much as 0.7 Å. We are unable to distinguish between the Oε1 and Nε2 atoms of Gln-312, as either assignment could satisfy the hydrogen bonding environment. The hydroxyl group of Ser-96 shifts 0.33 Å toward Gln-312, and it is within the hydrogen bonding distance to Nε2 (or Oε1) of Gln-312 (2.9 Å). In addition, the distance between the FAD-N-5 atom and Ser-96-Oγ in all three mutants increases by ∼0.2 Å compared with the wild-type structure. Steady-state kinetics of the mutants were performed for the diaphorase reaction using either K3Fe(CN)6 or INT as the electron acceptor, because the reductive half-reaction is rate-limiting in the ferricyanide reaction, whereas the oxidative one is limiting with INT (Scheme 1). The kinetic parameters (TableIII) reveal substantial differences using the two electron acceptors. In the case of ferricyanide, all the mutants showed a reduced k cat and aK m for NADPH almost unchanged with respect to that of the wild-type enzyme, except for the Ala mutant. Unexpectedly, this mutant was the most active, exhibiting about 60% of the wild-typek cat, whereas the FNR-E312D and the FNR-E312Q show a 4-fold decrease and the FNR-E312L mutant a 20-fold decrease. TheK m for ferricyanide of the Ala mutant was found also greatly decreased (3 versus 100 μm), and thek cat/K m is 20-fold higher than the wild-type one. Using INT as the second substrate, all the mutants, except the FNR-E312L, exhibited a substantial degree of activity with k cat values ranging from 50 to 110% of that of the wild-type FNR. The K m values for INT were always decreased and those for NADPH instead were increased, again except in the case of the Ala mutant (a 5-fold decrease). Thus, FNR-E312A is remarkable in that it shows a catalytic efficiency for each acceptor >5-fold higher than that of wild-type FNR.Table IIIKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant FNRsFNRDiaphorase activityFe(CN)63−INTReductive half-reactionk cat aElectron equivalents per second.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the spectral changes during enzyme reduction by NADPH was performed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry in anaerobiosis (Fig. 2). For wild-type FNR, time traces at any wavelength were best fitted by two exponential phases (Fig.2 A): the first phase corresponding to the formation of a charge-transfer complex between enzyme-bound oxidized FAD and NADPH (CT1), the slower phase corresponding to the formation, by hydride transfer, of a charge-transfer complex between reduced FAD and NADP+ (CT2) (Refs. 8Aliverti A.

It is well known that chromogranins can serve as immunocytochemical markers for neuroendocrine tissues and as a diagnostic tool for neuroendocrine tumors. In 1993, large CGA-derived fragments have been shown to be excreted into the urine in patients with carcinoid tumors and the present study deals with the characterization of the post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and O-glycosylation) located along the largest natural CGA-derived fragment CGA79–439. Using mild proteolysis of peptidic material, high performance liquid chromatography, sequencing, and mass spectrometry analysis, six post-translational modifications were detected along the C-terminal CGA-derived fragment CGA79–439. Three O-linked glycosylation sites were located in the core of the protein on Thr163, Thr165, and Thr233, consisting in di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides. Three phosphorylation sites were located in the middle and C-terminal domain, on serine residues Ser200, Ser252, and Ser315.

Chromogranins/secretogranins (CGs/Sgs)1 constitute a family of acidic secretory glycoproteins widely expressed in a large number of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells and in neurons (1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 2Helle K.B. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H.

Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Chromogranin A (CGA), the major member (40% of total soluble granule proteins) of this family, has been studied extensively. At the subcellular level, chromogranins are exclusively found in the soluble core of hormone and neurotransmitter storage vesicles and are released during exocytosis. Chromogranins have been proposed to play multiple roles in the secretory process. An intracellular function as a “helper” protein in the packaging of peptides, hormones, and neuropeptides by virtue of their ability to aggregate in the low pH and high calcium environment of the trans-Golgi network and as modulators of the processing of these components has been suggested (3Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Extracellularly, different members of the chromogranin family are now considered as precursor proteins, which are actively processed into peptides within the secretory granules (see Refs. 1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar and 5Dillen L. Miserez B. Claeys M. Aunis D. De Potter W. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 22: 315-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar for reviews). Previously, we reported a detailed study of the intracellular and extracellular processing of CGA and CGB/SgI (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Strub J.M. Garcia-Sablone P. Lonning K. Taupenot L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J.

Bader M.F. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in bovine chromaffin granules. The proteolytic processing of CGA is a topic of growing interest, as biological activities have been attributed to peptides located along the sequence of CGA. For example, in the N-terminal domain, a peptide corresponding to the sequence 1–113 has been shown to inhibit hormone secretion in the bovine parathyroid gland (9Drees B.M. Rouse J. Johnson J. Hamilton J.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3381-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); a homologous peptide, β-granin, corresponding to the sequence 1–115 has been isolated from rat pancreas, but its function has not yet been defined (10Hutton J.C. Davidson H.W. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Vasostatins are peptides containing the N-terminal sequence (1–76/113) (11Helle K.B. Marley P.D. Hogue-Angeletti R. Galindo E. Aunis D. Small D.H. Livett B.G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that exhibit vasoinhibitory activity of isolated human blood vessels (12Aardal S. Helle K.B. Regul.

Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As early as 1988, it was established that CGA is the precursor of a peptide that inhibits the secretory activity on chromaffin cells (14Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and recently, catestatin, a novel CGA fragment (344–364), was characterized as a noncompetitive nicotinic cholinergic antagonist (15Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, pancreastatin (248–293) is a peptide with multiple properties, since it negatively modulates insulin secretion from endocrine pancreatic islets (16Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G.

Pancreas. 1989; 4: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and acid secretion from parietal cells (19Lewis J.J. Goldenring J.R. Asher V.A. Modlin I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Parastatin (347–419) is another CGA-derived peptide located in the C-terminal domain of CGA that inhibits parathyroid cell secretion (20Fasciotto B.H. Trauss C.A. Greeley G.H. Cohn D.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition to the autocrine or paracrine role in hormone secretion of these CGA-derived peptides, we have shown recently that numerous peptides present as water-soluble components of bovine chromaffin granules and released during secretion display antibacterial activity (7Strub J.M.

Human CGA is a single polypeptide chain of 439 residues, with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and a pI of 4.7–5.2. The amino acid sequence of human CGA (25Helman L. Ahn T. Levine M. Allison A. Cohen P. Cohn D. Israel M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates a real molecular mass of 48 kDa for the unmodified form of this protein. The difference between the apparent (70 kDa) and theoretical molecular mass (48 kDa) probably results from post-translational modifications (i.e. glycosylation, phosphorylation) (27Kiang W.L.

Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, for review). In 1997, using mild proteolysis, peptide separation, microsequencing, and mass analysis techniques, seven post-translational modification sites were detected in bovine CGA (29Strub J.M. Sorokine O.

Two glycosylation sites, each consisting of the trisaccharide NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-linked to Ser186 and Thr231. The former residue is present in the antibacterial peptide named chromacin (22Strub J.M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Five phosphorylation sites were located on serine residues at positions Ser81, Ser307, Ser372, Ser376, and on Tyr173, this latter residue being the N-terminal amino acid of chromacin. Furthermore, studying the new antibacterial bovine CGA-derived peptides G- and PG-chromacin (CGA173–194), we demonstrated that the two post-translational modifications (Tyr173 and Ser186) are both necessary for the antibacterial activity of chromacin. Since 1989, it is well known that chromogranins can serve as immunocytochemical markers for neuroendocrine tissues and as a diagnostic tool for neuroendocrine tumors (3Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H.

The strategy consists in characterizing the primary structure of modified phosphorylated and O-glycosylated peptides, which were isolated after proteolytic cleavage of CGA79–439 with endoproteinase Lys-C. Then, using successively separation by reverse phase HPLC, enzymatic modification of phosphorylated peptides, and complete analysis by sequencing and mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight), a detailed study was carried out. These post-translational modifications were located along the polypeptidic chain, compared with sequences of others species and discussed in relation with biological activity of natural CGA-derived fragments. Urine was collected during a 24-h period from a patient with a histologically verified carcinoid tumor and multiple liver metastasis. The sample was collected, after informed consent, when the patient was on a clinical trial at the Endocrine Unit of Uppsala University Hospital. The study was also approved by the local Ethical Committee. The urine sample was first filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and then concentrated about 100 times in a dialysis tube (Spectra/Por; cutoff value, 6–8 kDa). CGA-derived fragments were isolated in a one-step separation on an anion exchange column (Mono Q, FPLC; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a linear gradient of 0.2 mammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.0 to 1.0 m ammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.0 containing 1.0 m sodium chloride. Fractions containing CGA-derived fragments were concentrated on a Minicon concentrator (Amicon) and stored in −70 °C before further analysis. CGA79–439 (2.5 nmol) was digested for 18 h at 37 °C with endoproteinase Lys-C at a protein to enzyme weight ratio of 1000:1 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Generated peptides were then separated by HPLC, using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), on a Macherey Nagel 300–5C18 column (4 × 250 mm; particle size 5 μm and pore size 100 Å). Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (solvent B). Material was eluted at a flow rate of 550 μl/min using, successively, a gradient of 0–30% solvent B in solvent A over 46 min, followed by a gradient of 30–50% over 13 min, and achieved by a gradient 50–100% over 10 min. Each peak fraction was automatically collected by the SMART system and concentrated by evaporation, but not to dryness. CGA209/210–245 mixture (100 pmol) was digested for 18 h at 37 °C with endoproteinase Glu-C at a protein to enzyme weight ratio of 100:1 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Released fragments were then separated by HPLC, using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a μRPC-C2/C18 (2.1 × 100 mm; particle size 3 μm and pore size 120 Å). Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile, 39.915% water (solvent B). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 200 μl/min using successively, a gradient 0–65% solvent B in 60 min, followed by a gradient 65–100% over 10 min. The sequence of purified CGA-derived peptides was determined in our laboratory by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473 A microsequencer. Samples (10–20 pmol) were loaded onto polybrene-treated and precycled glass fiber filters (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate analysis was performed using gas chromatography with a silicone OV 101 capillary column (0.32 mm × 25 m). Samples were analyzed after methanolysis (0.5 mhydrochloric acid-methanol for 24 h at 80 °C),N-reacetylation, and trimethylsilylation (39Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Clamp J.R.

Dot slots were performed using Bio-Dot SF microfiltration apparatus, and 1 nmol of glycoprotein was slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Fetuin was used as control. Desialylation of one-half of the dots was performed by treatment with 50 milliunits/ml sialidase from Clostridium perfringens in 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% CaCl2, 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 16 h at 37 °C prior incubation with the digoxigenin-labeled lectins. The different wells were incubated with each lectin dissolved in Tris-buffered saline: Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA-dig, 5 μg/ml), Arachis hypogaea agglutinin (PNA-dig, 2 μg/ml), and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA-dig, 2 μg/ml). Then, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-labeled Fab fragments (1 μg/ml). After washing, labeled glycoproteins were revealed by 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate staining. To isolate and characterize glycopeptides, we have performed LC/MS analysis of CGA-derived peptides obtained after endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of CGA. Then, CGA (500 pmol) was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with endoproteinase Lys-C at a protein-to-proteinase weight ratio of 1000:1 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Then, peptides were separated with an HPLC system (Applied Biosystems 140 A Solvent Delivery System) equipped with a UV detector (UV Waters Detector 386) on a Narrowbore Macherey Nagel Nucleosil 300–5C18 column (2 × 150 mm). Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (solvent B). Material was eluted at a flow rate of 250 μl/min using a gradient of 0–80% solvent B in solvent A over 80 min. A major part of the eluent (90%) was analyzed by UV detection and an aliquot (10%) was measured by LC-MS. The mass spectrometer was calibrated under conditions using a mixture of polyethylene glycols (average masses 400 and 2000 Da). Spectra were scanned overm/z 320–1800 for 6 s, and the total ion current was recorded. The mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a Brucker BIFLEXTMmatrix-assisted laser time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with the ScoutTM high resolution optics with X-Y multisample probe, a gridless reflector, and the HIMASTM linear detector. This instrument has a maximum accelerating potential of 30 kV and may be operated either in the linear or reflector mode. Ionization was accomplished with a 337-nm beam from a nitrogen laser with a repetition rate of 3 Hz. The output signal from the detector was digitized at a sampling rate of 250 MHz in linear mode and 500 MHz in reflector mode using a 1-GHz digital oscilloscope (Lecroy model). The instrument control and data processing were accomplished with software supplied by Brucker using a Sun Sparc workstation. These studies were realized according to the procedure previously described (22Strub J.M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol.

Sequence alignment of bovine CGA sequences with corresponding fragments of CGA from different species was performed using the Cameleon sequence alignment program using default parameters (41.Cameleon Sequence Analysis, Program V3.1, Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, UK.Google Scholar). Chromogranin sequences were retrieved from the Swiss-Prot data base. In this study, we have isolated a major fragment of human CGA corresponding predominantly to the domain CGA116–439 and a minor larger CGA-derived fragment CGA79–439, which are both excreted in urine of patients with carcinoid tumors (38Stridsberg M. Hellman U. Wilander E. Lundqvist G. Hellsing K. Oberg K. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine phosphorylation and O-glycosylation sites included within tumoral CGA, the large C-terminal fragment was digested by endoproteinase Lys-C and the generated fragments were separated by HPLC on a reverse phase C18 column (Fig.1 A). The different peaks of the chromatogram were directly submitted to automatic Edman degradation and mass spectra analysis to detect post-translational modifications. It is important to note that all the sequences determined in this study are in accordance with the primary structure proposed by Koneckiet al. (26Konecki D. Benedum U. Gerdes H. Huttner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in contrast, they diverge on 15 points (Fig.2) from the primary structure reported by Helman et al. (25Helman L. Ahn T.

Fragments resulting from endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of CGA79–439 were analyzed by LC-MS to detect areas containing O-glycosylated peptides (Fig. 1 B). The HPLC chromatogram (a), the single ion recording of specific ions characteristic of glycosylation sites (b), and the total ionic current of the chromatogram (c) are indicated. In b, the presence of glycans was recovered in peaks of regions I–IV (lineated in Fig. 1 A), and each area was analyzed to characterize the O-glycosylated sites. Area I included peaks corresponding to free saccharides, since areas II–IV contained glycopeptides. Sequencing of material included in the two major peaks (30Wiedenmann B. Huttner W.B. Virchows Archiv. B Cell Pathol. 1989; 58: 95-121Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 31Deftos L.J. Endocr.

MALDI-TOF MS analysis (negative mode) of peptide included in peak 31 reveals an experimental molecular mass of 2216 Da corresponding to the oxidized form of 124–144 (oxidation of Met140; calculated molecular mass 2200 Da). MALDI-TOF MS analysis of material included in peak 30 (Fig. 3 A) shows four different major molecular species with respective molecular masses of 3682, 3974, 4048, and 4264 Da (Table I), indicating the presence of several different glycans. By comparison with the expected molecular mass of CGA145–175 (3321 Da), the two molecular masses of 3682 and 3974 Da might be attributed to the O-glycosylated peptide CGA145–175 with the disaccharide Galβ1–3GalNAcα1, corresponding to the antigens T described previously as characteristic of human adenocarcinoids (42Springer G.F. Science. 1984; 224: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), and the trisaccharide NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα1 reported previously for bovine CGA (22Strub J.M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K.

In addition, the two other molecular masses of 4048 and 4264 Da are likely to correspond, respectively, to the O-glycosylated peptide CGA145–175 with two disaccharides Galβ1–3GalNAcα1 and the tetrasaccharide with an additional NeuAc linked in 2–6 on GalNAc (Fig. 3 A) as reported previously for fetuin (43Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5704-5717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain confirmation of the structure of these glycans, material included in peak 30 was slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose sheet and immunodetected with a panel of three lectins (MAA, SNA, and PNA), the specificity of which was reported previously (22Strub J.M.

Experimental data have shown unambiguously the simultaneous presence of the following linkages: Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O (PNA), NeuAcα2–3Galβ (MAA), and NeuAcα2–6GalNAc. Thus, our data revealed the presence of fourO-glycosylated moities on the peptide CGA145–175, including complete forms with a tri- or a tetrasaccharide and two truncated glycans corresponding to disaccharides (Fig. 3 A).Table IStructural characterization of human CGA-derived glyco- and phosphopeptides, generated after endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of human excreted CGA79–439Peak numberN-terminal sequenceExperimental molecular massLocationCalculated molecular massDaDa30AEGNNQAPGEEEEEEEEATNT3682145–17533213974145–1754048145–1754264145–17531SGEATDGARPQALPEPMQESK2216124–144220037EIRKGESRSEALAVDGAGKPGA3317246–2773240SGELEQEEERLSK1611304–316153450EEEEEEEEEAEAGEEAVPEEEGP4345210–24539834636210–2454928210–24563GLSAEPGWQAKREEEEEEEEEA5497198–24552646019198–2456212198–245Each fragment was sequenced, submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”), and located by comparison with the full CGA sequence (26Konecki D.

Human β-glucuronidase (HBG)1 is a lysosomal exoglycosidase that cleaves β-d-glucuronic acid residues from the nonreducing termini of glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid and is an essential enzyme for the normal restructuring and turnover of these extracellular matrix components (1Paigen K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1989; 37: 155-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These glycosaminoglycans are composed of alternating glucuronic acid and N-acetylglycosamine residues. The latter may be either N-acetylglucosamine orN-acetylgalactosamine and may be sulfated. Mutations in the β-glucuronidase gene result in the human lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type VII or Sly syndrome (2Shipley J.M. Klinkenberg B.M. Wu D.R. Bachinsky J.H. Sly W.S. Am.

This glycohydrolase is a homotetramer of 332,000 Da, the monomer consisting of 651 amino acids. It is a member of a sequence-related family of β-glycosidases (Family 2) that includes β-glucuronidases, β-galactosidases, and β-mannosidases (6Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar). Enzymes in this family hydrolyze their substrates with net retention of anomeric configuration, presumably via a double displacement mechanism involving the action of two active-site carboxylic acid residues (7Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). The first step involves nucleophilic attack by one of the carboxylates on the sugar anomeric center. General acid catalysis from the other carboxyl group aids in the departure of the aglycone to form an α-d-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. In the second step, the intermediate is hydrolyzed by general base-catalyzed attack of water at the anomeric center, resulting in cleavage of the glycosidic bond with net retention of the anomeric configuration. Formation and hydrolysis of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate proceed via transition states with substantial oxocarbenium ion character (Fig.1). The three-dimensional structure of HBG is one of two that have been solved for Family 2 β-glycosidases, the other being that ofEscherichia coli lacZ β-galactosidase (8Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.-J. Dubose R.F. Mathews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The two enzymes have a similar multidomain structure, each possessing a jelly roll barrel, an immunoglobulin constant domain, and a TIM barrel. The active sites, however, are significantly different since E. coli β-galactosidase is a metalloenzyme, binding Mg2+ at the active site. Removal of this metal ion reduces activity severely on most substrates. The role of this metal is unclear, one suggestion being that it acts as an electrophilic catalyst, interacting directly with the departing phenolate (7Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may function by correctly placing the acid/base catalyst. More important, HBG shows no metal ion dependence, and no metal ion is found in the x-ray crystal structure. In this case, it appears that Glu-451 functions as the acid/base catalyst. The equivalent residue in E. coli β-galactosidase (Glu-461) was previously suggested to play the role of the acid/base catalyst on the basis of affinity labeling studies and kinetic analyses of mutants (10Gebler J.C. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Richard J.P. Huber R.E. Lin S. Heo C. Amyes T.L.

Both residues are on the C-terminal side of a conserved asparagine that has been shown in other enzymes of Clan GH-A to hydrogen bond to the sugar 2-hydroxyl (14Sakon J. Adney W.S. Himmel M.E. Thomas S.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10648-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 28Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.-P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The catalytic nucleophile of E. coli β-galactosidase was identified as Glu-537 by trapping of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and sequencing of the labeled peptide. Based on the above information and amino acid sequence homology, Glu-540 has been suggested to be the catalytic nucleophile of HBG. However, another residue (Asp-207) has been proposed as an alternative candidate based upon its position in the active site (8Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, confirmation of the identity of this important residue is necessary. 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glycosyl fluorides have proven to be very useful reagents for the derivatization of active-site nucleophiles in a number of retaining β-glycosidases (15Withers S.G. Rupitz K. Street I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7929-7932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Miao S. McCarter J.D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10975-10978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These inactivators are mechanism-based as the C-2 fluorine destabilizes the transition states for both the glycosylation and deglycosylation steps, whereas the anomeric fluorine, a good leaving group, accelerates the first step, permitting the trapping of a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Proteolytic digestion of the labeled enzyme yields a mixture of peptides, one of which has the fluoro-sugar attached. Isolation of this peptide, followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis, permits identification of the nucleophile. This study presents evidence that HBG is a retaining glycosidase and describes the synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucuronyl fluoride (2-FGlcUAF) and its use in the identification of the enzyme's catalytic nucleophile.

To this was added SelectfluorTM (14.9 g, 42 mmol) portionwise, and then the reaction was stirred for 2 h at 70 °C. The bulk of the acetic anhydride was removed by evaporation, and the concentrated mixture was then diluted with 200 ml of water and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 150 ml). The organic phase was washed with water and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography (7:2 petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) yielded 3.1 g of compound 2 (23%) and 4.2 g of 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-mannopyranose (31%). The 1H NMR spectra were identical to those previously reported (19Csuk R. Glanzer B.I. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1988; 46: 73-177Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fluoride (4) was prepared by dissolving 3 g of tetraacetate (2) (8.6 mmol) in 45% HBr/glacial acetic acid (10 ml) and stirring at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was then diluted with water (200 ml) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 150 ml). The organic phase was washed with water and saturated sodium bicarbonate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting syrup was dissolved in 30 ml of HPLC-grade acetonitrile. To the solution was added silver fluoride (2.17 g, 17.1 mmol), and the suspension was allowed to stir overnight in the dark. The silver salts were then filtered off through a silica gel plug using ethyl acetate as the eluent, and the solvents were removed in vacuo. The syrup was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (30 ml), and then sodium methoxide (46 mg, 0.86 mmol) was added to the solution. After stirring at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction mixture was neutralized with Amberlite IR-120 (H+) resin and concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography (27:2:1 ethyl acetate/methanol/water) yielded 1.34 g (85%) of compound4. The 1H NMR spectrum was identical to that previously reported (19Csuk R. Glanzer B.I. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1988; 46: 73-177Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To a stirred solution of the 2-fluoroglucosyl fluoride (4) (19.5 mg, 0.106 mmol) in water (0.5 ml) was added sodium bromide (3.3 mg, 0.032 mmol) and TEMPO (0.5 mg, 0.0032 mmol). After cooling to 0 °C, 5.25% (v/v) bleach (3 ml, 2.1 mmol), already cooled to 0 °C, was added slowly, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h. It was then acidified with 1m HCl, and the water was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was suspended inN,N-dimethylformamide (1 ml). To this was added 2-bromoacetophenone (phenacyl bromide; 24.1 mg, 0.121 mmol), followed by triethylamine (16 μl, 0.115 mmol). After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the mixture was diluted with water (10 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 10 ml). The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography (3:1 ethyl acetate/petroleum ether) yielded 10.0 mg (33%) of compound 6 as a yellowish gum.1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.87–8.00 (2H, m, H-2′, H-6′), 7.66 (1H, tt, J = 1.6 Hz,J = 7.4 Hz, H-4′), 7.45–7.56 (2H, m, H-3′, H-5′), 5.90 (1H, d, J = 16.6 Hz, OCH-H), 5.40 (1H, ddd,J 1,2 = 6.2 Hz, J 1,F1 = 51.6 Hz, J 1,F2 = 4.4 Hz, H-1), 5.28 (1H, d,J = 16.6 Hz, OCH-H), 4.48 (1H, dddd,J 2,1 = 6.2 Hz, J 2,F1 = 12.2 Hz, J 2,3 = 8.1 Hz,J 2,F2 = 50.6 Hz, H-2), 4.20 (1H, d,J 5,4 = 9.3 Hz, H-5), and 3.86–4.05 (2H, m);19F NMR (188 MHz, CDCl3) δ −64.93 (1F, dt,J F,1 = 51.6 Hz, J F,2 = 12.2 Hz, F-1) and −126.42 (1F, dt, J F,2 = 50.6 Hz, J F,1 = 4.4 Hz, F-2). 10.0 mg of ester (6) was dissolved in methanol/water (4:1). To the solution was added a spatula tip full of 10% palladium on charcoal, and the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 6 h under an atmosphere of hydrogen. The catalyst was removed via filtration through Celite 545, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography (27:2:1 ethyl acetate/methanol/water) yielded 5.5 mg (87%) of compound 7.1H NMR (200 MHz, D2O) δ 5.46 (1H, ddd,J 1,2 = 7.0 Hz, J 1,F1 = 52.9 Hz, J 1,F2 = 3.4 Hz, H-1), 4.33 (1H, dddd, J 2,1 = 7.0 Hz,J 2,F1 = 13.7 Hz, J 2, 3 = 8.9 Hz, J 2,F2 = 51.5 Hz, H-2), 3.81 (1H, d,J 5,4 = 9.5 Hz, H-5), 3.80 (1H, dt,J 3,2 = 8.9 Hz, J 3,4 = 9.5 Hz, J 3,F2 = 15.9 Hz, H-3), and 3.81 (1H, t,J 4,3 = J 4,5 = 9.5 Hz, H-4); 19F NMR (188 MHz, D2O) δ −67.84 (1F, dt, J F,1 = 52.9 Hz, J F,2= 13.7 Hz, F-1) and −126.42 (1F, dt, J F,2 = 51.5 Hz, J F,1 = 3.4 Hz, F-2). High resolution liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (M − H)−: calculated, 197.0259; found, 197.0257. The buffer used in this experiment was 100 mm acetate solution, pH 4.8, in D2O (buffer A), prepared by adjusting the pH of a 100 mm solution of sodium acetate in D2O with a 100 mm solution of acetic acid in D2O. The 1H NMR spectrum of a sample of 1.1 mg (3.3 μmol) of p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucuronide (pNPGlcUA) in 400 μl of buffer A was recorded on a Brüker AC-200 spectrometer, and then HBG (200 μl, 0.95 mg/ml), previously exchanged with buffer A using 30-kDa nominal molecular mass cutoff centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Centricon-30), was added. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at different time intervals. Kinetic studies were performed at 37 °C. All studies on human β-glucuronidase were performed in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8 (buffer B). A continuous spectrophotometric assay based on the hydrolysis of pNPGlcUA was used to monitor enzyme activity by measurement of the rate ofp-nitrophenolate release upon hydrolysis (λ = 360 nm, ε = 2.25 × 103m−1cm−1 in buffer B) using a Unicam 8700 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a circulating water bath. Michaelis-Menten parameters for the substrate, previously undetermined with this enzyme, were K m = 1.56 mm andk cat = 250 min−1 at 37 °C in buffer B. The inactivation of human β-glucuronidase by 2-FGlcUAF was monitored by incubation of the enzyme (∼0.2 mg/ml) under the above conditions in the presence of various concentrations of 2-FGlcUAF at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl. Residual enzyme activity was determined at the appropriate time intervals by addition of a 10-μl aliquot of the inactivation mixture to a solution of pNPGlcUA (1 mm, 700 μl) in buffer A and measurement of p-nitrophenolate release over a period of 1 min. Pseudo first-order inactivation rate constants at each inactivator concentration (k obs) were determined by fitting each curve to a first-order equation using the program GraFit (27Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 3.03. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar). The value of k i/K i, assuming inactivation according to the kinetic model shown, was determined from the slope of a plot of k obsagainst inactivator concentration in the range where [I] ≪K i: k obs =k i[I]/(K i + [I]). Binding of 2-FGlcUAF at the active site was proven by demonstrating protection against inactivation by a competitive inhibitor. Inactivation mixtures (100 μl) containing 0.47 mg/ml enzyme and 150 μm2-FGlcUAF were incubated in buffer B at 37 °C in the presence and absence of d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (0.68 μm; K i = 0.23 μm). Because the lactone was found to bind to HBG slowly, preincubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor for a period of 1 h was necessary. At several time intervals, residual activity of the inactivation mixtures was determined. For samples containing no protecting ligand, aliquots (5 μl) were removed and assayed immediately. In the presence of protecting ligand, aliquots (1 μl) were removed, diluted into substrate, and assayed after a delay of 5 min (this delay allowed for the release of any protecting ligand still bound to HBG). The assays were performed as described above. The 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucuronyl-enzyme was generated by incubating HBG in the presence of 6 mm 2-FGlcUAF in buffer B at 37 °C for 10 min. The trapped intermediate (100 μl, 13.5 mg/ml) was freed of excess inactivator by concentration of the inactivated enzyme using 30-kDa nominal molecular mass cutoff centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Centricon-30), followed by dilution of the concentrated enzyme stock (100–200 μl) with buffer B to a final volume of 2000 μl. 4-Fold repetition of the process ensured a >99% reduction in the free 2-FGlcUAF concentration. Aliquots (30 μl) of the inactivated enzyme, freed from 2-FGlcUAF, were then incubated at 37 °C in buffer B alone, with 50 mmchitobiose, or with 50 mm N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Reactivation was monitored by removing aliquots (1 μl) at several time intervals and assaying for activity as described above. Approximately 50–75% of the activity was recovered relative to a control of native enzyme treated in an identical manner. β-Glucuronidase (30 μl, 3.7 mg/ml) was incubated with 2-FGlcUAF (4 μl, 50 mm) at 37 °C for 10 min in buffer B; complete inactivation (>99%) was confirmed by enzyme assay as described above. This mixture was immediately subjected to peptic digestion: β-glucuronidase (10 μl of native or 34 μl of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucuronyl-enzyme, 3.7 mg/ml) was mixed with pepsin (10 or 34 μl, respectively; 0.4 mg/ml in 300 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.0) and 300 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.0 (10 or 34 μl, respectively). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, frozen, and analyzed immediately by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) upon thawing. Mass spectra were recorded on a PE-Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an Ionspray ion source. Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on an Ultrafast Microprotein analyzer (Michrom BioResources Inc., Pleasanton, CA) directly interfaced with the mass spectrometer. In each of the MS experiments, the proteolytic digest was loaded onto a C18column (Reliasil, 1 × 150 mm) equilibrated with solvent A (solvent A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 2% acetonitrile in water). Elution of the peptides was accomplished using a gradient (0–60%) of solvent B over 60 min, followed by 100% solvent B over 2 min (solvent B: 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile in water). Solvents were pumped at a constant flow rate of 50 μl/min. Spectra were obtained in the single quadrupole scan mode (LC/MS) or the tandem MS product ion scan mode. In the single quadrupole mode (LC/MS), the quadrupole mass analyzer was scanned over a m/z range of 400–1800 Da with a step size of 0.5 Da and a dwell time of 1.5 ms/step. The ion source voltage was set at 5.5 kV, and the orifice energy was 45 V. In the tandem MS daughter ion scan mode, the spectrum was obtained by selectively introducing the parent ion (m/z= 935) from the first quadrupole (Q1) into the collision cell (Q2) and observing the product ions in the third quadrupole (Q3). Thus, Q1 was locked on m/z = 935; the Q3 scan range was 50–1120 Da; the step size was 0.5 Da; the dwell time was 1 ms; the ion source voltage was 5 kV; the orifice energy was 45 V; Q0 = −10 V; and IQ2 = −48 V. The use of proton NMR in the determination of the stereochemical course of enzyme-catalyzed glycoside hydrolyses has been demonstrated previously (20Gebler J. Gilkes N.R. Claeyssens M. Wilson D.B. Béguin P. Wakarchuk W.W. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12559-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Howard S. Braun C. McCarter J. Moremen K.W. Liao Y.-F. Withers S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts and coupling constants of the anomeric protons of α- and β-glycosides and the product hemiacetals are distinct and readily observed. When sufficient enzyme is used to complete the hydrolysis quickly (typically <2 min), the initially formed anomer is detected before mutarotation has occurred to any significant extent. Fig.2 illustrates the experiment performed using HBG. Fig. 2 A shows the anomeric proton region of pNPGlcUA in buffer A. The multiplet centered at δ 5.18–5.28 ppm arises from the axial anomeric proton of the β-glycoside substrate, and the large resonance at δ 4.7 ppm is from HOD. Panels B–D were recorded at time intervals after addition of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the enzymatic hydrolysis was essentially complete after 1.5 min since the resonance at δ 5.18–5.28 ppm had almost disappeared. Simultaneously, a new resonance appeared at δ 4.58 ppm (J = 7.9 Hz). The chemical shift and coupling constant identify this as the axial anomeric proton of β-d-glucuronic acid. After 4 min, a new doublet appeared at δ 5.18 ppm (J = 3.6 Hz) (Fig.2 C). This corresponds to the equatorial anomeric proton of α-d-glucuronic acid resulting from mutarotation of the initial β-d-glucuronic acid product. After 20 min, the product d-glucuronic acid converted via mutarotation to the equilibrium ratio of anomers (34:66 α/β) (Fig. 2 D). The data unequivocally demonstrate that hydrolysis catalyzed by HBG proceeds with net retention of anomeric configuration, presumably via a double displacement mechanism. The synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucuronyl fluoride is outlined in Fig. 3. The key steps involved the use of SelectfluorTM to introduce fluorine at C-2 and the use of TEMPO in the selective oxidation of the C-6 alcohol to the carboxylic acid. SelectfluorTM is an electrophilic fluorinating agent that is both stable and easy to use (22Lal G.S. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 2791-2796Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It reacts with olefins in the presence of a weak nucleophile such as water or acetic acid to yield the addition product, and it has previously been shown to react with glycals to yield a variety of 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosides (23Burkart M.D. Zhang Z. Hung S.-C. Wong C.-H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11743-11746Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In particular, tri-O-acetyl-d-glucal was shown to react with SelectfluorTM inN,N-dimethylformamide/water to give predominantly the manno-epimer. We found that by changing the solvent/nucleophile system to acetic anhydride/acetic acid thegluco-epimer was obtained in satisfactory quantities, albeit at lower yield relative to the manno-epimer (2:3gluco/manno; 23 and 32%, respectively). Fortunately, separation of the gluco- andmanno-products is readily achieved by silica gel chromatography, and the gluco-epimer was converted to 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride by a series of steps involving bromination, fluoride displacement, and deprotection. Glucopyranosyluronic acid was obtained via TEMPO-mediated oxidation of the C-6 alcohol of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride in water buffered at pH 10 with hypobromite (formed by the reaction of hypochlorite and bromide) as the regenerating oxidant (24Györgydeák Z. Thiem J. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 268: 85-92Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25de Nooy A.E.J. Besemer A.C. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 8023-8032Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 26Heeres A. van Doren H.A. Gotlieb K.F. Bleeker I.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 299: 221-227Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This reaction is both mild and selective for the primary C-6 alcohol. To facilitate purification of the product away from the inorganic salts present, the uronic acid was first converted to its phenacyl ester and then purified chromatographically. The choice of the phenacyl ester was based upon the need for a protecting group that can be easily removed under mild conditions, i.e. non-acidic and non-basic conditions. This particular ester is easily cleaved via catalytic hydrogenolysis. Incubation of HBG with 2-FGlcUAF resulted in inactivation of the enzyme in a time-dependent manner according to pseudo first-order kinetics (Fig. 4 A). However, no saturation was observed, even at the highest inactivator concentrations studied (Fig. 4 B); yet higher concentrations could not be investigated due to the rapidity of inactivation, which precluded accurate sampling. Reliable values for the inactivation rate constant (k i) or the reversible dissociation constant (K i) therefore could not be determined. However, a reliable second-order rate constant ofk i /K i = 286 min−1m−1 was calculated for the slope of the plot of k obs versus [2-FGlcUAF]. Incubation of the enzyme with 2-FGlcUAF (150 μm) in the presence of the competitive inhibitor d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (1) (0.68 μm) resulted in a two-phase reaction (Fig. 4 C). The initial inactivation rate constant was calculated to be 0.054 min−1, nearly identical to the apparent inactivation rate constant of 0.057 min−1 obtained in the absence of the lactone. The final inactivation rate constant was calculated to be 0.019 min−1. This observed protection from inactivation in the presence of the lactone is consistent with 2-FGlcUAF being active site-directed. These results suggest that inactivation is a consequence of accumulation of a stable covalent 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucuronyl-enzyme intermediate, a conclusion that is supported by the mass spectral analysis of the inactivated enzyme. Further evidence supporting the existence of a covalent 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucuronyl-enzyme arises from demonstration of the catalytic competence of the trapped intermediate. Following removal of excess inactivator from the labeled enzyme, the sample was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of buffer B alone, with 50 mm chitobiose, or with 50 mm N-acetylglucosamine, and the recovery of activity associated with the regeneration of the free enzyme was monitored. Reactivation kinetics of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucuronyl-enzyme in buffer alone followed a first-order process with an apparent rate constant of k re = 0.0040 h−1(t 12 = 250 h) (Fig.5). Rate constants for reactivation by transglycosylation (k trans) were found to be 0.0033 h−1 (t 12 = 303 h) withN-acetylglucosamine and 0.0072 h−1(t 12 = 139 h) with chitobiose. The higher enzyme reactivation rate observed in the presence of chitobiose (2-fold higher than the spontaneous reactivation rate) suggests that reactivation is accelerated by transglycosylation to an acceptor sugar. That chitobiose functions as a transglycosylation acceptor is not surprising since the natural substrates of HBG are the glycosaminoglycans, oligosaccharides composed of alternating glucuronic acid and N-acetylglycosamine residues, and chitobiose is a GlcNAc(β1–4)GlcNAc disaccharide. Peptic hydrolysis of native HBG or the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucuronyl-enzyme resulted in a mixture of peptides, which were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using the electrospray MS as detector. When scanned in the normal LC/MS mode, the total ion chromatograms showed a large number of peaks, each corresponding to one or more peptides in the digest mixture (Fig.6, A and C). The masses under each peak in the labeled sample were compared with the masses of the corresponding peptides in the native sample, searching for a peptide present only in the labeled sample that was 178 Da greater than a peptide present only in the unlabeled sample. Only one pair of peaks satisfied this requirement of difference in mass by that of the attached label, these being a peak at m/z756 in the native digest that was not observed in the labeled digest (Fig. 6B) and a peak at m/z 934 in the labeled digest that was not observed in that of the native enzyme (Fig.6 D). The mass difference between these two peaks is 178 Da, which corresponds exactly to the mass of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucuronyl label. The labeled parent ion (m/z 934) and the unlabeled intact peptide (m/z 756) thus appear as singly charged species. Candidate peptides with a mass of 756 ± 2 Da were then identified by inspection of the amino acid sequence of the enzyme and searching for all possible peptides with this mass. Twenty such peptides were identified, but of these, all but five were eliminated because their sequences did not contain either an aspartate or a glutamate residue. Precedent with all retaining glycosidases to date would predict that the nucleophile should be one of these two amino acids. The candidate peptides are 257KLEVRL262,60EEQWY64,318DFYTLP323,484NSNYAAD490, and539SEYGAET545. The peptide was then unambiguously identified by peptide sequencing using tandem MS. Information on the sequence was obtained by additional fragmentation of the peptide of interest (m/z 934) in the daughter ion scan mode (Fig.7). The parent ion of interest (m/z 934) was selected in the first quadrupole and subjected to collision-induced fragmentation, and then the masses of the daughter ions were detected in the third quadrupole. Peaks resulting from Y′′ ions correspond to fragments ET (m/z 249), AET (m/z 320), GAET (m/z 378), YGAET (m/z540), and EYGAET (m/z 669). Peaks arising from B ions bearing the label include SE (m/z 395), SEY (m/z 558), SEYG (m/z 616), SEYGA (m/z 687), and SEYGAE (m/z 816). Because the B ions bearing the label include SE (m/z 395), we can infer that the label is linked to either Ser-539 or Glu-540. This information, in conjunction with the mass of the labeled peptide and the primary sequence of the enzyme, permits identification of the peptide containing the active-site nucleophile as539SEYGAET545. Comparison of this sequence with those of the other Family 2 glycosidase sequences shows that the dipeptide EY is conserved throughout the known family members (TableI). However, the amino acids around this dipeptide are conserved only within a particular glycosidase category,i.e. galactosidase versus glucuronidaseversus mannosidase. From this, we can assign Glu-540 as the catalytic nucleophile.Table IConserved active-site residues of Family 2 glycosidasesGroupSequenceSpeciesGalactosidases507PRIICEYAHAME. coli α-subunit520PYISCEYMHSMClostridium acetobutylicum532PLILCEYAHAME. coli539PLILCEYAHAMKlebsiella pneumoniae546PLILCEYGHAMKluyveromyces lactis526PFISVEYAHAMLactobacillus delbrueckii529PFLNCEYMHDMLeuconostoc lactis640PYISCEYMHTMStreptococcus thermophilus457PYLVTEYNGHMThermoanaerobacter thermosulfurogenesGlucuronidases534PIIQSEYGAETCanis familiaris499PIIITEYGVDTE. coli535PIIQSEYGAETHomo sapiens531PIIQSEYGADAMus musculus531PIIQSEYGADARattus norvegicusMannosidases549ARFVSEYGYQSBos taurus549ARFVSEYGYQSCapra hircus549ARFASEYGYQSH. sapiens554PRCASEYGVQSCaenorhabditis elegansThe enzymes are grouped according to substrate specificity. Open table in a new tab The enzymes are grouped according to substrate specificity. Doubts have been expressed previously concerning the identity of the catalytic nucleophile of HBG. In particular, on the basis of the three-dimensional crystal structure, it had been suggested that Asp-207 might well serve in this role (8Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fact that E. coli β-galactosidase is a metalloenzyme, requiring a Mg2+ bound at the active site for catalytic activity, whereas HBG has no such requirement, causes concerns about parallels drawn between the two enzymes' active sites. These are further heightened by the fact that HBG cleaves a substrate containing a carboxylic acid, thus a different active-site composition may be required to accommodate this additional charge. However, the assignment of Glu-540 as the catalytic nucleophile of HBG removes any ambiguity concerning the identity of this residue and is completely consistent with expectations on the basis of sequence similarity (6Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar)."

To evaluate the regulation of human (h) GHS-R gene expression, we cloned the hGHS-R gene containing the 5′-flanking region of 0.6–2.9 kilobase pairs. Analysis of the hGHS-R transcripts with 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends suggested that the putative transcription initiation site was approximately −453 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation site (+1). There is no typical TATA, CAAT, or GC box but an initiator-like sequence and putative binding sites for several transcription factors around the putative transcription start site. The 5′-flanking region inserted into a luciferase reporter vector had promoter activity in GH3 cells but had activity indistinguishable from background in HeLa or EP1 cells. The hGHS-R promoter activity in GH3 cells increased by deletion of nucleotides from −1224 to −734, whereas it was decreased by further deletion from −734 to −608.

As there is a TdT-Inr family-like element that overlaps with the putative transcription start site, initiator binding protein other than TATA-binding protein may be a rate-limiting factor for the hGHS-R gene transcription initiation.In addition to the Inr-like sequence, there are several putative sites for binding transcription factors as shown in Fig. 2. Of particular interest is the presence of consensus sequences for the POU-domain transcription factors, Pit-1, Oct-1, and Ptx1, which have been shown to be involved in pituitary-specific expression (25Bonder M. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 50: 267-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 26Elsholtz H.P. Albert V.R. Treacy M.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

The octamer binding protein Oct-1 is expressed ubiquitously and activates certain eukaryotic TATA-less promoters (26Elsholtz H.P. Albert V.R. Treacy M.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ptx1 is expressed in all pituitary cell types and is essential for transcription of the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene and Lim3/hk3 and activates transcription of the GH or PRL gene in synergy with Pit-1 in somatolactotrophs, the LHβ gene with SF-1 in gonadotrophs (27Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the POMC gene with NeuroD1, one of bHLH factors, in corticotrophs (28Poulin G. Turgeon B. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6673-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putative binding sites for several transcription factors, such as bHLH factors and AP2, were also identified on the hGHS-R gene, some of which may be responsible for the basal activity of the hGHS-R gene promoter. The presence of multiple putative sites for AP2 binding suggests their involvement in mediating transcriptional activation by phorbol esters and cAMP (29Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). There were no GH response elements such as the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5, cis-inducible elements, or serum-response elements. The reported inhibition of rat GHS-R mRNA expression in the hypothalamus by GH (9Bennett P.A. Thomas G.B. Howard A.D. Feighner S.D. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Smith R.G. Robinson I.C.A.F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4552-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) may be caused by an indirect action of GH.The promoter activity of the hGHS-R 5′-flanking region was assessed after insertion upstream of the luciferase coding sequence in the pGL3-Basic vector. The activity of the GHS-R promoter was detected in GH3 cells but not in HeLa human epithelioid carcinoma of cervix cells and EP1 human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that this DNA fragment is necessary and sufficient to drive expression of a heterologous gene in GH3. This finding is consistent with the recent report demonstrating the expression of GHS-R mRNA in GH3 cells (8Adams E.F. Huang B. Buchfelder M. Howard A. Smith R.G. Feighner S.D. Van der Pleog L.H.T. Bowers C.Y. Fahlbush R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 638-642PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion studies allowed us to define positive regulatory elements for the basal promoter activity located between −734 and −608, where there are putative binding sites for Pit-1, PEA-3, AP2, and Ptx1. However, the small decrease of promoter activity by deleting from −734 to −669, where two Pit-1 binding like elements located, did not support strong Pit-1 dependence. Furthermore, deletion of the upstream fragments from −1224 to −734 led to a significant increase in the promoter activity, suggesting that this region works as a negative regulatory element such as a repressor in the hGHS-R gene. Further study is required to determine which transcription factors play a key role in the hGHS-R gene transcription.In summary, the 5′-flanking region of the hGHS-R gene contains a TATA-less promoter with cell-specific activity and putative binding sites for several transcription factors in the regions required for the basal activity. These initial characterizations should facilitate further study of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of the hGHS-R gene expression in human health and disease. Growth hormone (GH)1 secretion is regulated mainly by the hypothalamic stimulatory factor, GH-releasing hormone, and the inhibitory factor, somatostatin. On the other hand, GH secretagogues have been developed as a small synthetic peptide, GH-releasing peptide (1Momany F.A. Bowers C.Y. Reynolds G.A. Hong A. Newlander K.

As there is a TdT-Inr family-like element that overlaps with the putative transcription start site, initiator binding protein other than TATA-binding protein may be a rate-limiting factor for the hGHS-R gene transcription initiation.In addition to the Inr-like sequence, there are several putative sites for binding transcription factors as shown in Fig. 2. Of particular interest is the presence of consensus sequences for the POU-domain transcription factors, Pit-1, Oct-1, and Ptx1, which have been shown to be involved in pituitary-specific expression (25Bonder M. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 50: 267-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 26Elsholtz H.P. Albert V.R. Treacy M.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

The octamer binding protein Oct-1 is expressed ubiquitously and activates certain eukaryotic TATA-less promoters (26Elsholtz H.P. Albert V.R. Treacy M.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ptx1 is expressed in all pituitary cell types and is essential for transcription of the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene and Lim3/hk3 and activates transcription of the GH or PRL gene in synergy with Pit-1 in somatolactotrophs, the LHβ gene with SF-1 in gonadotrophs (27Tremblay J.J. Lanctot C. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 428-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the POMC gene with NeuroD1, one of bHLH factors, in corticotrophs (28Poulin G. Turgeon B. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6673-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putative binding sites for several transcription factors, such as bHLH factors and AP2, were also identified on the hGHS-R gene, some of which may be responsible for the basal activity of the hGHS-R gene promoter. The presence of multiple putative sites for AP2 binding suggests their involvement in mediating transcriptional activation by phorbol esters and cAMP (29Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). There were no GH response elements such as the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5, cis-inducible elements, or serum-response elements. The reported inhibition of rat GHS-R mRNA expression in the hypothalamus by GH (9Bennett P.A. Thomas G.B. Howard A.D. Feighner S.D. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Smith R.G. Robinson I.C.A.F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4552-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) may be caused by an indirect action of GH.The promoter activity of the hGHS-R 5′-flanking region was assessed after insertion upstream of the luciferase coding sequence in the pGL3-Basic vector. The activity of the GHS-R promoter was detected in GH3 cells but not in HeLa human epithelioid carcinoma of cervix cells and EP1 human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that this DNA fragment is necessary and sufficient to drive expression of a heterologous gene in GH3. This finding is consistent with the recent report demonstrating the expression of GHS-R mRNA in GH3 cells (8Adams E.F. Huang B. Buchfelder M. Howard A. Smith R.G. Feighner S.D. Van der Pleog L.H.T. Bowers C.Y. Fahlbush R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 638-642PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion studies allowed us to define positive regulatory elements for the basal promoter activity located between −734 and −608, where there are putative binding sites for Pit-1, PEA-3, AP2, and Ptx1. However, the small decrease of promoter activity by deleting from −734 to −669, where two Pit-1 binding like elements located, did not support strong Pit-1 dependence. Furthermore, deletion of the upstream fragments from −1224 to −734 led to a significant increase in the promoter activity, suggesting that this region works as a negative regulatory element such as a repressor in the hGHS-R gene. Further study is required to determine which transcription factors play a key role in the hGHS-R gene transcription.In summary, the 5′-flanking region of the hGHS-R gene contains a TATA-less promoter with cell-specific activity and putative binding sites for several transcription factors in the regions required for the basal activity. These initial characterizations should facilitate further study of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of the hGHS-R gene expression in human health and disease. The present study is the first report of a cloning and characterization of a human genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the hGHS-R gene. When the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the hGHS-R gene was compared with the upstream sequence of the hGHS-R cDNA, a single exon upstream of the coding exon was identified as shown for other human G protein-coupled receptor genes such as those for the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine, adrenocorticotropin, endothelin-A, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (11Peralta E.

The direct sequencing of the 5′-RACE products suggests that the major 5′-end of the hGHS-R cDNA is −453 bp relative to the translation initiation site. However, we obtained at least 13 RACE products with different 5′-termini. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the hGHS-R gene has multiple initiation sites like other G protein-coupled receptors such as those for the dopamine D4 (15Kamakura S. Iwaki A.

Sequence analysis of the 5′-untranslated flanking region of the hGHS-R gene indicated that the region upstream of the putative transcriptional start site does not have any of the typical characteristics of promoter regions such as a TATA box, CAAT box, or the GC-rich region.

The Jak2 tyrosine kinase was previously shown to bind to the EpoR, to be activated upon Epo stimulation, and to play a critical role in Epo-induced proliferation. However, little is known about the role of other tyrosine kinases in Epo signaling. In this paper, we examined whether Syk was involved in EpoR activation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the phosphorylated EpoR was associated with the Syk kinase in activated UT7 cells. The interaction of Epo with its receptor led to an increased kinase activity. The use of recombinant Syk Src homology 2 (SH2) domains expressed in tandem or individually revealed that both N- and C-SH2 domains of Syk participated in EpoR binding with a major contribution of the C-terminal SH2 domain. Far Western blotting further indicated that Syk directly binds to the EpoR and that the interaction of Syk with EpoR only occurred after Epo activation. These data suggest that phosphorylation of EpoR on tyrosine residues may mediate Syk binding to the receptor through interaction between the two SH2 domains of Syk and tyrosines of the receptor.

However, Jak2 may not be the only tyrosine kinase involved in Epo activation. Truncated receptor mutants, which still activate Jak2, have lost the ability to induce the phosphorylation of most tyrosine kinase substrates (17Gobert S. Duprez V. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting the implication of one or more tyrosine kinase(s) in addition to Jak2. Several other tyrosine kinases have been shown to associate and/or be activated by EpoR or cytokine receptors, but their role in signaling is still largely unknown. The tyrosine kinase c-Fes has been reported to be tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by Epo in the TF-1 erythroleukemia cell line (18Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1993; 81: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn associates with and activates the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor (19Corey S.J.

Lyn has also been shown to associate with EpoR and to be essential for erythropoietin-induced differentiation of JE2 erythroid cells (20Tilbroook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of the β-subunit of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor associates with and activates another Src kinase, p56lck, and interaction occurs within the acidic region (“A region”) of the β-chain (21Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). However, IL-2-mediated proliferation involves the serine-rich region (“S region”) of the β-chain, which has also been shown to associate with Syk protein tyrosine kinase (22Minami Y. Nakagawa Y. Kawahara A. Miyazaki T. Sada K. Yamamura H. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Antibody cross-linking of a transmembrane chimera protein bearing CD16 in its extracellular domain and Syk in its cytoplasmic domain results in c-myc gene induction, an event critical for cell proliferation (22Minami Y.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which suggests that Syk may be an important component of IL-2 signaling. Syk also associates with the G-CSF receptor and is activated upon activation of this receptor (19Corey S.J. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Geahlen R.L. Tkatch L.S. Tweardy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Simon H.-U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). So far, the involvement of Syk kinase in EpoR activation has not been investigated. The Syk family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases comprises two known members, Zap-70 and Syk. Syk is a 72-kDa cytoplasmic protein expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells (24Law C.-L.

Syk activation depends on an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM), made of two YXX(L/I) cassettes separated by 6–8 amino acids and present in intracytoplasmic tails of receptor subunits (34Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Receptor stimulation allows the rapid phosphorylation of an ITAM motif, which constitutes a binding site for the two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk (35Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). This event is seemingly mediated by members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Subsequently Syk is autophosphorylated (36Rowley R.B. Burkhardt A.L. Chao H.-G. Matsueda G.R. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11590-11594Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and/or phosphorylated by Src kinases (37Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J.

In the present study, we examined whether the Syk tyrosine kinase was involved in Epo signaling in the UT7 cell line. We show that following Epo activation, Syk and the EpoR are directly associated through the region of Syk that includes the two SH2 domains and that both N-SH2 and C-SH2 participate in EpoR binding with a major contribution of C-SH2. Furthermore, we show that Epo increases the intrinsic activity of Syk kinase. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk antibody LR and monoclonal anti-Syk antibody 4D10 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies 4G10 and PY72 were, respectively, gifts of B. Drucker (Portland, OR) and B. Sefton (La Jolla, Ca). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-EpoR antiserum was produced against a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the cytoplasmic portion of human EpoR. Anti-GST antiserum was produced against purified recombinant GST. Purified recombinant human Epo (specific activity of 120,000 units/mg) was a gift of Dr. M. Brandt (Boehringer Mannheim). A cDNA fragment encoding rat Syk residues 1–260 including the tandem N and C SH2 was isolated by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified fragments were cloned into the pGEX-2TK expression vector and sequenced. Constructs encoding human Syk residues 1–265 (N + C)-SH2, 1–117 (N)-SH2 and 163–265 (C)-SH2 in the pGEX-2TK expression vector were a generous gift of Dr. Brugge (Boston, MA). The GST fusion proteins were purified by batch absorption on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard procedures. The GST-HS1 fusion protein, which serves as a specific substrate for Syk was constructed by joining a BamHI–EcoRI polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the HS1 peptide motif (EQEDEPEGDYEEVLE-Stop) in frame to GST into the polylinker of the pGEX-2TK vector. The human leukemic cell line UT7 (39Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Miwa A. Ishihara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y. Suda T. Miura Y.

MO7E-ER cell line corresponds to the MO7E cell line (40Avanzi G.C. Lista P. Giovinazzo B. Miniero R. Saglio G. Benetton G. Coda R. Cattoretti G. Pegoraro L. Br. J. Hematol. 1988; 69: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) infected with an amphotropic virus encoding a murine EpoR and was cultured in the same medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Before stimulation, cells were deprived of growth factor by washing in phosphate-buffered saline and by incubating overnight in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml transferrin, penicillin, and streptomycin. For stimulation, cells were centrifuged and incubated (1 × 107/ml) at 37 °C in deprivation medium with or without addition of Epo. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Epo was iodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce), as described previously (41Mayeux P. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Tambourin P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with specific radioactivities ranging from 30 to 60 × 106 cpm/μg. Epo was biotinylated according to Wojchowski et al. (42Wojchowski D.M. Caslake L. Blood. 1989; 74: 952-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epo binding experiments were performed as described previously (43Hermine O. Dubart A. Porteux F. Mayeux P. Titeux M. Dumenil D. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1996; 87: 1746-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Mayeux P. Billat C. Jacquot R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13985-13990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were deprived of growth factor (see above) to ensure optimal expression of surface EpoR. Cells (2 × 107/ml) were incubated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin for 6 min at 37 °C with 1 nm125I-Epo and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Epo. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μm Na3VO4 and lysed (2 × 107cells/ml) on ice in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 1% Brij 96 (or 1% Nonidet P-40), 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin (lysis buffer). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with 2 μg/ml (unless stated otherwise) polyclonal anti-Syk or anti-EpoR antiserum (1:250) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Brij 96 (or 0.1% Nonidet P-40), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. For GST precipitation, lysates were incubated with 5 μg of GST fusion protein prebound to 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads for 90 min at 4 °C with rotation. Then beads were collected and processed as described above for immunoprecipitation. Precipitates were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For in vitro kinase assay, immunoprecipitates were washed an additional time with 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4 and incubated in 60 μl of 5 mm Hepes, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), 10 μm ATP plus 10 μg of GST-HS1 peptide for 5 min at 23 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 4× sample buffer and 40 mm EDTA. The samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected by autoradiography after gel treatment with 1n KOH at 55 °C to reduce the levels of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Quantification was done using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Software. Immunoblots were carried out as described previously (9Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with a mixture of 4G10 (0.3 μg/ml) and PY72 (1 μg/ml) or with anti-Syk antibodies (0.3 μg/ml polyclonal, 0.03 μg/ml monoclonal). Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as detailed by the manufacturer. For Far Western blotting, GST fusion proteins were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads with a buffer composed of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mmreduced glutathione, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred. The membrane was first incubated 3 h at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of GST fusion protein followed by detection with anti-GST immunoblotting. We used the UT7 cell line to examine whether Syk associates with the EpoR. UT7 cells were stimulated for various times at 37 °C with 10 units/ml Epo, and Syk was immunoprecipitated. Similar amounts of Syk protein were detected in such conditions in unstimulated and stimulated cells (Fig. 1 A,right part); a control antibody did not precipitate Syk protein (data not shown). Following Epo stimulation, EpoR is transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated reaching an optimum a few minutes after stimulation (9Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since anti-EpoR are poorly reactive in immunoblot analysis (45Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), 2V. Duprez, U. Blank, S. Chrétien, S. Gisselbrecht, and P. Mayeux, unpublished results. and since phosphorylated EpoR migrates at a position very similar to Syk in SDS-PAGE (72 kDa), the two proteins cannot easily be distinguished. To identify EpoR in anti-Syk immunoprecipitates, we therefore took advantage of the fact that EpoR can be detected as a phosphorylated species following immunoprecipitation with anti-EpoR antibodies in stimulated cells and anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. Thus, to assess the presence of activated EpoR in Syk precipitates, immune complexes were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS, and EpoR was further immunoprecipitated. Affinity-isolated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. A 72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein corresponding to the EpoR was clearly detected in Epo-stimulated cells, with a maximum 2–5 min after stimulation (Fig. 1 A, left part). Reprobing the blot with anti-Syk antibodies did not allow the detection of Syk in the second anti-EpoR immunoprecipitation, showing that the association of Syk with the EpoR was disrupted by the denaturation step. Also, when control antibodies were used in the first immunoprecipitation, no 72-kDa phosphorylated protein was precipitated with anti-EpoR antibodies in the second immunoprecipitation (data not shown). We conclude that the 72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, coprecipitated with Syk and reimmunoprecipitated with anti-EpoR in the second immunoprecipitation, is the activated EpoR. The association of Syk tyrosine kinase with the activated EpoR can also be shown directly following stimulation of UT7 cells for 10 min at 37 °C with biotinylated Epo and precipitation of solubilized biotinylated Epo·EpoR complexes with streptavidin-agarose. This method allows the precipitation of the EpoR (Ref. 46Gobert S. Porteu F. Pallu S. Muller O. Sabbah M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Courtois G. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Blood. 1995; 86: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 B,lane 1). A 72-kDa protein identified as Syk by immunoblot analysis was coprecipitated with the EpoR (Fig.1 B, lane 3) and was not detected when the incubation with biotinylated Epo was omitted (data not shown), indicating that Syk is associated with the EpoR. To further confirm the association of Syk with the activated EpoR, 125I-Epo was bound to cell surface receptors at 37 °C using a saturating concentration of 1 nm. After cell solubilization with Brij 96, 65% of the radioactivity specifically bound to EpoR was precipitated with anti-EpoR antiserum, and a significant fraction was also precipitated with polyclonal anti-Syk antibodies (Fig.1 C). Using an optimal concentration of anti-Syk antibodies (10 μg/ml), 2.3% of 125I-Epo·EpoR complexes precipitated with anti-EpoR antibodies were coprecipitated with anti-Syk. These experiments show that Syk is associated with the membrane EpoR in Epo-activated cells. We extended our analysis to determine whether the interaction between Syk and activated EpoR detected in vivocould be evidenced in vitro. Since the interaction between Syk and FcεRI involves the tandem SH2 domains of Syk (47Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this region could also mediate Syk-EpoR interaction. We generated a Syk-GST fusion protein containing both SH2 domains. UT7 cell proteins binding to the tandem SH2 domains of Syk were isolated from cell lysates prepared before and after activation, using the GST-(N + C)SH2-Syk bound to glutathione-agarose. When bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, a 72-kDa protein was transiently detected after Epo stimulation (Fig.2 A). This protein did not bind to GST alone, and it comigrated with the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein present in cell lysates previously identified as the EpoR (9Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elution of proteins bound to GST-(N + C)SH2-Syk with glutathione and reimmunoprecipitation of eluted proteins with anti-EpoR antibodies followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting identified this protein as the EpoR (Fig. 2 B). The results show that the interaction between Syk and the activated EpoR occurs through the region of Syk that includes the tandem SH2 domains. To examine the relative contribution of the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of Syk to EpoR binding, GST fusion protein containing either the N- or C-terminal SH2 domain was used for precipitation. The protein that contains the C-SH2 domain avidly bound to EpoR (Fig. 2 C, left), whereas the protein containing the N-SH2 domain bound to EpoR with less efficiency (Fig. 2 C, right). A shorter exposure of the autoradiogram revealed a lower binding of C-SH2 compared with the recombinant protein including both SH2 domains (not shown). These data show that both SH2 domains of Syk participate in the binding to the EpoR with a major contribution of the C-SH2 domain. Recruitment of Syk to the EpoR may be direct or involve an intermediate component. Such a signal-transducing adapter molecule containing an ITAM motif has recently been identified (48Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneto K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 49Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but does not seem to associate with Syk (49Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To determine if the interaction between the SH2 domains of Syk and EpoR was direct, GST fusion proteins were used in a Western blot of EpoR isolated from resting or Epo-activated UT7 cells. GST-(N + C)SH2-Syk recognized a 72-kDa protein present in EpoR immunoprecipitates from activated cells, but GST alone did not (Fig. 3). The interaction did not occur when EpoR were isolated from resting cells. To confirm that the 72-kDa protein recognized by GST-(N + C)SH2-Syk was the EpoR, the same experiment was performed after denaturation of precipitated proteins and reimmunoprecipitation with anti-EpoR antibodies. Again, the same 72-kDa protein was recognized by GST-(N + C)SH2-Syk (data not shown). These data demonstrate that Syk can directly interact with the activated EpoR via its SH2 domains. They also strongly suggest that following Epo activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of EpoR Syk SH2 domains can interact with tyrosines present in the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR. Recently Brunati et al. (50Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) analyzed the phosphorylation efficiency of Syk for various peptide substrates derived from naturally occurring phosphoacceptor sites. They identified a peptide from HS1 protein, a target of protein kinases activated by the B-cell antigen receptor (51Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyoshima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), as one of the best substrate for Syk (50Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with a K m value around 4 μm. To monitor Syk kinase activity, we produced a recombinant GST fusion protein containing the HS1 peptide. This fusion protein can be used for the specific monitoring of Syk, since other Src-related kinases (50Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as Jak2 kinase 3V. Duprez and P. Mayeux, unpublished data. do not phosphorylate it. Syk tyrosine kinase was immunoprecipitated from lysates of untreated control or Epo-treated cells and assayed for its capacity to phosphorylate the HS1 fusion protein. As shown in Fig.4 A (top), Epo enhanced the Syk kinase activity against the exogenous substrate in UT7 cells with a 2-fold increase at 5 min and a 1.8-fold increase at 20 min after activation. Syk did not induce any detectable phosphorylation of a control GST protein, which indicates that HS1 peptide is the Syk substrate (data not shown). Epo also enhanced the Syk kinase activity in MO7-ER, a human cell line infected with an amphotropic virus encoding a murine EpoR (2-fold increase at 2 min and 2.4-fold increase at 15 min). Western blotting analyses with anti-Syk antibodies confirmed that equivalent amounts of the kinase were present in the anti-Syk immune complexes prepared from untreated or Epo-stimulated cells (Fig. 4 A, bottom). In addition to the enhancement of Syk kinase activity against HS1 peptide, Epo also induced an increase in Syk autophosphorylation in vitro(Fig. 4 B). A maximum increase was observed about 15 min after Epo activation, and then Syk autophosphorylation returned to basal level. These data indicate that Epo induces a transient activation of Syk kinase. In this report, we investigated the possible involvement of Syk tyrosine kinase in signal transduction through the Epo receptor. Syk and activated EpoR were shown to associate both in vivo in coprecipitation experiments and in vitro by the ability of Syk SH2 fusion proteins to bind the EpoR. The interaction between EpoR and Syk SH2 occurred directly and only following Epo activation. Moreover, we found that the Syk kinase activity increased as a functional consequence of Epo binding to cells. The association between Syk and tyrosine-phosphorylated EpoR involves the N-terminal region of Syk that includes the tandem SH2 domains. Optimal binding was obtained by using fusion proteins containing both the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains. The relative contributions of Syk N and C domains to EpoR binding were not equivalent. The C-SH2 domain bound the EpoR efficiently whereas the N-SH2 domain showed only weak binding. A similar selectivity and cooperation of Syk SH2 domains binding has been shown for the high affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) (47Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syk associates with the γ-chain of FcεRI through an interaction between the tandem SH2 domains of Syk and the doubly phosphorylated ITAM motif of the receptor (47Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ITAM motif is based on two repeated YXX(L/I) separated by 6–8 amino acids (34Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The receptor of the cytokine G-CSF contains a potential ITAM motif and also associates with and activates Syk (19Corey S.J. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Geahlen R.L. Tkatch L.S. Tweardy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Syk has recently been shown to associate with the β-subunit of the GM-CSF receptor in eosinophils (23Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.-U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Interestingly, four YXX(L/I) sequences with no consensus ITAM motif are also present in the β-chain. However, these motifs have not yet been explored for their implication in Syk activation by these cytokines. Syk and EpoR interaction could involve a tyrosine-containing motif present in the rapidly and transiently phosphorylated EpoR (7Miura O. D'Andrea A. Kabat D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Damen J. Mui A.L.F. Hughes P. Humphries K. Krystal G. Blood. 1992; 80: 1923-1932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yoshimura A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In accordance with this hypothesis, we showed that Syk directly associates with EpoR and that Epo activation seems to be required for the interaction. Although a consensus ITAM is not present in the EpoR, three tyrosines (Tyr343, Tyr401, and Tyr429 in the membrane proximal domain of the intracellular region of the EpoR) present a leucine or isoleucine residue at the +3-position and thus represent potential candidates for Syk binding. In addition to demonstrating the physical association of Syk tyrosine kinase with the EpoR, our data show that Syk tyrosine kinase activity transiently increases following Epo stimulation in UT7 cells as well as in MO7E cells expressing the EpoR, as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylating capacity toward the Syk-specific HS1 peptide. The 2–3-fold increase in Syk kinase activity is reminiscent of the increase observed in B lymphocytes after B cell receptor activation (53Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 54Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Syk, in addition to Jak2, contributes to EpoR signaling. However, the relative contributions of Jak2 and Syk tyrosine kinases in the phosphorylation of EpoR substrates are presently unknown. Jak2 is more likely involved in EpoR phosphorylation. Indeed, studies of mutated EpoR have shown a correlation between receptor phosphorylation and the ability of the EpoR to bind Jak2 (11Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Jak2 autophosphorylation and EpoR phosphorylation can be detected in vitro in anti-EpoR precipitates in 32D cells expressing EpoR (11Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in UT7 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, when EpoR and JAK2 cDNA were introduced into COS cells, we observed an increase in EpoR phosphorylation after Epo stimulation, whereas introduction of Syk with EpoR cDNA had no effect.3 This suggests that EpoR phosphorylation by Jak2 precedes Syk kinase activation. Thus, JAK2 may phosphorylate EpoR, and phosphorylated tyrosines of the receptor may then constitute binding sites for Syk kinase. Syk recruitment to the receptor following Epo activation would then result in an increase in kinase activity and phosphorylation of its substrates. The increase in Syk kinase activity was observed between 5 and 30 min after Epo stimulation in UT7 cells. Signaling molecules recruited by EpoR such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and STAT5 were activated with similar kinetics in these cells (17Gobert S. Duprez V. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S.

Other tyrosine kinases such as Src family protein kinases have been reported to participate in cytokine receptor activation and could also participate in EpoR signaling. p56lck and Syk are both involved in IL-2 receptor β-chain activation (22Minami Y.

Reconstitution of this pathway with purified components is consistent with the sequential assembly of NER proteins at the DNA lesion. However, recent studies have suggested that NER proteins may be pre-assembled in a high molecular weight complex in the absence of DNA damage. To examine this model further, we have constructed a histidine-tagged version of the yeast DNA damage recognition protein Rad14. Affinity purification of this protein from yeast nuclear extracts resulted in the co-purification of Rad1, Rad7, Rad10, Rad16, Rad23, RPA, RPB1, and TFIIH proteins, whereas none of these proteins bound to the affinity resin in the absence of recombinant Rad14. Furthermore, many of the co-purifying proteins were present in approximately equimolar amounts. Co-elution of these proteins was also observed when the nuclear extract was fractionated by gel filtration, indicating that the NER proteins were associated in a complex with a molecular mass of >1000 kDa prior to affinity chromatography. The affinity purified NER complex catalyzed the incision of UV-irradiated DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes that encode polypeptides required for the events of base damage recognition, damage-specific incision, and oligonucleotide excision during NER can be divided into two broad groups. Genes such as RAD1, RAD2,RAD4, RAD10, and RAD14 are indispensable for NER but not for cell viability, whereas genes such asRFA1, RFA2, RFA3, RAD3,SSL1, SSL2, TFB1, TFB2,TFB3, and TFB4 are essential for both NER and cell viability (2Feaver W.J.

In addition, mutations in the RAD7,RAD16, or RAD23 genes confer moderate sensitivity to killing by ultraviolet (UV) radiation (5Schild D. Glassner B.J. Mortimer R.K. Carlson M. Laurent B.C.

A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) capable of catalyzing repair synthesis of DNA associated with NER in vitro has led to important insights into the molecular mechanism of this process. By using this assay it was demonstrated that Rad3 protein functions in NER as a component of TFIIH, a multiprotein complex that is required for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (9Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The identification of Rad3 as a subunit of this transcription factor provided an explanation for the essential function of the RAD3 gene (10Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J.

Additionally, the requirement for core TFIIH in NER predicted that genes encoding the other six subunits of this complex are also indispensable for this process. This has now been directly demonstrated for all seven proteins using a yeast cell-free system (2Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Mortimer R.K. Carlson M. Laurent B.C. Yeast. 1992; 8: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Perozzi G. Prakash S. Mol. Cell.

Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown thatrad7 and rad16 mutant extracts are proficient in DNA damage-dependent incision both in vitro andin vivo but fail to excise the oligonucleotide fragment containing the DNA lesion (15Reed S.H. You Z. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29481-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hence, the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins, which interact with each other (16Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), appear to be required for post-incision events during NER.Distinct biochemical functions have been assigned to a number of the NER gene products. Rad14 protein recognizes and binds to UV radiation-induced DNA lesions, in particular (6-4) photoproducts, suggesting a role in the recognition of base damage (17Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It appears that the heterotrimeric protein complex Rpa, which is required for DNA replication, is also involved in DNA lesion recognition (18Coverley D. Kenny M.K. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Lane D.P. Wood R.D. Nature. 1991; 349: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 19He Z. Henricksen S.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Rad3 and Ssl2 proteins, both of which are components of core TFIIH, are DNA helicases that appear to be involved in unwinding the DNA duplex in the vicinity of DNA lesions, thereby generating NER “bubbles” that include sites of base damage (12Sung P. Guzder S.N. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10821-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S.

A. 1987; 84: 8951-8955Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Finally, Rad2 and a heterodimeric complex of Rad1 and Rad10 proteins are DNA structure-specific endonucleases that are similar in that they cleave DNA at duplex/single-strand junctions but differ in terms of the polarity of the single strand that they cleave (23Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30194-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24638-24641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These junctions are likely generated by TFIIH-mediated “bubble” formation. Rad2 protein cleaves the 5′ single-strand at the junction and hence operates as a 3′ endonuclease with respect to sites of base damage. Reciprocally, Rad1/Rad10 protein cleaves the 3′ single-strand at the junction and hence operates as a 5′ endonuclease with respect to sites of base damage (23Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30194-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24638-24641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The combined action of these two endonucleases is responsible for the dual incision events that are characteristic of NER in all eukaryotes studied and that result in the removal of DNA lesion-containing oligonucleotides 27–30 nucleotides in length (20Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 26Huang J.-C. Svodoba D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In addition to the proteins described above, a complex of Rad4 and Rad23 proteins is required for early events during NER (20Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); however, the precise roles of these proteins is not yet understood.Recently, a relatively stable high molecular weight complex comprising core TFIIH and multiple NER subunits was identified and extensively purified from cell extracts prepared from yeast cells not exposed to exogenous DNA-damaging agents (11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These observations led to the suggestion that, in the yeast S. cerevisiae and possibly other eukaryotes, a NER complex is assembled in the absence of substrate base damage. In this initial study, the NER complex was called a repairosome although it was not shown to perform any of the reactions involved in NER. Here we define a repairosome as a stable complex of proteins that carry out the DNA damage recognition and incision reactions that are characteristic of NER. Recent studies have also provided evidence suggesting the existence of a high molecular weight complex of NER proteins in extracts from undamaged human cells that catalyze DNA damage-dependent DNA synthesis (27He Z. Ingles J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although it is plausible that such preformed multiprotein complexes may function to constantly monitor the genome for sites of base damage and catalyze NER in the presence of such damage, there is as yet no direct biochemical evidence for such functions by the repairosome. It has also not been established that yeast cells contain only a single multiprotein complex that comprises both TFIIH and NER polypeptides. Indeed, the primary question as to whether or not any NER complex is pre-assembled in yeast (and other eukaryotes) or is assembled in a step-wise process exclusively when cells are required to carry out NER is controversial (11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion.”)In initial studies that led to the elaboration of the repairosome hypothesis, extracts containing histidine (his)-tagged Tfb1 protein (one of the subunits of TFIIH) were fractionated by assaying for complementation of defective RNAP II transcription in vitro(11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To further test the hypothesis that a high molecular weight complex of proteins comprising both TFIIH and NER subunits exists in undamaged yeast cells, we have constructed a his-tagged derivative of the DNA damage recognition protein Rad14 (which is not required for RNAP II transcription) and expressed this recombinant protein in a yeast strain deleted of the chromosomal RAD14 gene. Here we present evidence that single step affinity chromatography of recombinant Rad14 protein from nuclear extracts results in the co-purification of multiple other NER proteins, including TFIIH subunits, in a complex with a molecular mass >1000 kDa. Additionally, we show that fractions containing this complex incise UV-irradiated DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction.DISCUSSIONDuring purification of TFIIH containing a his-tagged Tfb1 subunit, it was observed that this RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor co-purified with NER proteins not involved in RNAP II transcription (11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Based on these results it was suggested that a large multiprotein complex dedicated to NER (nucleotide excision repairosome) exists in yeast cells, the assembly of which does not require prior exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents. Subsequent independent studies, which employed different column resins and different elution protocols during the initial purification steps, led to the conclusion that NER is mediated by the sequential assembly of subcomplexes at sites of base damage (28Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If NER proteins are indeed associated in a large multiprotein complex prior to the time that cells sustain bulky base damage of the type that is a substrate for NER, it should be possible to identify such a complex by affinity purification regardless of which NER protein is tagged with poly-histidine residues, with the obvious caveat that the tagged protein is accessible for binding to appropriate affinity matrices.By using a his-tagged version of the DNA damage recognition protein Rad14, we have partially purified a multiprotein complex by a single affinity chromatography step. The NER proteins Rad1, Rad10, Rad7, Rad16, Rad23, the 34-kDa subunit of Rpa, the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, RPB1, and at least two components of TFIIH bound to the affinity column exclusively in the presence of recombinant Rad14. These results confirm and extend previous observations and are consistent with other studies describing a high molecular weight complex including both TFIIH and NER proteins in yeast and human cell extracts (11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 27He Z. Ingles J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast to this study, the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins were not detected in the repairosome that was affinity purified using his-tagged Tfb1 (11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This is presumably a consequence of the different purification schemes that were used to isolate the repairosome complexes.It is formally possible that our results reflect the fortuitous independent binding to DNA of multiple proteins involved in NER. We consider this unlikely since treatment of the nuclear extract with DNase did not affect the behavior of these proteins in subsequent fractionation steps of either gel filtration or affinity chromatography. We also consider it unlikely that the binding of overexpressed recombinant Rad14 to the affinity column specifically promotes the association of NER (and possibly other) proteins in the nuclear extract for the following reasons: (i) when nuclear extracts were applied directly to a gel filtration column many of the NER proteins, which co-purified with recombinant Rad14 by affinity chromatography, co-eluted with Rad14 in fractions that correspond to a molecular mass of >1000 kDa; (ii) although the NER proteins that co-purify with recombinant Rad14 were present in approximately equimolar amounts, the relatively abundant nuclear proteins PCNA and Rad51, which are not involved in the DNA damage recognition and incision steps of NER (events that are specific to NER), were not retained by the affinity column in either the presence or absence of recombinant Rad14; (iii) a similar spectrum of NER proteins was retained by the affinity column in a Rad14-dependent manner when recombinant Rad14 was expressed at the same level as the native protein.A high molecular weight complex of NER proteins was initially detected after affinity purification of a his-tagged version of Tfb1 expressed at wild type levels (11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The putative repairosome containing his-tagged Tfb1 complemented the repair defect in extracts from several yeast strains mutated in NER genes (11Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, this complex was not investigated for its ability to directly support reactions involved in NER. Here we have demonstrated that the multiprotein complex partially purified by affinity chromatography of his-tagged Rad14 protein incises UV-irradiated DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. Hence, we conclude that the high molecular complex of NER proteins constitutes a functional repairosome.Unlike the complex of human proteins purified by XPA affinity chromatography (27He Z. Ingles J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we failed to detect co-purification of PCNA with NER proteins. Thus, it is unlikely that the affinity purified complex of yeast NER proteins can support DNA damage-dependent DNA synthesis. In fact the yeast NER complex is similar to another high molecular weight transcription-repair complex isolated from human cells in that it contains the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II (45Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Although our results provide support for the notion that repairosomes exist in undamaged yeast cells, it is not known what proportion of NER proteins are present in such complexes. Nor can we eliminate the possibility that affinity chromatography identifies several independent complexes containing NER proteins, some of which contain additional polypeptides dedicated to other cellular responses to DNA damage. However, the relative ease of genetic manipulation in yeast make this an attractive organism to identify proteins that play important roles in the assembly and/or stability of multiprotein complexes. Finally, these results do not exclude the possibility that some, if not most, DNA lesions are in fact removed by the sequential assembly of NER subcomplexes at or near the site of DNA damage in vivo.It seems reasonable to speculate that a preformed repairosome is dedicated to continual surveillance of the genome in eukaryotic cells for sites of base damage normally processed by NER. We suggest that when (and only when) such sites are encountered, the multiprotein complex undergoes specific conformational changes that strengthen the protein-DNA interactions. Additionally, these and/or further conformational changes may both facilitate localized unwinding of the DNA that flanks sites of base damage by the Rad3 and Ssl2 DNA helicases and position the Rad2 and Rad1/Rad10 endonucleases at the duplex/single-strand junctions generated by this unwinding, specifically on the damaged DNA strand.Several observations suggest that the amount and/or composition of the nucleotide excision repairosome may change when yeast cells are exposed to UV radiation or other DNA-damaging agents that generate substrates for NER. For example, genes that encode several subunits of the repairosome are up-regulated under these conditions. Notable examples include RAD2 (46Robinson G.W. Nicolet C.M. Kalainov D. Friedberg E.C.

Additionally, recent studies in one of our laboratories (E. C. Friedberg) have demonstrated significant inhibition of RNAP II transcription in vitro in the presence of active NER (50You Z.

This inhibition can be relieved by supplementingin vitro reactions with purified holo-TFIIH, a form of TFIIH specifically required for transcription initiation. Hence, when cells are required to carry out NER, subunits of the repairosome such as TFIIH and Rpa which are indispensable for transcription and replication, respectively, may be preferentially sequestered by the repairosome. This would not only enhance the cellular repair capacity but would also inhibit transcription and replication until the genome is repaired. The repair of base damage by the eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 pathway involves ∼30 proteins (1Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes that encode polypeptides required for the events of base damage recognition, damage-specific incision, and oligonucleotide excision during NER can be divided into two broad groups. Genes such as RAD1, RAD2,RAD4, RAD10, and RAD14 are indispensable for NER but not for cell viability, whereas genes such asRFA1, RFA2, RFA3, RAD3,SSL1, SSL2, TFB1, TFB2,TFB3, and TFB4 are essential for both NER and cell viability (2Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

In addition, mutations in the RAD7,RAD16, or RAD23 genes confer moderate sensitivity to killing by ultraviolet (UV) radiation (5Schild D. Glassner B.J. Mortimer R.K. Carlson M. Laurent B.C. Yeast. 1992; 8: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Perozzi G. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that their polypeptide products may either increase the efficiency of NER or participate in a subpathway(s) of this process. The characterization of cell-free extracts from mammalian (7Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (8Wang Z.

A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) capable of catalyzing repair synthesis of DNA associated with NER in vitro has led to important insights into the molecular mechanism of this process. By using this assay it was demonstrated that Rad3 protein functions in NER as a component of TFIIH, a multiprotein complex that is required for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (9Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The identification of Rad3 as a subunit of this transcription factor provided an explanation for the essential function of the RAD3 gene (10Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J.

Additionally, the requirement for core TFIIH in NER predicted that genes encoding the other six subunits of this complex are also indispensable for this process. This has now been directly demonstrated for all seven proteins using a yeast cell-free system (2Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

In these systems, an increase in one lipid component is always at the expense of another or accompanied by a change in total lipid concentration. Here we report that in saturated phosphatidylserine (PS)/phosphatidylcholine (PC)/diacylglycerol (DAG) mixtures, increasing PS or DAG at the expense of PC revealed an optimal mol % PS, dependent on mol % DAG, with higher mol % PS diminishing activity. The decrease at high mol % PS is probably not attributable simply to more gel-phase lipid due to the higher melting temperature of saturated PS versus PC because a similar peak in activity occurred in unsaturated lipid systems. Increasing the total lipid concentration at suboptimal mol % PS provided the same activity as higher mol % PS at lower total lipid concentration. However, at optimal mol % PS, activity increased and then decreased as a function of total lipid concentration. PKC autophosphorylation also exhibited an optimum as a function of mol % PS, and increasing the PKC concentration increased the mol % PS at which activity decreased, both for autophosphorylation and for heterologous phosphorylation. Formation of two-dimensional crystals of PKC on lipid monolayers also exhibited a peak as a function of mol % PS, and the unit cell size of the crystals formed shifts from 50 × 50 Å at low mol % PS to 75 × 75 Å at higher PS.

The two versions of the C1 domain, C1A and C1B, present in most PKC isozymes have structural differences (reviewed in Ref. 15Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y.

Comparison of PS analogues supports a requirement for the 1,2-sn-l-PS head group for PKC activation (17Lee M.-H. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

However, a specific PS-binding site on the enzyme has not yet been identified, and the requirement for acidic lipids can be bypassed with short chain phosphatidylcholine (PC) micelles (21Walker J.M.

Some of the classical PKC activators as well as additional lipids and lipid-soluble molecules that can contribute to PKC activation increase activity up to a maximum and decrease activity with further increase of the additive. These include short chain PCs (21Walker J.M. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4537-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and short chain PSs (27Walker J.M. Homan E.C. Sando J.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5623-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In saturated phospholipid systems, a maximum is observed as a function of DAG (32Dibble A.R.G. Hinderliter A.K.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting several hypotheses having to do with the coexistence of compositionally distinct domains and/or interface regions in addition to alterations in mol % PS. Goldberg and Zidovetski (31Goldberg E.M. Zidovetski R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5623-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) observed similar maxima as a function of DAG in unsaturated systems and noted a correlation between increasing activity and increasing frustration of the bilayer, but decreasing activity as bilayers were disrupted to form a HexII phase. All of these lipid systems are complex, and the increase of one component is always at the expense of another or accompanied by a change in total lipid concentration. Here we show that activity also can decrease as mol % PS is increased beyond maximally effective concentrations, but that the mol % PS for maximal activity depends on the total lipid concentration and enzyme concentration. The unit cell size of PKC two-dimensional crystals changes in a corresponding manner as a function of mol % PS in lipid monolayers. All lipids (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylserine (DMPS), dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and diolein (DO)) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA) and adjusted to a specific activity of 0.75–1.25 mCi/mmol for kinase assays. [3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (19.6 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. Fetal calf serum and Grace's insect medium were from Life Technologies, Inc., and yeastolate and lactalbumin were from Difco. Polyclonal antibodies to C-terminal epitopes in PKCα or PKCδ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Histone (type III-S), ATP, phorbol esters, and leupeptin were from Sigma. Organic solvents (chloroform, methanol, benzene, and hexane) were high performance liquid chromatography-grade and were obtained from Fisher. All other materials were reagent-grade and were obtained from Sigma, Fisher, or Calbiochem. Peptide substrates for PKC corresponding to the pseudosubstrate sequences for PKCε or PKCη, but with S replacing A, were synthesized in the Biomolecular Research Facility at the University of Virginia. The sequences were as follows: ε peptide, RKRQGSVRRRVH; and η peptide, RKRQRSMRRRVH. Multilamellar vesicles of the various lipid mixtures were prepared from stock solutions in CHCl3by evaporating the solvent under a stream of nitrogen gas, resuspending the mixture in hexane, and lyophilizing under vacuum overnight. Lipid purity was periodically confirmed by thin-layer chromatography, and concentrations of phospholipids were confirmed by phosphate assay (34Kingsley P.B. Feigenson G.W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1979; 24: 135-147Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PKCα and PKCδ were expressed in Sf9 cells from baculovirus constructs generously provided by Drs. Parker, Stabel, and Fabbro. The enzymes were purified by fast performance liquid chromatography through Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Superose columns (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) as described previously (28Sando J.J. Chertihin O.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Maurer M.C. Grisham C.M. Sando J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Purity was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and by Western blotting with isozyme-specific antibodies. Enzyme concentration was determined by binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate as described previously (36Sando J.J. Young M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2642-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PKC activity was determined by its ability to transfer phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP either to lysine-rich histone or to substrate peptides corresponding to the pseudosubstrate sequences of PKCε or PKCη with S-for-A replacements. Reactions were carried out in 75 μl containing substrate (0.2 mg/ml histone or 30 μm peptide), 5 mm MgCl2, 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10–20 mCi/mmol), 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4 at 30 °C), 0.8–4 nm PKC isozyme as indicated, and PC/PS/DO mixtures of varying compositions and final concentrations (0.10–10 mm) as indicated. Reactions were terminated after 3 or 5 min at 30 °C by spotting 50 or 60 μl onto P-81 ion exchange paper (Whatman). Papers were washed three times in 50 mm NaCl to remove unreacted ATP and dried. Bound32P was determined by Cerenkov counting. Autophosphorylation of PKC was carried out under similar conditions, except that the specific activity of the ATP was higher (100 mCi/mmol), and reactions were stopped by addition of boiling SDS-containing sample buffer. 32P incorporation into PKC was determined by autoradiography after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using XK-1 film. Several exposures were obtained to ensure linearity of detection, and autophosphorylation was quantitated by densitometry. Two-dimensional crystals of PKCδ were grown by depositing 25-μl aliquots containing 0.28 μm PKCδ in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) into 30-μl Teflon wells and overlaying the solution with 1 μl of DOPC/DOPS/DO (95–x:x:5 molar ratio; 2 mg/ml total lipid in CHCl3/hexane (1:1 by volume)) as described previously (37Owens J.M. Sando J.J. Chertihin O.I. Kretsinger R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After 1 h at 20 °C, monolayers were collected onto carbon-coated electron micrograph grids, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and examined using a JEOL JEM 100× electron microscope (37Owens J.M. Sando J.J. Chertihin O.I. Kretsinger R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded on Kodak 4489 film. Grids were scored for total number of two-dimensional crystals formed and for the % of small (50 × 50-Å unit cell size) and large (75 × 75-Å unit cell size) crystals formed. Recent experiments in a DMPC/DMPS/DAG system revealed a peak in PKC activity at DAG mol fractions that corresponded to a mixture of compositionally distinct lipid domains as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (32Dibble A.R.G. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1877-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Hinderliter A.K. Dibble A.R.G. Biltonen R.L. Sando J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Potential explanations for the decrease in activity at high mol % DAG included (a) some requirement for interface regions between domains that would be maximal under maximal domain coexistence conditions; (b) a possible dilution of PKC multimers or PKC-substrate aggregates as an optimal domain is increased; and (c) the decrease in mol % PS that would occur as DAG was increased at the expense of PC and PS in those studies. To examine the effect of varying the mol % PS, DMPS was varied at the expense of DMPC at several DO mol fractions. As shown in Fig.1, PKCα activity was maximal at 60% DMPS with 15 mol % DO and then rapidly fell as PS was increased to 85%. When the mol % DO was higher, less DMPS was required to reach maximal activity (35 mol % DMPS with 25 mol % DO; ≤15 mol % DMPS with 35 mol % DO), but activity also decreased at lower mol % DMPS. Since DMPS has a higher T m than does DMPC (∼39 °C (38Casal H.L. Mantsch H.H. Hausser H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4408-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) versus ∼24 °C (39Huang C. Wang Z.-Q. Lin H.-N. Brumbaugh E.E. Li S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), increasing the mol % DMPS will increase the amount of lipid in gel versusliquid crystalline phase at the temperature of the PKC assays (30 °C). In an attempt to eliminate concerns about gel-phase domains, a similar experiment with varying mol % PS was conducted in the unsaturated system DOPC/DOPS/DO. As shown in Fig.2 A, maximal histone phosphorylation by PKCα occurred at 40–60 mol % DOPS with 2 mol % DO and at 20% DOPS with 20% DO. A similar peak in activity occurred at 60 mol % DOPS in the absence of DO, but the maximal activity was only about half that with 2% DO. Some activity of PKCα in the absence of DAG has been observed previously in short chain PSs (27Walker J.M. Homan E.C. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8016-8021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in unsaturated PC/PS vesicle systems with fatty acids (31Goldberg E.M. Zidovetski R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5623-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Very similar results were observed with PKCδ and a peptide substrate. As in the saturated system, maximal activity occurred at lower mol % PS (20%) with higher mol % DAG (20%). PKCδ activity, however, was completely DAG-dependent in this system. Since DOPS and DOPC both have T m values well below 30 °C (40Casal H.L. Martin A. Mantsch H.H. Paltauf F. Hauser H.

Biophys. 1978; 187: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the decrease in activity at high mol % DOPS cannot be attributed to formation of gel-phase domains. If suboptimal PKC activity at very low or very high mol % PS is due to insufficient amounts of an activating lipid domain(s) (including an interface as a potentially relevant domain), then increasing the total lipid concentration should increase the amount of the relevant domain(s) even at suboptimal compositions. As shown in Fig.3, increasing the total lipid concentration at the lower mol fractions of PS did ultimately generate PKCδ activity similar to that achieved at lower total lipid concentrations with higher mol % PS. This occurred both in the unsaturated DOPC/DOPS system (Fig. 3 A) and in the saturated DMPC/DMPS system (Fig. 3 B). The lower maximal activity with higher mol % PS in the saturated system probably reflects the lesser amount of liquid crystalline phase with increasing mol % DMPS at the assay temperature (30 °C). Similar results were observed with PKCα using histone as substrate (data not shown). However, at the very high PS mol fractions, increasing the total lipid concentration resulted in decreasing PKC activity in both saturated and unsaturated systems. Thus, it seems that two phenomena are occurring. Increasing the total lipid concentrations at lower than optimal mol % PS does seem to increase the amount of relevant domain(s) to permit maximal PKC activation, but this does not explain the decrease in PKC activity at high lipid concentrations at higher mol fractions of PS. If PKC activity requires some interaction between PKC molecules at a membrane surface, i.e. if PKC dimers or some other multimers have higher activity than do monomers, activity per unit enzyme would be expected to decrease as PKC concentration is diluted with respect to the activating surface. Thus, if enzyme concentration is increased, the decrease in activity per unit enzyme should not occur until higher mol fractions of PS. As shown in Fig. 4(A and B), this is indeed the case. With 20 mol % DO, increasing the PKC concentration 5-fold (from 0.8 to 4 nm) delayed the decrease in activity to higher mol fractions of PS at both 0.2 and 1.0 mm total lipid. At the lower concentrations of PKC, maximal activity was reached at lower mol fractions of PS as well, suggesting an optimal PKC/PS ratio. This trend was not so evident at low (2%) DO (Fig. 4 C), perhaps because 0.8 nm PKC is already excessive for this concentration of DO. An alternative explanation for the decrease in activity at high mol % PS is that substrates that also bind to PS could be removed from PKC access with dilution on the PS-containing surface. To eliminate consideration of exogenous substrates, PKC autophosphorylation was examined as a function of mol % DOPS. As shown in Fig.5, autophosphorylation also decreased at very high mol fractions of PS, and again, the PS requirement was diminished with increased DO. Increasing the PKC concentration from 0.8 to 4 nm was similarly associated with maintenance of maximal activity at higher mol fractions of PS at high mol % DO (Fig.4 B), but not at low mol % DO (data not shown). Although these results could argue for multimerization of the enzyme, they also are consistent with autophosphorylation via an inter- versusintramolecular mechanism. In other recent work, we used similar DOPC/DOPS/DO mixtures to generate two-dimensional crystals of PKC on a lipid monolayer (37Owens J.M. Sando J.J. Chertihin O.I. Kretsinger R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For both PKCα and PKCδ, three crystals of different unit cell sizes were observed. We thus examined two-dimensional crystal formation also as a function of mol % PS. As shown in Fig.6 A, the ability to detect crystals on the grids exhibited a similar peak at ∼60 mol % PS with 5 mol % DO. However, the proportion of large unit cell (75 × 75 Å) versus small unit cell (50 × 50 Å) crystals also varied as a function of mol % PS (Fig. 6 B). Few crystals form at 0% PS, and those that do are all of the small unit cell size. Formation of the larger unit cell crystals increased as a function of mol % PS up to ∼40–50% PS. Numerous lipids and lipid-soluble molecules have been observed to affect PKC activity, and many, including short chain PCs, short chain PSs, lysophospholipids, tamoxifen, bile acids, free fatty acids, and DAGs, exhibit biphasic effects, with low concentrations activating PKC and higher concentrations decreasing activity (21Walker J.M.

In the saturated DMPC/DMPS system, increasing the mol % PS will increase the amount of gel-phase domains since DMPS melts at a higher temperature than DMPC. Gel-phase lipids have been found to activate PKC much less efficiently than liquid crystalline-phase lipids (31Goldberg E.M. Zidovetski R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5623-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Dibble A.R.G. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, even in the unsaturated DOPC/DOPS/DO system, in which all of the lipid is above the phase transition at the temperature of the PKC assays, a peak in activity was still observed as a function of mol % PS (Fig. 2). Since all of the acyl chains in this system are the same unsaturated 18:1, some explanation besides gel-phase domains or % unsaturation in the whole system is required to account for the results. The mol % PS required for maximal activity is dependent on the mol % DAG, with more PS requiring less DAG within certain limits. In the saturated DMPC/DMPS/DO system, DMPS/DO ratios varying from ∼1:2 to 4:1 provide near-maximal activity, and in the unsaturated DOPC/DOPS/DO system, ratios varying from 30:1 to 1:1 provide full activity. A simple fixed ratio of the two activators does not seem to explain the results. However, in the saturated system, activity correlates with 50–70 mol % DMPC, and in the unsaturated system, with 38–40 mol % DOPC. These results are suggestive of the involvement of PC in the activating domains, as had been suggested previously with the observation of a DMPC/DMPS/DO fixed ratio compound via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (32Dibble A.R.G. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1877-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and/or with a possible requirement for interface regions between compositionally distinct domains as proposed before (32Dibble A.R.G. Hinderliter A.K. Sando J.J. Biltonen R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1877-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Hinderliter A.K. Dibble A.R.G. Biltonen R.L. Sando J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). If PKC activation does correlate with the formation of lipid domains of defined composition (including interface as a potentially important domain), then increasing the lipid concentration at suboptimal compositions should increase PKC activity toward that observed with optimal compositions. In fact, this is what is observed, in both saturated and unsaturated lipid systems (Fig. 3). However, increasing the total lipid concentration at optimal compositions results in a decrease in PKC activity (Fig. 3). Bazzi and Nelsestuen (42Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) observed a similar decrease in PKC activity at high concentrations of PC/PS/DAG. A potential explanation for the decrease in activity at high lipid concentrations is dilution of PKC·substrate or PKC·PKC complexes on the lipid surface. Increasing substrate concentrations should diminish dilution of PKC·substrate complexes; however substrate/PKC and substrate/lipid interactions are complex. Several investigators have observed a peak in the dependence of PKC activity on substrate concentration with those basic-rich substrates like polylysine/serine, polylysine/arginine, protamine, and poly-l-arginine that can provide significant PKC activation in the absence of phospholipids (42Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 43Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the decrease in activity at high concentrations of these activating substrates also is due to dilution of PKC multimers on the activating surface. A decrease in PKC activity at high histone concentrations has been observed, however, as well, both for intact PKC (44Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and for its catalytic fragment, PKM (45Nakadate T. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11507-11513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, basic-rich substrates can bind PS and cluster PS in lipid vesicles, thus altering lipid structure (46Yang L. Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1500-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and acidic lipids can interact with and affect secondary structure of some PKC substrates, altering their ability to be phosphorylated (47Vinton B.B. Wertz S.L. Jacob J. Steere J. Grisham C.M. Cafiso D.S. Sando J.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To avoid the additional complexities of exogenous substrate as an added variable, we examined PKC autophosphorylation as a function of mol % DOPS. Autophosphorylation, too, exhibits a peak as a function of mol % DOPS, and the DOPS concentration required is dependent on the mol % DO just as it is with heterologous phosphorylation (Fig. 5). In support of the hypothesis that high lipid concentrations or high PS molar ratios dilute out PKC·PKC complexes, increasing PKC concentrations delays the decrease in activity to higher molar ratios of PS, both for autophosphorylation and for histone phosphorylation (Figs. 4 and5). The PKC concentration dependence for the decrease in autophosphorylation at high concentrations of activating lipid is consistent with dilution of enzyme-substrate complexes where the phosphorylation is intermolecular. However, the possibility also exists that a PKC-PKC dimer or higher aggregate has greater activity and that such multimers are diluted out at higher concentrations of activating lipid. A similar model was proposed for the decrease in PKC autophosphorylation as a function of short chain PC concentration beyond optimal activating concentrations (48Walker J.M. Sando J.J. Hidaka H. Calcium Protein Signalling. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 29-36Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility is the observation of different two-dimensional crystal species of PKCδ as a function of mol % DOPS in lipid monolayers (Fig. 6). Very few crystals form on monolayers lacking PS, and those that do have a unit cell size of 50 × 50 Å. As discussed previously (37Owens J.M. Sando J.J. Chertihin O.I. Kretsinger R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), this cell size is smaller than that expected to accommodate the diameter of a globular PKC molecule and suggests either crystal formation from small amounts of PKC fragments contaminating the enzyme preparations or formation of crystals with a more elongated PKC molecule attached to the lipid via its narrow end. As DOPS is increased to ∼40–50 mol %, more 75 × 75-Å crystals are seen per grid. This unit cell size can accommodate the diameter of a more globular PKC molecule, or it might be attributed to dimerization of PKC. Image resolution is not yet adequate to resolve this issue. However, the observation that the number of 75 × 75-Å crystals per monolayer and the PKC activity in multilamellar vesicles increase similarly as a function of increasing DOPS suggests that these crystals represent active PKC. The formation of more 75 × 75-Å crystals at the expense of the 50 × 50-Å crystals argues against the possibility that the smaller crystal form is a PKC fragment. In summary, at least two explanations can be offered for the maxima observed in PKC activation in various lipid systems. First, an appropriate surface for enzyme activation must be provided. Although this surface may be provided by some negatively charged substrates or even glass, greater activation is achieved on lipid surfaces, where physical properties of the lipid in addition to negative charge and specific DAG and/or PS interactions contribute, possibly by facilitating an insertion event. Exposure of proteolytic cleavage sites in the V3 region with lipid versus non-lipid activating systems (49Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with different conformations of active PKC in lipid versus non-lipid systems. Second, an optimal ratio of PKC to activating surface is suggested by the interdependence of these variables. The decrease in PKC activity at high concentrations of activating lipid, both for autophosphorylation and for heterologous phosphorylation, suggests the importance of PKC·PKC complexes. Preliminary two-dimensional crystal studies are consistent with a different, larger unit cell structure under conditions of maximal PKC activity."
https://openalex.org/W2012985530,"The bacteriophage T4 GroES homologue, gp31, in conjunction with the <i>Escherichia coli</i> chaperonin GroEL, is both necessary and sufficient to fold the T4 major capsid protein, gp23, to a state competent for capsid assembly as shown by <i>in vivo</i> expression studies. GroES is unable to function in this role as a productive co-chaperonin. The sequencing and characterization of mutations within gp23 that confer GroEL and gp31 chaperonin-independent folding of the mutant protein suggest that the chaperonin requirements are due to specific sequence determinants or structures in critical regions of gp23 that behave in an additive fashion to confer a chaperonin bypass phenotype. Conservative amino acid substitutions in these critical regions enable gp23 to fold in a GroEL-gp31 chaperonin-independent mode, albeit less efficiently than wild type, both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Although the presence of functional GroEL-gp31 enhances folding of the mutated gp23<i>in vivo</i>, GroEL-GroES has no such effect. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that a translational pausing mechanism is not responsible for the bypass mutant phenotype. Polyhead reassembly experiments are also consistent with direct, post-translational effects of the bypass mutations on polypeptide folding. Given our finding that gp31 is not required for the binding of the major capsid protein to GroEL and that active GroES is incapable of folding the gp23 polypeptide chain to native conformation, our results suggest co-chaperonin specificity in the folding of certain substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2031400239,"Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, a syndrome characterized by abnormally low plasma levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, is caused by mutations in the apolipoprotein (apo) B gene that interfere with the synthesis of a full-length apoB100. In many cases of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, nonsense or frameshift mutations result in the synthesis of a truncated apoB protein. To understand why these mutations result in low plasma cholesterol levels, we used gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells to introduce a nonsense mutation (N1785Stop) into exon 26 of the mouse <i>Apob</i> gene. The sole product of this mutant<i>Apob</i> allele was a truncated apoB, apoB39. Mice homozygous for this ""apoB39-only"" (<i>Apob</i> <sup>39</sup>) allele had low plasma levels of apoB39 and markedly reduced plasma levels of very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterol when fed a high fat diet. Analysis of liver and intestinal RNA from heterozygous apoB39-only mice revealed that the<i>Apob</i> <sup>39</sup> mRNA levels were 60–70% lower than those from the wild-type allele. Interestingly, apoB39 was not cleared as rapidly from the plasma as apoB48. The apoB39-only mice provide new insights into the mechanisms of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and the structural features of apoB that are important for lipoprotein metabolism."

Little is known about the Bcm binding domain in Rho. A recent structure-activity relationship study led us to evaluate the reductive amination probe, 5<i>a</i>-(3-formylanilino)dihydrobicyclomycin (FD-Bcm). Biochemical studies showed that FD-Bcm possessed inhibitory activities comparable to Bcm in Rho-dependent ATPase and transcription termination assays. Incubation of Rho with FD-Bcm, ATP, and poly(C) followed by NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction and dialysis led to an appreciable loss of ATPase activity. Inclusion of Bcm with FD-Bcm in the reductive amination reaction protected Rho, indicating that Bcm and FD-Bcm competed for the same binding site in Rho. Incubation of Rho with FD-Bcm and poly(C) followed by NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction provided a sample with residual ATPase activity (12%). Mass spectrometric analysis indicated the presence of two proteins in an approximate 1.2:1 ratio, whose masses corresponded to wild-type Rho (47,010 Da) and lysine-modified Rho (47,417 Da), respectively. Trypsin digestion of the Rho sample followed by high performance liquid chromatography separation and tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified the site of modification as Lys<sup>181</sup> within the combined tryptic fragment, Gly-Leu-Ile-Val-Ala-Pro-Pro-Lys-Ala-Gly-Lys (residues 174–184). Similar analysis of a lesser modified sample (following incubation with inclusion of ATP) showed that addition had again occurred at Lys<sup>181</sup>.

Defining functional roles for amino acid residues around the distal heme site is a primary step in unraveling the reaction mechanism of NO synthesis. Our previous results indicated that residue Glu-361 in eNOS is critical for l-arginine binding (16Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

Another eNOS residue, Asp-369, which corresponds to Asp-379 in mouse iNOS, was also demonstrated to be important in enzyme activity and l-arginine binding (16Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J.

Asl-arginine binding occurs close to the distal heme site in eNOS, mutant proteins with impaired l-arginine binding are likely to provide useful tools to study the relationship between the side chain structure around the substrate-binding region and the distal heme site. To explore this further, eight polar amino acid residues in the 360–379 segment of eNOS were mutated and their functional effects characterized. Only mutations at residues 369 and 372 abolished eNOS activity. To elucidate the roles of Asp-369 and Arg-372 in maintaining heme environment, we replaced these two residues with a variety of amino acids and characterized the spectral properties of the resulting mutant proteins in complexes with various heme ligands. The results indicate that residues Asp-369 and Arg-372 are critically important in stabilizing eNOS oligomeric structure and heme environment. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine (58 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

NADPH, CaM, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The oligonucleotide primers used in preparing Asp-369 and Arg-372 mutants shown in Fig. 1 A were synthesized by Genosys Inc. (Woodlands, TX). The strategy for polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was described previously (11Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25062-25066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the mutated cDNA were confirmed using the dideoxy chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52760) Google Scholar). cDNAs for the wild-type and mutant eNOS were inserted into the EcoRI site of the pVL1392 transfer vector, which was used to generate recombinant viruses in the Sf9 cells. Procedures for preparation of crude cell homogenates and purification of recombinant proteins were essentially the same as described previously (19Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). NOS activity was assayed by measuring conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline as described by Bredt and Snyder (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 μmcalmodulin, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μmβ-NADPH, 10 μm BH4, 100 μml-arginine, and 1 μCi ofl-[3H]arginine was incubated with enzyme at 37 °C for 3 min. Cytochrome c reductase activity was determined from the absorbance increase at 550 nm using Δεred-ox of 21 mm−1cm−1 (20Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reduced form of biopterin was first oxidized by a modified procedure of Schmidt et al.(21Schmidt H.H.H.W. Smith R.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3243-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified wild-type and mutant eNOS proteins (0.3 mg/ml) were oxidized with 1% iodine and 2% KI in 0.25 mH3PO4. After standing for 60 min in the dark, excess iodine was reduced by crystalline ascorbic acid. The sample was centrifuged and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using C18 reverse phase column. The column was eluted with 5% methanol, and biopterin was detected by a fluorescence monitor (Shimadzu RF-535) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 410 nm, respectively. The BH4 concentrations in samples were determined by integrating the peak area and relating it to that of the authentic BH4. Optical spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu-2401 PC or a HP8452 diode array spectrophotometer. The ferrous heme-CO spectrum was obtained by flushing the sample with CO gas, followed by reducing the sample with a few grains of dithionite. The binding affinity for l-arginine and heme ligand was determined by perturbation difference spectroscopy as described by McMillan and Masters (9McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme (1.5–2 μm) was directly titrated with various concentrations ofl-arginine or heme ligands at room temperature. The absorbance change (ΔA) was generated by subtracting the recorded spectrum at each concentration of ligand from the spectrum of the resting enzyme. Because K d of the wild-type eNOS for l-arginine binding was close to the enzyme concentration, the free l-arginine was obtained by correction for the bound l-arginine from the totall-arginine based on the following formula: [L]free = [L]T − [EL] = [L]T − ΔA/ΔA max[E]T, where [L]free is the concentration of free ligand, [L]T is the concentration of total ligand, [EL] is the ligand-enzyme complex, ΔA is the absorbance change at indicated concentration of ligand, ΔA max is the maximum absorbance change at the saturated concentration of ligand, and [E]T is the total enzyme concentration. Binding isotherms were constructed by plotting the difference absorbance (ΔA) versus the free ligand concentration. Dissociation constant (K d) values were estimated by fitting the data to a hyperbolic one-site binding model. Wild-type and mutant eNOS proteins were analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a BioSelect 250 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). The column was pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline and calibrated with the following protein molecular mass standards: thyroglobulin, 675 kDa; γ-globulin, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 44 kDa; and myoglobin, 17 kDa. Our previous studies demonstrated that Glu-361 of eNOS is critically involved in l-arginine binding and enzyme activity (16Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To study the role of the region around Glu-361, we mutated eight additional polar residues in the segment from Thr-360 to Val-379, which are conserved among all three human NOS isoforms (Fig.1 B) and expressed these mutants in Sf9 cells. The crude cell homogenates were prepared, and the correct size of the expressed full-length mutant proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). All mutants retained much of the l-citrulline formation activity (>45% of the wild type) with the exception of D369I and R372L, which lost essentially all activity (Table I). These two mutant proteins were purified for spectral studies. The purified wild-type eNOS exhibited a Soret peak at ∼398 nm, and addition of imidazole shifted the Soret peak to 428 nm, typical for a six-coordinate low spin imidazole complex (Fig.2 A). This complex was converted back to a five-coordinate high spin species, with a Soret peak at 395 nm upon addition of l-arginine (Fig.2 A). In contrast, both mutant proteins exhibited a Soret peak at 416 nm with a slight shoulder at 390–397 nm and a less prominent charge-transfer band at 647 nm, indicating a mixture of high and low spin states with the majority present as the low spin form (Fig. 2, B and C). Imidazole induced a shift of the Soret peak from 416 to 428 nm in both mutants. However, it is difficult to convert this imidazole-heme complex back to the high spin form even with addition of a high concentration ofl-arginine (>50 mm). l-Arginine was thus first added to both mutant proteins and shifted the Soret peak of each sample from 416 to 398 nm. Further addition of imidazole shifted the Soret peak to 428 nm, indicating the formation of imidazole-heme complex (Fig. 2, B and C). Wild-type eNOS and the D369I and R372L mutants exhibited similar Soret peaks at 445 nm in the reduced CO-heme complexes (Fig.3). However, the 445-nm peak of D369I mutant was unstable and quickly disappeared with concomitant formation of a 420-nm peak (Fig. 3 B).Table Il-Citrulline forming activities in crude cell homogenates of the wild-type and mutant eNOSl-Citrulline formational-Citrulline formation was measured at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the means of duplicate experiments agreed within 5% variations.

All the mutants were expressed in a baculovirus system and purified to apparent homogeneity, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The optical absorption spectra, the l-citrulline formation, and cytochrome c reduction activities of all purified mutant proteins were determined. As shown in TableII, all mutants retained essentially all the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, but had a very low l-citrulline formation activity with the exception of mutants D369E and R372K, which retained 27% and 44% of the wild-type enzyme activity, respectively.Table IICatalytic activities and BH4 content of the purified wild-type and mutant eNOSl-Citrulline formational-Citrulline formation and cytochromec reduction activities were measured at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the means of duplicate experiments, which agreed within 5%.Cytochrome creductaseal-Citrulline formation and cytochromec reduction activities were measured at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the means of duplicate experiments, which agreed within 5%.BH4 contentbBH4 content was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”nmol/min/mgeq/subunit% of wild typeWild-type82.314300.55100D369E22.415000.2240D369I1.312600.035D369N1.413100.035D369V2.31200UDcUD, undetectable.0D369G1.81120UDcUD, undetectable.0R372K36.312400.4276R372M3.414600.3462R372L2.213600.355R372V3.712500.2851R372G3.81430NDdND, not determined.NDdND, not determined.a l-Citrulline formation and cytochromec reduction activities were measured at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the means of duplicate experiments, which agreed within 5%.b BH4 content was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c UD, undetectable.d ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The BH4 content of mutant proteins was determined and shown in Table II. All Asp-369 mutants except for D369E, which retained 40% of the wild-type BH4 content, had a very low BH4 content (less than 5% of the wild type). In contrast, mutation of Arg-372 to either charged or neutral residues preserved more than 50% of the wild-type BH4 content. The Soret absorption characteristics of the wild-type and mutant eNOS are summarized in Table III. Instead of the 398-nm peak found for the wild-type eNOS, most mutants exhibited a Soret peak at 416 nm. On the other hand, absorbance in the D369E, R372K, and R372M mutants peaked at 407, 402, and 403 nm, respectively.l-Arginine converted all mutants back to the high spin state (Table III). The K d value forl-arginine determined by optical perturbation for the wild- type enzyme was 0.4 μm, but for mutants was higher. Asp-369 mutants had K d values in the range of 1–10 mm. R372K, R372M, and R372L had K dvalues between 5 and 20 μm, and R372V exhibited aK d of 140 μm (TableIV). Replacement of Arg-372 with glycine greatly weakened the l-arginine binding (K d ∼ 11 mm), suggesting a dramatic change in the enzyme structure.Table IIISoret absorption characteristic peaks of wild-type and mutant eNOSSoret peak position (nm)Resting state+l-ArginineaAll mutants except R372K and R372M, exhibited a broader peak at 398 nm after addition of 20 mml-arginine.+1-PhImb1-Phenylimidazole.+3,5-LutidineWild-type398395399395D369E407395424398cThe amplitude of the Soret peak was reduced and its position shifted to 398 nm.D369I411398424395dThe Soret peak was shifted to 395 nm with a shoulder at 411 nm.D369N413398424420D369V416398424423D369G416398424422R372K402395403395R372M403395426395R372L416398426HS/LSeMixed high and low spin states.R372V416398426421R372G416398426HS/LSeMixed high and low spin states.a All mutants except R372K and R372M, exhibited a broader peak at 398 nm after addition of 20 mml-arginine.b 1-Phenylimidazole.c The amplitude of the Soret peak was reduced and its position shifted to 398 nm.d The Soret peak was shifted to 395 nm with a shoulder at 411 nm.e Mixed high and low spin states.

Open table in a new tab 1-Phenylimidazole is frequently used as a heme ligand for P450 proteins. Binding of 1-phenylimidazole to human iNOS shifted the Soret peak to 428 nm, with a K d ∼ 28 μm(22Chabin R.M. McCauley E. Calaycay J.R. Kelly T.M. MacNaul K.L. Wolfe G.C. Hutchinson N.I. Madhusudanaraju S. Schmidt J.A. Kozarich J.W. Wong K.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9567-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, addition of 1-phenylimidazole to the wild-type eNOS did not change the spin state, even at 100 mm concentration (Fig. 4), indicating a lack of binding to this isoform. Similar behavior was observed for the R372K mutant (TableIV). In contrast, addition of 1-phenylimidazole to all other mutant proteins shifted the Soret peak to 424–426 nm. This is exemplified by the specific mutants D369I and R372L shown in Fig. 4 (B andC) and is consistent with formation of a six-coordinate low spin heme complex with a N-ligand. The K d values for 1-phenylimidazole calculated from optical titrations were in the 10–65 μm range for these mutants (Table IV). We also used another heme ligand, 3,5-lutidine, which has been employed to probe width of the eNOS heme pocket in our previous study (23Berka V. Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33293-33300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), to determine the role of the side chains of Asp-369 and Arg-372 on the eNOS heme environment. As shown in Fig.5 A, binding of this heme ligand to the wild-type eNOS shifted the Soret peak from 398 to 395 nm. The difference spectrum exhibited a peak at 390 nm and a trough at 420 nm (Fig. 5 A, inset), a change typical for a type I perturbation. Similar to the wild type, binding of 3,5-lutidine to R372K and R372M shifted the Soret peak to 395 nm and caused a type I difference spectrum (Fig. 5, B and inset; TableIII). In contrast, binding of 3,5-lutidine to the R372V mutant shifted the Soret peak to 421 nm (Fig. 5 C), yielding a type II difference spectrum with a peak at 434 nm and a trough at 412 nm (Fig.5 C, inset), indicating that the nitrogen atom of 3,5-lutidine directly coordinates to the heme iron (24Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sono M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5496-5502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of 3,5-lutidine to the R372L and R372G mutants produced broad absorbance peaks centered at 416 nm with shoulders at 400 nm and 421 nm, indicating a mixture of high and low spin states (spectra not shown). As with wild-type eNOS, the K d values of the R372K and R372M mutants derived from the type I difference spectra with 3,5-lutidine were ∼200 μm. The K dvalue for R372V derived from the type II difference spectrum was ∼160 μm. The Soret peak shifts caused by binding of 3,5-lutidine to the Asp-369 mutants were similar to those of the Arg-372 mutants. Binding of 3,5-lutidine to D369I caused a mixed spin state with a predominant high spin form (Fig.6 A). Binding of 3,5-lutidine to D369E reduced the amplitude of the Soret peak and shifted its wavelength to 398 nm (Fig. 6 B), indicating a spin mixture with predominant high spin. Binding of 3,5-lutidine to the D369N, D369V, and D369G mutants shifted the Soret peak to 420–423 nm, consistent with formation of a six-coordinate nitrogen-based ligand (Fig. 6, C and D; Table III).Figure 6Effects of 1 mm 3,5-lutidine on the absorption spectra of the D369I (A), D369E (B), D369V (C), and D369G (D) mutants of eNOS.

The wild-type eNOS had a single major peak with molecular mass estimated to be ∼280 kDa, consistent with a dimeric structure (Fig.7 A). Mutant D369E had a broader peak with elution position in the range of the dimeric and monomeric species, indicating a mixture of dimeric and other forms (Fig. 7 B). Two separate peaks with elution volume corresponding to both monomeric and dimeric forms, respectively, were shown in all other mutants such as D369V, R372K, and R372L (Fig. 7,C–E). The monomeric species of R372K is eluted before other mutant monomers, possibly due to the difference in shape as well as size of these monomer species. A minor fraction of the protein eluted in the void volume for all mutants, indicating formation of high molecular mass aggregates. Results presented here indicate that among polar residues in the segment 360–379, Asp-369 and Arg-372 are important in several aspects of eNOS structure and activity. The role of these two residues is primarily involved in the oxygenase domain function. Replacement of Asp-369 and Arg-372 with either charged or neutral amino acid residues preserved essentially all NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, whereas the oxygenase domain activity was greatly reduced except for two charge-conserved mutants, D369E and R372K. These results suggest that residues 369 and 372 participate in charge interactions that are crucial for eNOS oxygenase domain catalysis (Table II). Asp-369 and Arg-372 are also important in the binding ofl-arginine and of heme ligands. Mutations in these two residues substantially decreased the l-arginine binding affinity (Table IV). 1-Phenylimidazole, a poor ligand for the wild-type eNOS, exhibited high affinity for all Asp-369 and Arg-372 mutants except R372K, and shifted the Soret peak to 424–426 nm, indicating that these changes enable a direct ligation of the 1-phenylimidazole N-1 nitrogen to the heme iron. Binding of another heme ligand, 3,5-lutidine, was found to be sensitive to alteration in both charge and size of the side chains of Asp-369 and Arg-372 (Figs. 5 and 6), suggesting an important role for these two residues in modulating ligand access to the distal heme. The general structural integrity of the oxygenase domain active site was altered to varying degrees by Asp-369 and Arg-372 mutations. All mutants had normal heme incorporation, although most mutants had a heme present in the low spin rather than the high spin state found in wild-type eNOS (Table III). In addition, the reduced CO-heme complexes of the Asp-369 mutants were unstable and rapidly converted to a species with 420-nm Soret peak (Fig. 3). These findings indicate that Asp-369 and Arg-372 are essential for maintaining a proper heme environment. Furthermore, mutation of Asp-369 or Arg-372 caused derangement in dimer formation as shown in Fig. 7. A conservative change in these two residues (such as D369E and R372K) influenced the dimer stability, suggesting a strict requirement for eNOS quaternary structure and a critical role of Asp-369 and Arg-372 in NOS dimerization. While this manuscript was under review, Crane et al. (26Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) and Masters et al. (27.Masters, B. S. S., Raman, C. S., Li, H., Martasek, P., Kral, V., and Poulos, T. L.

LB 97.Google Scholar) reported the x-ray crystallographic structures for complexes of murine iNOS and bovine eNOS oxygenase domains with l-arginine, respectively. These results indicate that a hydrogen-bond network is of critical importance in formation of the oxygenase domain active site. Dimerization of NOS creates a deep active-site channel with several components located at the dimer interface including l-arginine-binding helix (α7a helix, residues 360–368 in eNOS) and BH4, and exposes the heme edge on the side opposite to the active-site channel, which provides a surface for interaction with reductase domain. BH4 sits proximal and perpendicular to the heme, and participates in the extensive hydrogen-bond network for the formation of active site via interactions with heme propionate A,l-arginine-binding helix, and residues of the second subunit. Helix α7 itself (residues 360–379) traverses the active site and supplies residues that interact with l-arginine, BH4, and heme. Our previous results implicated residue Glu-361 in l-arginine binding (16Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6114-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The present work further demonstrates that Asp-369 and Arg-372 in helix α7 are critical for NO synthesis. In the crystal structure of l-arginine-NOS complex, Asp-369 forms an ion pair with residue Arg-365, which is located in the central part of the l-arginine binding helix and directly interacts with BH4 (26Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 27.Masters, B. S. S., Raman, C.

Even a conservative mutation of Asp-369 resulted in a significant loss of BH4 binding (Table II), suggesting that Asp-369 is critical for BH4 binding either directly or indirectly. Loss of BH4 has been reported to cause general conformational changes in NOS isoforms (28Mayer B. Wu C. Gorren A.C. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Werner E.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8422-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J.

Rousseau D.L Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which may account for the alteration in heme spin-state, stability of CO-heme complex, binding of l-arginine and of heme ligands, and oligomeric state in the Asp-369 mutants. These pleiotropic effects further emphasize the notion that BH4 plays a fundamental role in controlling NOS active-center formation and dimerization. Surprisingly, substitution of Arg-365 with a neutral residue, leucine, led to retention of a major part of the wild-typel-citrulline formation activity, despite its pivotal position in BH4 binding (26Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 27.Masters, B. S. S., Raman, C.

On the other hand, Arg-372 associates with the β-carboxylate side chain of Asp-366 and connects to the α-carboxylate groups ofl-arginine via water molecules. All the Arg-372 mutants retained a significant amount of BH4 that may explain the more stable reduced CO-heme complex and the moderate reduction ofl-arginine affinity observed. However, since mutation of Arg-372 did change the heme behavior and quaternary structure, and decreased the enzyme activity, this residue is clearly important in preserving integrity of the oxygenase domain active site. In conclusion, we have identified by site-directed mutagenesis two amino acid residues, Asp-369 and Arg-372, to be essential for NO synthesis. Functional and spectral analysis of mutants of these two residues suggests that they are involved in several aspects of oxygenase domain structure and activity.

A multitude of functional and spectral changes caused by mutations of these two residues has confirmed that the extensive hydrogen-bond network at NOS active site is crucial for maintaining the interconnections among BH4 cofactor, l-arginine binding, dimer formation, and heme stability.

Although the ligand-binding domains of RARs share the same novel folding pattern, many RAR subtype-specific retinoids have been synthesized indicating that the ligand-binding pocket of each RAR subtype has unique features. Previously we have demonstrated the importance for RA binding and RA-dependent transactivation of Arg276 of RARα alone and in RARβ Arg269 in conjunction with Lys220. In this study, we have examined the role of the homologous amino acid residues (Lys229 and Arg278) in RARγ for these activities. Like RARα but dissimilar to RARβ, Arg278 in RARγ alone was found to play an important role in RA binding and RA-dependent transactivation. Since Lys236 in RARγ was suggested from the crystal structure of holo-RARγ to interact with RA, we also examined its role and that of its homologs in RARα and RARβ. Despite the suggestion from the crystal structure, neither Lys236 nor its homologs in RARα and RARβ play a role in the binding of RA or RA-dependent transactivation. It is likely that Lys236 in RARγ and its homologs in RARα and RARβ are solvent exposed rather than pointing into the RA-binding pocket.

The biological effects of retinoids are mediated by a group of nuclear proteins, which belong to the multigene family of steroid and thyroid hormone receptors, called retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (for review, see Ref. 2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). Three subtypes, called α, β, and γ, of both RAR and RXR have been extensively studied along with several isoforms of each subtype which arise due to alternative promoter usage and differential splicing (2Chambon P.

In dimeric form, these proteins function as ligand inducible transcriptional regulatory proteins by binding to DNA sequences called retinoic acid-responsive elements or retinoid X-responsive elements located in the promoter of target genes. In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that the natural metabolites, all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA are high affinity ligands for RARs, whereas only 9-cis-RA has been shown to bind to RXRs (12Heyman R.A.

In addition, many synthetic retinoid agonists and antagonists have been described which display RAR subtype or RXR selectivity. Like other members of the steroid and thyroid hormone superfamily, RARs are composed of six structurally distinct domains referred to as domains A-F (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain (domain C) and the ligand-binding domain (domain E) are highly conserved among RARs, demonstrating greater than 90 and 75% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. The A and B domains contain a ligand-independent transactivation function (AF-1) and the E domain contains a ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2). Finally, amino acid residues in both the C and E domains have been demonstrated to mediate dimerization. Within the last few years, there have been major advances in the understanding of the nature of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of RARs and RXRs. High resolution crystal structures of the LBD of apo-RXRα and holo-RARγ have demonstrated that the LBDs of these proteins share a novel protein fold termed an antiparallel α-helical sandwich (14Bourguet W.

Furthermore, a number of site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the functional importance of several amino acid residues for high affinity binding of RA and discrimination of subtype-specific synthetic ligands (17Tairis N.

It has been proposed from the LBD holo-RARγ crystal structure that several amino acids from α-helices H1, H3, H5, H11, H12, loops 6–7 and 11–12, and β-sheet s1 contact RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Of these amino acids, two positively charged residues in the LBD of RARγ have been suggested to form salt bridges with RA, Lys236 with the carboxylate O-21 of RA and Arg278 with the carboxylate O-22 of RA. Mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the importance of the homologous amino acid residue to Arg278 of RARγ in RARα (Arg276) and RARβ (Arg269) for the binding of RA (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L.

However, in RARβ Lys220 acts synergistically with Arg269 for the high affinity binding of RA while in RARα Arg278 appears to act relatively independently. In this article we have examined the relative importance of the homologous positively charged amino acid residues in RARγ (Lys229 and Arg278) previously shown by mutagenesis to be critical for RA binding and RA-dependent transactivation by either RARα or RARβ. In addition, we have investigated the role of Lys236 in RARγ and its homologous amino acid residue in RARα and RARβ (Lys234and Lys227, respectively) for these activities. Of the amino acids examined, only Arg278 of RARγ was found to be important for RA binding and RA-dependent transactivation. Furthermore, despite the suggestion from the LBD holo-RARγ crystal structure, Lys236 plays no role in the binding of RA or RA-dependent transactivation by RARγ either alone or in conjunction with other positively charged amino acid residues (Arg278 or Lys229). Similarly no role for the homologous Lys residue in either RARα or RARβ could be determined. Mutants were prepared according the site-directed mutagenesis technique described by Higuchi et al. (24Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). pSG5-mouse RARα1, pSG5-mouse RARβ2, and pSG5-mouse RARγ1 were generous gifts from Professor Pierre Chambon (Institute de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France). Both sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Ransom Hill Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). The GCT codon and the CAG codon were used to encode the mutant Ala residues and Gln residue, respectively, indicated in bold and underlined in the mutagenic primers. For each mutant construct, the presence of the specific mutation and the lack of random mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis (25Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). No codon mutations were found in the entire RAR coding sequences except for the desired mutation. The ability of each mutant protein to bind DNA and dimerize with RXRα was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using recombinant protein for wild type and each mutant as described previously (19Scafonas A. Wolfgang C.L. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Wolfgang C.L. Zhang Z. Gabriel J.L. Pieringer R.A. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 746-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All mutant proteins bound DNA (retinoic acid response element from the RARβ2 promoter) and dimerized with RXRα in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay similar to that of their respective wild type protein (data not shown). For the preparation of R278A RARγ, two separate polymerase chain reactions were prepared using BglII linearized wild type pSG5-RARγ DNA as a template and the primer pairs RARγ 5′-sense (5′-AAGGAGGAAAGCGGCCGCATGGCCACCAATAAGGAG-3′) plus γR278A-antisense (5′-CTGGGGTATAAGCTGTACAG-3′) and RARγ 3′-antisense (5′-AAAAAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTCAGGGCCCCTGGTCAGG-3′) plus γR278A-sense (5′-CTGTACAGCTTATACCCCAG-3′), respectively. The two polymerase chain reaction fragments were purified, annealed, and amplified in a third polymerase chain reaction using RARγ 5′-sense and RARγ 3′-antisense primers. Likewise, the R278Q, K229A, and K236A RARγ mutants were constructed using the RARγ 5′-sense and RARγ 3′-antisense primers and the following mutagenic primers: γR278Qantisense (5′-CTGGGGTATACTGTGTACAG-3′ and γR278Q-sense (5′-CTGTACAC AGTATACCCCAG-3′); γK229A-antisense (5′-CTCGCTGAAAGCGTCCCACAG-3′) and γK229A-sense (5′-CTGTGGGACGCTTTCAGCGAG-3′); γK236A-antisense (5′-GATGATGCAAGCGGTGGCCAG-3′) and γK236A-sense (5′-CTGGCCACCGCTTGCATCATC-3′). The two RARγ double mutants, K229A/R278A and K236A/R278A, were prepared as described above for K229A and K236A except that the template DNA wasBglII linearized R278A pSG5-RARγ DNA (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each mutant, the product of the third polymerase chain reaction was purified and the 720-bp KpnI-TthIII1 fragment which contained the desired mutation was exchanged with that of wild type pSG5-RARγ DNA to create each of the mutant DNA constructs. To make each of the pET29a-RARγ prokaryotic expression constructs the 600-bpPstI fragment from the appropriate pSG5 construct which contained the desired mutation was exchanged with that of wild type pET29a-RARγ (20Wolfgang C.L.

The two RARα mutants, K234A and K234A/R276A, were prepared in a similar manner using RARα 5′-sense (5′-GAGGGGGATCCATGGCCAGCAATAGCAG-3′) and RARα 3′-antisense (5′-GAGGGAAGCTTTCATGGGGATTGGTGG-3′) along with the two mutagenic primers αK234A-antisense (5′-AATGATGCAAGCGGTGGAGAG-3′) and αK234A-sense (5′-CTCTCCACCGCTTGCATCATT-3′).BamHI linearized wild type pSG5-RARα DNA was used as the template. Following the third polymerase chain reaction, the product was purified and the 364-bp PstI-EcoRV fragment which contains the K234A mutation was exchanged with that of wild type pGem3-RARα and R276A pGem3-RARα (19Scafonas A. Wolfgang C.L. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To prepare the K234A and K234A/R276A pSG5 mutant constructs, the 651-bpPstI-BspEI fragments of K234A pGem3-RARα and K234A/R276A pGem3-RARα were each exchanged with that of wild type pSG5-RARα DNA. To prepare the K234A and K234A/R276A pET29a mutant constructs, the 1400-bp BamHI-HindIII fragments of K234A pGem3-RARα and K234A/R276A pGem3-RARα were each subcloned into pET29a. The four RARβ mutants, K227A, K220A/K227A, K227A/R269A and K220A/K227A/R269A, were prepared in a similar manner using RARβ 5′-sense (5′-GGGAGGGATCCATCGAGGGTAGATTTGACTGTATGGGAT-3′) and RARβ 3′-antisenses (5′-GAAGGAAGCTTTCACTGCAGCAGTGGTGA-3′) along with the two mutagenic primers, βK227A-antisense (5′-AATAATGCAAGCGGTGGCCAG-3′) and βK227A-sense (5′-CTGGCCACCGCTTGCATTATT-3′). XbaI linearized wild type pSG5-RARβ2 DNA and XbaI linearized R269A-pSG5-RARβ2 DNA (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as templates for the preparation of K227A and K227A/R269A, respectively. Following the polymerase chain reactions, the 630-bp MscI-BstXI fragment containing the desired mutation was exchanged with that of wild type pSG5-RARβ2 DNA. For the preparation of K220A/K227A and K220A/K227A/R269A, the 630-bpMscI-BstXI fragment from K227A-pSG5-RARβ2 or K227A/R269A-pSG5-RARβ2, respectively, was exchanged with that of K220A-pSG5-RARβ2 (17Tairis N.

To prepare the pET29a clones, the 300-bpMscI-StuI fragment from each was exchanged with that of wild type pET29a-RARβ2 (20Wolfgang C.L. Zhang Z. Gabriel J.L. Pieringer R.A. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R.

The next day, the cells were transfected with a total of 9 μg of DNA (4 μg of wild type or mutant pSG-5 RAR expression construct, 4 μg of RARE-CAT reporter construct obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Ronald Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and 1 μg of pCMV-βgal) by the Ca2+ phosphate methodology (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four h later, the cells were treated with either retinoid (all-trans-RA or all-trans-retinol ranging in concentration from 10−10m to 10−5mprepared in ethanol) or ethanol carrier. After an additional 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity (26Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activity (27Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency and expressed as a percentage of relative CAT activity. The fold induction in normalized CAT activity of wild type RAR at 10−6mall-trans-RA compared with no retinoid treatment (ethanol control) was chosen as 100% relative activity. The EC50value for wild type and each of the mutants represents the concentration of retinoid that resulted in 50% of the maximal activity of the wild type RAR determined by extrapolation from the plotted points. The K d of the wild type and each mutant receptor protein for all-trans-RA or all-trans-retinol was determined essentially as described previously using recombinant S-Tag RAR protein (19Scafonas A. Wolfgang C.L. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Wolfgang C.L. Zhang Z. Gabriel J.L. Pieringer R.A. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 746-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Each pET29a-RAR expression construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The expression of each S-Tag RAR protein and the preparation of the receptor extracts was performed as described previously (19Scafonas A. Wolfgang C.L. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,20Wolfgang C.L. Zhang Z. Gabriel J.L. Pieringer R.A. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 746-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The production of the recombinant S-Tag wild type and mutant RAR fusion proteins in the receptor extracts was monitored using the S-Tag Western blot kit (Novagen). The Western blot analysis of wild type RARα, RARβ, and RARγ along with each of their respective mutant proteins demonstrated a major band that migrated at an approximate molecular mass of 55 kDa, along with several minor smaller molecular mass bands, which were of similar size. Retinoic acid binding assays were performed with receptor extracts diluted with binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 120 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) gelatin, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin) to a final concentration of 10–30 μg of total protein (0.1–0.3 pmol of wild type). Similar protein concentrations were used for the mutant proteins. Total RA binding was determined in the diluted protein extracts by adding [3H]all-trans-retinoic acid (1.82–1.92 Tbq/mmol or 49.2–52.0 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.) in the concentration range of 0.1–20 nm and incubating for 3 h at 27 °C. Dilutions of RA were made in ethanol. In a duplicate set of reactions nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled all-trans-RA. The contribution of ethanol to the total volume was the same for each RA concentration and was equal to 2%. Bound RA was separated from free by extraction with 3% (w/v) equal particle size charcoal-dextran prepared as described by Dokoh et al. (28Dokoh S. Pike W.J. Chandler J.S. Mancini J.M. Haussler M.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All steps in the procedure were performed under yellow light. Specific RA binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding, always less than 12% of the total binding, from the total binding. No specific RA binding was detected in receptor extracts prepared from cells containing pET29a-RAR expression construct which were not induced to express RAR with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside or in receptor extracts prepared from cells containing the empty pET29a plasmid treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were determined for the wild type and each mutant protein by Scatchard analysis (29Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1946; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar). Binding assays for each wild type and mutant protein were repeated at least three times using two independently prepared receptor extracts. Retinol binding assays were performed as described above using [3H]all-trans-retinol (1.75 Tbq/mmol or 47.2 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and a 200-fold molar excess of all-trans-retinol. Initially, we examined the role of three individual positively charged amino acid residues, Lys229, Lys236, and Arg278 of RARγ (referred to as γLys229, γLys236, and γLys278) in the binding of RA and RA-dependent transactivation. Note that in RARβ the homologous amino acid residues are βLys220, βLys227, and βArg269 while in RARα they are αLys227, αLys234, and αArg276 (see Fig. 1). We have previously demonstrated that βLys220 and βArg269 act synergistically in the binding of RA and RA-dependent transactivation by RARβ (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18380-18387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, study of the homologous amino acids in RARα has demonstrated that αArg276 alone plays a major role in RA binding and transactivation, whereas αLys227 does not appear to be important for these two activities (19Scafonas A. Wolfgang C.L. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analysis of the ligand-binding domain of RARγ has suggested that γLys236 also plays an important role in the binding of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), however, there have been no structure/function studies demonstrating the importance of this amino acid residue in any of the three RARs. Each of these three positively charged amino acid residues of RARγ were individually mutated to an Ala (K229A, K236A, and R278A) and γArg278 was also mutated to a Gln (R278Q). Fig.2 show the transactivation assays and Table I lists both the EC50and K d values for the wild type and mutant RARγs. K236A displayed both an EC50 and K dvalue for RA which were comparable to that of wild type RARγ while the K d value of K229A was comparable to that of wild type RARγ but the EC50 value was slightly elevated. On the other hand, R278A displayed low activity, with EC50 andK d values for RA that were elevated 45- and >25-fold, respectively, when compared with those of wild type RARγ. In addition, R278Q displayed a similar increase in both its EC50 and K d values for RA. Therefore, individually only γArg278 was found to play an important role for both RA-binding and RA-dependent transactivation activity.Table IEC50 and Kd values of wild type and mutant RARs for all-trans-RARAREC50aMean ± S.E. of three to four independent experiments.K dbMean ± S.E.nmRARγWT2 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.2K229A12 ± 43.1 ± 0.4K236A4 ± 27.0 ± 1.0R278A95 ± 5>50cNo specific binding up to 50 nm[3H]all-trans-RA.R278Q85 ± 15>50cNo specific binding up to 50 nm[3H]all-trans-RA.K229A/R278A72 ± 14>50cNo specific binding up to 50 nm[3H]all-trans-RA.K236A/R278A122 ± 50>50cNo specific binding up to 50 nm[3H]all-trans-RA.RARαWT6 ± 0.60.9 ± 0.2K234A15 ± 51.4 ± 0.1K234A/R276A1000 ± 100>50cNo specific binding up to 50 nm[3H]all-trans-RA.RARβWT5 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.2K227A6 ± 20.5 ± 0.1K220A/K227A18 ± 22.3 ± 0.2K227A/R269A225 ± 208.2 ± 0.4K220A/K227A/R269A1500 ± 288>50cNo specific binding up to 50 nm[3H]all-trans-RA.a Mean ± S.E. of three to four independent experiments.b Mean ± S.E.c No specific binding up to 50 nm[3H]all-trans-RA. Open table in a new tab We next examined the effect of mutating either γLys229 or γLys236 to an Ala in conjunction with R278A (K229A/R278A and K236A/R278A). Fig. 3 shows the results of the RA-dependent transactivation assays and both the EC50 and K d values are summarized in Table I. Both K229A/R278A and K236A/R278A behaved very similarly to R278A demonstrating an approximately 40–60-fold elevation in EC50 value and >25-fold elevation in K dfor RA. Thus, unlike RARβ but similar to RARα, we could not observe any synergism between γLys229 and γArg278in the binding of RA or in RA-dependent transactivation. Furthermore, in contrast to the results predicted by the crystal structure of holo-RARγ ligand-binding domain, Lys236 does not appear to play any role either alone or in conjuction with γArg278 in the binding of RA or in RA-dependent transactivation activity. Since the crystal structure of holo-RARγ ligand-binding domain suggests that γLys236 may be important for RA binding, we also examined the effect of mutation of the homologous amino acid residues, αLys234 (K234A) and βLys227 (K227A), to an Ala. Like the homologous mutant RARγs, both RARα K234A and RARβ K227A displayed wild type activity in both transactivation assays (EC50 value) and in RA binding studies (K d value) (see Figs.4 and 5 and Table I).Figure 5Transactivation activity of wild type RARβ and Lys227 single, double, and triple mutants. See the legend to Fig. 2 for conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further examine the role of Lys234 in RARα, this amino acid residue was mutated to an Ala in conjunction with R276A (K234A/R276A). The EC50 value of K234A/R276A was found to be 1000 nm (see Fig. 4 and Table I) which is quite comparable to the EC50 of 900 nm previously reported for the single mutant R276A (19Scafonas A. Wolfgang C.L. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, as in RARγ, αLys234 does not appear to play a role either alone or in conjunction with αArg276 in the binding of RA or in RA-dependent transactivation activity. Finally, we examined the role of βLys227 in conjunction with both βLys220 and βArg269 since both of these two amino acid residues have been previously demonstrated to act synergistically in the binding of RA and for RA-dependent transactivation (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K220A/K227A displayed near wild type activity in the transactivation assays and RA binding assays (see Fig.5 and Table I). The EC50value and K d value for K227A/R269A were elevated 45- and 12-fold, respectively, suggesting a potential slight synergism between βLys227 and βArg269. In contrast, the triple mutant K220A/K227A/R269A displays an EC50 in RA-dependent transactivation assays of 1500 nmwhich is comparable to the EC50 of 5000 nmpreviously reported for K220A/R269A (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, βLys227 appears to play either no role or a rather minor role in the binding of RA or the RA-dependent transactivation activity of RARβ. Since βArg269 when mutated to a Gln (R269Q) displays high affinity for retinol and high retinol-dependent transactivation activity (18Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18380-18387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we examined the comparable mutation in RARγ (R278Q). TableII shows that, as expected, wild type RARγ did not bind retinol within the limits of the binding assay and has low activity in transactivation assays. R278Q RARγ displayed no detectable binding of retinol and only low activity in the retinol-dependent transactivation assays. In fact, R278Q displayed at least a 10-fold lower activity in the retinol-dependent transactivation assays when compared with that of wild type RARγ. The small amount of activity observed in the retinol-dependent transactivation assays for wild type RARγ is likely to be due to low levels of RA formed within the cells due to the oxidation of retinol. If the RA formed from the oxidation of retinol is indeed responsible for the observed low activity, it is not unexpected that R278Q would display a higher EC50 than that of the wild type in retinol-dependent transactivation assays, because R278Q has an approximately 50-fold higher EC50 value with RA compared with that of the wild type receptor (see Table I).Table IIEC50 and Kd values of wild type and mutant RARγs for all-trans-retinolRARγEC50aRelative to the maximum relative activity displayed by wild type RARγ at 10−6mall-trans-RA.K dnmWT150>100bNo specific binding up to 100 nm[3H]all-trans-retinol.R278Q1500>100bNo specific binding up to 100 nm[3H]all-trans-retinol.a Relative to the maximum relative activity displayed by wild type RARγ at 10−6mall-trans-RA.b No specific binding up to 100 nm[3H]all-trans-retinol. Open table in a new tab In this report, we have examined the role of three positively charged amino acid residues in RARγ (Lys229, Lys236, and Arg278) along with βLys227 and αLys234 (homologous to γLys236) in the binding of RA and in RA-dependent transcriptional transactivation. In RARγ, only Arg278 was found to be important for the binding of RA and RA-dependent transactivation. Although we observed a slight elevation in the EC50 value of the K229A mutant of RARγ, it is unlikely that γLys229 plays an important role in the binding of RA since the K d value of this mutant was comparable to that of the wild type receptor and we observed no additive or synergistic effect on the EC50 value when Lys229 and Arg278 were mutated simultaneously. It is possible, however, that the mutation of γLys229 to an Ala slightly affects the conformation of the liganded receptor causing the modest reduction in transactivation activity observed for γK229A. Finally, mutation of γLys236, βLys227, and αLys234 had no effect on the binding of RA or the RA-dependent transactivation activity of their respective RAR. It is unlikely that global conformation changes are responsible for the reduced activity observed with several of the RAR mutants, since all mutants examined displayed similar abilities to dimerize with RXR and bind DNA (retinoic acid response element) in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Table III presents a comparison between the fold increase in EC50 value obtained from RA-dependent transactivation assays of the RAR mutants described in this report and the homologous RARα and RARβ mutants that we have previously published (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In all three RARs, mutation of the homologous Arg (αArg276, βArg269, and γArg278) to either an Ala or a Gln demonstrates that this amino acid residue plays an important role in the binding of RA most likely by interacting with the carboxylate group of RA. This is consistent with the LBD holo-RARγ crystal structure, in which Arg278 has been demonstrated to form a salt bridge with the carboxylate O-22 of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). However, we observed several important differences between the γArg278 mutants and both αArg276 and βArg269 mutants which suggests that the orientation of this amino acid residue in each ligand-binding site and the electronic environment associated with this Arg in each RAR is different. First, mutation of γArg278 to either an Ala or a Gln results in essentially the same fold increase in EC50 value. On the other hand, the Ala mutant of αArg276 displays a 3 times higher EC50 value than the Gln mutant (113-fold versus 38-fold) while the Gln mutant of βArg269 has an EC50 value which is at least 160 times higher than the Ala mutant (>1000-foldversus 6-fold). Second, in RARβ Lys220 and Arg269 act synergistically in the binding of RA. Mutation of each amino acid individually to an Ala has a modest effect on RA-dependent transactivation activity and affinity for RA while the mutation of both residues simultaneously to Ala results in a 500-fold increase in EC50 and K d values (17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No similar synergism was observed between the homologous residues of either RARα or RARγ. Furthermore, γLys229 and αLys227 appear to play little to no role in the binding of RA or RA-dependent transactivation activity. Third, R269Q RARβ is a very efficient retinol receptor (18Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18380-18387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas neither R278Q RARγ nor R276Q RARα (19Scafonas A. Wolfgang C.L. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11244-11249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) display any detectable binding of retinol or retinol-dependent transactivation activity. Therefore, although the ligand-binding domains of RARs and RXRs most likely display a very similar fold (14Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Open table in a new tab The fold increase for each receptor are normalized to the wild type EC50 value for that receptor. It is interesting to note that upon comparison of the fold increases in EC50 value of the homologous mutants of each of the three RARs (see Table III), that RARγ appears to be more similar to RARα than RARβ suggesting that the mechanism of ligand binding by RARβ is different from that of RARα and RARγ. However, only a maximum 42–66-fold loss of activity could be achieved with either the single or double mutants of RARγ studied while a 375- and 500-fold loss of activity was observed with RARα and RARβ, respectively. To account for this difference, it is likely that at least one additional amino acid residue of RARγ may interact with the carboxylate group of RA to aid in the high affinity binding of RA. Analysis of the LBD holo-RARγ crystal structure suggests that γSer289 may be a likely candidate (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). In the report of the crystal structure of LBD holo-RARγ the authors conclude that in addition to the coordination of γArg278to RA, an additional positively charged amino acid residue (γLys236) makes a salt bridge with the carboxylate O-21 atom of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, the analysis of our mutagenesis data strongly supports that mutation of γLys236 either alone or in conjunction with other positively charged amino acid residues has little to no effect on RA binding or RA-dependent transactivation. Furthermore, similar results were obtained with the homologous amino acid residue (αLys234 and βLys227) in RARα and RARβ, respectively. Although the crystallographers conclude that γLys236 points inward forming a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of RA, they indicate that a second alternative conformation (approximately 60% occupation) was observed in the crystallographic data in which the side chain of γLys236was solvent accessible pointing to the outside of the molecule and making a salt bridge with γAsp351 of a symmetrical molecule (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). This second conformation was considered to be due to a packing effect of the crystals. Our data, however, strongly support this alternative conformation for γLys236. In addition, our analysis of the homologous amino acid residue (Lys274) in the crystal structure of the LBD of apo-RXRα demonstrated that in this receptor Lys274 is solvent exposed lying on the surface of the RXR molecule (14Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Therefore, neither γLys236 nor its homologous amino acid residue in RARα or RARβ are important for the high affinity binding of RA and it is most likely that the side chains of these homologous amino acid residues are solvent exposed on the surface of their respective RAR molecule.

The stability and integrity of the genetic material of all organisms is constantly being challenged. Genetic instability results from potentially deleterious interactions of intracellular and extracellular agents with DNA and from errors introduced during DNA replication and recombination. Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)1 sites are the most common DNA lesions that contribute to genetic instability (1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). AP sites arise through the spontaneous hydrolysis of N-glycosylic bonds, through disruption of the sugar-phosphate backbone by reactive oxygen species, or as a result of the removal of altered bases during the base excision repair process. Accumulation of AP sites can be cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic if not repaired. Four classes of AP endonucleases have been postulated that are distinguished by the structure of the DNA termini they produce (2Spiering A.L. Deutsch W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3222-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Class II AP endonucleases hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond immediately 5′ to the AP site producing a 3′-hydroxyl DNA terminus, a suitable substrate for DNA repair polymerases. Additionally, class II AP endonucleases have 3′-phosphodiesterase and 3′-phosphatase activities that remove 3′-terminal groups that block polymerase function. These include some of the major lesions associated with radiation-induced DNA strand breaks. The importance of this group of enzymes for maintaining genomic integrity is confirmed by their presence in all organisms analyzed to date. Drosophila Rrp1 (recombinationrepair protein 1) was the first higher eukaryotic class II AP endonuclease to be cloned (3Sander M. Lowenhaupt K. Lane W.S. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rrp1 is a member of the family of Escherichia coli exonuclease III-like enzymes based on the homology to E. coli exonuclease III within its C-terminal 252 amino acids (33% sequence identity and 55% sequence similarity). This family of enzymes includes 13 homologues from bacteria to human (4Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Unlike the other members of this family, Rrp1 has also been shown to carry out DNA strand transfer and single-stranded DNA renaturation in vitro, in addition to its DNA repair activities (3Sander M. Lowenhaupt K. Lane W.S. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Lowenhaupt K. Sander M. Hauser C. Rich A. J. Biol.

This unique characteristic of Rrp1 maps to its N-terminal 421-amino acid region, a region that is not homologous to any known protein. The C-terminal region of Rrp1 complements cellular deficiency in E. coli exonuclease III and provides resistance to oxidative and alkylating agents in vivo (11Gu L. Huang S.-M. Sander M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The amino acid distribution within Rrp1 is skewed; the N-terminal region is enriched with charged residues (13% lysine and 18% glutamic acid), while the C-terminal region has an average amino acid distribution. Together these observations suggest that Rrp1 may have a bipartite structural organization. In this paper, we report the use of limited proteolysis to isolate the nuclease domain of Rrp1. Enzymatic comparison of the full-length and truncated forms of Rrp1 was carried out. This information facilitated an evaluation of Rrp1 domain structure/function and the potential influence of the N-terminal region on the nuclease activities of Rrp1. Hydrodynamic and circular dichroism measurements were also carried out on both full-length and truncated forms of Rrp1. Together, these data allow us to propose a shape model of Rrp1 domain structure. Recombinant Rrp1 was purified as described previously (12Sander M. Carter M. Huang S.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Bleomycin was purchased from Sigma. Uracil DNA glycosylase was purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Protease V8 was purchase from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. Inc. The sequences of oligonucleotides used to make the various nuclease assay substrates were as follows: TAEX-1, 5′-CGGCGGTGGCGGTTTTTTTTCCCCTTTTTT-3′; TAEX-2, 5′-GGGGGGAAAAAAGGGGAAAAAAAA-3′; BL1, 5′-CCCCAAAAAAAAAAAAGCAAAAAAAAAATTA-3′; BL2, 5′-TAATTTTTTTTTTCGTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGG-3′. Appropriate oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]adenosine triphosphate (13Linxweiler W. Horz H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4845-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified (16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel) using an Elutrap electroelution system (Schleicher & Schuell). The recovery was calculated, and dsDNA substrates were prepared by annealing the labeled oligonucleotides with a 2.5-fold molar excess of complementary, unlabeled oligonucleotides. Annealing was carried out at 80 °C for 1 min in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm NaCl, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. All reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmNaCl, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 ng (4–8 nm) of labeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 10 μl. The amount of enzyme used varied depending on the particular assay. Reactions were stopped by the addition of proteinase-K and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml and 25 mm, respectively, and were incubated for 10 min at 42 °C. Prior to analytical gel electrophoresis, 5 μl of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added to each sample. The products were resolved on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were analyzed and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. 5′-End-labeled TAEX-2 was annealed to TAEX-1 giving a dsDNA substrate with 3′-recessed ends. Reaction products were resolved on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Calculation of fmol of nucleotide released/min/ng of enzyme has been previously detailed (14Sander M. Benhaim D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3926-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, the relative fraction of each reaction product, as determined by PhosphorImager analysis, was multiplied by the fmol of oligonucleotide in the reaction and the difference in nucleotide length between the product and substrate. Total fmol of nucleotide released was calculated by summing over all of the product species. Preparation of an oligonucleotide substrate with a 3′-terminal phosphoglycolate has been described previously (15Sander M. Huang S.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL1 contains a unique GpC dinucleotide sequence that is preferentially cleaved by bleomycin to leave a 3′-phosphoglycolate (16Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Ohtsubo E. Ohtsubo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5983-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Winters T.A. Henner W.D. Russell P.S. McCullough A. Jorgensen T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 5′-End-labeled BL1 was annealed to equimolar amounts of BL2, precipitated, and resuspended in 50 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.2) and 50 mm NaCl. On ice, the sample was incubated with 0.4 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm bleomycin, and 100 μm iron(II) ammonium sulfate for 30 min. After the addition of 0.5 volume of formamide loading buffer, the 3′-phosphoglycolate oligonucleotide, BL1–17PG, was purified as stated above. BL1–17PG was annealed to BL2. The reaction products were resolved on a 16% denaturing gel. The product BL1–17OH migrates with slower mobility than the substrate BL1–17PG. The relative specific activity was calculated by determining the amount of enzyme necessary to produce 50% product. Protease V8 digests were carried out at 23 °C for the indicated times in a buffer with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. With the exception of preparative digests, reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 volumes of 2× Laemmli buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue) (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Preparative digests were stopped with 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 mm o-phenathroline, 0.1 mm benzamidine-HCl prior to chromatography. Proteolytic fragments were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Unless otherwise indicated, all buffers used in the purification contain 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 mm o-phenathroline, 0.1 mm benzamidine-HCl, and a 0.5 μg/ml concentration of each of the following peptides: pepstatin A, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and aprotinin. Typically, a preparation started with a 12-liter culture of induced E. coli cells (BL21(DE3), Novagen). 2× YT medium (Bacto-tryptone (16 g/liter), Bacto-yeast extract (10 g/liter), and NaCl (5 g/liter), pH 7.0) was inoculated with 0.01 volume of a fresh overnight culture and grown at 37 °C. When the cells reached mid-log phase (A 600 approximately 0.5) isopropyl-β-d-galactosidase was added to 1.0 mm with continued incubation for an additional 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman J6-M centrifuge. Cells were washed in 500 ml of cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (5.37 mmNa2PO4, 1.76 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.68 mm KCl), 10% glycerol, and 1.0 mm EDTA) and recentrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of sonication buffer (50 mmNa2PO4 (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm EDTA) by agitation and pipetting. Cells were frozen and thawed prior to the addition of lysozyme (Boehringer Mannheim) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The mixture was gently swirled on ice for 10 min. Cells were then sonicated three times while on ice using a Branson Sonifier 450 at 50% duty cycle, output control of 4, for 30 s each cycle. Insoluble material was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 20 min in a Sorvall HB-6 rotor. Supernatant was decanted, and pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of extraction buffer (sonication buffer with 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole) by pipetting. This sample was centrifuged in a Sorvall Ti-70 rotor at 55,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was removed and subjected to immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Specifically, the supernatant was mixed with 6 ml of a 50% slurry of extraction buffer and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) and batched for 1 h by gentle mixing. This protein-resin complex was then packed into a column for washing and elution steps. Flow-through was collected, and the column was washed with 100 ml of extraction buffer. Collected flow-through was reapplied to the 3-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed with 100 ml of extraction buffer, and Rrp1 was eluted with elution buffer (extraction buffer with 500 mm imidazole). Peak protein fractions (1.5-ml fractions were collected), as determined by Bradford analysis, were pooled (approximately 12 ml) and dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of buffer S (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mm o-phenathroline, 0.02 mm benzamidine-HCl, and a 0.25 μg/ml concentration of each of the following peptides: pepstatin A, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and aprotinin). The dialyzed material was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min to remove precipitate material. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC Mono-P HR 5/5 column, equilibrated with buffer S containing 100 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 3 ml of buffer S containing 100 mm NaCl and eluted with a 17-ml gradient from 100 to 750 mm NaCl. Peak protein fractions were pooled and reapplied to the Mono-P column under the same conditions as described previously with the exception of a slightly shallower elution gradient (22-ml gradient). Rrp1 eluted at approximately 200 mm NaCl. The peak fraction was split; the first half was used for hydrodynamic and CD studies, while the second half was used to make sufficient quantities of Rrp1-C274 for hydrodynamic and CD studies. It should be noted that recombinant His-tagged Rrp1 has been shown to be enzymatically indistinguishable from recombinant Rrp1 lacking the His tag leader peptide. 2B. J. Reardon and M. Sander, unpublished data. Preparative V8 digests were loaded onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC Mono-S HR 5/5 column, equilibrated with buffer S containing 100 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 3 ml of buffer S containing 100 mm NaCl and eluted with a 15-ml gradient from 100 to 750 mm NaCl. Rrp1-C274 eluted at approximately 325 mm NaCl. Protein sequencing was performed by Dr. David Klapper (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina) using a Perkin Elmer/ABI Procise 491 protein/peptide sequencer with automatic conversion of derivatized amino acids to the phenylthiocarbamoyl form and on-line HPLC analysis. This instrument is capable of sequencing materials from glass fiber filters using polybrene to immobilize the sample or sequencing from polyvinylidene difluoride type membranes using a specialized cartridge and modified sequencing programs. Current reproducible detection limits are 100–300 fmol of phenylthiocarbamoyl amino acid. Measurements of CD were performed on a Jasco (Easton, MD) J-600 CD spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller. Cells of 1-mm path length were used. A 2-s time constant with 0.1-nm bandwidth was used during acquisition over a wavelength range of 195–260 nm. Buffer conditions were 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0). Five spectra were recorded and averaged for each protein. Spectra for buffer were collected in a similar manner and subtracted. Protein concentrations for CD analysis were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients calculated from amino acid composition. Predictions of secondary structure were performed, without smoothing, against a 17-protein reference set using the program, SELCON (19Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The secondary structure assignments for the reference proteins were previously calculated (20Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed on a Beckman Instruments Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C in two-sector charcoal-Epon-filled centerpieces. Runs were performed at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman AN60 Ti rotor. Analysis of sedimentation velocity concentration profiles was accomplished with the program SVEDBERG, kindly provided by John Philo (21Philo J. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M.

These values were measured at several protein concentrations and extrapolated to zero concentration to obtain the values reported in Table I. For both Rrp1 and Rrp1-C274, the single species model provided the best fit of the concentration profiles. Solution masses were calculated from the experimentally measureds and D values by the Svedberg equation as follows, Mr=RTs/D(1−νρ)Equation 1 where M r is the relative molecular weight, ν is the partial specific volume, R is the gas constant (8.3144 × 107 ergs/mol), T is temperature in Kelvin, s is time in seconds, and ρ is the density of the buffer. Measurements of solution masses for Rrp1 and Rrp1-C274 were also accomplished by sedimentation equilibrium analyses in six-sector charcoal-Epon-filled centerpieces. Rrp1 and Rrp1-C274 were sedimented at 20,000 rpm for 30 h at 4 °C at three cell loading concentrations. Equilibrium was reached as evidenced by no difference between successive scans collected over 4 h after 30 h of sedimentation. Absorbance data from the three loading concentrations were analyzed globally with the program NONLIN (23Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) provided by the National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility (Storrs, CT). A number of reaction models for nonassociating and self-associating solutes were tested. For Rrp1 and Rrp1-C274, the data were best fit to the single ideal nonassociating solute model. The final solution masses were calculated from global values ofS and the reduced apparent molecular weight according to the following equation (24Laue T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), Mr=(ςRT)/(1−νr)ω2Equation 2 where ς is the reduced apparent molecular weight,r is the radial position in cm, and ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, (rpm·π)/30. Frictional ratios,f/f 0, were calculated using the following equations, f=Mr(1−νρ)/NsEquation 3 and f0=6πη(3Mr(ν+δ)/(4πN))1/3Equation 4 where N is Avogadro's number (mol−1), δ is the g of H20/g of protein, and η is the solution viscosity. Solution densities, ρ, were measured experimentally using a Mettler DA110M density meter. Estimates of δ (25Kuntz I.E. J. Am. Chem.

Evidence supporting the hypothesis that Drosophila Rrp1 is organized into two domains/regions is represented schematically in Fig.1. Rrp1 derivatives truncated for each of the regions were constructed and characterized previously (12Sander M. Carter M. Huang S.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminally truncated mutant, which was stable and soluble, is deficient in nuclease function but competent with respect to its ability to renature single-stranded DNA. Strand transfer activity of this derivative can be restored if DNA 3′-exonuclease activity is provided in trans. The biological function of the N-terminally truncated mutant was also determined previously. The C-terminal 259-amino acid region of Rrp1 is sufficient to confer resistance to oxidative and alkylating agents when expressed in a repair-deficient strain of E. coli (11Gu L. Huang S.-M. Sander M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, unlike the C-terminally truncated mutant, when produced by recombinant methods, this mutant has poor solubility properties and was not purified or enzymatically characterized. The major human AP endonuclease, HAP1, shows 27% sequence identity and 58% sequence similarity to E. coli exonuclease III (30Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,31Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. Fortelle E.D.L. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). E. coli exonuclease III is a globular protein of 2-fold α/β symmetry as determined by its crystal structure (31Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. Fortelle E.D.L. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Based on this existing structural information and the homology alignment between HAP1 and E. coli exonuclease III, a model structure for HAP1 was constructed (30Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This model displayed a remarkable degree of overall structural conservation with the structure determined forE. coli exonuclease III. Recently, this model was confirmed when the crystal structure for HAP1 was solved (31Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. Fortelle E.D.L. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We predicted that the C-terminal region of Rrp1, which shows 37% sequence identity and 55% sequence similarity to E. coli exonuclease III, should, like HAP1, share structural conservation with E. coliexonuclease III and exist as a discrete globular domain. Limited proteolysis has been used by others to generate polypeptide fragments that reflect independently folded domains, often providing valuable information regarding structure-function relationships (32Manuel R.C. Czerwinski E.W. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16218-16226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Konigsberg W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether Rrp1 would be amenable to limited proteolysis. Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of Rrp1 digestion by protease V8 at two substrate:protease ratios. Undigested Rrp1 is shown in lane 1; the minor peptides observed are truncated products that co-purify with Rrp1. At a substrate:protease ratio of 200:1 (w/w), five discrete peptides are initially observed; over time, the intensity of the three faster migrating peptides increased (Fig. 2, lanes 2–5). When the ratio of substrate to protease is decreased 10-fold to 20:1 (w/w), the slower migrating peptides are less abundant throughout the time course, and the single fastest migrating polypeptide accumulates as the predominant species (Fig. 2,lanes 8 and 9). This single peptide is resistant to further digestion; if allowed to incubate in the presence of protease V8 an additional 14 h, the peptide is not degraded any further (data not shown). The apparent size of this peptide, based on relative mobility during SDS-PAGE, is reasonably close to the size predicted for the, C-terminal, E. coli exonuclease III homology region of Rrp1. Protease V8 is a serine protease that hydrolyzes peptide and ester bonds at the carboxylic side of glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues. The cleavage efficiency of glutamic acid as compared with aspartic acid is approximately 3000:1 (Boehringer Mannheim). 77 potential protease V8 cleavage sites (neglecting the relatively poor cleavage after aspartic acid residues) are found within Rrp1, 58 in the N-terminal region and 19 in the C-terminal region. The results in Fig.2 suggest that the protease-resistant peptide of Rrp1 is folded such that potential cleavage sites are inaccessible to protease V8. To test this hypothesis, digests were performed in the presence of a low concentration of SDS in order to disrupt the Rrp1 structure. Protease V8 is stable and active in the presence of 0.1% SDS (Boehringer Mannheim). However, this concentration of SDS is 20-fold higher than the concentration necessary to completely inactivate Rrp1 enzymatic functions. 3B. J. Reardon and M. Sander, unpublished result. Fig.3 shows that the presence of 0.1% and 0.01% SDS (lanes 3 and 4, respectively) eliminates the appearance of the protease-resistant peptide. In contrast, complete digestion of Rrp1 by protease V8 is observed, while the protease-resistant fragment of Rrp1 is detected in a reaction lacking SDS (Fig. 3, lane 2). Thus, t"

The two enzymes belong to a large family of eukaryotic protein kinases which share a common “kinase catalytic core” but exhibit varying regulatory mechanisms and specificities (8Hanks S.K. Hunter T.

Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). R2C2,inactive+4cAMP⇌2Cactive+R2·(cAMP)4Equation 1 This reversible reaction is a major component in cAMP-mediated signal transduction. There are two principal types of regulatory subunit, RI (43 kDa) and RII (45 kDa), which differ in both their tissue distributions and functional properties (11Corbin J.D. Keely S.L. Park C.R. J.

The x-ray crystallographic analyses that were conducted with the isolated catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase demonstrated the binding of a peptide substrate analogue at a site near the entrance to a bilobal cleft, which contains the ATP-binding region. One of the two lobes functions principally in nucleotide binding while the other larger lobe participates in peptide binding and catalysis (15Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Crystal studies with an overexpressed truncated form of the catalytically active γ subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which possesses 33% sequence identity with the catalytic core (residues 42–297) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, revealed a similar three-dimensional structure (18Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The “catalytic cores” of still other protein kinases have been modeled from the coordinates established by Knighton et al. (15Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). These enzymes include smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, which exhibits 30% sequence identity with the aligned 261-residue sequence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, which displays 46% identity with the aligned sequence of the smooth muscle enzyme (19Knighton D.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Noncovalently bound fluorescent ligands have facilitated dynamic solution studies of the interactions of numerous enzymes with their substrates and effectors (21Giuliano K.A. Post P.L. Hahn K.M. Taylor D.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 405-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Haughland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemical. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1996Google Scholar). For example, our laboratory employed the fluorescent dyes 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate in the monitoring and characterization of the glycogen phosphorylase b toa conversion (23Malencik D.A. Zhao Z. Anderson S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 24Seery V.L. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and 9-anthroylcholine in analyses of the binding equilibria of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (25Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Bohnert J.L. Shalitin Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4031-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,26Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fluorescent probe approach has been used infrequently with protein kinases. 5,5′-Bis[8-(phenylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonate] (bis(ANS)),1 a fluorescent dye that first was found to compete with NADH in binding by lactate dehydrogenase (27Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Lu F.J. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3479-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), also interacts with the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Association of the regulatory subunits with either cAMP or the catalytic subunit leads to the dissociation of a major portion of the previously bound bis(ANS) molecules. However, neither bis(ANS) nor the parent molecule 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonate affects nucleotide binding by the isolated catalytic subunit (29Bohnert J.L. Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Teller D. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5570-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 1,N 6-Ethenoadenosine cyclic 3′,5′-phosphate and lin-benzoadenosine 5′-phosphate are fluorescent nucleotide derivatives that have been applied to competitive displacement experiments with cAMP and the regulatory subunits (30Bohnert J.L. Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Teller D. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5563-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 31LaPorte D.C. Builder S.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2343-2349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with ATP and the isolated catalytic subunit (32Bhatnagar D. Roskoski Jr., R. Rosendahl M.S. Leonard N.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6310-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively. However, the emission spectrum and quantum yield of linbenzoadenosine 5′-phosphate do not change appreciably on complex formation facts which mean that fluorescence polarization measurements are required for the detection of binding. The highly fluorescent 1,N 6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate is simply not bound by the catalytic subunit (32Bhatnagar D. Roskoski Jr., R. Rosendahl M.S. Leonard N.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6310-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Overall, there is no noncovalent fluorescent probe that is known to be applicable to fluorescence intensity measurements with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The identification and application of a fluorescent probe that binds reversibly to either the “kinase catalytic core” or to a region that is functionally connected to the core are the objectives of the experiments described in this report. The studies are based on the premise that such a probe would be sensitive to subtle structural variations that exist among closely related protein kinases and to the binding of ligands and effectors by the enzymes that interact with the probe. Experiments with the isolated catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, and the catalytically active 33-kDa chymotryptic fragment derived from the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase show that 9-anthroylcholine undergoes selective binding by individual protein kinases. The investigation also considers the relationships between 9-anthroylcholine binding and the association of the isolated catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with substrates and effectors. The synthetic peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), salmine, ATP, ADP, AMP-PNP, cAMP, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. Sephacryl S-200 superfine gel filtration medium was obtained from Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ. Histone H2A was supplied by Calbiochem, Inc. 9-Anthroylcholine was supplied by Molecular Probes, Inc. All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. Buffers were prepared from distilled water that had undergone a final purification in a Milli-Q reagent water system. Most of the experiments were performed in a buffer containing 5.0 mm MOPS, 0.10 m KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2 (in the nucleotide binding determinations), 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3, 25 °C. The catalytic subunit of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase was prepared from bovine heart as described by Peters et al. (33Peters K.A. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5691-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), with the modifications outlined in our earlier report (30Bohnert J.L. Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Teller D. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5563-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Final enzyme fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration with an immersible ultrafiltration unit (Millipore Immersible CX NMWL 10,000 daltons), dialyzed against 1 volume of glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 23 μmol of32P/min/mg in the catalytic assay employing Malantide as phosphate acceptor (34Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RII was prepared from bovine heart essentially as described by Dills et al. (35Dills W.L. Goodwin C.D. Lincoln T.M. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Corbin J.D. Krebs E.G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 199-217PubMed Google Scholar). Regulatory subunit free of cAMP was prepared according to Builder et al. (36Builder S.E. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2350-2354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP-free RI from bovine skeletal muscle was a generous gift from Dr. Janice Bohnert. As detailed by Bohnertet al. (30Bohnert J.L. Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Teller D. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5563-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), both RI and RII were fractionated on Sephacryl S-200 in order to remove aggregates. Myosin light chain kinase was prepared from both smooth muscle (turkey gizzard) and striated muscle (rabbit skeletal) as described, respectively, by Sobieszek and Barlko (37Sobieszek A. Barlko B. Stephens N.L. Smooth Muscle Contraction. Marcel Dekker, New York1985: 283-316Google Scholar) and Blumenthal and Stull (38Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5608-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The two purified enzymes exhibited the expectedapparent molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis—90,000 (skeletal) and 135,000 (smooth). No lower molecular weight components were detected. Catalytic assays showed nearly absolute calmodulin dependence, with specific activities of 12.5 μmol of 32P/mg for the smooth muscle enzyme (see Ref. 25Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Bohnert J.L. Shalitin Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4031-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and 7.1 μmol of 32P/min/mg for the skeletal muscle enzyme (38Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5608-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the myosin light chain kinases were verified in stoichiometric fluorescence titrations of dansylcalmodulin and in titrations performed in the presence of 9-anthroylcholine in the case of the smooth muscle enzyme (25Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Bohnert J.L. Shalitin Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4031-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 33-kDa catalytically active chymotryptic fragment of rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase (30 μmol of 32P/min/mg) was prepared and assayed according to the method of Malencik et al. (39Malencik D.A. Zhao Z. Anderson S.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 31-43Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar); telokin was isolated from turkey gizzard following the protocol of Itoet al.(40Ito M. Dabrowska R. Guerriero Jr., V. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13971-13974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); calmodulin was purified from bovine brain as described by Schreiber et al. (41Schreiber W.E. Sasagawa T. Titani K. Wade R.D. Malencik D. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); and rabbit skeletal muscle troponin I was prepared according to Kerrick et al. (42Kerrick W.G. Malencik D.A. Hoar P.E. Potter J.D. Coby R.L. Pocinwong S. Fischer E.H. Pflugers Arch. 1980; 386: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All proteins were 95% or more homogeneous in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The concentration was routinely determined by UV absorption using values of A280 nm0.1%, 1 cm = 1.49 for C (33Peters K.A. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5691-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), 0.80 for RI (36Builder S.E. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2350-2354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 0.60 for RII (43Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. West L. Flockhart D.A. Lincoln T.M. McCarthy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3997-4003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 0.20 for calmodulin (44Watterson D.M. Sharief F. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 962-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 0.90 for the catalytic fragment of phosphorylase kinase (39Malencik D.A. Zhao Z. Anderson S.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 31-43Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and 1.1 for myosin light chain kinase (45Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following molecular masses were used to calculate molarity from protein concentration: C = 40.8 kDa, RI = 43 kDa, RII = 45 kDa (see review by Taylor et al. (10Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar)), CaM = 16.7 kDa (44Watterson D.M. Sharief F. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); and skeletal muscle MLCK = 65 kDa (49Takio K. Blumenthal D.K. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8049-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Measurements of fluorescence anisotropy (r = (I ∥ −I ⊥)/(I ∥ + 2I ⊥) and total fluorescence intensity (I ∥ + 2I ⊥) were obtained by using the SLM 4000 fluorescence polarization spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 365 nm, which is close to an absorption maximum for 9-anthroylcholine. For maximum sensitivity in the polarization measurements, the fluorescence was observed through a Schott-KV filter with either a 418- or 389-nm cutoff limit. Quartz fluorescence cuvettes (previously treated with 1% dichlorodimethylsilane in chloroform) of 2-, 5-, or 10-mm path length were used throughout the experiments. By using differing path lengths, we obtained a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and the concentration of free 9-anthroylcholine up to concentrations of ∼50 μm. The performance of the binding experiments and the data analyses are the same as those that we described previously for smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (25Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Bohnert J.L. Shalitin Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4031-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Side by side comparisons were made of the fluorescence intensities of the enzyme/9AC mixtures (F) with the fluorescence of the standard containing the equivalent concentrations of 9AC (F 0). Computerized analyses for the determination of dissociation constants and maximum fluorescence changes employed Graph Pad Prism version 2.01 software. Fluorescence emission spectra, corrected for the wavelength dependence of grating transmission and detector response, were determined with the Perkin-Elmer LS-50 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Both fluorometers were connected to circulating constant temperature baths (±0.1 °C). Direct determinations of the quantities of 9-anthroylcholine bound by the isolated catalytic subunit were obtained with the Beckman XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge (50Schachman H.K. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society for Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar,51Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 887-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The sedimentation of the solutions was carried out at 40,000 rpm and monitored at 362 nm (an absorption maximum of 9AC) and at either 280 or 295 nm, depending on protein concentration. The samples analyzed included the three different concentrations of C-subunit (0.9, 1.8, and 3.7 mg/ml), sedimented in both the presence and absence of 100 μm 9AC, and a reference containing only 100 μm 9AC, which does not sediment. The reference sectors of the cells contained the buffer blank (0.10 m KCl, 10 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.3). The sedimentation monitored at any of the three wavelengths demonstrated a single component withs 20,w = 3.3 S. Measurement of the absorbance at 362 nm of the supernatant solution and of the plateau region, performed after the boundaries were well separated from the meniscus and with radial dilution correction applied, yielded the proportions of free and bound dye. The emission spectra shown in theinset to Fig. 1 demonstrate the large changes in fluorescence that occur when the catalytic subunit (C) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (2.5 μm) is added to a solution containing 5.0 μm9-anthroylcholine (9AC). Since these effects resemble those reported for smooth muscle MLCK, we followed the protocol established with that enzyme in order to determine a dissociation constant (K 2 = [9AC][C]/[C-9AC]) for the C subunit·9AC complex (25Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Bohnert J.L. Shalitin Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4031-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the relative fluorescence intensities (F) found in titrations of a fixed concentration (2.0 μm) of enzyme with varying quantities of 9ACversus those obtained in titrations of buffer alone. The smooth curve through the data points was calculated for a simple equilibrium PX ⇌ P + X with K 2 = 21.9 ± 0.7 μm (χ2 = 0.999) and for a difference between the fluorescence intensities of totally free and bound 9AC at saturation of 7.0. The relative values of K 2 and of the concentration of the C-subunit are consistent with the assumption made in the computations that, within experimental error, most of the 9AC is unbound. Corrections for binding based on the premise that the C-subunit has one 9AC site reduceK 2 to 20.9 μm. The dissociation constant of the C-subunit·9AC complex is close to that reported for smooth muscle MLCK (17.1 μm) (26Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also performed analytical ultracentrifugation experiments in order to compare the directly determined concentration of bound 9-anthroylcholine to the quantity that is predicted for a single binding site with K d = 21 μm. To ensure that a significant fraction of dye was bound, the measurements were made at protein concentrations that equal or exceed the value ofK d (0.9 to 3.7 mg/ml). The comparisons given in Table I show that the calculated and observed values of, the average number of moles of 9AC bound per mole isolated catalytic subunit are similar.Table I9-Anthroylcholine binding by the isolated catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase[C-subunit]Additionsn̄ aValue determined by analytical ultracentrifugation.n̄ bValue calculated from results of fluorescence titrations.mg/ml0.9None0.74 ± .060.801.8None0.72 ± .030.763.7None0.57 ± .010.663.71.0 mmMgATP0.24 ± .030.04cValue calculated for purely competitive displacement withK 1 = 11 μm and K 2 = 21 μm.The following conditions were used: 0.10 m KCl, 10 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2.0 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm 9-anthroylcholine, pH 7.3 (12 °C).a Value determined by analytical ultracentrifugation.b Value calculated from results of fluorescence titrations.c Value calculated for purely competitive displacement withK 1 = 11 μm and K 2 = 21 μm.

Fluorescence titrations with skeletal muscle MLCK and the 33-kDa catalytically active fragment of the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase 2The chymotryptic fragment of phosphorylase kinase is in fact a mixture of three fragments containing residues 1–290, 1–296, and 1–298 of the 44.7-kDa γ-subunit (45Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpressed truncated form of the γ-subunit contains residues 1–298 (18Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). show little detectable interaction with 9AC (Fig. 1). Since the fluorescence intensity of 9AC does not necessarily change on binding, we also determined the fluorescence anisotropies of the samples. The complex of smooth muscle MLCK with 9AC has an anisotropy under these conditions of 0.147 while free 9AC has a value of 0.067 (25Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Bohnert J.L. Shalitin Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4031-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The anisotropies obtained with skeletal MLCK and the 32-kDa phosphorylase kinase fragment are close to the latter value (not shown), verifying that little association with 9AC takes place. Telokin, an independently expressed protein containing the last 154 amino acid residues of smooth muscle MLCK (40Ito M. Dabrowska R. Guerriero Jr., V. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13971-13974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also fails to bind 9AC. Since the binding of 9AC by smooth muscle MLCK is strongly calmodulin-dependent, with K 2decreasing from 17.1 to 3.8 μm in solutions containing calmodulin (Ca2+) and 0.10 m KCl (26Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we considered whether a similar effect may occur with skeletal muscle MLCK. Fig. 2 illustrates the changes in fluorescence that are detected when calmodulin is added stepwise to solutions of 5 μm 9AC containing either skeletal or smooth muscle MLCK or buffer alone. Note that the titration of 9AC that is performed in the absence of the enzymes results in a linear increase in fluorescence that is due to the Ca2+-dependent binding of four to six 9AC molecules by calmodulin, with an average K d ≅ 440 μm (52LaPorte D.C. Wierman B.M. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3814-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). As we previously reported (25Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Bohnert J.L. Shalitin Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4031-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the initial fluorescence of the solution containing smooth muscle MLCK is enhanced (F/F 0 = 6.6) and the initial rate of increase in intensity obtained upon CaM addition is 2.4-fold greater than that observed when CaM is added to 9AC alone. When skeletal muscle MLCK is present, on the other hand, the initial rate of increase in intensity observed upon CaM addition is only ∼25% of that obtained in the titration of 9AC with CaM. However, the slopes approach the latter value after the end point of 1 mol of CaM/mol of either smooth or skeletal muscle MLCK is reached. Decreases in the fluorescence of CaM/9AC mixtures were found p"
