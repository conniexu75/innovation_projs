https://openalex.org/W1991125864,"Formation flight of birds improves aerodynamic efficiency. Theoretically, 25 birds could have a range increase of about 70 percent as compared with a lone bird, the advantage being more pronounced when there is a tail wind. A vee formation is required to equally distribute the drag saving, and, contrary to other statements, the lead bird does not necessarily have the most strenuous position. The angle of the predicted vee compares with that observed in nature; stability mechanisms are described which make it easy and natural for the bird to sense optimal formations."

The formation of rouleaux increases the effective volume of erythrocytes as a result of (i) the increase in axial ratio and (ii) the limitation of deformation of individual erythrocytes. The effective cell volume is the fundamental determinant of blood viscosity."
https://openalex.org/W2156873390,An improved procedure for the isolation of the A protein of lactose synthetase is presented. The Km for UDP-galactose is not influenced by the concentration of glucose or α-lactalbumin but these compounds alter the maximum velocity of the reaction. There is a reciprocal relationship between the concentration of glucose and α-lactalbumin in the lactose synthetase assay and α-lactalbumin lowers the apparent Km of glucose. It is suggested that the physiological function of α-lactalbumin is to lower the Km of glucose so that it may be used maximally for the synthesis of lactose. Lactose may be synthesized at maximum rates by the A protein in the absence of α-lactalbumin but in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. Different preparations of the A protein have variable activities.
https://openalex.org/W2024172175,"Mean maximum nestling weight of purple martins decreased with increase in brood size from three to five. Martins in the absence of acarine nest parasites produced young heavier than parasitized young of the same brood size; in addition, unparasitized nestlings tended to reach a maximum weight equivalent to that of young in parasitized broods of one less member. Modal brood size for parasitized and unparasitized martins was four, but there was a significant trend toward production of broods of five by mite-free birds, and of broods of three by parasitized parents. This suggests a potentially important role for nest parasitism in the determination of clutch size in martins and other birds."

Extension from the reported secondary structure requires arguments and data relating to ester orientation, direction of coiling, side-chain orientation, and conformational stability. Conformation of the valinomycin-potassium ion complex provides a clear-cut example in which elucidation of conformation is sufficient to gain an understanding of molecular function which, in this case, is selective ion transport by a carrier mechanism."

This is more than twice the concentration found in total cell lipids. The resistance of these lipids to hydrolytic enzymes suggests that they increase the stability of the surface membranes.

https://openalex.org/W1578203661,"Crystalline turkey egg white lysozyme has been prepared by a simple procedure consisting of adsorption on carboxymethylcellulose followed by elution with (NH4)2CO3 solution and crystallization from 5% NaCl solution. The twice crystallized enzyme gave a single peak when eluted from carboxymethylcellulose, and it migrated as a single band during disc electrophoresis. Separation of the tryptic peptides from reduced and S-carboxymethylated turkey egg white lysozyme has yielded peptides analogous to those of reduced and S-carboxymethylated chicken egg white lysozyme. It is found that the turkey enzyme amino acid sequence differs from that of the chicken lysozyme at a minimum of seven positions which are distributed over six of these tryptic peptides. The replacements detected from examination of these peptides are: Tyr for Phe3, Leu for His15, His for Gln41, Lys for Arg73, Ala for Val99, Gly for Asp101, and His for Gln121 of the chicken egg white lysozyme. The apparent occurrence of glycine as Residue 101 of turkey egg white lysozyme is especially interesting inasmuch as the x-ray crystallographic investigation of chicken egg white lysozyme and its complexes with certain inhibitors has led to the view that the carboxyl group of Asp101 is involved in binding substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2073599649,"The median giant fiber and the pair of lateral giant fibers that run the length of the ventral nerve cord in earthworms were thought to arise by fusion of the axons of several nerve cells in each segment. The structure of these giant fibers has now been examined with a fluorescent dye injected into single fibers. Each giant axon connects to one cell body in each segment; the giant fibers are not fused axons. In each segment, the median giant fiber has three branches and each lateral giant fiber has five branches. These branches are presumably dendritic. No structural differences between the giant fibers in anterior and posterior regions of the worm seem to account for the functional polarity of the giant fiber system observed in behavioral studies."

The adult volume is estimated to have been 440 cubic centimeters. This value, plus other redeterminations of australopithecine endocasts, lowers the average to 442 cubic centimeters, and increase the likelihood of statistically significant differences from both robust australopithecines and the Olduvai Gorge hominid No. 7."
https://openalex.org/W2018518237,Human embryonic cells are highly susceptible to infection with feline leukemia and sarcoma viruses. These viruses were propagated in human cultures without antigenic modification or loss of infectivity for cat or human cells. Virus stocks contained at least 10(6) infectious units of virus per milliliter for human cells. Virus present in 10(-6) dilution of virus stock replicated to detectable amounts as early as 7 days after virus infection. The feline sarcoma virus induced morphological transformation of human cells.
https://openalex.org/W1991129886,"The relation of collagen synthesis to experimentally induced arteriosclerosis was studied by measuring proline hydroxylase activity. Gross aortic plaques were produced in rabbits by daily injection of epinephrine (intravenous) and thyroxine (intraperitoneal) for 4, 9, or 14 days. Activity of proline hydroxylase was significantly increased after 4 days of treatment and reached a peak, five- to sixfold increase, after 14 days of treatment. The increase in enzyme activity was correlated with the severity of observed arteriosclerosis. Increase in proline hydroxylase activity may be a possible biochemical defect in the aortas of rabbits with arteriosclerosis induced by injury."

Intraperitoneal administration of tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine) into newborn animals advances the appearance of porphyrin in the gland. Conversely, a single injection of cortisol acetate into newborns retards the appearance of porphyrin. The time of porphyrin appearance in the gland parallels the time for maturation of the evoked cortical response to visual stimulation in normal and hormone-treated animals."
https://openalex.org/W1520999168,"Abstract This paper presents evidence that the pathway by which d-fructose is metabolized in Aerobacter aerogenes PRL-R3 depends on whether it is presented to the cells extracellularly as the free hexose or intracellularly as a product of sucrose hydrolysis. Whereas the metabolism of exogenously supplied d-fructose is mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate:d-fructose 1-phosphotransferase system and d-fructose 1-phosphate kinase (ATP:d-fructose 1-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase), the metabolism of the d-fructose moiety of sucrose is mediated by a specific d-fructokinase (ATP:d-fructose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.4) that is preferentially induced by sucrose. Conclusions drawn from studies with the wild type strain were supported by an analysis of mutants lacking d-fructokinase, d-fructose 1-phosphate kinase, or both of these enzymes. However, in contrast with the wild type, the mutant which lacks d-fructokinase metabolizes the d-fructose moiety of sucrose via d-fructose 1-phosphate rather than d-fructose 6-phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1531459376,"Abstract Crystals of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin were treated with 0.2 m sodium bromoacetate in concentrated ammonium sulfate solution at pH 6.8 for 10 days. The product obtained after dissolving the crystals retained most of the physical properties of the unmodified protein, except for the development of a small number of electrophoretic components representing an increment of about six to eight net negative charges on the average, judged at pH 9.2. The most fully studied preparation contained 6.4, 2.7, 2.0, and 0.8 residue per molecule of histidine, 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine, 3-carboxymethylhistidine, and 1-carboxymethylhistidine, respectively. The amino-terminal valyl residue was largely alkylated. Between 1 and 2 residues of lysine were alkylated. No modification of methionine was detected. After removal of heme the modified protein was subjected to cleavage by trypsin and chymotrypsin and the peptides were isolated by chromatography on ion exchange resins and, as required, by paper chromatography or paper electrophoresis. The state of alkylation of 10 of the 12 histidyl residues was established by quantitative estimation of the yields of appropriate tryptic and chymotryptic peptides. The state of residue 12 was determined qualitatively, and that of residue 113 surmised by difference. The following residues were recovered as unmodified histidine: 24, 48, 82, 93, and 97. Residue 119 was recovered primarily in the unmodified form but partly as 1-carboxymethylhistidine. The following residues were recovered primarily or exclusively as 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine: 12, 81, 114, and 116. Residue 116 was recovered partly as 3-carboxymethylhistidine. Residue 36 was recovered in high yield exclusively as 3-carboxymethylhistidine. Without exception these results appear to conform to the implications of the crystalline structure reported by Kendrew and Watson when account is taken of the geometry of interactions between neighboring myoglobin molecules in the crystal lattice."

https://openalex.org/W2130623892,"Abstract Uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2) from yeast was activated by cations, such as Na+, Mg2+, and a series of quaternary amines, among which spermine was the most effective. The activation by spermine could be explained by a decrease in the Km of the enzyme for uridine diphosphate galactose. Studies of sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge indicated that uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase could assume three distinct states of aggregation, represented by averaged, unextrapolated sedimentation coefficients of approximately (a) 3.6 S, (b) 6.5 S, and (c) 10.9 S. These corresponded to (a) inactive enzyme, titrated with p-chloromercuribenzoate, (b) partially active enzyme, in solutions of low cation concentration, and (c) fully active enzyme, in the presence of relatively high concentrations of activating cations. Analysis of sedimentation equilibria together with previously published information on the molecular weight of the 6.5 S species (Darrow, R. A., and Rodstrom, R., Biochemistry, 7, 1645 (1968)) indicated that the three stages of aggregation are caused by a successive binary association of subunits, resulting in molecular weights of (a) 60,000, (b) 125,000, and (c) 250,000. Some preparations of uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase contained a form of the protein which did not associate to a molecular weight of 250,000 from 125,000, regardless of the cation concentration. This nonassociating form, which still was partially activated by cations, could be separated from the associating form, to a limited extent, by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose."
https://openalex.org/W1539034169,"The amino acid sequence of Chromatium ferredoxin was determined by studies of thermolysin peptides of S-carboxymethylcysteinylferredoxin and chymotryptic peptides of oxidized ferredoxin. The 81 amino acid residues in the molecule have the following sequence: Ala-Leu-Met-Ile-Thr-Asp-Gln-Cys-Ile-Asn-Cys-Asn-Val-Cys-Gln-Pro-Glu-Cys-Pro-Asn-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser-Gln-Gly-Asp-Glu-Thr-Tyr-Val-Ile-Glu-Pro-Ser-Leu-Cys-Thr-Glu-Cys-Val-Gly-His-Tyr-Glu-Thr-Ser-Gln-Cys-Val-Asp-Cys-Val-Glu-Val-Cys-Pro-Ile-Lys-Asp-Pro-Ser-His-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Asp-Glu-Leu-Arg-Ala-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Arg-Ile-Thr-Gly-Glu-Gly. The molecular weight, excluding iron and inorganic sulfide, was calculated to be 8943. The 9 cysteinyl residues are located in a somewhat different manner from those of the ferredoxins of nonphotosynthetic bacteria. However, this sequence is apparently homologous to those of nonphotosynthetic bacterial ferredoxins. Some structural features of bacterial ferredoxins are compared."

https://openalex.org/W1608503145,"Abstract When Lactobacillus plantarum is cultured in a medium containing certain fatty acids, the synthesis of fatty acid by the organism is reduced. Of the fatty acids tested, oleic and cis-vaccenic acids exert the most pronounced inhibition, but significant inhibition is also produced by palmitoleic, lactobacillic, elaidic, linoleic, and eicosenoic acids. Linolenic acid, petroselenic acid, and the saturated fatty acids, myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids, have little or no such effect. The exogenous fatty acids are incorporated into the cellular lipids, thus altering the fatty acid composition. Experimental evidence suggests that the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis is a consequence of repression of enzyme synthesis. There is no evidence to suggest feedback inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. The activities of both acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase are considerably reduced. When L. plantarum is grown in the presence of oleic acid, the activity of the fatty acid synthetase drops below one-twentieth of its normal level. The level of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase also decreases, but to what precise extent remains undetermined because of the low activity of this enzyme in crude extracts. Several of the component enzymes of the fatty acid synthetase (the malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase, the acetyl, malonyl-ACP condensing enzyme, the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, the β-hydroxybutyryl-ACP dehydrase, the β-hydroxyoctanoyl-ACP dehydrase, and the enoyl-ACP reductase) are reduced by 5 to 6 times when cells are grown in the presence of oleic acid—which suggests that the synthesis of these enzymes is under some form of coordinate control. The synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid is repressed more than the synthesis of saturated fatty acid, suggesting that the enzyme(s) required solely for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid is under a different level of control. The amount of the acyl carrier protein is also regulated since cells grown in the presence of oleic acid contain reduced levels of acyl carrier protein."

https://openalex.org/W1582917959,"Abstract The regulatory enzyme, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase of Rhodomicrobium vannielii was studied. Both phenylalanine and tyrosine are competitive inhibitors with respect to the substrate, erythrose 4-phosphate. Tryptophan does not influence enzyme activity per se, but potentiates the effect of phenylalanine or tyrosine. Kinetic experiments led to the conclusion that alternative kinetic pathways to the ternary complex existed, and that the one forming (phosphoenolpyruvate-enzyme) as the initial binary complex was kinetically preferred. Accordingly, the ratio of the two substrates had a marked influence upon reaction velocity. The observed ability of phenylalanine and tyrosine to either activate or inhibit enzyme activity, depending upon the ratio of the two substrates was consistent with the postulated mechanism. An extremely wide range of enzyme activity exists, on the one hand, because of the stimulation of activity by one or two amino acid end products, and on the other hand, because of the potent concerted inhibition in the simultaneous presence of all three amino acids. The physiological consequences of this pattern of control for 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase are discussed."

This differs from the carboxyl-terminal structure in aldolase isolated from tissue which had been frozen and thawed. Amino acid analyses, ultracentrifugation, and digestion with carboxypeptidase suggest that the difference is the result of a limited carboxypeptidase-like proteolytic digestion promoted by the freezing and thawing procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1591478960,"Abstract Cyanferrihemoglobin Bibba (α2136 pro(H19)β2) was found by sedimentation velocity and viscosity measurements to be extensively dissociated into dimers in dilute salt solution at neutral pH. The dissociation constant in 0.1 m NaCl, at pH 7.2 and 25°, is about 500 x 10-6 m. The deoxy form is likely more associated than the cyanferri derivative. The cyanferri derivative of this hemoglobin variant is relatively stable in buffers of neutral and alkaline pH and low ionic strength. At pH 10.7, hemoglobins Bibba and A are both primarily dimers. At this pH, hemoglobin A maintains a compact, globular structure, while hemoglobin Bibba undergoes some type of molecular expansion or unfolding. At pH 4.9, the highly dissociated hemoglobin Bibba is unstable and precipitates readily."

https://openalex.org/W2157324449,"Abstract dl-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in low concentrations has been found to be a time-dependent inhibitor of aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) isozymes. The cationic isozyme is more susceptible than the anionic isozyme to this inhibition. The l-isomer of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was as effective as the d-isomer for each isozyme. Study of various glycolytic intermediates indicated that the conjoint presence of the free aldehyde group and the phosphoryl residue of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was necessary for inhibition. The extent of inhibition was dependent on the duration of preliminary incubation, the concentration of glyceraldehyde-3-P, and the pH of the preliminary incubation mixture, but was independent of the concentration of enzyme. Half-maximum inhibition of each isozyme was obtained between pH 6.5 and 6.7. Maximum inhibition of the anionic isozyme was obtained at pH values of 8.4 and above, while the cationic isozyme was optimally inhibited at pH 7.4. The presence of α-ketoglutarate in the preliminary incubation mixture decreased inhibition while aspartate accentuated it. After 30 min of preliminary incubation with glyceraldehyde-3-P, dialysis of the anionic isozyme against buffer, aspartate, α-ketoglutarate, or pyridoxal 5-phosphate resulted in a substantial release of inhibition. In the case of the cationic isozyme, substantial release of inhibition was obtained only by dialysis against α-ketoglutarate. The addition of α-ketoglutarate to either the anionic or cationic isozyme-inhibitor preliminary incubation mixtures released inhibition, but only in the case of the anionic isozyme was the extent of release dependent on the duration of preliminary incubation. Prolonged incubation of this isozyme with glyceraldehyde-3-P resulted in the appearance of a second phase of inhibition. The mechanism of the inhibition of the isozymes by glyceraldehyde-3-P is discussed."
