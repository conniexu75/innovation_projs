https://openalex.org/W1562457256,"A sphingomyelin (SM)-signaling cycle has been described in human leukemia-derived HL-60 cells (Okazaki, T., Bell, R.M., and Hannun, Y.A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). Activation of the cycle by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) occurs rapidly, with peak levels of approximately 30% SM hydrolysis observed within 45-60 min. The mechanisms by which TNF alpha induces this SM turnover remain largely unexplored. In this study, arachidonic acid (AA) was investigated as a potential mediator of TNF alpha effects on SM turnover. In HL-60 cells, 30 nM TNF alpha stimulated the release of AA within 5-10 min. In turn, AA stimulated SM hydrolysis and concomitant ceramide generation within 20 min of addition to cells. Other fatty acids, notably oleate, mimicked the effects of AA on SM hydrolysis, but the methyl ester and alcohol analogs of fatty acids were inactive. Diacylglycerol, a candidate mediator of TNF alpha responses, AA activated a cytosolic sphingomyelinase dose dependently, with 10-100 microM AA including 3-4-fold activation, thus suggesting a direct effect of AA on sphingomyelinase. Melittin, a potent phospholipase A2 activator, induced SM hydrolysis at concentrations as low as 35 nM. However, unlike AA, melittin was unable to stimulate sphingomyelinase activation in an in vitro assay system. Finally, exogenous addition of AA also produced antiproliferative effects reminiscent of ceramide effects. Thus, a role for the phospholipase A2/AA pathway in mediating TNF alpha induction of the SM cycle is supported by multiple lines of evidence. These studies begin to elucidate a mechanism of TNF alpha signaling and identify a close relationship between glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid signaling. AA, therefore, may be pivotal to understanding the sphingomyelin-signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1568294354,"The synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin has been implicated in the docking and subsequent calcium-regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. We demonstrate that synaptotagmin is a major constituent of synaptic vesicle membranes, comprising 7-8% of the total vesicle protein. A proteolytic fragment of synaptotagmin, containing two repeats homologous to the C2-domain of protein kinase C, bound to a variety of natural membranes in a calcium-dependent manner (EC50 approximately 30 microM calcium). Binding was insensitive to proteolysis of the acceptor membranes suggesting an interaction with the lipid constituents. This interaction was confirmed using a recombinant fusion protein, containing both C2-like domains of synaptotagmin, that bound to artificial liposomes in a calcium-dependent manner. Phospholipid binding properties were preserved in a 114-amino acid domain corresponding to the first C2-like repeat of the protein and represents the shortest functional cassette yet reported. Furthermore, deletion of a highly conserved 9-amino acid motif, within this region, was sufficient to abolish the calcium-dependent phospholipid binding properties of this domain. This mutation may provide a means to selectively disrupt individual C2-domains in order to assess their relative contributions to function."
https://openalex.org/W1530129745,"Growth factors stimulate the Na+/H+ exchange activity (NHE1 human isoform) and at the same time increase the phosphorylation state of the exchanger at serine residues. To determine the role of NHE1 phosphorylation, a set of deletion and point mutants has been generated. Functional characterization of deletion mutants expressed in fibroblastic cells revealed that the cytoplasmic region between amino acids 567 and 635 is required for both growth factor-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization and maintenance of high intracellular pH (pHi) sensitivity. In contrast to the loss of growth factor activation and pHi sensitivity caused by the deletion of amino acids 567-635, the same deletion had no apparent effect on the pattern of growth factor-induced phosphorylation. In addition, individual replacement of any of the serine residues between amino acids 567 and 635 with alanine also had no effect on growth factor activation of the exchange activity. Comparison of phosphopeptide maps for the wild type with those for the internal deletion mutant exchangers and the expressed cytoplasmic domain revealed that all major in vivo phosphorylation sites including growth factor-sensitive ones map to the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 636-815). Deletion of these sites preserves high pHi sensitivity and reduces by only 50% growth factor-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization. Taken together, these data support the existence of a mechanism not requiring direct phosphorylation of NHE1, by which growth factor signals transmit to the H(+)-sensor and control the set point value of the exchanger. We propose that a regulatory factor(s) controls NHE1, presumably through its interaction with the critical cytoplasmic region prior to amino acid 635."
https://openalex.org/W1501884416,"The EnvM protein was purified from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain. It showed NADH-dependent enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase activity using both crotonyl-ACP and crotonyl-CoA as substrates. The protein bound a radioactive diazaborine derivative in the presence of NAD+ and radioactive NAD+ in the presence of the drug. Based on these data, it is concluded that EnvM is the NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase (EC 1.3.1.9) of E. coli and we propose to rename the corresponding gene fabI."
https://openalex.org/W1572134094,"We have previously reported that insulin increases fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene transcription, and that sequences responsible for positive regulation are located within the first 332 base pairs of the FAS promoter. To define minimal sequences required for insulin regulation within this region, chimeric constructs containing serial 5' deletions starting at -318 and extending through position +67 of the rat FAS gene ligated to the luciferase reporter gene were transfected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin treatment at 10 nM increased luciferase activity 2-3-fold in 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with constructs containing progressive deletions from -318 to -67. This stimulation of the FAS promoter activity by insulin was dose-dependent. However, no effect of insulin was observed when fusion constructs containing FAS promoter sequences spanning from -25 or from -19 to +67 were transfected into adipocytes. These results suggest that the insulin response sequences of the FAS gene may be located in the region from -67 to -25. DNase I footprinting using liver nuclear extracts revealed a protected region spanning -71 and -50 in addition to a region near the putative TATA box. Gel mobility shift assays using the sequence from -71 to -50 as a probe revealed nuclear factor(s) from mouse liver and 3T3-L1 adipocytes that specifically complexed with this sequence. Mutational analysis of this region showed that sequences between -68 and -60 are essential for recognition and interaction with a trans-acting factor(s). Moreover, when three tandem repeats of the sequences spanning -68 to -52 were linked to the SV40 promoter and used for transfection, luciferase activity increased 3.6-fold in response to insulin treatment. Thus, we have identified novel cis-acting DNA sequences responsible for insulin regulation of the FAS gene, which interact with nuclear protein(s) from liver and adipocytes and which are found to share limited homology to insulin response sequences present in other genes."
https://openalex.org/W1668266668,"Ash/Grb-2 is an adaptor protein composed only of Src homology (SH) 2 and SH3 domains that is considered to be essential for Ras activation. To clarify the downstream of Ash signaling, we investigated Ash-bound proteins. Ash-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were used to affinity-purify proteins bound to Ash. We found 180-, 150-, 100-, and 70-kDa proteins bound to GST-Ash, among which the 100 kDa protein was found to be dynamin by amino acid sequencing and Western blot with anti-dynamin antibody. Next, the in vitro and in vivo associations between Ash and dynamin were examined using PC12 cells. Dynamin in PC12 cell lysates bound to GST-Ash independent of NGF treatment. Also, Ash and dynamin co-precipitated when cell lysates of PC12 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ash antibody or anti-dynamin antibody. Using various GST-Ash constructs, we studied the importance of the individual domains in binding and found that the SH3 domain is necessary for binding. This binding was inhibited by a synthetic peptide (GPPQVPSRPNRC, amino acids 827-838 in dynamin). These data show that Ash SH3 domains bind to the proline-rich region of dynamin. Considering the function of dynamin in membrane trafficking, Ash may regulate endocytosis in addition to Ras activation."
https://openalex.org/W1589005530,"A clone has been isolated from a Chinese hamster ovary cell cDNA expression library that complements mutant cells defective in the uptake of the folate analogue methotrexate. When transfected with this clone, the mutant cells regain the ability to bind and transport the drug and, as a consequence, become sensitive to its cytotoxic action. The clone is 2314 base pairs long and has an open reading frame of 1557 base pairs that codes for a putative protein of 58 kDa. This novel putative protein has a high content of hydrophobic residues and has a large part of its predicted secondary structure in the form of beta-sheets. In the wild-type cell line and in one of the mutant cell lines, this clone detects an mRNA of 2.5 kilobases, while in another mutant cell line, this message is absent. The data are consistent with this clone encoding either the reduced folate transporter or an auxiliary function that interacts with this transporter. This is the first report of a cDNA coding for a function, other than folate-binding protein, that is involved in the transport of methotrexate."
https://openalex.org/W1529000927,"Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases have two distinct enzymatic activities in the biosynthesis of prostanoids: a peroxidase and a fatty acid oxygenase. Hydroperoxides, such as the cyclooxygenase reaction product, prostaglandin G2, act both as substrates for the synthase peroxidase and as obligatory initiators of the cyclooxygenase reaction itself. A mechanistic scheme was devised to describe the interactions between the two activities of the synthase. This mechanism was based on a heme-dependent peroxidase mechanism such as that observed with horseradish peroxidase and initiation of the cyclooxygenase reaction by intramolecular reaction with a peroxidase intermediate. Rate equations derived from the mechanism were numerically integrated by an interactive computer program that consolidated the diverse phenomena to provide quantitative predictions of the reaction kinetics of the synthase. The predictions agreed well with experimental observations of the purified ovine seminal vesicle enzyme under a wide variety of conditions, including inhibition by exogenous hydroperoxide scavenger and by cyanide, stimulation by exogenous hydroperoxide, and inhibition of eicosapentaenoic acid oxygenation under conditions where arachidonic acid reacts rapidly. The detailed analyses of reaction kinetics made possible with the computer simulation provide important insights into the interactions between the two catalytic activities of the synthase in the control of prostaglandin biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1555657815,"The receptor for prolactin (PRL) is a member of the hematopoietic receptor family that also includes the receptors for interleukins 2-7. PRL is synthesized and is secreted by human T lymphocytes and acts as a lymphokine necessary, but not sufficient, for T lymphocyte progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Although data now indicate that PRL serves an immunomodulatory role in vitro and in vivo, the mechanisms of PRL receptor signal transduction in T cells have not been defined. We demonstrate here that PRL induced the phosphorylation of the p72-74 serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1 in the PRL-dependent rat T-cell line Nb2. Associated with this inducible phosphorylation of Raf-1 was a concentration- and time-dependent activation of in vitro Raf-1 autokinase and substrate kinase activities, which correlated with the PRL-induced proliferation of Nb2 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed association of Raf-1 with PRL receptors in Nb2 cells. These results revealed that all isoforms of the PRL receptor (short, intermediate, and long) are expressed in Nb2 cells and associate with Raf-1. In contrast to the PRL-dependent Nb2 cells, phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 were constitutive in the Nb2-derived, PRL-independent, T-cell line Sp. These studies demonstrate for the first time an association between the PRL receptor and a serine/threonine kinase affiliated with signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1514082852,"Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) are potent activators of platelets and vascular smooth muscle whose responses are mediated through a common G-protein coupled receptor (TXA2/PGH2 receptor). Despite the many studies describing their ability to aggregate platelets and contract vascular smooth muscle, little is known concerning the potential mitogenic capabilities of these autocoids. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) and ribosomal S6 kinases are well characterized intracellular mediators involved in proliferation of cells. The present study was designed to examine the activation of MAP kinase and S6 kinase in guinea pig coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) in response to stimulation by a TXA2/PGH2 mimetic, I-BOP ([1S-(1 alpha,2 beta(5Z),3 alpha(1E,3R*),4 alpha)]-7-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-(4'- iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo-[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-h eptenoic acid). Equilibrium radioligand binding assays using [125I]BOP defined a single class of high affinity TXA2/PGH2 receptors on monolayers of guinea pig CASMC (Kd = 0.18 +/- 0.03 nM; 26,476 +/- 3,600 sites/cell; 0.08 +/- 0.01 pmol/mg of protein; n = 12). I-BOP produced a concentration-dependent increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in these cells (EC50 = 0.3 nM) which was inhibited by a series of TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonists as well as by verapamil and staurosporine. I-BOP also produced a time-dependent increase in the activation of kinases phosphorylating myelin basic protein (MBP; a substrate for MAP kinase) and RRLSSLRA (S6 peptide; a substrate for pp85rsk kinase), reaching a peak activation between 5 and 10 min. Stimulated MBP kinases were identified as ERK1 and ERK2. The activation of these kinases by I-BOP was inhibited by the TXA2/PGH2 receptor antagonist SQ29548 and also by staurosporine. These results indicate that I-BOP, a TXA2/PGH2 mimetic, produces growth of coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, which is preceded by activation of MAP kinase and S6 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1577399617,"Cellular responsiveness to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD) is conferred by its intracellular receptor (VDR), which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. VDRs are known to bind to specific response elements in the promoter region of VD-regulated genes. Two types of natural VD response elements (VDREs) have been identified so far. One is bound by VDR homodimers and is found in the human osteocalcin gene promoter (DR6-type), and the other is bound by heterodimers of VDR with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) as in the mouse osteopontin promoter (DR3-type). Here, we demonstrate that VDRs directly interact in solution not only with RXR but also with retinoid acid receptors (RARs) and, interestingly, with thyroid hormone receptors (T3Rs). All three heterodimeric partners were able to enhance the in vitro DNA binding affinity of VDR as compared to VDR homodimers, but they showed different affinities for the two types of VDREs, as determined by Scatchard analysis. Moreover, functional assays showed that VDR.T3R heterodimers act differently on the two types of VDREs; on the DR3-type we observed highest induction by thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, T3) alone, whereas on a DR6-type VDRE VD and T3 together provided maximal gene activity. Our data suggest that the expression levels of VDRs, RXRs, RARs, and T3Rs and their specific ligands regulate the transcription of VD-responsive genes and illustrates the complexity of this interactive network of nuclear receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1487624404,"Two rat liver cDNAs encoding CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT-1 and CT-2) were expressed in COS cells. The specific activity of CT in the microsomes increased approximately 20- or 100-fold after transfection with CT-1 or CT-2, respectively, but there was only a 3-5 fold increase in the rate of [3H]choline or [3H]glycerol incorporation into phosphatidylcholine (PC). The phosphocholine pool decreased approximately 40% in keeping with a stimulation of the CT-catalyzed reaction. The CDP-choline pool increased 12-fold suggesting that the conversion of CDP-choline to PC, catalyzed by cholinesphosphotransferase, could not keep pace with the CT-catalyzed reaction. This could account for the discrepancy between the increases in the amount of active (membrane-bound) CT and the rate of PC synthesis. Incubation of CT-transfected cells with sodium oleate to increase the supply of cellular diacylglycerol resulted in a further 2-fold increase in the rate of PC synthesis. This suggests that the diacylglycerol supply may be a limiting factor in the degree of stimulation of PC synthesis in CT-transfected COS cells. Despite the increased rate of PC synthesis, the total cellular PC mass increased only 17%, due to a 3-fold acceleration of the PC degradation rate. To determine which degradative pathway for PC was accelerated in the CT-transfected cells, we measured the pool sizes of several catabolites. Neither diacylglycerol nor phosphatidic acid mass was altered. The pool of glycerophosphocholine (GPC) was increased approximately 4-fold, and there was elevated release of GPC from the CT-transfected cells. The turnover of choline in GPC and lyso-PC was very slow compared with that of choline, phosphocholine, or CDP-choline, suggesting that GPC and lyso-PC were derived from slowly degraded choline-labeled PC. The metabolism of GPC and lyso-PC was stimulated in the cells over-expressing CT. These data suggest that PC synthesis and degradation are coordinated and that PC catabolism involving PC-->lyso-PC-->GPC is accelerated in COS cells overexpressing CT."
https://openalex.org/W1553229669,"Sequences in the gene for P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) which are responsible for its complex pattern of transcriptional control were determined using transgenic mice containing a chimeric PEPCK-bovine growth hormone (bGH) gene consisting of a segment of the PEPCK promoter from -460 to +73, with mutations in specific regulatory domains. A mutation in the cAMP response element (CRE) (-87 to -74), which binds CCATT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP beta) and/or cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), resulted in a 4- and 20-fold elevation in the level of bGH mRNA in the liver and kidney of transgenic mice, respectively. Expression of the PEPCK-bGH gene in the liver was reduced 60% by a mutation in the P3 (I) region (-248 to -230), whereas expression in the kidney was increased 10-fold by the same mutation. A mutation in the P2 region (-200 to -164) greatly reduced expression of the PEPCK-bGH gene in the kidney but not in the liver. Induction of hepatic PEPCK-bGH gene expression by Bt2cAMP was eliminated by mutations in the CRE, P1, P3(I), or by a double mutation of the CRE and P3(I). Mutations in the CRE or P3(I) regions of the PEPCK promoter did not interfere with the expected induction of the PEPCK-bGH gene in the liver at birth. None of the mutations in the PEPCK promoter interfered with the induction of transcription of the PEPCK-bGH gene in the liver when mice were fed a carbohydrate-free diet or the deinduction of transcription from the PEPCK promoter caused by a diet high in carbohydrate, whereas a mutation in P2 (an HNF-1 binding domain) eliminated dietary regulation of transcription of the transgene in the kidney. A model to explain the role of the various elements in the PEPCK promoter on the control of PEPCK gene transcription in the liver and kidney is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1605580650,"The src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing protein-tyrosine-phosphatase SH-PTP2, was over-expressed in Escherichia coli for a kinetic study employing a set of synthetic 13- to 14-mer phosphopeptide substrates. The full-length SH-PTP2 protein, as well as a truncated form, lacking the two amino terminus SH2 domains (SH-PTP2(delta SH2)), exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and demonstrated striking substrate preferences on phosphopeptides having sequences based on sites of intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation. For example, while a KM of 59 microM and kcat/KM of 1.1 x 10(5) were obtained using SH-PTP2(delta SH2) and PDGFRY1021, a phosphorylation site within the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, other peptides revealed no detectable phosphate release. PDGFRY1009, modeled after a sequence identified as an in vivo binding site for SH-PTP2, was also a good substrate for this enzyme. The truncated form, lacking the SH2 domains demonstrated higher catalytic efficiency than the full-length enzyme. Interestingly, soluble SH2 domains were found to inhibit the catalytic activity of SH-PTP2 in a concentration-dependent manner. There was also evidence of a non-phosphotyrosine-mediated association between the two domains. These observations suggested that the SH2 domains have a direct role in regulating the catalytic activity of SH-PTP2."
https://openalex.org/W1585683041,"The formation of the iron-radical cofactor in the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase has been monitored by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The differrous cluster in reduced R2 functions as a tyrosine oxidase; it uses O2 to oxidize Tyr-122 to a stable radical and results in an oxo-bridged diferric cluster. The Phe-122 mutant produces an identical dinuclear iron center and provides a simplified model for O2 activation. Oxidation with 18O2 results in quantitative incorporation of 18O into the diferric cluster as evidenced by the 13-cm-1 downshift in the Fe-O-Fe stretching vibration at 500 cm-1. Thus, O2 must be coordinated to the diiron center during O-O bond cleavage. When the Phe-208 adjacent to the diferous cluster is mutated to Tyr, reaction with O2 results in its oxidation to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA-208) and subsequent coordination to Fe as a catecholate ligand. The Fe-O/(catecholate) stretching modes at 512 and 592 cm-1 shift by -13 and -8 cm-1, respectively, when the oxidation is performed in H(2)18O. These isotope shifts indicate that the second oxygen atom of DOPA-208 originates from H2O rather than O2. Taken together, our results are consistent with a mu-1,1-peroxide and a high valent iron-oxo species as reaction intermediates. A common pathway for oxygen activation by the related iron-oxo enzymes methane monooxygenase and fatty acid desaturase is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1603021038,"The epidermin biosynthetic reaction between the flavoprotein EpiD and the precursor peptide EpiA was investigated by reversed-phase chromatography and ion spray mass spectrometry. Several products with molecular masses 46 and 104 Da less than that of EpiA were observed; these results were confirmed by using an MBP-EpiD fusion protein as enzyme and the mutant peptides EpiAR-1Q and K-EpiA as substrates. The reaction was inhibited by Zn2+ ions. Modifications were localized in the C-terminal fragment of EpiA as shown by factor Xa cleavage of the products followed by mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, EpiD reacted with the precursor peptides and with proepidermin, indicating that the leader peptide is not necessary for the recognition of EpiA by EpiD. Sequence analysis of modified proepidermin revealed that at least the amino acids Ile(+1)-Tyr+20 are unmodified. The observed decrease in mass of 46 Da and the modification at the C terminus of EpiA is in agreement with the proposed enzymatic function of EpiD, the oxidative decarboxylation of the precursor peptide. In addition, the increased absorbance at 260 nm of the modified peptides indicates the presence of a thioenol group in the C-terminal proepidermin."
https://openalex.org/W1593353682,"An enzyme catalyzing sulfide quinone oxido-reduction (E.C.1.8.5.'.; SQR) has been purified in an active form, from thylakoids of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria limnetica. It is composed of a single polypeptide of about 57 kDa. The catalytic activity of the purified enzyme is similar to the membrane-bound form in its kinetic parameters: apparent Km for sulfide equals 8 microM; Vmax of 100-150 mumol of plastoquinone-1 reduced/mg protein/h; quinone-substrate specificity; differential sensitivity to quinone analog inhibitors, the most potent of which being aurachin C (I50 = 7 nM), and specific inducibility by sulfide. Taken together, they suggest that the purified SQR is the enzyme catalyzing anoxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. The UV and visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of the purified SQR are typical of a flavoprotein. Both the absorption and fluorescence intensities are reduced by sulfide. The SQR activity is inhibited by KCN, a flavoprotein inhibitor. We have sequenced so far 29 amino acid residues of the SQR NH2 terminus and found that from the second residue, this sequence contains the highly conserved fingerprint of the NAD/FAD-binding domain of many NAD/FAD-binding enzymes (Wierenga, R. K., Terpstra, P., and Hol, W. G. S. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 187, 101-107). This suggests that the SQR enzyme is a flavoprotein which contains binding sites for sulfide and quinone and that the electron transfer between the two is mediated by FAD."
https://openalex.org/W1636161271,"Polymerases in general share only a few regions of amino acid similarity. One of the most conserved regions, called motif A, has the sequence DXXSLYPSII or a similar sequence in many eukaryotic and viral DNA polymerases and in bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. We designed genetic techniques to isolate mutant T4 DNA polymerases with amino acid substitutions in this highly conserved motif. The mutant DNA polymerases differed from wild type T4 DNA polymerase in several ways. For one mutant DNA polymerase, the pyrophosphate analog, phosphonoacetic acid, was a potent inhibitor of DNA replication, and this mutant DNA polymerase replicated DNA with reduced fidelity. Another mutant DNA polymerase replicated DNA with increased accuracy, but this mutant DNA polymerase was less processive in primer extension reactions, and DNA replication required high concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates. We provide evidence that indicates that all of these changes to DNA polymerase function are due to differences in how the mutant DNA polymerases partition between states active for DNA replication or exonucleolytic proofreading. These studies also provide further support for the hypothesis that the accuracy of DNA replication observed for DNA polymerases and 3‘–>5‘ exonuclease activities (Muzyczka, N., Poland, R. L., and Bessman, M. J. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7116-7122)."
https://openalex.org/W1604828986,"We have investigated the role of cellular p21ras protein in insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling pathways. Insulin stimulation increased Ras-GTP formation in Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing normal human insulin receptors (HIRc-B), far greater than in parental Rat-1 fibroblasts, indicating that competent insulin receptors mediate this response. Cellular microinjection of a dominant-negative mutant p21ras protein (N17 ras) or anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody (Y13-259) into HIRc-B cells reduced insulin- and IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis by 75-90%. Insulin-induced c-fos protein expression was also inhibited by 74%. Microinjection of oncogenic p21ras (T-24 ras) into HIRc-B cells activated the mitogenic pathway, and coinjection of N17 ras and T-24 ras showed that oncogenic p21ras rescued the cells from the N17 ras blockade. This later finding indicates that T-24 ras acts downstream of N17 ras. In conclusion, 1) microinjection of a dominant interferring ras mutant into quiescent cells abrogated subsequent insulin and IGF-I mitogenic signaling; 2) oncogenic ras protein rescued cells from the N17 ras blockade, indicating that T24 ras action is downstream of the site of N17 inhibition; and 3) p21ras is an intermediate signaling molecule in the insulin/IGF-I signal transduction pathway and is required for gene expression and DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1586079655,"Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) regulates the uptake and secretion of phospholipid by alveolar type II cells and is an important component of surfactant lipid aggregates. In an attempt to understand how specific structural domains of SP-A relate to the function of the protein, we used site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA for SP-A and heterologous expression with baculovirus vectors. Synthesis of the wild type SP-A in insect cells resulted in a form of the protein in which proline residues were not hydroxylated and that is denoted SP-Ahyp. Three mutant SP-As with substitutions in the consensus sequences for glycosylation (SP-Ahyp,glc) to prevent N-linked oligosaccharide attachment at Asn1 and Asn187 were produced, individually and in tandem. The SP-Ahyp was glycosylated at both the Asn1 and Asn187 positions, demonstrated partial sulfhydryl-dependent oligomerization, and formed incomplete oligomers in solution. The SP-Ahyp and SP-Ahyp,glc bound to immobilized carbohydrate and to phospholipid liposomes and partially competed for occupancy of a plasma-membrane receptor for SP-A. The SP-Ahyp and the SP-Ahyp,glc were equally effective inhibitors of the secretion of surfactant lipids from isolated type II cells (IC50 = 0.5 microgram/ml) and aggregated phospholipid liposomes at 20 degrees C. All of the recombinant SP-As demonstrated markedly reduced aggregation of lipid at 37 degrees C. We conclude that the hydroxylation of proline residues is required for perfect oligomerization of SP-A and for thermal stability in the interaction with lipid. Furthermore, recombinant SP-A is able to inhibit the secretion of phospholipid from isolated type II cells and to aggregate lipid vesicles independent of the presence of N-linked carbohydrate or the site of glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1554644454,"One of the effects of ATP in the endoplasmic reticulum is to induce the phosphorylation of several proteins among which a 57-kDa protein (pp57) prevails in our labeling conditions. We provide evidence that pp57 is protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an abundant ubiquitous protein of the endoplasmic reticulum involved in various important cellular functions. This phosphorylation does not result from the activity of a microsomal protein kinase but from an autophosphorylation as described for other microsomal proteins such as chaperones. Phosphoamino acid analysis and cyanogen bromide cleavage indicate that the modification site lies on a threonine residue within the central region of the protein outside the thioredoxin-like domains. For the pure PDI, only the dimer is able to phosphorylate, while some experiments suggest that within the endoplasmic reticulum the phosphorylated form of PDI is mainly mobilized in larger size oligomers. Thus a possible role for this phosphorylation may be to modulate the association of PDI with its different partners."
https://openalex.org/W1482994518,"Q10 values of the protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate the regulatory light chain of smooth muscle myosin were determined. Six phosphatases were examined, i.e. skeletal muscle protein phosphatase 1c; protein phosphatase 2Ac; smooth muscle phosphatases (SMP) I, II, and IV; and myosin-associated protein phosphatase (MAP phosphatase). Among them, SMP-IV and MAP phosphatase, which can dephosphorylate intact smooth muscle myosin, showed extremely high Q10 values (5.3 and 5.2, respectively). On the other hand, the Q10 values of other tested phosphatases were within the range of the normal enzyme reaction (Q10 = 2.0). The rate of dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain in alpha-toxin-skinned strips was measured at different temperatures. The results provided a Q10 of 5.1, which was quite similar to those values obtained for SMP-IV and MAP phosphatase. These results suggest that the physiological myosin light chain phosphatases are SMP-IV and/or MAP phosphatase, i.e. type 1 protein phosphatases. The temperature dependence of maximum force, the steady-state extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation, and the relaxation rate of alpha-toxin-permeabilized rabbit portal vein smooth muscle strips were measured. Both maximum force and the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation were significantly higher at lower temperature (15 degrees C) than at higher temperature (25 degrees C) under all pCa conditions tested, i.e. > 8, 6.3, and 5. The temperature dependence of the relaxation rate was much steeper (decreased 4 times by lowering the temperature from 25 to 15 degrees C) than that of the initial rate of increase in force development (decreased 1.4 times by lowering the temperature from 25 to 15 degrees C). These results are consistent with the Q10 values of myosin light chain phosphatases (Q10 = 5) and myosin light chain kinase (Q10 = 1.7) and further show that the smooth muscle type 1 phosphatases are responsible for the dephosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1487134204,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a growth factor involved in the clonal expansion of antigen-activated T lymphocytes. Interaction of IL-2 with its receptor triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of a series of proteins and results in the activation of p21ras. We report here that Shc, an SH2-containing adaptor protein, is tyrosine-phosphorylated following IL-2 stimulation. IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was detectable within seconds following IL-2 addition, reaching its highest level by 15 min. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was induced in multiple IL-2-dependent T cell lines and was found to correlate with IL-2-dependent cell proliferation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc was found to be capable of associating with the SH2 domain of Grb2 following IL-2 stimulation. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2 may be important events in IL-2-initiated signal transduction events in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568470731,"We have investigated the functioning of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) synthase activity partially purified from spinach chloroplast envelope membranes, using mixed micelles containing diacylglycerol (the substrate for MGDG synthase), CHAPS (3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1- propanesulfonic acid), and phosphatidylglycerol. The presence of this anionic phospholipid was essential for optimal MGDG synthase activity because it strongly improves diacylglycerol solubilization by CHAPS. We have demonstrated that the dilution kinetic model proposed by Deems et al. (Deems, R.A., Eaton, B.R., and Dennis, E.A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 9013-9020) is valid for MGDG synthase assayed in mixed micelles within a narrow range of CHAPS concentration. However, the experimental conditions we have set up in this study led to the description of defined equilibrium and kinetic parameters of the interaction of the envelope MGDG synthase with diacylglycerol. Two-substrate kinetic studies were performed with varied UDP-galactose molar concentrations and varied dioleoylglycerol surface concentrations. The families of reciprocal plots obtained were shown to intersect at a single point of the 1/[substrate] axis thus demonstrating that MGDG synthase is a sequential, either random or ordered, bireactant system. Therefore, MGDG synthase possesses two distinct and independent substrate-binding sites, a hydrophilic one for UDP-galactose and a hydrophobic one for diacylglycerol. The dependence of kinetic parameters on the diacylglycerol mol fraction allows a comparison of the affinity of the enzyme for a wide range of diacylglycerol molecular species. The Km values obtained were ranging between 0.0089 mol fraction (52 microM) for dilinoleoylglycerol (18:2/18:2) to 0.0666 mol fraction (416 microM) for distearoylglycerol (18:0/18:0), but the differences observed were not really related to the unsaturation of the molecule since the Km value for dilinoleoylglycerol was much lower than that (0.040 mol fraction) for dilinoleoylglycerol (18:3/18:3). The Km values for dioleoylglycerol (18:1/18:1) and for the diacylglycerol molecular species synthesized within chloroplasts, i.e. containing 18:1/16:0, were in the average range, i.e. lower than 0.030 mol fraction (around 170 microM)."
https://openalex.org/W1512670651,"In the rat, cytochrome P-450IA1 gene expression, which is most closely associated with aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity, is thought to be regulated by several trans-acting factors, including the 4 S polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-binding protein. This protein has been purified to homogeneity from rat liver using ion exchange, gel permeation, hydrophobic interaction, and affinity chromatographies. Partial sequencing of the 33-kDa band indicated its identity as glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). Polyclonal antibodies to GNMT immunoprecipitated PAH-binding activity from rat liver cytosol. Methyltransferase and PAH-binding activities copurified during the course of protein purification. GNMT protein and PAH binding activity were colocalized in various cytosolic fractions. These data all indicate that the 4 S PAH-binding protein and GNMT are one and the same protein or very similar proteins. Western blot analyses yielded a positive signal under denaturing (33 kDa) and nondenaturing (150 kDa, tetramer) conditions; the PAH-binding protein also was an oligomer. GNMT was detected by immunohistochemistry in nuclei from H4IIE rat hepatoma cells and rat liver. The localization of GNMT in liver nuclei is in accordance with a role in modulating cytochrome P-450IA1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1514061196,"Mevalonate pathway enzyme activities in rat liver mitochondria were investigated, and it was found that isopentenyl pyrophosphate can be utilized for the synthesis of all-trans-polyprenyl pyrophosphates in vitro. In this reaction sequence intermediate formation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) predominates, and the FPP synthase activity was studied in more detail. The mitochondrial activity constitutes 13% of the total hepatic capacity for FPP synthesis, exceeding the corresponding microsomal, nuclear, and peroxisomal activities by 10-fold. Mitochondrial FPP synthase exhibits trypsin sensitivity only after sonication of intact mitochondria and upon subfractionation the activity is found localized in the matrix. FPP synthase activities at different locations responded distinctly when rats were treated with a diet enriched in cholesterol or containing mevinolin or cholestyramine. With the high cholesterol diet, mitochondrial FPP synthase activity increased 2-fold, while the cytosolic activity was slightly decreased. Both mevinolin and cholestyramine treatment resulted in 3-fold increases in cytosolic FPP synthase activities, without altering the mitochondrial activity. FPP was utilized as substrate for trans-prenyltransferase activity in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The products formed in this reaction were identified as nona- and decaprenyl-PP, and the reaction was influenced by changes in both substrate and Mg2+ concentration, giving more decaprenyl-PP when the concentrations of these substances were increased. These results demonstrate that mitochondria utilize endogenously produced FPP for isoprenoid biosynthesis and that the biosynthetic steps in mitochondria are regulated independently from those occurring in other subcellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1594626340,"Ca2+ regulation of vertebrate-striated muscle contraction is initiated by conformational changes in the Ca(2+)-binding protein troponin C (TnC) and subsequent changes in the interaction of TnC with the inhibitory protein TnI. We have constructed mutants of rabbit skeletal muscle TnC in which natural Cys-98 was replaced by Leu, and a single Cys residue was introduced at position 12 (TnC12) or 89 (TnC89). Cys residues of mutant TnCs were derivatized with 4-maleimidobenzophenone and photocross-linked to TnI in binary TnC.TnI complexes. After digestion with CNBr or proteases, cross-linked peptides were purified and sequenced. TnC12 cross-linked at or near TnI Met-134 in a region known to be sensitive not only to occupancy of the regulatory Ca(2+)-binding sites of TnC but also to the contractile state of the thin filament. TnC89 cross-linked to TnI(108-113) in the inhibitory region. Taken together with earlier findings, these results indicate that in the TnC.TnI complex, both domains of TnC, as well as the linker region between them, make contact with the inhibitory region of TnI. Our data also indicate that the N- and C-terminal domains of TnC interact with opposite ends of the TnI inhibitory region."
https://openalex.org/W1622534368,"Cytochrome c6, a nuclear-encoded protein, is synthesized in the cytoplasm in a precursor form (pre-apocytochrome c6). Time course radiolabeling experiments support the model that the pre-protein is the substrate for a lumen-targeting post-translational pathway which includes two proteolytic cleavage events and the covalent attachment of heme to cysteinyl thiols on the polypeptide. Cell fractionation studies indicate that the fully processed protein fractionates with other soluble proteins, whereas the precursor and intermediate forms appear to be membrane-associated. To determine whether either of the processing steps is influenced by heme attachment, the biosynthetic pathway was examined 1) in a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant (B6) that is defective in the heme attachment step and 2) in wild-type cells treated with gabaculine, an inhibitor of heme synthesis. In vivo radiolabeling experiments with the B6 mutant showed that a defect in heme attachment affects neither the synthesis of the pre-apoprotein nor its processing to the mature apoform to any significant extent, supporting the notion that heme attachment and processing are not obligatorily coupled in this pathway. A similar conclusion is reached from examination of cytochrome c6 synthesis in gabaculine-treated cells where inhibition of heme attachment did not prevent either of the two processing steps. The fully processed apoprotein is a suitable substrate for heme attachment in vivo, since the apoprotein was indeed converted to holoprotein in gabaculine-treated cells, albeit more slowly than in untreated cells. Despite the lack of effect of gabaculine treatment on the accumulation of cytochrome c6-encoding messages, the amount of holocytochrome c6 precursors synthesized during a brief labeling period is 4-7-fold less than in untreated cells, suggesting that synthesis of the polypeptide may be coupled to heme availability by a control mechanism operating at the translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1595705707,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia is caused by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation of human chromosomes 9 and 22. The resulting fusion protein, p210Bcr/Abl, has enhanced tyrosine kinase activity compared with the normal cellular homologue, p145c-Abl. Expression of this chimeric protein in hematopoietic cell lines results in a rapid progression to growth factor independence and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of unidentified cellular proteins. In this study, we show that the phosphorylation state of the hematopoietically restricted tyrosine kinase, p93c-Fes, is increased. Increased phosphorylation of p93c-Fes was detected in p210Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemic cell lines, in primary leukemic cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and in myeloid cell lines expressing p210Bcr/Abl after transfection. Furthermore, p93c-Fes phosphorylation was increased by p210Bcr/Abl even when coexpressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. v-abl expression was also found to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of p93c-Fes. This increased phosphorylation was found to be accompanied by an increase in the ability of p93c-Fes to phosphorylate exogenous substrates. p93c-Fes could contribute to the transforming activity of the abl oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1528681221,"A gene encoding a novel FMN-binding protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Miyazaki F) was cloned, and its expression system was constructed in Escherichia coli. The 1.4-kilobase pair DNA fragment isolated from D. vulgaris (Miyazaki F) by double digestion with KpnI and SmaI was found to express a protein binding FMN as a prosthetic group under control of the lac promoter in E. coli. This DNA fragment contained several putative open reading frames. The partial amino acid sequence of the polypeptide portion of the purified FMN-binding protein and its tryptic peptides were completely consistent with those deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the third open reading frame in the cloned SmaI-SmaI fragment of D. vulgaris (Miyazaki F) DNA, which may include promoter and regulatory sequences. The nucleotide sequence of FMN-binding protein indicated that the protein is composed of 122 amino acids including an initiator Met residue and lacks a signal peptide for secretion. The main redox potential of the FMN-binding protein was measured as -325 mV using direct current cyclic and differential pulse voltammetric techniques and an electroreflectance method, suggesting that this FMN-binding protein functions as a redox protein like other FMN-binding proteins. Immunoblot analysis of the whole proteins from D. vulgaris (Miyazaki F) clearly indicated that this protein is expressed in this bacteria. However, the protein was found to have a primary structure distinct from those of other FMN-binding proteins and to be the smallest FMN-binding protein yet reported."
https://openalex.org/W1566528463,"We have cloned from murine macrophages a cDNA coding for a new protein of the scavenger receptor family whose mRNA is increased very strongly by adherence and moderately by exposure to tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma. The nucleotidic sequence extends for 2168 bases and encodes a protein of 559 amino acids with six potential glycosylation sites. The first 100 NH2-terminal amino acids represent a single scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain, whereas the COOH-terminal end of the molecule is compatible either with a transmembrane hydrophobic peptide followed by a very short intracytoplasmic sequence or a signal sequence for an anchoring via a glycophosphatidylinositol. The protein is highly homologous to most of the very recently identified human MAC-2-binding protein and murine cyclophilin C-associated protein."
https://openalex.org/W1608180090,"Vibrio harveyi luciferase is sensitive to aldehyde substrate inhibition, and two kinetic schemes have been previously postulated to account for such an inhibition. One scheme depicts a sequential binding of 2 aldehyde molecules, yielding an active enzyme-aldehyde binary complex and subsequently an inactive enzyme-(aldehyde)2 ternary complex (Holzman, T. F., and Baldwin, T. O. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 2838-2846). This two-aldehyde model was later withdrawn, and recently, a different scheme was proposed, following which the prior binding of one aldehyde to the native luciferase forms an inactive dead-end complex (Abu-Soud, H. M., Clark, A. C., Francisco, W. A., Baldwin, T. O., and Raushel, F. M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7699-7706). In this work, kinetic and equilibrium studies were carried out to elucidate further the mechanism of aldehyde inhibition. Two, presumably independent, aldehyde-binding sites were detected, with a higher affinity site for the aldehyde substrate and a weaker affinity site for the aldehyde inhibitor. Binding to and dissociation from the inhibitor site by decanal were revealed by chemical relaxation analysis to be slow processes. Furthermore, whereas the binding of the decanal substrate enhances the affinity of the reduced riboflavin 5'-phosphate (FMNH2) site, the binding of decanal to the inhibitor site competes against FMNH2 binding, thus resulting in inhibition of luciferase activity. These findings are not compatible with either of the two earlier schemes mentioned above. A new kinetic model is formulated for the mechanism of aldehyde inhibition. Theoretical kinetic behaviors predicted on the basis of this model are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. A particularly reactive cysteine (residue 106) on the alpha subunit has been previously demonstrated to be at or near an aldehyde site (Fried, A., and Tu, S.-C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10754-10759). Evidence is presented to indicate that this residue is at or near the aldehyde inhibitor site. Relative locations of this residue and binding sites for FMNH2, the aldehyde substrate, and the aldehyde inhibitor are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1495931578,"The interaction of the T cell antigen receptor with a photoreactive antigenic peptide derivative bound covalently to the H-2Kd (Kd) molecule was studied by photoaffinity labeling on cloned, CD8 positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The Kd-restricted Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite peptide 253-260 (YIPS-AEKI) was conjugated with iodo-4-azidosalicylic acid at the N terminus and with 4-azidobenzoic acid at the T cell receptor residue Lys-259. Cell-associated or soluble Kd molecules were photoaffinity-labeled with the peptide derivative by selective photoactivation of the N-terminal photoreactive group. Incubation of cell-associated or soluble covalent Kd-peptide derivative complexes (ligands) with cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognized this peptide derivative and activation of the orthogonal photoreactive group resulted in specific photoaffinity labeling of the T cell receptor. The labeling was inhibitable by an anti-Kd antibody and was absent on Kd-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes of different specificity. The binding of the soluble ligand reached a maximum after 2-4 min at 37 degrees C, after 30 min at 18 degrees C, and after 3 h at 4 degrees C. In contrast, binding of the cell-associated ligand reached a transient maxima after 50 and 110 min at 37 and 18 degrees C, respectively. The degree of binding at 37 degrees C was approximately 30% lower than that at 18 degrees C. No binding took place at 4 degrees C. Inhibition studies with antibodies and drugs indicated that the binding of the cell-associated, but not the soluble ligand, was highly dependent on T cell-target cell conjugate formation, whereas the binding of the soluble ligand was greatly dependent on CD8."
https://openalex.org/W1503617342,"The amino acid sequence of the rat 60 S ribosomal subunit protein L13a was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in two recombinant cDNAs. Mature ribosomal protein L13a has 202 amino acids (the NH2-terminal methionine is removed after translation of the mRNA) and a M(r) of 23,330. Hybridization of the L13a cDNA to digests of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 9-11 copies of the L13a gene. The mRNA for the protein is approximately 800 nucleotides in length. Rat L13a is related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal proteins that have been provisionally designated rp22 and rp23 and to the eubacterial and archaebacterial family of L13 ribosomal proteins. The mouse tum- transplantation antigen P198 is a mutant of the mouse homolog of rat ribosomal protein L13a. Rat ribosomal protein L7 has, at its NH2 terminus, five tandem repeats of a similar sequence of 12 amino acids (Lin, A., Chan, Y. L., McNally, J., Peleg, D., Meyuhas, O., and Wool, I. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12665-12671); L13a has, in its carboxyl-terminal region, amino acid sequences with significant identity to L7 repeats 1, 3, and 5. L13a also has a number of short amino acid sequences that are repeated, a leucine zipper-like motif at its NH2 terminus, and a potential basic region-leucine zipper element in its carboxyl-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1540091532,"Abstract Three different types of VP16 mutants were assayed in vitro. These included deletion of the C-terminal activation subdomain and alterations in either the acidic or non-acidic components of the minimal activation domain. The mutant GAL4-VP16 proteins were found to be transcriptionally defective using a HeLa cell nuclear extract. In all three cases the loss of transcription activity was accompanied by a commensurate loss in ability to form open transcription complexes. The comparison implies that the diverse components of GAL4-VP16 activate transcription by the common facilitation of steps required for open complex formation. The results further imply that open complex formation may be a common target for mammalian transcriptional activation, as known previously to be the case in bacterial systems."
https://openalex.org/W1517470749,"Two different Type I interferon receptors (IFN-R) have been described: the normal and the variant receptors. The alpha subunit of the Type I IFN-R has a molecular mass of 110 kDa in cells expressing normal and variant receptors. The beta subunit has a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa in cells that express normal receptors and 55 kDa in cells expressing the variant form of the receptor. The IFN alpha-resistant U-937 cell line expresses variant receptors and fails to down-regulate and phosphorylate the alpha subunit on tyrosine residues. We report that two other myelomonocytic cell lines, YK-M2 and ML-2, also expressing the variant form of the receptor, fail to down-regulate and phosphorylate the alpha subunit on tyrosine residues. However, YK-M2 and ML-2 cells are sensitive to the antiproliferative and antiviral effects of IFN alpha 2, indicating that phosphorylation of the alpha subunit is not necessary to elicit an IFN alpha response and that expression of variant receptors is not a source of IFN alpha resistance. We also determined if other proteins involved in the IFN alpha signal transduction pathway had a different phosphorylation pattern. Treatment of cells expressing variant receptors induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p135tyk2 tyrosine kinase, and the three interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 alpha (ISGF3 alpha) polypeptides (p113, p91, and p84), albeit at lower levels. These results indicate that cells expressing either form of the Type I IFN-R phosphorylate a similar set of proteins, with the exception of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1643584977,"The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) in the clearance of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) by hepatocyte-like cells was studied. Rat (Novikoff) hepatoma cells were able to bind and degrade t-PA in a PAI-1 independent fashion, but PAI-1 markedly increased the rate of degradation and t-PA/PAI-1 was a more efficient inhibitor of 125I-t-PA or of 125I-t-PA/PAI-1 degradation than free t-PA. Competition studies revealed that the effect of PAI-1 is unlikely to involve determinants located on the PAI-1 part of the complex: 1) an excess of free PAI had no effect on the rate of degradation of 125I-t-PA/PAI-1.2) Complexes of PAI-1 with urokinase-type PA or with a t-PA mutant lacking the finger and growth factor domains were unable to compete for the binding and degradation of free or PAI-1-complexed 125I-t-PA.3) t-PA KHRR296-299AAAA, a mutant which reacts 2 orders of magnitude slower with PAI-1 than wild type t-PA, behaved similar to wild type t-PA. The clearance via both the PAI-1-dependent and the PAI-1-independent mechanisms was inhibited by the receptor-associated protein, a general inhibitor of clearance mediated by the LDL receptor-related protein. We conclude that t-PA can be cleared by rat hepatoma cells in a PAI-1 independent fashion, but after complex formation with PAI-1, binding of t-PA to the cells is increased and clearance accelerated. Both mechanisms seem to involve the same receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1521772215,"To gain information about the mechanism of RecA-promoted strand exchange reactions in genetic recombination, we have investigated the environment of and interactions between DNA strands accommodated in complexes with Beck protein. DNA bound in different sites in the Reck filament was tested by adding stoichiometric amounts of DNAs of variable base compositions. For this purpose, poly(dA) labeled by fluorescent benzo(a)pyrenediol epoxide (BPDE), which binds covalently to N-6 of adenine, was used. The fluorescence intensity, anisotropy, and quenching by acrylamide provide information about the DNA environment in the complexes with Reck In the absence of extra DNA, binding of Reck to BPDE-poly(dA) only slightly affects both the intensity of the BPDE fluorescence and the accessibility of BPDE to acrylamide. However, a strongly increased fluorescence anisotropy shows that the mobility of the BPDE fluorophore is restricted in the Reck complex. Binding of a second and third single-stranded DNA to the RecA.BPDE-poly(dA) complex reduces the fluorescence intensity in a manner that depends on base complementarity. The change is large when the second and third DNAs are poly(dT), i.e. complementary to the already bound poly(dA) strand. In such a complex, the accessibility of BPDE to quencher is also reduced. When BPDE-poly(dA) was added as the second or third DNA in the Reck filament, the fluorescence intensity became smaller when the earlier bound DNA was complementary to the added DNA. These results indicate that all three DNA strands are interacting with each other in the Beck filament. BPDE-modified poly(dA) forms a duplex with poly(dT), whereupon the fluorescence of BPDE is strongly decreased. Binding of Reck to this duplex DNA increases the BPDE fluorescence, suggesting a destabilization of the duplex. Finally, we also find indications of base complementary interactions between single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs bound to the Beck filament."
https://openalex.org/W1524471967,"Most mammalian S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferases have a conserved aspartate residue in a sequence oDso (o denotes a hydrophobic amino acid and s denotes a small neutral amino acid). Rat guanidinoacetate methyltransferase has two aspartate residues (Asp-129 and Asp-134) conforming to the motif in close proximity to Tyr-136 that is photoaffinity-labeled by AdoMet (Takata, Y., and Fujioka, M. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 4369-4374). In order to investigate the role of these residues, we prepared variant forms of the enzyme by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Conversion of Asp-129 to asparagine or alanine resulted in a functional enzyme. Alteration of Asp-134 to glutamate (D134E) and asparagine (D134N) decreased activity, and replacement with alanine (D134A) led to inactivation. Decreases of 3- and 120-fold were found for kcat values of D134E and D134N, respectively. The Km values of D134E for AdoMet and those for guanidinoacetate were increased about 160- and 80-fold over the respective values of wild type. The corresponding increases in D134N were 800- and 50-fold, respectively. Conservative changes of the residues flanking Asp-134 had little effect on activity. Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase obeys an ordered Bi Bi mechanism in which AdoMet binds first. Thus, the large decreases in kcat/Km values for AdoMet indicate that Asp-134 is crucial for binding AdoMet. Spectroscopic studies indicated that the amino acid substitutions of Asp-134 resulted in no significant changes in the secondary and tertiary structures, and urea denaturation experiments showed that the altered enzymes were not destabilized."
https://openalex.org/W1597801302,"Methoxylamine mutagenesis of the beta-galactosidase gene from Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus was used to generate cold-sensitive variants. Two variants, P429S and L317F, were characterized kinetically in order to determine the enzymatic consequences of these mutations. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax on the synthetic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside have been determined over a temperature range of 11-45 degrees C. Only the Vmax of the two variants was significantly different than the wild-type enzyme over the temperature range studied. The Vmax of the L317F variant is reduced proportionately at all temperatures compared to the wild-type enzyme while the value of Vmax for the P429S mutant deviates from wild-type only at lower temperatures (in 2 mM Mg2+). This temperature-dependent effect on the Vmax of P429S can be suppressed by increasing the Mg2+ concentration. The results suggest that the binding of this essential metal ion is altered in the P429S variant such that its dissociation is increased by lowering the temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1563006911,"An alignment of 5 amino acids in the Escherichia coli proline carrier (G328-A366-L371-GR376) is common in the amino acid sequences of several Na+ symport carriers, and it has been proposed as the putative sodium binding motif (Deguchi, Y., Yamato, I., and Anraku, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21704-21708). To determine whether these amino acids are essential for Na+ symport activity as the Na+ binding site, one of the amino acids in this alignment, Arg-376, which is the only positively charged amino acid in the innermost part of the predicted membrane-spanning regions, was changed to either lysine, glutamine, or glutamic acid by oligonucleotide dependent site-specific mutagenesis. The transport and binding activities of the proline of the R376K mutant carrier were not detected at all. The activities of the other mutant carriers for uptake and binding of proline were as high as those of the wild-type carrier. These two mutant carriers were as sensitive to the proline analogue azetidine-2-carboxylate and to N-ethylmaleimide as the wild-type carrier, indicating that they have the same properties as the wild-type. The amounts of the carrier proteins expressed from these mutated putP genes were similar to that from the wild-type gene. These results imply that the Arg-376 in the proline carrier does not reside at the sodium binding site, suggesting that the similar alignment found in the amino acid sequences of several Na+ symport carriers is not essential for the transport or binding activities, although this similar alignment may have some relevance to the structure of the Na+ symporter. Furthermore, that the only Arg residue in the middle part of the predicted membrane-spanning regions is dispensable for the energy coupling activity indicates a unique difference of the coupling mechanism from the other secondary active transport systems, such as that of the lactose permease and the tetracycline/H+ antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W1589346873,"We have studied the biosynthesis and turnover of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in WB cells, a rat liver epithelial cell line. In detergent extracts of 35S-labeled WB cells, an affinity-purified antibody directed at the C terminus of the IP3R immunoprecipitated two labeled polypeptides, a major band at 233 kDa and a minor band at 222 kDa. The major band was shown to correspond to the IP3R by immunoblotting. The minor band was not a proteolytic clip of the IP3R because, unlike the IP3R, the 222-kDa band was not a glycoprotein or a substrate for protein kinase A and was not recognized by three different IP3R antibodies on immunoblots. The identity and function of this co-immunoprecipitating protein is unknown. The IP3R in WB cells was 5 kDa smaller than the rat cerebellar IP3R. Significant changes in the molecular weight of the IP3R were not observed in pulse-chase experiments, indicating that extensive proteolytic or carbohydrate processing events do not occur during biosynthesis of the receptor. From the analysis of such experiments in confluent WB cells, it was determined that the half-life of the IP3R protein was 11 h. Chromatography of the 35S-labeled extracts on Sephacryl S-400 columns revealed rapid oligomerization of newly synthesized protein with > 95% of newly synthesized protein forming tetramers during a short (10 min) pulse labeling period. However, significant amounts of mature IP3R were found as incompletely oligomerized forms. Mature IP3R was bound by concanavalin A-Sepharose beads, and binding was greatly reduced by endoglycosidase H treatment of the receptor. Endoglycosidase H sensitivity, absence of binding to wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and insensitivity of biosynthesis or oligomerization to brefeldin A suggest that processing of the WB IP3R does not involve transit through the Golgi apparatus."

Metal-inducible reduction in poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activity was observed in two pAS-5'-transfected clones out of 72 neo-resistant clones examined, and metal-independent reduction in the activity was exhibited in pAS-FL-transfected clones. The antisense RNA was induced in a metal-dependent manner in the clones transfected with pAS-5', as judged by hybridizing with a sense riboprobe of the synthetase gene. The mRNA of the synthetase decreased 1 day after an addition of metal ions, and the synthetase activity of the transformants decreased by more than 90% 3 days after an addition of metal ions. Thus, we incubated the transformant clones in the presence of metal ions for 3 days and then treated them with IFN-gamma. The IFN-gamma-inducible expression of MHC class II molecules was amplified in the transformant clones, as judged by RNA blot analysis and flow cytometry. These results indicate that the decrease in poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase makes THP-1 cells favorable to induce MHC class II molecules by IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1507486330,"The effects of irreversibly attaching product at the active site of type I dehydroquinase from Escherichia coli have been investigated at the level of the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of the protein by spectroscopic and hydrodynamic techniques. The results agree with the previously identified stabilization of the enzyme but show for the first time that the protein dimer is also stabilized and suggest that the E. coli dehydroquinase subunit may be bilobal."
https://openalex.org/W1502459142,"A synthetic segment (110-127) of the carboxyl terminus of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rh-GM-CSF) was used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antibody (345-6), which recognized both peptide and full-length Escherichia coli-derived rh-GM-CSF in a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody 345-6 was shown to antagonize the binding of 125I-labeled rh-GM-CSF to its receptor on the KG-1 cell line and to inhibit human GM-CSF-dependent proliferation of the AML-193 cell line. The purified IgG fraction of neutralizing antibody 345-6 was used as immunogen to obtain sheep anti-serum 1418. Antibody 1418 recognized antibody 345-6 on direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay but did not recognize rh-GM-CSF or the peptide 110-127 to which antibody 345-6 was raised. Antiserum 1418, as well as a purified IgG fraction of this serum, inhibited both rh-GM-CSF-stimulated cell proliferation and 125I-labeled rh-GM-CSF receptor binding but not 125I-labeled recombinant human interleukin-4 receptor binding. The anti-idiotypic antibody response derived from the anti-(110-127) antibody strongly suggests that the carboxyl-terminal region of rh-GM-CSF may be directly involved in the receptor-ligand interaction of this protein. The high affinity receptor consists of two different components (GM-R alpha beta) a cytokine-specific alpha-subunit and a beta-subunit that is shared by human GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and interleukin-5. In an effort to localize the epitope of antibody 1418 to either GMR alpha or GMR beta, several cell lines containing high, low, or both high and low affinity receptors were examined. Each was specifically and completely inhibited by antibody 1418. Interleukin-3-dependent cell proliferation of the AML-193 cell line was found to be unaffected by the antibody 1418. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal region of rh-GM-CSF is likely to be involved in the interaction of the ligand with the alpha-subunit of the high affinity receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1515370032,"Bovine seminal plasma (BSP) contains a family of four closely related proteins previously designated as BSP-A1, BSP-A2, BSP-A3, and BSP-30-kDa (collectively called BSP proteins). They are secreted by seminal vesicles and they bind to the choline phospholipids composing the sperm plasma membrane upon ejaculation. these proteins contain two homologous domains that are similar to the type II structure present in the putative insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) binding domain of the IGF-II receptor. Thus, it was of interest to verify the interaction between the IGF-II and these proteins. The interaction between the IGF-II and BSP proteins was demonstrated by solid phase assay, analytical gel filtration, affinity cross-linking, and gel overlay binding technique. All techniques showed that 125I-IGF-II interacted specifically with BSP proteins and that the binding could be inhibited with an excess of unlabeled IGF-II. No structural homology has been found between BSP proteins and any IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) identified to date, and therefore, they represent a new family of IGFBP. Since BSP cross-reacting proteins are ubiquitous, we propose that the specific binding of these proteins to IGF-II could modulate the activity of this growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1530712512,"Extracts from whole oocytes of Xenopus laevis are widely used as an efficient in vitro system for the transcription of cloned genes by RNA polymerase III. We have found that these extracts no longer support RNA polymerase III transcription in response to a brief incubation in the presence of Ca2+. However, when transcription complexes were first formed on the genes, a subsequent incubation in the presence of Ca2+ had little effect. Fractionation of extracts was used to show that transcription factors (TF) IIIC and, to a lesser extent, TFIIIB, but not RNA polymerase III, were targets of the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation process. An additional component (not present in fractionated TFIIIC or TFIIIB) was required for the Ca(2+)-dependent destruction of transcription factor activity. The Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation process was blocked by protease inhibitors that inhibit known Ca(2+)-dependent proteases called calpains. These results suggest that TFIIIC and TFIIIB are inactivated by an endogenous calpain. The common use of Ca2+ as a second messenger and the widespread distribution of calpains suggest that the proteolytic degradation of transcription factors may be a general mechanism for the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1511176664,"Rabbit brain contains three phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) isozymic subunits designated A, B, and C. The primary structures of the first of these two isozyme types have been determined previously. The isozyme C of rabbit brain was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography and subjected to proteolytic and chemical digestion. A large number of peptides were sequenced, the total number of amino acids identified being equal to about 80% of the total structure. The sequence of the cDNA derived from brain mRNA for C isozyme was determined from polymerase chain reaction fragments synthesized using oligonucleotides designed on the basis of the peptide sequences. The deduced size of the C isozyme was 86,371 Da, slightly larger than PFKs described previously. The amino acid sequence identity with the rabbit A isozyme was 68.9% and a range of identity to other sequenced mammalian PFKs was 67-69%. Using these data plus previously published data on chemical modification, assignments of the 6 organic ligand binding sites of PFK were inferred. The full-length cDNA was cloned into and expressed in Escherichia coli. Phosphofructokinase C was purified to homogeneity from the bacterial extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1503482156,"Two differentially expressed lectins from the legume Dolichos biflorus, the seed lectin and a stem and leaf lectin (DB58), were photoaffinity-labeled at their adenine binding sites using the probe [2-3H]8-azidoadenine. Both heteromeric subunits I and II of the seed lectin and alpha and beta of DB58 were specifically labeled. This result, combined with the adenine binding site stoichiometries of two identical sites/seed lectin tetramer or one site/DB58 dimer, indicates that the adenine binding site resides at a heterologous subunit interface. Three radiolabeled peaks from seed lectin and one from DB58 were isolated from chymotryptic digests of the labeled lectins by reverse phase chromatography at pH 7.0. From these four peaks, six unique peptide sequences were determined. When aligned with the concanavalin A sequence, four of these peptides map to three loops in the metal binding domain of concanavalin A. The remaining two sequences represent carboxyl-terminal peptides unique to the D. biflorus lectins which may extend to the putative binding site from adjacent, heterologous subunits. It thus appears that the adenine binding sites of these D. biflorus lectins are within the metal binding domain and adjacent to the carbohydrate binding site."
