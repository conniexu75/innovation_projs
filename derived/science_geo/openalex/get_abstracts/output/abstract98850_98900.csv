https://openalex.org/W2001751662,"Emerging data indicate that neurotrophic factors and cytokines utilize similar signal transduction mechanisms. Although neurotrophic factors can protect CNS neurons against a variety of insults, the role of cytokines in the injury response is unclear. We now report that TNF beta and TNF alpha (1-100 ng/ml) can protect cultured embryonic rat hippocampal, septal, and cortical neurons against glucose deprivation-induced injury and excitatory amino acid toxicity. The elevation of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by glucose deprivation, glutamate, NMDA, or AMPA was attenuated in neurons pretreated with TNF beta. The mechanism whereby TNFs stabilize [Ca2+]i may involve regulation of the expression of proteins involved in maintaining [Ca2+]i homeostasis, since both TNF beta and TNF alpha caused a 4- to 8-fold increase in the number of neurons expressing the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k. These data suggest a neuroprotective role for TNFs in the brain's response to injury."
https://openalex.org/W2044801809,"The Arabidopsis floral homeotic gene APETALA1 (AP1) encodes a putative transcription factor that acts locally to specify the identity of the floral meristem and to determine sepal and petal development. RNA tissue in situ hybridization studies show that AP1 RNA accumulates uniformly throughout young floral primordia, but is absent from the inflorescence meristem. Later in development, AP1 RNA is excluded from cells that will give rise to the two inner whorls of organs. Here we show that AP1 expression is under the control of two negative regulators: the meristem identity gene TERMINAL FLOWER represses AP1 RNA accumulation in the inflorescence meristem, and the organ identity gene AGAMOUS prevents AP1 RNA accumulation in the two inner whorls of wild-type flowers. These and other data presented here lead to a revised model for the regulatory interactions among the genes specifying floral organ identity in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W1565234800,"Maximally effective concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1), acidic FGF (aFGF), or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by 3-4-fold in crude extracts of myocytes cultured from neonatal rat heart ventricles. Maximal activation was achieved after 5 min. Thereafter, MAPK activity stimulated by ET-1 or aFGF declined to control values within 1-2 h, whereas activation by TPA was more sustained. Two peaks of MAPK activity (a 42- and a 44-kDa MAPK) were resolved in cells exposed to ET-1 or aFGF by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column. One major and one minor peak of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) was stimulated by ET-1 or aFGF. Cardiac myocytes expressed protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha, -delta, -epsilon and -zeta as shown immunoblotting. Exposure to 1 microM TPA for 24 h down-regulated PKC-alpha, -delta, and -epsilon, but not PKC-zeta. This maneuver wholly abolished the activation of MAPK on re-exposure to TPA but did not affect the response to aFGF. The effect of ET-1 was partially down-regulated. ET-1 stimulated phospho[3H]inositide hydrolysis 18-fold, whereas aFGF stimulated by only 30%. Agonists which initially utilize dissimilar signaling pathways may therefore converge at the level of MAPKK/MAPK and this may be relevant to the hypertrophic response of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1964694199,"Release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals occurs by exocytosis of vesicular contents into the synaptic cleft. We find that more than one quantum of transmitter can interact with the same population of postsynaptic NMDA receptors in conditions which increase the probability of transmitter release. Increasing release probability also results in proportional increases in both AMPA and NMDA receptor components of the synaptic current. These results suggest that the fraction of AMPA and NMDA receptors occupied by transmitter following the release of a single quantum is similar. Based on AMPA and NMDA receptor responses of outside-out patches to short applications of glutamate, we suggest that both receptor types may be saturated normally by synaptic release."
https://openalex.org/W2000937423,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine that affects the survival and differentiation of certain neuronal populations in vitro. To identify LIF-responsive neurons in the adult rat, we have demonstrated retrograde axonal transport of 125I-LIF to sensory and motor neurons. The accumulation of 125I-LIF by both cell types was significantly increased by prior sciatic nerve crush. Retrograde transport of 125I-LIF was inhibited by excess unlabeled LIF but not by related cytokines, indicating a specific receptor-mediated mechanism. Northern blot analysis revealed LIF expression in peripheral nerve that was increased in distal segments after axotomy. The correlation between LIF expression and increased retrograde transport following injury suggests that LIF plays a role in peripheral nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1978224954,"Neuronal membrane components that bind alpha-bungarotoxin with high affinity can increase intracellular levels of free calcium, demonstrating the components function as nicotinic receptors. Though such receptors often contain the alpha 7 gene product, which by itself can produce ionotropic receptors in Xenopus oocytes, numerous attempts have failed to demonstrate an ion channel function for the native receptors on neurons. Using rapid application of agonist, we show here that the native receptors are ligand-gated ion channels which are cation selective, prefer nicotine over acetylcholine, and rapidly desensitize. Much of the calcium increase caused in neurons by the receptors under physiological conditions appears to result from their depolarizing the membrane sufficiently to trigger calcium influx through voltage-gated channels."
https://openalex.org/W2091257232,"Solution at 2.4 Å resolution of the structure of H-2Db with the influenza virus peptide NP366–374 (ASNEN-METM) and comparison with the H-2Kb-VSV (RGY-VYQGL) structure allow description of the molecular details of MHC class I peptide binding interactions for mice of the H-2b haplotype, revealing a strategy that maximizes the repertoire of peptides that can be presented. The H-2Db cleft has a mouse-specific hydrophobic ridge that causes a compensatory arch in the backbone of the peptide, exposing the arch residues to TCR contact and requiring the peptide to be at least 9 residues. This ridge occurs in about 40% of the known murine D and L allelic molecules, classifying them as a structural subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W2074293349,"We have identified a putative cGMP-gated cation conductance in rat retinal ganglion cells. Both in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction amplification detected transcripts in ganglion cells that were highly homologous to the cGMP-gated cation channel expressed in rod photoreceptors. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings detected a current stimulated by cGMP due to activation of nonselective cation channels. This current had a reversal potential near 0 mV, showed some outward rectification, and could be blocked by Cd2+. The current could also be activated by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and the nitric oxide donors sodium nitroprusside and S-nitrosocysteine. We propose that nitric oxide released from an identified subpopulation of amacrine cells may activate this channel to modulate ganglion cell activity."
https://openalex.org/W1519345480,"High conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ (maxi-K) channels from bovine tracheal and aortic smooth muscle membranes have been purified employing monoiodotyrosine charybdotoxin binding as a marker for the channel and conventional chromatographic techniques. This K+ channel is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, of 62 and 31 kDa, respectively. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the electroeluted tracheal smooth muscle alpha-subunit was subjected to tryptic cleavage and a number of fragments were isolated by microbore C18 high performance liquid chromatography. Several of these peptides were microsequenced using Edman degradation techniques. Amino acid sequence information obtained from these fragments reveals the existence of very high sequence homology with the recently cloned mSlo maxi-K channel (Butler, A., Tsunoda, S., McCobb, D. P., Wei, A., and Salkoff, L. (1993) Science 261, 221-224). A specific anti-peptide antibody directed against the amino acid sequence of one of the fragments of the alpha-subunit is capable of specifically immunoprecipitating not only the denatured 125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled alpha-subunit, but also, under nondenaturing conditions, the complex of alpha and beta subunits, demonstrating specific noncovalent association of both subunits. Thus, our results indicate that the alpha-subunit of the purified tracheal smooth muscle maxi-K channel is a member of the mSlo family of K+ channels and forms a noncovalent complex with a beta-subunit. It is concluded that the extensive biochemical information acquired to date on smooth muscle charybdotoxin receptors is pertinent to the structure of native maxi-K channels."
https://openalex.org/W1558486290,"In macrophages and other cell types, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and certain cytokines stimulate nitric oxide (NO) production via expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Citrulline, which is the coproduct of NOS-catalyzed metabolism of arginine, can be recycled to arginine by the action of argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase, which are present at high levels in hepatocytes and renal tubular cells but normally at very low levels in other cell types such as macrophages. The present study demonstrates that lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma, which induce NOS in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, also coinduce activity and mRNA for argininosuccinate synthetase, which is limiting for arginine synthesis. Argininosuccinate lyase activity and mRNA abundance are unaffected. Induction of argininosuccinate synthetase is not blocked by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a potent inhibitor of NOS, indicating that argininosuccinate synthetase induction is not the consequence of depleting cellular arginine levels by NOS. Because plasma levels of arginine are limiting for NO synthesis, enhanced cellular capacity to regenerate arginine from citrulline could play a significant role in regulating NO production, especially under conditions where the inducible isoform of NOS is expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1585648374,"Integrins alpha IIb beta 3 and alpha V beta 3 mediate numerous cell-matrix and cell-cell contacts. Both integrins contain multiple divalent cation-binding motifs that regulate ligand binding. Here, we elucidate a major difference in the regulation of alpha IIb beta 3 and alpha V beta 3 by divalent ions. Fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 in Ca(2+)-containing buffer is rapid, with an apparent association rate constant (k1app) of 8.2 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, but Ca2+ does not support association between fibrinogen and alpha V beta 3. Interestingly, Mn2+ supports fibrinogen binding to both integrins, albeit with a relatively slow association rate (k1app = 10(4) M-1 s-1). This influence of divalent ions on ligand association rates accounts for the opposite divalent ion requirements for platelet aggregation and tumor cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Furthermore, the regulation of fibrinogen binding to alpha V beta 3 is complex when both Ca2+ and Mn2+ are present. Physiological concentrations of Ca2+ completely ablated adhesion. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that Ca2+ is a mixed-type inhibitor of Mn(2+)-supported fibrinogen binding to alpha V beta 3. Consequently, the data presented here suggest a mechanism in which two separate cation-binding sites regulate ligand binding to beta 3-integrins."
https://openalex.org/W1604986533,"Voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are multisubunit complexes that include, among others, a large alpha 1 subunit, which by itself is sufficient to form a channel. Several alpha 1 genes encoding L-, N-, and P-type Ca2+ channels have been cloned. These alpha 1 genes share a high degree of sequence homology in the putative transmembrane regions, but vary substantially in the putative intracellular loops and the flanking amino and carboxyl termini. In the present study, we investigated the functional roles of the 665-amino acid long carboxyl terminus of a cardiac alpha 1 by constructing deletion mutants. Expression in Xenopus oocytes of delta C1856, delta C1733, and delta C1700, which lack from 307 to 472 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus, led to inward Ba2+ currents that were 4- to 6-fold greater than observed with the 2171-amino acid long wild type alpha 1. Ionic currents increased without a change in the amount of charge moved during voltage-dependent gating, suggesting that the increase in ionic currents was not due to an increase in the number of channels that were expressed. Single channel analysis revealed an unaltered unitary conductance. Thus, removal of up to 70% of the carboxyl terminus increased current density by facilitating the coupling between the voltage-dependent gating and channel opening, leading to an increased opening probability of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2040529976,"Key events in vertebrate embryogenesis are difficult to observe in many species. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was used to follow cell movements and lineages in developing frog embryos. A single cell was injected at the 16-cell stage with a contrast agent, based on the gadolinium chelate gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-dextran. The labeled progeny cells could be followed uniquely in three-dimensional magnetic resonance images, acquired from the embryo over several days. The results show that external ectodermal and internal mesodermal tissues extend at different rates during amphibian gastrulation and neurulation."
https://openalex.org/W1532882622,"Retroviral vectors containing five different protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes (alpha, delta, epsilon, eta, zeta) were expressed in 32D hematopoietic cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In an effort to investigate signaling events regulated by PKC activation, we analyzed whether tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins would occur after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment of the various transfectants. While no detectable tyrosine-specific phosphorylation was observed after treatment of the majority of the transfectants, pronounced TPA-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of an 82-kDa protein was detected in the 32D/PKC-delta and NIH-3T3/PKC-delta lines. Interestingly, the 82-kDa substrate proved to be PKC-delta itself. Tyrosine phosphorylation of purified PKC-delta by src family or receptor tyrosine kinases in vitro enhanced PKC-delta activity, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC-delta may positively affect its function."
https://openalex.org/W1525279604,"CHIP is the archetypal member of the aquaporins, a widely expressed family of membrane water channels. The NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of CHIP are sequence-related, and hydropathy analysis predicted six membrane-spanning domains with five connecting loops (A-E). Here, we determined the membrane topology of CHIP expressed in Xenopus oocytes using biologically active recombinant channels. CHIP is glycosylated at Asn-42, indicating loop A is exofacial. An epitope from the coronavirus E1 glycoprotein was inserted into CHIP and localized to the outer or inner leaflet of the membrane by alpha-chymotrypsin digestion of intact oocytes or inside-out membrane vesicles. The E1 epitope at Thr-120 was protease-sensitive in intact oocytes, indicating that loop C is exofacial. The E1 epitope at Lys-6, Arg-162, or Lys-267 was protease-sensitive in inside-out membrane vesicles, confirming the cytoplasmic location of the NH2 and COOH termini and loop D. Insertions into loops B and E did not produce active water channels, but their cleavage patterns were consistent with inner (loop B) and outer (loop E) leaflet locations. This study indicates that the functional CHIP molecule is a unique structure with two internal repeats oriented 180 degrees to each other within the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2071688202,"Fusion of BERH-2 rat hepatocellular carcinoma cells with activated B cells produced hybrid cells that lost their tumorigenicity and became immunogenic. Syngeneic rats injected with BERH-2-B hybrid cells became resistant to challenge with parental BERH-2 cells, and rats with established BERH-2 hepatomas were cured by subsequent injection of BERH-2-B cells. Both CD4 + and CD8 + cells were essential for the induction of protective immunity; however, only CD8 + cells were required for the eradication of BERH-2 tumors. The generation of hybrid tumor cells that elicit antitumor immune responses may be a useful strategy for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1495441076,"Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from L-arginine by different NO synthase isozymes, which are inhibited by the substrate analogs NG-methyl- and NG-nitro-L-arginine. We studied binding of 3H-labeled NG-nitro-L-arginine to purified brain NO synthase and compared the data with results obtained in enzyme kinetic experiments. Binding data revealed a single binding site for NG-nitro-L-[3H]arginine (KD = 0.17 microM). Binding was competitively antagonized by L-arginine (KI = 2.9 microM). The half-time of dissociation was remarkably slow (9.4 min) and closely correlated with the time necessary for surmounting NO synthase inhibition by dilution. Although an apparently less potent inhibitor, NG-methyl-L-arginine exhibited the same affinity for brain NO synthase as the nitro derivative (KI = 0.17 microM), and in initial rate experiments, almost equal KI values were obtained for NG-methyl-L-arginine (0.61 microM) and NG-nitro-L-arginine (0.53 microM). However, after prolonged incubation periods, NG-nitro-L-arginine induced a rapid inactivation of the enzyme, whereas the methyl derivative turned out to be a substrate of NO synthase, which was slowly converted into stoichiometric amounts of NO and L-citrulline."
https://openalex.org/W1530028130,"According to current models, human thrombin receptors are activated when thrombin cleaves the receptor's N terminus, exposing the tethered ligand domain, SFLLRN. In the megakaryoblastic CHRF-288 cell line, thrombin receptor activation is followed by the rapid internalization of > 90% of the receptors. In the present studies, antibodies directed at the site of cleavage by thrombin were used to examine changes in receptor structure during activation, internalization, and recovery. As would be expected, the initial rate of receptor cleavage was directly related to the thrombin concentration. However, even after prolonged incubation, receptor cleavage was incomplete until the thrombin concentration exceeded the receptor concentration. Only cleaved receptors were internalized in response to thrombin and only catalytically active thrombin and active variants of SFLLRN-containing peptides caused receptor internalization. Over a 3-h period following receptor activation by thrombin, there was a gradual recovery of approximately one-quarter of the receptors on the cell surface. These receptors were detectable with antibodies directed at retained portions of the receptor N terminus, but not with antibodies directed at the proposed site of cleavage, confirming that they are recycled, rather than new, receptors. At 4 degrees C two-thirds of the receptors cleaved by thrombin were retained on the cell surface. Like recycled receptors these receptors failed to self-activate when warmed to 37 degrees C, but could be activated by SFLLRN. Unlike recycled receptors, however, the cold-cleaved receptors were also internalized and appeared to be activated by a second addition of thrombin. These results 1) provide strong evidence at the protein level that thrombin cleaves its receptors at the predicted site, 2) show that receptor activation is necessary for internalization, 3) suggest that each thrombin molecule may not activate large numbers of receptors, 4) demonstrate that a substantial fraction of internalized thrombin receptors can be recycled, and 5) suggest that the failure of recycled receptors to be reactivated by thrombin may involve a change in the receptor that does not occur at 4 degrees C. Finally, the inability of cold-cleaved receptors to self activate in the absence of thrombin, suggests that in addition to cleaving the receptor, thrombin may also play an important role in guiding the tethered ligand domain to regions on the remainder of the receptor that mediate activation."
https://openalex.org/W1545524676,"In earlier studies of oligosaccharide probes (neoglycolipids) generated from an ovarian cystadenoma glycoprotein, one of the components that strongly supported binding of the endothelial adhesion molecule, E-selectin, was identified as an equimolar mixture of tetrasaccharides of blood group Le(a) and Le(x) type sulfated at position 3 of the outer galactose (C.-T. Yuen, A. M. Lawson, W. Chai, M. Larkin, M. S. Stoll, A. C. Stuart, F. X. Sullivan, T. J. Ahern, and T. Feizi (1992) Biochemistry 31, 9126-9131). In the present studies, the individual sulfated Le(a) and sulfated Le(x) oligosaccharides synthesized chemically have been investigated, first, for their ability to support E-selectin binding when converted into neoglycolipids, and second, for their ability to inhibit E-selectin binding to immobilized lipid-linked sialyl-Le(a), sialyl-Le(x), or sulfated Le(a) pentasaccharides; their activities have been compared with those of the sialyl-Le(a) and sialyl-Le(x) analogues. From these studies, the sulfated Le(a) tetra- and pentasaccharides emerge as the most potent E-selectin ligands so far. In particular, the inhibitory activity of the sulfated Le(a) pentasaccharide is substantially greater than that of the sialyl-Le(x) trisaccharide, which is currently the most widely used inhibitor of E-selectin binding: 45-, 35-, or 15-fold greater depending on whether adhesion is to sialyl-Le(a), sulfated Le(a), or sialyl-Le(x) pentasaccharides, respectively. These findings have an important bearing on design of new generations of inhibitors of E-selectin binding as antiinflammatory compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1551636999,"The anion transporter, band 3, is the major tyrosine kinase substrate in both red cell membranes and intact human erythrocytes. Using antibodies to various protein-tyrosine kinases, we found that p72syk and p56/53lyn are present in human red cells, while p56lck, pp60src, p59fyn, and p55blk are absent. Treatment of intact red cells with a combination of vanadate and hydrogen peroxide dramatically increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3. This treatment increased the tyrosine kinase activity of p72syk and decreased the activity of p56/53lyn in immune complex kinase assays. Band 3 was found to be associated in immune complexes with p72syk but not with p56/53lyn. These findings suggest that p72syk is responsible, at least in part, for the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 in human erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1518271910,"alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2M) binds numerous cytokines; however, since binding affinities have not been determined, it is difficult to compare various alpha 2M-cytokine interactions or predict whether alpha 2M-cytokine complexes will form in the presence of other cytokine-binding macromolecules. In this investigation, we used a novel method to demonstrate that transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), TGF-beta 2, nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta), platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) reversibly associate with alpha 2M-methylamine to form noncovalent complexes. Apparent equilibrium was achieved in less than 15 min. Noncovalent alpha 2M-cytokine complexes were converted into covalent complexes; however, this occurred slowly. Therefore, a rapid equilibrium assumption was applied and equilibrium dissociation constants were determined using a single binding site model. KD values for the binding of cytokines to alpha 2M-methylamine varied by 2 orders of magnitude. The rank order of affinity was TGF-beta 2 (13 +/- 2 nM) > TGF-beta 1, NGF-beta > PDGF-BB > or = bFGF > TNF-alpha. Native alpha 2M bound TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, NGF-beta, PDGF-BB, and TNF-alpha. Interferon-gamma did not bind to native alpha 2M or alpha 2M-methylamine. Each cytokine bound native alpha 2M with lower affinity than alpha 2M-methylamine except for TGF-beta 2 which bound both forms with equal affinity. In non-equilibrium systems, alpha 2M-methylamine appeared to bind more TGF-beta 2 due to the more rapid dissociation of TGF-beta 2-native alpha 2M complex. The classification of alpha 2M-cytokine complexes according to binding affinity should predict which complexes are most likely to form in cell culture and under various conditions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1562197596,"We recently localized the high affinity binding site for activated type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) to the somatomedin B domain (i.e. amino acid (aa) 1-51) of vitronectin (Vn). In this study to further define this site, N-terminal Vn fragments of various lengths were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for PAI-1 binding activity. Vn polypeptides containing aa 1-52 and 1-40 retained PAI-1 binding activity and stabilized PAI-1 to a similar extent as intact Vn, but polypeptides containing aa 1-30 did not bind to PAI-1 nor stabilize its activity. The effects of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to Vn on PAI-1 binding was also determined. One mAb bound to Vn and blocked its ability to bind to PAI-1. It also dissociated pre-existing PAI-1.Vn complexes, and prevented the incorporation of PAI-1 into extracellular matrix of HT 1080 cells. This mAb bound to the recombinant peptide containing aa 1-40, but not to the peptide consisting of aa 1-30. A second randomly chosen mAb with similar affinity for Vn was inactive in these assays and bound to the region between aa 52 and 239. These results indicate that the high affinity binding site for active PAI-1 in Vn is between aa 1 and 40, and that this domain may also stabilize active PAI-1."
https://openalex.org/W2044403322,"We have investigated the site of expression of the potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) induced by the activation of postsynaptic voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, by examining the effect of depolarizing pulses on miniature (m) EPSCs and responses to AMPA. Application of voltage pulses caused a approximately 2.5-fold increase in the mean amplitude of mEPSCs. This NMDA receptor-independent potentiation of mEPSC amplitudes was transient, returning to control values within 30-40 min. The potentiation was associated with a decrease in the number of small amplitude events and an increase in the number, as well as the maximum amplitude, of the larger events, with no apparent change in mEPSC kinetics. Accompanying the increase in mEPSC amplitudes, there was a 1.6-fold increase in the apparent frequency of events. Voltage pulse-induced potentiation was completely blocked by the inclusion of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA in the recording pipette. Responses to repeated applications of AMPA were also potentiated following the application of voltage pulses, and the time course of this potentiation was similar to that observed with the mEPSCs. Our data indicate that rises in intracellular Ca2+ that occur independently of NMDA receptor activation can result in a potentiation of quantal size, which is due to an increase in the postsynaptic sensitivity of non-NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1556308744,"We have generated several clones of Chinese hamster ovary, mouse epitheloid C127, and pig kidney epithelial LLCPK1 cells producing high levels of functional recombinant human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Processing of CFTR to the mature and fully glycosylated form in these cells is inefficient with only approximately 40% of all newly synthesized CFTR being converted to the mature form. Furthermore, expression of the most frequent mutant allele of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene, the delta F508 mutant in these epithelial cells, indicated that it is biosynthetically arrested at the endoplasmic reticulum and fails to traffic to the plasma membrane. Using a combination of CFTR mutants and monoclonal antibodies, all the detectable recombinant CFTR in these cells was determined at least under the conditions used, to be present as a monomer. To demonstrate the feasibility of protein replacement therapy, we were able to effect the physical transfer of functional recombinant CFTR produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells to the plasma membranes of Ha3b fibroblasts, a cell line devoid of cAMP-stimulated chloride channels. Transfer of CFTR was mediated by the hemagglutinin viral fusion protein of influenza virus present on the Ha3b cells. Efficiency of transfer was up to 25% of the target cells, and CFTR chloride channel activity was detectable for up to 12 h post-fusion. Therefore, with the development of an appropriate formulation of fusogenic proteoliposome or virosome containing reconstituted purified CFTR, it should be feasible to introduce functional CFTR into CF-affected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004695318,"Ligand-gated ion channel subunits show a striking abundance of highly conserved proline residues. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that peptidyl-prolyl isomerases may be involved in the maturation of these channels. Cyclosporin A, a selective blocker of a ubiquitous isomerase cyclophilin, reduced the surface expression in Xenopus oocytes of functional homo-oligomeric receptors containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 7 without blocking alpha 7 polypeptide synthesis. This effect could be generalized to the homo-oligomeric 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor but not to the hetero-oligomeric muscle nicotinic receptor. An alpha 7 receptor could be rescued from cyclosporin A blockade by coexpressed muscle non-alpha subunits. The effect of cyclosporin A was reversed by overexpression of exogenous rat brain cyclophilin. These findings indicate that cyclophilins may play a critical role in the maturation of homo-oligomeric receptors, acting directly or indirectly as prolyl isomerases or as molecular chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W1604557362,"The asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) is a highly specialized biomembrane elaborated by terminally differentiated urothelial cells. It contains quasi-crystalline arrays of 12-nm protein particles each of which is composed of six dumbbell-shaped subdomains. In this paper we describe the precursor sequence, processing and in vitro membrane insertion properties of bovine uroplakin II (UPII), a 15-kDa major protein component of AUM. The cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence revealed that UPII is synthesized as a precursor protein containing a cleavable signal peptide of approximately 26 amino acids, a long pro-sequence of approximately 59 residues harboring three potential N-glycosylation sites, and the mature polypeptide of 100 residues. In vitro translation of UPII mRNA demonstrated that UPII is indeed first synthesized as a 19-kDa precursor, which loses its signal peptide upon insertion into added microsomes; this process is accompanied by the acquisition of high mannose-type oligosaccharides giving rise to a 28-kDa precursor which is completely protected from the digestion by exogenous proteases. These results, together with the presence of a stretch of 25 hydrophobic amino acids at the C terminus, suggest that UPII protein is anchored to the lipid bilayer via its C-terminal membrane-spanning domain with its major N-terminal domain exposed luminally. The formation of the 15-kDa mature UPII requires the removal of the pro-sequence by a furin-like endoprotease. Since only mature UPII devoid of this pro-sequence can interact with 27-kDa uroplakin I, the proteolytic processing of UPII precursor may play an important role in regulating the assembly of AUM. Finally, we showed that genomic sequences cross-hybridizing with bovine UPII cDNA are present in many mammals suggesting that UPII performs a highly conserved function in the terminally differentiated cells of mammalian urinary bladder epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1605902541,"We have investigated biochemical mechanisms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha signaling in cultured human skin fibroblasts. We found that TNF-alpha signaling may involve activation of a cell membrane neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) in that within 2.5-5 min of treatment of cells with TNF-alpha there was a 2-fold increase in the activity of N-SMase compared to control. This reaction led to the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin as evidenced by a decrease in sphingomyelin mass and in the radioactivity associated with [14C]choline-labeled sphingomyelin. This was accompanied by a 4-fold increase in the formation of cholesteryl [14C]oleate within 2.5 min of incubation with TNF-alpha. This reaction also stimulated the mobilization of cell surface-associated [3H]cholesterol and its utilization in the synthesis of [3H]cholesteryl esters via acyl coenzyme-A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). Gas chromatographic analysis revealed that the cellular level of cholesteryl esters increased about 2.5-3-fold following treatment with TNF-alpha compared to control. Cholesteryl ester synthesis was compromised upon incubation of cells with antibody against N-SMase and remained unaltered with TNF-beta and fibroblast growth factor. Furthermore, TNF-alpha-mediated stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis was compromised by incubation of cells with an inhibitor of ACAT. These findings suggest a possible biological role of N-SMase in the signal transduction of TNF-alpha in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters in human fibroblasts."

To determine the importance of altering metabolic demand while maintaining food intake constant, littermates were also studied in a cold environment (10 degrees C). Results were tissue-specific: the level of GHR mRNA per unit total RNA in liver was greater on high than low (high = 2 x low) food intake (P < 0.001), whereas in muscle it was elevated on the low compared with the high intake diet (P < 0.02) and also at 10 degrees C compared with 26 degrees C (P < 0.04). When results for GHR mRNA were expressed per unit weight of tissue, only the effects of diet on liver and temperature on muscle remained significant. The changes in hepatic GHR mRNA may have been driven in part by nutritionally induced changes in thyroid status, because both plasma 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine concentration and liver 5'-deiodinase activity were greater on the high than the low intake diet (P < 0.001). Levels of liver GHR mRNA probably had a direct influence on growth of the animals, as they were positively correlated with plasma IGF-I and growth rate (P < 0.001), whereas muscle GHR mRNA may have had a metabolic role when energy supplies were limited."
https://openalex.org/W1572507953,"The 5'-upstream region of the rat alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene strongly increased de novo methylation of an adjacent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene upon transfection into F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells. The same effect was exerted by a distal 775-base pair (bp) fragment and by 300- and 1-kb fragments preceding the transcriptional start site, but not by other parts of the control region. Further division of the larger, strongly active fragments resulted in a gradual decrease of methylation and clonal variation in the methylation patterns. The effect of the 775-bp fragment did not depend on its orientation. It was ablated by insertion of the mouse metallothionein I promoter between the AFP gene fragment and the CAT gene, but not by its insertion upstream of the AFP gene fragment. Two fragments from the AFP control region increasing methylation contained B1 and B2 small interspersed repetitive elements, respectively. B1 and B2 sequences of different origin also acted strongly to increase methylation. These findings support the idea that mammalian genes contain specific sequences involved in regulating their methylation. The effects of these sequences appear to be exerted in cis, to be dependent on proximity, but not on orientation, and to require an optimal size of 500-700 bp. Small retrotransposon sequences within such elements may be particularly effective in attracting de novo methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1529255301,"Highly purified yeast RNA polymerase III ternary complexes were found to possess a hydrolytic chain retracting activity that cleaves nascent RNA from its 3'-OH end. Most of the shortened transcripts were capable of resuming RNA chain elongation, indicating that they remain stably associated with the enzyme-DNA complex. Analysis of the products of cleavage indicated that retraction primarily occurred in dinucleotide increments, but that mononucleotides were also excised at lower frequency. The ribonuclease activity was totally dependent on the presence of a divalent cation and was stimulated by the addition of non-cognate ribonucleotides. The inclusion of ATP in the reaction enhanced both the rate and extent of transcript cleavage. Evidence suggesting that the hydrolytic activity is intrinsic to RNA polymerase III and factor-independent is also presented. Transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase III ternary complexes appears to be more closely related to the intrinsic nucleolytic activity of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase ternary complexes than to TFIIS-dependent cleavage that has been described for RNA polymerase II ternary complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1587213486,"The mammalian cDNA encoding alpha (1,3)-fucosyltransferase (alpha (1,3)Fuc-T) termed ELAM-1 ligand fucosyltransferase (ELFT) or Fuc-TIV was previously cloned by three groups who reported different results from transfection studies Goelz et al. (Goelz, S. E., Hession, C., Goff, D., Griffiths, B., Tizard, R., Newman, B., Chi-Rosso, G., and Lobb, R. (1990) Cell 63, 1349-1356) found that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the ELFT cDNA had alpha (1,3)Fuc-T activity and were able to bind to E-selectin. In contrast, Lowe et al. (Lowe, J. B., Kukowska-Latallo, J. F., Nair, R. P., Larsen, R. D., Marks, R. M., Macher, B. A., Kelly, R. J., and Ernst, L. K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17467-17477) and Kumar et al. (Kumar, R., Potvin, B., Muller, W. A., and Stanley, P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21777-21783) found no binding to E-selectin of CHO transfectants expressing the same alpha (1,3)Fuc-T gene; nor did the latter transfectants synthesize a known E-selectin ligand, sialylated Lex (SLex), although they had substantial alpha (1,3)Fuc-T activity. We now show that these discrepant results were due to a difference between the parental CHO cell lines. Following transfection of ELFT cDNA into Pro-5 or dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)- CHO cells, only the DHFR- transfectants expressed SLex and bound to E-selectin. Indirect evidence from monoclonal antibody and lectin binding studies indicates that the range of carbohydrate structures synthesized by the Pro-5 and DHFR- CHO cell lines differs. Since DHFR-/ELFT transfectants expressed cell surface SLex but transferred fucose poorly to sialylated substrates in vitro, ELFT may be able to fucosylate a complex carbohydrate missing from Pro-5 cells. Alternatively, either CHO line may have an activity (such as an alpha (2,3)-sialyltransferase), that modifies alpha (1,3)-fucosylated lactosamines."
https://openalex.org/W2154142128,"A contribution of the 51-kDa subunit of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase to activities of the parental heterodimer (p66/p51) was assessed in heterodimers whose p51 component contained C-terminal truncations of 13, 19, or 25 residues. Analyses included (i) efficiency of reconstitution into heterodimer, (ii) retention of polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) function, and (iii) interaction with the HIV replication primer, tRNA(Lys,3). Our data suggest that these features of heterodimer reverse transcriptase can be modulated by the extent of the C-terminal p51 deletion. Severely impaired tRNA binding in a selectively deleted heterodimer whose 51-kDa subunit lacks 13 residues, despite retention of enzymatic functions, strengthens arguments for p51 involvement in tRNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1479938390,"By using a DNA substrate with defined gap size, we found that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) was able to perform strand displacement DNA synthesis. This activity was not affected first by calf thymus proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication factor C and second by Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein, which together allow DNA polymerase delta to perform strand displacement DNA synthesis (Podust, V., and Hubscher, U. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 841-846). 3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate inhibited displacement completely, indicating that DNA synthesis is required for this reaction. The HIV-RT p66 polypeptide alone could perform limited strand displacement DNA synthesis, whereas the HIV-RT p51 polypeptide was completely inactive, likely due to its inability to replicate extensively on a M13 DNA template. On the other hand the HIV-RT p51 polypeptide enhanced the strand displacement activity of the HIV-RT p66 subunit at a molar ratio of 4:1, mainly by chasing short products into longer ones. Furthermore, kinetic experiments after complementation of HIV-RT p66 with HIV-RT p51 indicated that HIV-RT p51 can restore rate and extent of strand displacement activity by HIV-RT p66 compared with the HIV-RT heterodimer p66/p51, suggesting a function of the 51-kDa polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1633331005,"The transmembrane folding of the alpha subunit of Na,K-ATPase was studied by using immunoelectron microscopy to determine whether monoclonal antibodies with defined epitopes bind to the extracellular or cytoplasmic surface. In double labeling experiments, an antibody and a reference marker were bound to purified membrane-associated Na,K-ATPase and were visualized by employing colloidal gold particles of two different sizes. Wheat germ agglutinin and a previously characterized monoclonal antibody were used as control markers for the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic surfaces, respectively. Three antibodies, VG4, VG2, and IIC9, unambiguously bound to the extracellular surface. Previously IIC9 had been assigned to the cytoplasmic surface because, in immunofluorescence studies, it stained intact cells only when they were detergent-permeabilized. To investigate the basis for this contradiction, a third assay for sidedness was used: competition binding in solution to right-side-out renal medullary vesicles. IIC9 was found to bind to the extracellular surface of sealed vesicles, but only in certain experimental conditions. It was concluded that IIC9 has an epitope that is not always accessible and that in this instance, studies of binding to intact and detergent-treated cells had given misleading results. An extracellular disposition for all three antibodies is not compatible with existing folding models, and new models are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1575529827,"The NH2-terminal domain of pro-opiomelanocortin, designated as the 16-kDa fragment, is highly conserved throughout the vertebrate family and is likely therefore to have an important functional role. Bovine 16-kDa fragment is a 77- residue glycopeptide, which has been found to be glycosylated at threonine 45 and asparagine 65. Available evidence suggests that glycoforms lacking glycans at the O-linked site are processed in the intermediate pituitary at -Arg49-Lys50- to give the residue 1-49 amino-terminal peptide and a carboxyl-terminal glycopeptide referred to as Lys1 gamma 3-melanotropin. Glycoforms carrying O-glycans remain unprocessed in the intermediate pituitary. Thus O-glycosylation is likely to play an important role in controlling the fate of the NH2-terminal portion of pro-opiomelanocortin, thereby affecting the biological events that are influenced by peptides and glycopeptides derived from this domain. In a recent study (Siciliano, R. A., Morris, H. R., McDowell, R. A., Azadi, P., Rogers, M. E., Bennett, H. P. J., and Dell, A. (1993) Glycobiology 3, 225-239), we sequenced the N-glycans attached to Asn-65 of bovine 16-kDa fragment and demonstrated that the acidic components contain, in addition to neutral antennae, a single SO4-4GalNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1- antenna, which is characteristic of the pituitary glycohormone N-glycans (Baenziger, J. U., and Green, E. D. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 947, 287-306). We now report the structural characterization of the O-linked oligosaccharides found in bovine 16-kDa fragment. The major component, which constitutes about 80% of the O-glycan population, is a novel sulfated tetrasaccharide, which carries the same sulfated epitope as the N-glycans. This is the first time that the SO4-4GalNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1- moiety has been observed in O-glycans, and it raises the interesting possibility that the beta-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase responsible for the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine to the pituitary glycohormones (Smith, P. L., and Baenziger, J. U. (1988) Science, 242, 930-933) might be capable of glycosylating both N- and O-linked acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1519034820,"Interferons induce a number of different proteins which mediate the antiproliferative, antiviral, and immunomodulatory functions of interferons. Interferon-induced Mx proteins, which confer resistance to influenza, vesicular stomatitis, and measles viruses, contain consensus GTPase sequence elements. Insect cell-produced purified murine Mx1 and human MxA proteins were found to hydrolyze GTP with Km = 65 microM (Vmax, 7.1 min-1) and 62 microM (Vmax, 3.1 min-1), respectively. The GTPase activity of Mx1 and MxA proteins was strictly dependent on Mg2+ ions. Murine Mx1 protein was inactivated at 10 degrees C lower temperatures than MxA protein. As analyzed, by filter binding assay, Mx1 protein (at 1 microM) showed a relatively high affinity for GDP (Kd = 1.0 x 10(-7) M) and approximately 340-fold lower affinity for guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) (Kd = 3.4 x 10(-5) M). The Kd values for MxA protein were 2.0 x 10(-7) M for GDP and 5.9 x 10(-6) M for GTP gamma S, showing approximately a 30-fold affinity difference. ATP, UTP, or CTP did not inhibit the Mx protein-dependent GTPase activity, suggesting that Mx1 and MxA proteins are highly specific for guanosine nucleotides. In conclusion recombinant nuclear murine Mx1 and cytoplasmic human MxA proteins show clear differences in their enzymatic activities and nucleotide binding characteristics. How these differences influence their cellular functions and antiviral potential is presently not known."
https://openalex.org/W1563012002,"It has long been known that pyruvate is essential for survival of prenatal neurons in culture. To understand the role of exogenous pyruvate in neuronal calcium homeostasis, we have investigated the effects of pyruvate (plus malate) addition to dissociated adult rat hippocampal and cerebral cortex cells and cultured CNS neurons having an unrestricted glucose supply. We found that pyruvate (plus malate) increased the respiration rate while ATP levels were unchanged. At the same time, cytosolic free calcium concentrations, [Ca2+]i, decreased while total 45Ca2+ and 40Ca2+ accumulation increased. The extra Ca2+ accumulated by the cells is attributable to an increase in the size of the intracellular calcium pools. Two such pools were identified on the basis of their sensitivity to specific drugs. The first pool was mobilized by thapsigargin plus tert-butyl hydroquinone and caffeine while the second pool was discharged by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (plus oligomycin). The two pools represented about 15-20% and 15-30%, respectively, of the rapidly exchangeable 45Ca2+ pools in cerebral cortex cells. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (as induced by uncouplers (FCCP) or respiratory chain inhibitors (antimycin) caused a large increase in [Ca2+]i which varied in size and shape among cells and was reduced by external Ca2+ chelation. The latter condition also resulted in a partial discharge of FCCP-releasable 45Ca2+. The effects of FCCP did not result simply from ATP depletion since incubation in glucose-free medium and sequential additions of 2 mM deoxyglucose and 10 microM oligomycin, conditions that led to a dramatic reduction in cellular ATP levels, did not abolish the FCCP-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Taken together, the results indicate that mitochondria harbor a significant proportion of cellular Ca2+. The sensitivity of the mitochondrial pool size to pyruvate (plus malate) questions previous hypotheses concerning a kinetic limitation for Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria in resting neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1931741544,"AtT20 (mouse pituitary corticotroph) cells were stably transfected with human proinsulin cDNA. Clone H12 displayed low basal release of insulin-like immunoreactivity (< 1% cell content/30 min) with 17-fold stimulation by isobutylmethylxanthine/forskolin. Clone H23, by contrast, showed higher basal release (2.8% cell content/30 min) and only 6-fold stimulation. To follow the kinetics of conversion and release of only newly synthesized proinsulin, cells were pulse-chased, and labeled proinsulin-related products were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. In the cells of both clones, [3H]proinsulin was converted to insulin with des-31,32-split proinsulin as the only detectable intermediate. While basal release of labeled products from H12 cells was low (3%/60 min), it was rapid and elevated from H23 cells (12.5% by 30 min and 24.8% by 60 min of chase) with [3H]des-31,32-split proinsulin the predominant molecular form. Stimulation of [3H] insulin release increased with time, reaching 3.8-fold by 90 min of chase, whereas that of [3H]des-31,32-split proinsulin was approximately 1.5-fold regardless of the chase time. Rapid secretion of newly synthesized products that is insensitive to secretagogues is the hallmark of the constitutive pathway. Thus in H23 cells an unusually large amount of proinsulin is diverted to the constitutive pathway, where it is partially converted to des-31,32-split proinsulin before release."

https://openalex.org/W1664911529,"We evaluated the role of the protein kinase C (PKC) and its isozymes in the activation of human endothelial cells (EC) stimulated by platelet-activating factor (PAF). Exposure of confluent EC to PAF resulted in a rapid and concentration-dependent redistribution of PKC from cytosol to plasma-membrane, rearrangement of cytoskeleton (i.e. decrease in F-actin content and redistribution of vinculin), and finally increase in the transendothelial flux of 125I-albumin. Stimulation of EC with oleylacetylglycerol or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced the modification of the cytoskeletal structures and the increase of 125I-albumin clearance. Inhibitors of PKC prevented the effects induced by PAF on the cytoskeleton and on the barrier function of the EC monolayer. Confluent EC expressed only alpha, beta, and epsilon PKC isoforms. Biochemical and immunochemical analysis showed that the time course of the PKC isozymes translocation from cytosol to the membrane fraction of EC stimulated by PAF was different: beta isoform was redistributed more quickly than alpha isoform. PAF did not induce translocation of PKC epsilon. These results suggest that activation of PKC alpha and beta is an important signal transduction pathway by which PAF activates endothelial monolayer and modify its function of barrier to macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1652147248,"Using a computer-assisted molecular modeling protocol, we have completed the three-dimensional structures of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I based on the C alpha crystal coordinates of the individual enzymes. The two model-built structures were then used to compare the electrostatic potential contours and analyze the spatial positions of residues conserved in the catalytic domains of the two enzymes. In spite of rather weak sequence similarity and different folding patterns between the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (pol I) and the RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (RT), we have noted the occurrence of identical or similar residues at common spatial positions in pol I and RT in a three-dimensional context. The homologous residues present at equivalent spatial position in the Klenow fragment and the p66 subunit of HIV-1 RT may therefore imply their functional similarity. Furthermore, these conserved residues may represent a similar structure-function feature in all polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1841262292,"The response of the murine genes encoding the subunits of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKAD) to changes in dietary protein was determined. Steady-state RNA levels for two of the subunits, E1 beta and E2, decreased by two- to four-fold in the livers of mice fed 0% protein isocaloric diets compared to the levels observed in mice fed standard (23%) or high (50%) protein isocaloric diets. In contrast, the levels of RNA encoding the E1 alpha subunit did not change significantly in response to these dietary protein changes. The hepatic decreases in E1 beta and E2 RNA associated with 0% protein isocaloric diets were reversible, with prompt return to baseline levels following 48 hours of 50% protein isocaloric diets ad libitum. In kidney, no significant changes in the RNAs encoding any of the three BCKAD subunits were observed in response to changes in dietary protein. Studies of RNA variations associated with growth and development in several murine tissues, including liver and kidney, demonstrated coordinated changes between all subunits. Similar coordinated changes were observed during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. These studies suggest that the responses of the BCKAD subunit genes to alterations in dietary protein are noncoordinated and tissue-specific, in contrast to the coordinated changes observed during growth and/or differentiation. The differences in BCKAD subunit RNA levels observed under varying nutritional and developmental conditions suggest that multiple regulatory mechanisms modulate BCKAD subunit expression."

In this report, we synthesized tRNA(Lys-3) of which the 3'-terminal adenosine residue lacks either a 2'-OH or 3'-OH. These tRNA molecules were used for the HIV-1 cDNA-priming reaction in a cell-free system consisting of a 141-base RNA template and purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It was found that under the conditions used, the tRNA containing the 2'-deoxyadenosine was able to initiate the cDNA synthesis, while the tRNA with the 3'-deoxyadenosine was not. The results show that retroviral reverse transcriptase specifically primes cDNA synthesis from the 3'-OH group. This is in contrast to bacterial reverse transcriptase, which initiates cDNA synthesis from the 2'-OH group of an internal guanosine residue of a template RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1487219476,"The reversible denaturant-induced unfolding of immunoglobulin molecules has been analyzed by transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis and the effects that urea-induced unfolding exerts on the functional properties associated with their variable region, i.e. antigen binding and idiotypic expression, have been determined by Western blot analysis. Results obtained from these experiments indicate that urea-induced unfolding of the immunoglobulin molecule is a highly cooperative reversible process that occurs through a two-state transition with no accumulation of intermediates. The unfolding transition has its midpoint at about 6.5 M urea and appears to be slow on the time scale of electrophoresis. Folding intermediates in rapid equilibrium with the unfolded state as well as molecular forms with different electrophoretic mobility can be detected during refolding reactions. Results from Western blot analysis confirm the highly cooperative reversible urea-induced unfolding of immunoglobulin molecules and demonstrate that the unfolding transition leads to disappearance of both antigen binding and idiotypic expression, whereas the ability to interact with antibodies directed to continuous epitopes of the variable region is preserved. After progressive removal of the denaturing agent, the variable region refolds into structures that regain the functional properties of the native conformation."

Here, we report antigen-specific deletion of cloned T cells by treatment with soluble, cognate MHC II-(peptide-toxin) complexes. Toxin (doxorubicin or mycophenolic acid) was attached to synthetic AcMBP(1-14)Ala4 peptide, an analog of the natural acetylated NH2-terminal segment, AcMBP(1-14), of rat myelin basic protein (MBP). IAk-restricted, AcMBP(1-14)-Specific AJ1.2 and 4R3.9 cloned murine T cells were killed by IAk-(AcMBP(1-14)Ala4-toxin). No killing resulted from incubating AJ1.2 and 4R3.9 cells with irrelevant MHC II-(peptide-toxin) or treating IEk-restricted, pigeon cytochrome c-specific A.E7 cloned murine T cells with IAk-(AcMBP(1-14)Ala4-toxin). T cell receptor-mediated T cell uptake of the peptide-toxin moiety of relevant complex was blocked by anti-T cell receptor-alpha/beta antibody and by excess toxin-free complex. LD50 determinations revealed that cognate MHC II-(peptide-toxin) killed T cells much more effectively than did peptide-toxin conjugate alone. Finally, T cell uptake of peptide-toxin and intracellular release of toxin occurred after incubation with relevant MHC II-(peptide-toxin) containing radiolabeled toxin. These findings, which provide the first evidence that cloned T cells can be deleted with soluble, cognate MHC II-(peptide-toxin) complexes, may have significant clinical relevance for antigen-specific therapy of autoimmune or other T cell-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1658436193,"Treatment of rats with hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] (HCCL), a cobalamin antagonist, results in both increased hepatic mitochondrial content and the development of defects in mitochondrial ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase. The present study was designed to evaluate changes in hepatic mitochondrial RNA contents in response to HCCL treatment in rats. After 2 weeks of HCCL treatment, hepatic contents of the mature mitochondrial mRNAs (expressed normalized to 28 S rRNA) encoding subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CO II), subunit 1 of NADH dehydrogenase (ND1), and cytochrome b were reduced to values 40-60% of those observed in RNA from control liver tissue. In addition, HCCL induced a pronounced accumulation of high molecular weight RNA species which hybridized to mitochondrial probes and represented polycistronic RNA sequences. The polycistronic RNAs were products of the heavy strand of the mitochondrial genome, and major species demonstrated hybridization patterns consistent with identifications corresponding to the 12-16 S rRNA, 12-16 S-ND1, 16 S-ND1, and CO II-ATP synthase subunit 6 regions of the mitochondrial genome. Maximal expression of the polycistronic mitochondrial RNA was observed after 2 weeks of HCCL treatment. Thus, HCCL treatment interferes with mitochondrial RNA processing and decreases the content of mature mitochondrial mRNAs. Altered expression of the mitochondrial genome may be responsible for the decreased electron transport chain activity known to result from HCCL administration."
