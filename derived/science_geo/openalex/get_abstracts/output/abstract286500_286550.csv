https://openalex.org/W2005291531,"A previously undescribed marine bacterium, Vibrio damsela, was isolated from naturally occurring skin ulcers on a species of temperate-water damselfish, the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis). Laboratory infection of the blacksmith with Vibrio damsela produced similar ulcers. Vibrio damsela was pathogenic for four other species of damselfish but not for members of other families of fish. The bacterium has also been isolated from water and from two human wounds and may be a cause of human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2065141899,"Male American cockroaches walk a zigzag path upwind toward a source of female sex pheromone. Although the maximum width of the pathway is regulated by the width of an odor plume, many turns are made before the edge of a wide plume is encountered. In addition to the pheromone regulation of the insect's orientation movements, an internal mechanism appears to influence the zigzag turning pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2038053024,"The outer, densely calcified layer of the alligator eggshell shows progressive crystal dissolution, with the production of concentrically stepped erosion craters, as incubation progresses. This dissolution is caused by the acidic metabolic by-products of nest bacteria. Extrinsic degradation serves to gradually increase the porosity and decrease the strength of the eggshell."
https://openalex.org/W1983344425,"Gypsy moth caterpillars have long, soft setae distributed along the lateral portions of the body, but only short, stiff setae on the dorsal surface. Setae act as selective insulation for caterpillars by reducing the rates of convective heat exchange without affecting the rates of radiative heat exchange. Changes in posture abolish the effects of the setae by maximizing convection and minimizing radiant heat uptake."
