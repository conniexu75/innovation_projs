The nanotubes were resonantly excited at the fundamental frequency and higher harmonics as revealed by their deflected contours, which correspond closely to those determined for cantilevered elastic beams. The elastic bending modulus as a function of diameter was found to decrease sharply (from about 1 to 0.1 terapascals) with increasing diameter (from 8 to 40 nanometers), which indicates a crossover from a uniform elastic mode to an elastic mode that involves wavelike distortions in the nanotube. The quality factors of the resonances are on the order of 500. The methods developed here have been applied to a nanobalance for nanoscopic particles and also to a Kelvin probe based on nanotubes."

However, we demonstrate here that some steroid hormones are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis of steroid-carrier complexes. We show that 25-(OH) vitamin D3 in complex with its plasma carrier, the vitamin D–binding protein, is filtered through the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules by the endocytic receptor megalin. Endocytosis is required to preserve 25-(OH) vitamin D3 and to deliver to the cells the precursor for generation of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, a regulator of the calcium metabolism. Megalin−/− mice are unable to retrieve the steroid from the glomerular filtrate and develop vitamin D deficiency and bone disease."

https://openalex.org/W2031492273,Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate plant cell division. The D-type cyclin CycD3 was found to be elevated in a mutant of Arabidopsis with a high level of cytokinin and to be rapidly induced by cytokinin application in both cell cultures and whole plants. Constitutive expression of CycD3 in transgenic plants allowed induction and maintenance of cell division in the absence of exogenous cytokinin. Results suggest that cytokinin activates Arabidopsis cell division through induction of CycD3 at the G 1 -S cell cycle phase transition.

The complex [H 2 O(terpy)Mn(O) 2 Mn(terpy)OH 2 ](NO 3 ) 3 (terpy is 2,2′:6′,2""-terpyridine), which was synthesized and structurally characterized, contains a di-μ-oxo manganese dimer and catalyzes the conversion of sodium hypochlorite to molecular oxygen. Oxygen-18 isotope labeling showed that water is the source of the oxygen atoms in the molecular oxygen evolved, and so this system is a functional model for photosynthetic water oxidation."

In mammals, taste perception begins with the recognition of tastant molecules by unknown membrane receptors localized on the apical surface of receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelium. We report the cloning and characterization of two novel seven–transmembrane domain proteins expressed in topographically distinct subpopulations of taste receptor cells and taste buds. These proteins are specifically localized to the taste pore and are members of a new group of G protein–coupled receptors distantly related to putative mammalian pheromone receptors. We propose that these genes encode taste receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2052540561,"Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is required for inheritance of epigenetically determined chromosomal states in vivo and promotes assembly of chromatin during DNA replication in vitro. Herein, we demonstrate that after DNA replication, replicated, but not unreplicated, DNA is also competent for CAF-1-dependent chromatin assembly. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a DNA polymerase clamp, is a component of the replication-dependent marking of DNA for chromatin assembly. The clamp loader, replication factor C (RFC), can reverse this mark by unloading PCNA from the replicated DNA. PCNA binds directly to p150, the largest subunit of CAF-1, and the two proteins colocalize at sites of DNA replication in cells. We suggest that PCNA and CAF-1 connect DNA replication to chromatin assembly and the inheritance of epigenetic chromosome states."

Engineered L1s retrotranspose at high frequency in cultured human cells. Here it is shown that L1s insert into transcribed genes and retrotranspose sequences derived from their 3′ flanks to new genomic locations. Thus, retrotransposition-competent L1s provide a vehicle to mobilize non-L1 sequences, such as exons or promoters, into existing genes and may represent a general mechanism for the evolution of new genes."

Morphology-specific gene products may confer proinvasive properties. A hypha-specific surface protein, Hwp1, with similarities to mammalian small proline-rich proteins was shown to serve as a substrate for mammalian transglutaminases. Candida albicans strains lacking Hwp1 were unable to form stable attachments to human buccal epithelial cells and had a reduced capacity to cause systemic candidiasis in mice. This represents a paradigm for microbial adhesion that implicates essential host enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2077353522,"During learning, neural responses decrease over repeated exposure to identical stimuli. This repetition suppression is thought to reflect a progressive optimization of neuronal responses elicited by the task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study the neural basis of associative learning of visual objects and their locations. As expected, activation in specialized cortical areas decreased with time. However, with path analysis it was shown that, in parallel to this adaptation, increases in effective connectivity occurred between distinct cortical systems specialized for spatial and object processing. The time course of these plastic changes was highly correlated with individual learning performance, suggesting that interactions between brain areas underlie associative learning."
https://openalex.org/W1978962917,The morphology of amorphous solid water grown by vapor deposition was found to depend strongly on the angular distribution of the water molecules incident from the gas phase. Systematic variation of the incident angle during deposition using a collimated beam of water led to the growth of nonporous to highly porous amorphous solid water. The physical and chemical properties of amorphous solid water are of interest because of its presence in astrophysical environments. The ability to control its properties in the laboratory may shed light on some of the outstanding conflicts related to this important material.
https://openalex.org/W2154968967,"A chimera with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been constructed to visualize the dynamic properties of the endosome-microtubule linker protein CLIP-170 (GFP-CLIP170). GFP-CLIP170 binds in stretches along a subset of microtubule ends. These fluorescent stretches appear to move with the growing tips of microtubules at 0.15–0.4 μm/s, comparable to microtubule elongation in vivo. Analysis of speckles along dynamic GFP-CLIP170 stretches suggests that CLIP-170 treadmills on growing microtubule ends, rather than being continuously transported toward these ends. Drugs affecting microtubule dynamics rapidly inhibit movement of GFP-CLIP170 dashes. We propose that GFP-CLIP170 highlights growing microtubule ends by specifically recognizing the structure of a segment of newly polymerized tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W1944302200,"Hox homeodomain proteins are developmental regulators that determine body plan in a variety of organisms. A majority of the vertebrate Hox proteins bind DNA as heterodimers with the Pbx1 homeodomain protein. We report here the 2.35 Å structure of a ternary complex containing a human HoxB1–Pbx1 heterodimer bound to DNA. Heterodimer contacts are mediated by the hexapeptide of HoxB1, which binds in a pocket in the Pbx1 protein formed in part by a three–amino acid insertion in the Pbx1 homeodomain. The Pbx1 DNA-binding domain is larger than the canonical homeodomain, containing an additional α helix that appears to contribute to binding of the HoxB1 hexapeptide and to stable binding of Pbx1 to DNA. The structure suggests a model for modulation of Hox DNA binding activity by Pbx1 and related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2060528642,"COPI-coated vesicle budding from lipid bilayers whose composition resembles mammalian Golgi membranes requires coatomer, ARF, GTP, and cytoplasmic tails of putative cargo receptors (p24 family proteins) or membrane cargo proteins (containing the KKXX retrieval signal) emanating from the bilayer surface. Liposome-derived COPI-coated vesicles are similar to their native counterparts with respect to diameter, buoyant density, morphology, and the requirement for an elevated temperature for budding. These results suggest that a bivalent interaction of coatomer with membrane-bound ARF[GTP] and with the cytoplasmic tails of cargo or putative cargo receptors is the molecular basis of COPI coat assembly and provide a simple mechanism to couple uptake of cargo to transport vesicle formation."
https://openalex.org/W2041892053,"Dpp, a TGFβ, organizes pattern in the Drosophila wing by acting as a graded morphogen, activating different targets above distinct threshold concentrations. Like other TGFβs, Dpp appears to induce transcription directly via activation of a SMAD, Mad. However, here we demonstrate that Dpp can also control gene expression indirectly by downregulating the expression of the brinker gene, which encodes a putative transcription factor that functions to repress Dpp targets. The medial-to-lateral Dpp gradient along the anterior–posterior axis is complemented by a lateral-to-medial gradient of Brinker, and the presence of these two opposing gradients may function to allow cells to detect small differences in Dpp concentration and respond by activating different target genes."

This new material can be quenched to ambient temperature above 1 gigapascal. The vibration spectrum of CO2-V is similar to that of the quartz polymorph of silicon dioxide, indicating that it is an extended covalent solid with carbon-oxygen single bonds. This material is also optically nonlinear, generating the second harmonic of a neodymium-yttrium-lithium-fluoride laser at a wavelength of 527 nanometers with a conversion efficiency that is near 0.1 percent."

Dpp signals via the SMAD proteins Mad and Medea. Here we show that in the absence of brinker (brk), Mad is not required for the activation of Dpp target genes that depend on low levels of Dpp. brk encodes a novel protein with features of a transcriptional repressor. brk itself is negatively regulated by Dpp. Dpp signaling might relieve brk’s repression of low-level target genes either by transcriptional repression of brk or by antagonizing a repressor function of brk at the target gene promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2043092063,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder leading to the widespread development of benign tumors that often contain giant cells. We show that the Drosophila gene gigas encodes a homolog of TSC2, a gene mutated in half of TSC patients. Clones of gigas mutant cells induced in imaginal discs differentiate normally to produce adult structures. However, the cells in these clones are enlarged and repeat S phase without entering M phase. Our results suggest that the TSC disorder may result from an underlying defect in cell cycle control. We have also identified a Drosophila homolog of TSC1."

Increase in the niobium/thorium ratio shows involvement of hydrated lithosphere in differentiation of Earth since approximately 3.8 billion years ago.

https://openalex.org/W1838484704,"Carbonic anhydrase III (CA III; EC 4.2.1.1) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that exhibits a relatively low carbon dioxide hydratase activity. It is expressed at a very high level in skeletal muscle, where physical exercise has been shown to increase free radical production. In this work we show the effect of overexpression of CA III on cellular response to oxidative stress. Rat CA III cDNA was transfected to NIH/3T3 cells, which have no endogenous CA III expression. The isolated clones expressed CA III mRNA and protein. The protein was localized to cytoplasm and nuclei. Compared to parental cells, transfected cells showed lower basal oxidized state as judged by measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) using fluorescent dye and an image analysis system. Addition of exogenous H2O2 to cells induced a rapid increase of ROS in control but not in CA III overexpressing cells. Association of this phenomenon with CA III expression was further confirmed by showing that overexpression of CA II could not prevent H2O2-stimulated increase of ROS. In proliferation assays, CA III overexpressing cells grew faster and were more resistant to cytotoxic concentrations of H2O2 than control cells. After a 16 h exposure to oxidative stress, the number of apoptotic cells was also reduced in transfectants. Our results suggest that CA III functions as an oxyradical scavenger and thus protects cells from oxidative damage. A lower level of free radicals in CA III overexpressing cells may also affect growth signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1491374817,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leads to dysfunction and degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells. This disease is characterized, in part, by the development of extracellular deposits called drusen. The presence of drusen is correlated with the development of AMD, although little is known about drusen composition or biogenesis. Drusen form within Bruch's membrane, a stratified extracellular matrix situated between the retinal pigmented epithelium and choriocapillaris. Because of this association, we sought to determine whether drusen contain known extracellular matrix constituents. Antibodies directed against a battery of extracellular matrix molecules were screened on drusen-containing sections from human donor eyes, including donors with clinically documented AMD. Antibodies directed against vitronectin, a plasma protein and extracellular matrix component, exhibit intense and consistent reactivity with drusen; antibodies to the conformationally distinct, heparin binding form of human vitronectin are similarly immunoreactive. No differences in vitronectin immunoreactivity between hard and soft drusen, or between macular and extramacular regions, have been observed. RT-PCR analyses revealed that vitronectin mRNA is expressed in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE)-choroidal complex and cultured RPE cells. These data document that vitronectin is a major constituent of human ocular drusen and that vitronectin mRNA is synthesized locally. Based on these data, we propose that vitronectin may participate in the pathogenesis of AMD."

Three classes have been identified, all using free-radical chemistry but based on different cofactors. Classes I and II have been shown to be evolutionarily related, whereas the origin of anaerobic class III has remained elusive. The structure of a class III enzyme suggests a common origin for the three classes but shows differences in the active site that can be understood on the basis of the radical-initiation system and source of reductive electrons, as well as a unique protein glycyl radical site. A possible evolutionary relationship between early deoxyribonucleotide metabolism and primary anaerobic metabolism is suggested."

Above 2000 meters elevation the ice sheet is in balance but thinning predominates at lower elevations, with rates exceeding 1 meter per year on east coast outlet glaciers. These high thinning rates occur at different latitudes and at elevations up to 1500 meters, which suggests that they are caused by increased rates of creep thinning rather than by excessive melting.

https://openalex.org/W2115022546,"The semimajor axes of asteroids up to about 20 kilometers in diameter drift as a result of the Yarkovsky effect, a subtle nongravitational mechanism related to radiation pressure recoil on spinning objects that orbit the sun. Over the collisional lifetimes of these objects (typically, 10 to 1000 million years), orbital semimajor axes can be moved by a few hundredths of an astronomical unit for bodies between 1 and 10 kilometers in mean radius. This has implications for the delivery of multikilometer near-Earth asteroids, because the Yarkovsky drift drives many small main-belt asteroids into the resonances that transport them to the Mars-crossing state and eventually to near-Earth space. Recent work has shown that, without such a drift, the Mars-crossing population would be depleted over about 100 million years, a time scale much smaller than the age of the solar system. Moreover, the Yarkovsky semimajor axis mobility may spread in an observable way the tight semimajor axis clustering of small asteroids produced as a consequence of disruptive collisions."

Among these proteins, two functionally distinct subgroups are characterized: aquaporins that allow specific water transfer and glycerol channels that are involved in glycerol and small neutral solutes transport. Since the flow of small molecules across cell membranes is vital for every living organism, the study of such proteins is of particular interest. For instance, aquaporins located in kidney cell membranes are responsible for reabsorption of 150 liters of water/day in adult human. To understand the molecular mechanisms of solute transport specificity, we analyzed mutant aquaporins in which highly conserved residues have been substituted by amino acids located at the same positions in glycerol channels. Here, we show that substitution of a tyrosine and a tryptophan by a proline and a leucine, respectively, in the sixth transmembrane helix of an aquaporin leads to a switch in the selectivity of the channel, from water to glycerol.

Based on amino acid sequence, members of the MIP 1The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside 1The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside family are predicted to share a common topology consisting in 6 transmembrane domains connected by 5 loops (A–E). From biochemical and biophysical data, a model representing these proteins as “hourglasses” has been proposed (1Jung J. Preston G. Smith B. Guggino W. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In this model, the channel pore is constituted by the junction of loops B and E that overlap midway between the leaflets of the membrane. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the first identified aquaporin, AQP1 (2Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), has been obtained and has defined that the protein complex is constituted by four monomers (3Cheng A. Van Hoek A.N. Yeager M.

This zone represents likely the narrowest segment of the water pore and may be constituted by loops B and E according to the hourglass model. As opposed to the increasing amount of data aiming to determine aquaporins structure, no study concerning glycerol channels has been reported, but considering their high level of identity, it was assumed that they had the same structural organization. Using a biochemical approach, we showed recently that an insect aquaporin, AQPcic (6Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M.T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is tetrameric in cell membrane, like AQP1, whereas the glycerol channel of Escherichia coli(GlpF) is a monomer (7Lagrée V.

These results suggest that oligomerization of MIP proteins could be involved in transport selectivity. In order to elucidate molecular mechanisms that are accountable of the channel selectivity, we have developed a strategy consisting in a systematic comparison of the physico-chemical properties of amino acids at each position in multiple sequence alignments (8Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have identified five positions (P1–P5) corresponding to amino acid residues conserved in aquaporins and glycerol channels but with highly different physico-chemical properties in the two subgroups. Interestingly, four positions (P2, P3, P4, P5) highlighted by our sequence analysis are located in, or very close to, loop E, strengthening the idea that this loop is involved in the pore structure and/or selectivity of the protein. In this paper, we performed a functional study combined to an oligomerization state analysis of AQPcic mutants. We demonstrate that substitution of a tyrosine and a tryptophan by a proline and a leucine, respectively, on positions P4P5 of AQPcic abolishes the water transfer and allow the glycerol passage through the protein.RESULTSWe have constructed mutants of AQPcic by substituting characteristic amino acids of aquaporins with corresponding glycerol channels amino acids at positions P2 (AQPcic-S205D), P3 (AQPcic-A209K), and P4P5 (AQPcic-Y222P/W223L). Transcripts corresponding to AQPcic and mutants AQPcic and GlpF were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and the presence of proteins in the oocyte membranes was verified by Western blot (Fig. 2).Figure 2Expression of AQPcic, mutant AQPcic, and GlpF in oocytes. Western blots were performed with total protein membrane extracts of Xenopus oocytes injected with AQPcic cRNA (AQPcic), mutant AQPcic cRNA (S205D, A209K, Y222P/W223L), GlpF cRNA (GlpF), or H2O (control). Immunodetections were achieved with anti-AQPcic antibodies (A) or with antibodies directed against a synthetic peptide of GlpF (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional assays were achieved by measuring the water permeability (Pf), the apparent glycerol permeability (P′gly), and the glycerol uptake of oocytes expressing the different proteins. As shown previously, oocytes injected with AQPcic cRNA present a 14-fold increase ofPf compared with control oocytes (Fig. 3A). In contrast, oocytes injected with mutants AQPcic (AQPcic-S205D, AQPcic-A209K, and AQPcic-Y222P/W223L) or GlpF cRNA do not demonstrate anyPf increase (Fig. 3A). In Fig. 3B, apparent glycerol permeability is evaluated for each oocyte batch. Remarkably, oocytes expressing AQPcic-Y222P/W223L behave like GlpF expressing oocytes and exhibit a 8-fold increase ofP′gly compared with control oocytes. When injected with GlpF cRNA, oocytes exhibit a 9-fold increase ofP′gly, whereas in oocytes expressing AQPcic, AQPcic-S205D, or AQPcic-A209K, no modification ofP′gly is observed as compared with controls. To reinforce these data, an experiment of glycerol uptake has been performed using [14C]glycerol. The results confirm a significant increase in glycerol uptake of 9-fold for oocytes expressing AQPcic-Y222P/W223L and of 8-fold for GlpF expressing oocytes as compared with controls (Fig. 3C).Figure 3The mutant AQPcic-Y222P/W223L loses its ability to transport water and acquires glycerol transport properties. For each experiment,Pf, P′gly, and glycerol uptake were measured from 10 oocytes expressing either AQPcic (AQPcic), AQPcic-S205D (S205D), AQPcic-A209K (A209K), AQPcic-Y222P/W223L (YW222/223PL), or from H2O-injected oocytes (Control).

The experiments were performed using proteins overexpressed in yeast cells and extracted either with denaturing detergent (SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate) or nondenaturing detergent (OG,n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). As shown in Fig. 4, AQPcic extracted with OG peaks at sedimentation fraction number 9–10. These fractions correspond to a 6.8 S apparent sedimentation coefficient mean value that fits with a homotetrameric form of the protein. When protein solubilization is performed with SDS, sedimentation occurs at fraction numbers 14 and 15 (mean value of 2.8 S) that correspond to the monomeric form of the protein. In opposition, the mutant AQPcic-Y222P/W223L constantly peaks at fractions corresponding to a monomer whatever the detergent used for the solubilization of the proteins and thus behaves like the GlpF protein (Fig. 4).Figure 4The mutant AQPcic-Y222P/W223L is a monomer. AQPcic and AQPcic-Y222P/W223L were extracted from yeast membranes and GlpF from Xenopus total membranes. Proteins were extracted with a nondenaturing detergent (OG) or a denaturing detergent (SDS) and then analyzed on sucrose gradient.

Thus, the puzzling question that currently emerged is how the specificity of proteins for water and/or small solutes is achieved. Our data reveal that substitution of amino acids on aquaporins by corresponding glycerol facilitator residues at positions P2, P3, P4P5 abolishes water transport, demonstrating the crucial role of these amino acids in aquaporin function. Furthermore, the AQPcic mutant that has been substituted on positions P4P5 by glycerol channels amino acids gains competence to transport glycerol. Oligomerization analysis further demonstrates that this mutant loses its ability to form a tetramer. The involvement of these two conserved amino acids positions in both oligomerization and specificity of the proteins gives a new important parameter that need to be considered for structural and functional studies on MIP proteins. Indeed, in addition to amino acids strictly involved in the pore structure, one should also take into account amino acids that are necessary for oligomer assembly, without excluding the fact that some residues might be implicated in both mechanisms. Positions P4P5 are located at the top of helix 6 in MIP proteins and correspond to aromatic residues in aquaporins whereas a proline followed by a non aromatic residue is always found in the glycerol channels group (Fig. 1B). The role of proline in determining local conformation in proteins is well known (25MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of such residue in MIP proteins provokes undoubtedly a different conformation of helix 6 and/or influences regions closed to the helix. Since loop E, that is supposed to participate in the pore of the protein, is very close to this helix, the interaction between the loop E and helix 6 may modulates the aperture of the pore and thus be responsible of the protein specificity. Using the three-dimensional model (3Cheng A. Van Hoek A.N. Yeager M. Verkman A.S. Mitra A.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) of AQP1, Walzet al. (5Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heymann J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) have assigned each helix of the protein by their corresponding numbers in the hourglass model. According to their analysis, each monomer of AQP1 interacts with each other by contacts between helices 4 and 6. Conserved amino acids located in these helices are thus essential to maintain the tetrameric structure of aquaporins. This structural organization of aquaporin monomers explains the crucial role of amino acids at positions P4P5 in the conformation of the protein. In this paper, we report for the first time a double mutation that modifies the protein structure in such a way that it allows a change in the nature of the transported molecule from water to glycerol. We point out two amino acids that are involved in the selective transport by MIP proteins. We further demonstrate that the specificity switch (water to glycerol transport) is correlated to a change in oligomerization state of the proteins. We thus propose that oligomerization state is part of the mechanisms utilized by MIP proteins to ensure selectivity. Based on amino acid sequence, members of the MIP 1The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside 1The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside family are predicted to share a common topology consisting in 6 transmembrane domains connected by 5 loops (A–E). From biochemical and biophysical data, a model representing these proteins as “hourglasses” has been proposed (1Jung J. Preston G. Smith B. Guggino W. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In this model, the channel pore is constituted by the junction of loops B and E that overlap midway between the leaflets of the membrane. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the first identified aquaporin, AQP1 (2Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), has been obtained and has defined that the protein complex is constituted by four monomers (3Cheng A. Van Hoek A.N. Yeager M. Verkman A.S. Mitra A.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Li H. Lee S. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Each monomer is formed by six tilted α helices spanning the membrane bilayer and surrounding a central density zone. This zone represents likely the narrowest segment of the water pore and may be constituted by loops B and E according to the hourglass model. As opposed to the increasing amount of data aiming to determine aquaporins structure, no study concerning glycerol channels has been reported, but considering their high level of identity, it was assumed that they had the same structural organization. Using a biochemical approach, we showed recently that an insect aquaporin, AQPcic (6Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Delamarche C. Pellerin I. Bonnec G. Guillam M.T. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Hubert J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is tetrameric in cell membrane, like AQP1, whereas the glycerol channel of Escherichia coli(GlpF) is a monomer (7Lagrée V. Froger A. Deschamps S. Pellerin I. Delamarche C. Bonnec G. Gouranton J. Thomas D. Hubert J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33949-33953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results suggest that oligomerization of MIP proteins could be involved in transport selectivity. In order to elucidate molecular mechanisms that are accountable of the channel selectivity, we have developed a strategy consisting in a systematic comparison of the physico-chemical properties of amino acids at each position in multiple sequence alignments (8Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have identified five positions (P1–P5) corresponding to amino acid residues conserved in aquaporins and glycerol channels but with highly different physico-chemical properties in the two subgroups. Interestingly, four positions (P2, P3, P4, P5) highlighted by our sequence analysis are located in, or very close to, loop E, strengthening the idea that this loop is involved in the pore structure and/or selectivity of the protein. In this paper, we performed a functional study combined to an oligomerization state analysis of AQPcic mutants. We demonstrate that substitution of a tyrosine and a tryptophan by a proline and a leucine, respectively, on positions P4P5 of AQPcic abolishes the water transfer and allow the glycerol passage through the protein. RESULTSWe have constructed mutants of AQPcic by substituting characteristic amino acids of aquaporins with corresponding glycerol channels amino acids at positions P2 (AQPcic-S205D), P3 (AQPcic-A209K), and P4P5 (AQPcic-Y222P/W223L). Transcripts corresponding to AQPcic and mutants AQPcic and GlpF were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and the presence of proteins in the oocyte membranes was verified by Western blot (Fig. 2).Functional assays were achieved by measuring the water permeability (Pf), the apparent glycerol permeability (P′gly), and the glycerol uptake of oocytes expressing the different proteins. As shown previously, oocytes injected with AQPcic cRNA present a 14-fold increase ofPf compared with control oocytes (Fig. 3A). In contrast, oocytes injected with mutants AQPcic (AQPcic-S205D, AQPcic-A209K, and AQPcic-Y222P/W223L) or GlpF cRNA do not demonstrate anyPf increase (Fig. 3A). In Fig. 3B, apparent glycerol permeability is evaluated for each oocyte batch. Remarkably, oocytes expressing AQPcic-Y222P/W223L behave like GlpF expressing oocytes and exhibit a 8-fold increase ofP′gly compared with control oocytes. When injected with GlpF cRNA, oocytes exhibit a 9-fold increase ofP′gly, whereas in oocytes expressing AQPcic, AQPcic-S205D, or AQPcic-A209K, no modification ofP′gly is observed as compared with controls. To reinforce these data, an experiment of glycerol uptake has been performed using [14C]glycerol. The results confirm a significant increase in glycerol uptake of 9-fold for oocytes expressing AQPcic-Y222P/W223L and of 8-fold for GlpF expressing oocytes as compared with controls (Fig. 3C).Figure 3The mutant AQPcic-Y222P/W223L loses its ability to transport water and acquires glycerol transport properties. For each experiment,Pf, P′gly, and glycerol uptake were measured from 10 oocytes expressing either AQPcic (AQPcic), AQPcic-S205D (S205D), AQPcic-A209K (A209K), AQPcic-Y222P/W223L (YW222/223PL), or from H2O-injected oocytes (Control). The givenPf (A) and P′gly (B) are the average of five independent experiments. Glycerol uptake (C) is given from three experiments (values ± S.D.).

The experiments were performed using proteins overexpressed in yeast cells and extracted either with denaturing detergent (SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate) or nondenaturing detergent (OG,n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). As shown in Fig. 4, AQPcic extracted with OG peaks at sedimentation fraction number 9–10. These fractions correspond to a 6.8 S apparent sedimentation coefficient mean value that fits with a homotetrameric form of the protein. When protein solubilization is performed with SDS, sedimentation occurs at fraction numbers 14 and 15 (mean value of 2.8 S) that correspond to the monomeric form of the protein. In opposition, the mutant AQPcic-Y222P/W223L constantly peaks at fractions corresponding to a monomer whatever the detergent used for the solubilization of the proteins and thus behaves like the GlpF protein (Fig. 4).Figure 4The mutant AQPcic-Y222P/W223L is a monomer. AQPcic and AQPcic-Y222P/W223L were extracted from yeast membranes and GlpF from Xenopus total membranes. Proteins were extracted with a nondenaturing detergent (OG) or a denaturing detergent (SDS) and then analyzed on sucrose gradient.

DISCUSSIONAccumulating data indicate that MIP proteins contain two major physiological subgroups. Recently, we (8Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and others have reported that the separation of these two subfamilies might be based on few sequence and/or motif distinctions (17Park J.H.

https://openalex.org/W1580752465,"Cytokines play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of septic shock. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) stimulate the progression of septic shock whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has counterregulative potency. The amino acid glycine (GLY) has been shown to protect against endotoxin shock in the rat by inhibiting TNF-alpha production. In the current study we investigated the role of GLY on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced cell surface marker expression, phagocytosis, and cytokine production on purified monocytes from healthy donors. GLY did not modulate the expression of HLA-DR and CD64 on monocytes, whereas CD11b/CD18 expression (P<0.05) and E. coli phagocytosis (P<0.05) decreased significantly. GLY decreased LPS-induced TNF-alpha production (P<0.01) and increased IL-10 expression of purified monocytes. Similarly, in a whole blood assay, GLY reduced TNF-alpha (P<0.0001) and IL-1beta (P<0.0001) synthesis and increased IL-10 expression (P<0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of GLY were neutralized by strychnine, and the production of IL-10 and TNF-alpha was augmented by anti-IL-10 antibodies. Furthermore, GLY decreased the amount of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha-specific mRNA. Our data indicate that GLY has a potential to be used as an additional immunomodulatory tool in the early phase of sepsis and in different pathophysiological situations related to hypoxia and reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2005020760,"Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates the second messenger diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid. To date, very little is known about the regulation of DGK activity. We have previously identified the DGKθ isotype, which is predominantly expressed in brain (Houssa, B., Schaap, D., van der Wal, J., Goto, K., Kondo, H., Yamakawa, A., Shibata, M., Takenawa, T., and Van Blitterswijk, W. J. (1997) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 272, 10422–10428). We now report that DGKθ binds specifically to activated RhoA in transfected COS cells as well as in nontransfected neuronal N1E-115 cells. Binding is abolished by a point mutation (Y34N) in the effector loop of RhoA. DGKθ does not bind to inactive RhoA, nor to the other Rho-family GTPases, Rac or Cdc42. Like active RhoA, DGKθ localizes to the plasma membrane. Strikingly, the binding of activated RhoA to DGKθ completely inhibits DGK catalytic activity. Our results suggest that DGKθ is a downstream effector of RhoA and that its activity is negatively regulated by RhoA. Through accumulation of newly produced diacylglycerol, RhoA-mediated inhibition of DGKθ may lead to enhanced PKC activity in response to external stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2136304861,"Oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) participate in atherosclerosis plaque formation, rupture, and subsequent thrombosis. Because oxLDL are toxic to cultured cells and Bcl-2 protein prevents apoptosis, the present work aimed to study whether Bcl-2 may counterbalance the toxicity of oxLDL. Two experimental model systems were used in which Bcl-2 levels were modulated: 1) lymphocytes in which the (high) basal level of Bcl-2 was reduced by antisense oligonucleotides; 2) HL60 and HL60/B (transduced by Bcl-2) expressing low and high Bcl-2 levels, respectively. In cells expressing relatively high Bcl-2 levels (lymphocytes and HL60/B), oxLDL induced mainly primary necrosis. In cells expressing low Bcl-2 levels (antisense-treated lymphocytes, HL60 and ECV-304 endothelial cells), the rate of oxLDL-induced apoptosis was higher than that of primary necrosis. OxLDL evoked a sustained calcium rise, which is a common trigger to necrosis and apoptosis since both types of cell death were blocked by the calcium chelator EGTA. Conversely, a sustained calcium influx elicited by the calcium ionophore A23187 induced necrosis in cells expressing high Bcl-2 levels and apoptosis in cells expressing low Bcl-2 levels. This suggests that Bcl-2 acts downstream from the calcium peak and inhibits only the apoptotic pathway, not the necrosis pathway, thus explaining the apparent shift from oxLDL-induced apoptosis toward necrosis when Bcl-2 is overexpressed."

In search of genes and pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with proteinuria, we used differential display-PCR to identify differences in gene expression between glomeruli from CNF and control kidneys. A distinctly underexpressed PCR product of the CNF kidneys showed over 98% identity with a mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX I). Using a full-length COX I cDNA probe, we verified down-regulation of COX I mRNA to 1/4 of normal kidney values on Northern blots. In addition, transcripts of other mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain complexes showed a similar down-regulation whereas the respective nuclearly encoded complexes were expressed at comparable levels. Additional studies using histochemical, immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, and biochemical and electron microscopic methods all showed a mitochondrial involvement in the diseased kidneys but not in extrarenal blood vessels. As a secondary sign of mitochondrial dysfunction, excess lipid peroxidation products were found in glomerular structures in CNF samples. Our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in the kidneys of patients with CNF, with subsequent lipid peroxidation at the glomerular basement membrane. Our additional studies have revealed similar down-regulation of mitochondrial functions in experimental models of proteinuria. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction may be a crucial pathophysiologic factor in this symptom."
https://openalex.org/W2114869892,"In serum-deprived MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, mechanical stimulation caused by mild (287 x g) centrifugation induced a 10-fold increase in mRNA levels of the proto-oncogene, c-fos. Induction of c-fos was abolished by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H-89, suggesting that the transient c-fos mRNA increase is mediated by cAMP. Down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by chronic TPA treatment failed to significantly reduce c-fos induction, suggesting that TPA-sensitive isoforms of PKC are not responsible for c-fos up-regulation. In addition, 287 x g centrifugation increased intracellular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels 2.8-fold (P<0. 005). Since we have previously shown that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can induce c-fos expression via a cAMP-mediated mechanism, we asked whether the increase in c-fos mRNA was due to centrifugation-induced PGE2 release. Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not hinder the early induction of c-fos by mechanical stimulation. We conclude that c-fos expression induced by mild mechanical loading is dependent primarily on cAMP, not PKC, and initial induction of c-fos is not necessarily dependent on the action of newly synthesized PGE2."
https://openalex.org/W2029493776,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis characterized by hyperproliferative keratinocytes (KC). The skin lesions are infiltrated by T cells, which secrete gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) and are believed to be necessary to maintain the psoriatic phenotype. In normal KC, gamma-IFN is a potent inhibitor of proliferation, but proliferation of KC persists in psoriatic plaques despite the presence of gamma-IFN. Immunostaining of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) revealed that IRF-1 was localized to the basal cells of the epidermis in normal and in nonlesional psoriatic skin, but was suprabasal or completely absent in lesional psoriatic skin. This finding led to the hypothesis that abnormal signaling in the gamma-IFN pathway may occur in psoriatic KC. To test this hypothesis, we measured activation of IRF-1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1alpha transcription factors in KC after stimulation with gamma-IFN. Primary cultures of KC from normal and nonlesional psoriatic skin were stimulated with gamma-IFN and subsequent transcription factor activation was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Psoriatic KC showed a reduced induction of IRF-1 and STAT-1alpha activation after stimulation with gamma-IFN, compared with normal KC. Reduced activation of IRF-1 and STAT-1alpha in response to gamma-IFN indicates a fundamental defect in the growth and differentiation control of psoriatic KC in the absence of the influence of other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1586665170,"It is now widely accepted that injured nerves, like any other injured tissue, need assistance from their extracellular milieu in order to heal. We compared the postinjury activities of thrombin and gelatinases, two types of proteolytic activities known to be critically involved in tissue healing, in nonregenerative (rat optic nerve) and regenerative (fish optic nerve and rat sciatic nerve) neural tissue. Unlike gelatinases, whose induction pattern was comparable in all three nerves, thrombin-like activity differed clearly between regenerating and nonregenerating nervous systems. Postinjury levels of this latter activity seem to dictate whether it will display beneficial or detrimental effects on the capacity of the tissue for repair. The results of this study further highlight the fact that tissue repair and nerve regeneration are closely linked and that substances that are not unique to the nervous system, but participate in wound healing in general, are also crucial for regeneration or its failure in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1606495340,"Depletion of growth factors and glucocorticoids are known to induce apoptosis and inhibit growth in T lymphocytes. We have examined the effect of Bcl-2 expression on the cellular response to growth factor depletion in the presence or absence of glucocorticoids. Cell growth was determined by cell counting and viability was quantitated by dye exclusion. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry, analysis of DNA integrity, and enzymatic determination of caspase-3-like activity. Serum depletion and glucocorticoid administration inhibited cell growth and stimulated apoptosis in Bcl-2 negative cells. Cotreatment with both stimuli had additive effects on apoptosis but not on inhibition of cell growth. Bcl-2 expression abrogated the repressive effect of glucocorticoids on apoptosis but not on cell growth. In contrast, neither apoptosis nor growth inhibition induced by serum depletion of cells was blocked by Bcl-2 expression. However, glucocorticoid treatment of Bcl-2-overexpressing cells protected them from apoptosis induced by serum depletion. Glucocorticoid protection of Bcl-2-overexpressing cells from serum depletion-induced apoptosis was mimicked by other inducers of apoptosis, which act to inhibit protein synthesis. These data suggest that Bcl-2 expression can switch the effect of glucocorticoids from proapoptotic to antiapoptotic when lymphocytes expressing Bcl-2 are exposed to other apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2136285700,"The developmental and tissue-specific regulation of growth hormone receptor (GHR) mRNA expression is complex and involves alternate leader exon usage. The transcript composition of hepatic GHR mRNA has therefore been determined in fetal sheep during late gestation and after experimental manipulation of fetal plasma cortisol levels by fetal adrenalectomy and exogenous cortisol infusion, using RNase protection assays and a riboprobe containing exons 1A, 2, and 3 of the ovine GHR gene. Expression of the adult liver-specific GHR mRNA transcript containing exon 1A was not detected earlier than 138 days of gestation (term 145 ±2 days). Thereafter, expression of this leader exon increased and accounted for 25–30% of the total GHR mRNA in the fetal liver at term. Hepatic GHR mRNA derived from leader exons other than 1A was detectable at 97 days and increased in abundance toward term in parallel with the normal prepartum rise in fetal plasma cortisol. Abolition of this cortisol surge by fetal adrenalectomy prevented both the activation of exon 1A expression and the prepartum rise in GHR mRNA derived from the other leader exons in fetal ovine liver. Conversely, raising cortisol levels by exogenous infusion earlier in gestation prematurely activated exon 1A expression and enhanced the abundance of GHR mRNA transcripts derived from the other leader exons. Cortisol therefore appears to activate the adult mode of GHR gene expression in fetal ovine liver during late gestation. These observations have important implications for the maturation of the somatotrophic axis and for the onset of GH-dependent growth after birth.—Li, J., Gilmour, R. S., Saunders, J. C., Dauncey, M. J., Fowden, A. L. Activation of the adult mode of ovine growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene expression by cortisol during late fetal development. FASEB J. 13, 545–552 (1999)"

https://openalex.org/W1548034758,"This paper describes a branched synthetic peptide [3.7] that incorporates sequence discontinuous residues of HIV-1 gp120 constant regions. The approach was to bring together residues of gp120 known to interact with human cell membranes such that the peptide could fold to mimic the native molecule. The peptide incorporates elements of both the conserved CD4 and CCR5 binding sites. The 3.7 peptide, which cannot be produced by conventional genetic engineering methods, is recognized by antiserum raised to native gp120. The peptide also binds to CD4 and competitively inhibits binding of QS4120 an antibody directed against the CDR2 region of CD4. When preincubated with the CD4+ve MM6 macrophage cell line, which expresses mRNA for the CCR3 and CCR5 chemokine receptors, both 3.7 and gp120 inhibit binding of the chemokine MIP-1α. The peptide also inhibits infection of primary macrophages by M-tropic HIV-1. Thus, 3.7 is a prototype candidate peptide for a vaccine against HIV-1 and represents a novel approach to the rational design of peptides that can mimic complex sequence discontinuous ligand binding sites of clinically relevant proteins.—Howie, S.
