They conclude that most inherited risk for autism is determined by common variation and that rare variation explains a smaller fraction of total heritability. A key component of genetic architecture is the allelic spectrum influencing trait variability. For autism spectrum disorder (herein termed autism), the nature of the allelic spectrum is uncertain. Individual risk-associated genes have been identified from rare variation, especially de novo mutations1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. From this evidence, one might conclude that rare variation dominates the allelic spectrum in autism, yet recent studies show that common variation, individually of small effect, has substantial impact en masse9,10. At issue is how much of an impact relative to rare variation this common variation has. Using a unique epidemiological sample from Sweden, new methods that distinguish total narrow-sense heritability from that due to common variation and synthesis of results from other studies, we reach several conclusions about autism's genetic architecture: its narrow-sense heritability is ∼52.4%, with most due to common variation, and rare de novo mutations contribute substantially to individual liability, yet their contribution to variance in liability, 2.6%, is modest compared to that for heritable variation."
https://openalex.org/W2161413435,"In the 1950s, the drug thalidomide, administered as a sedative to pregnant women, led to the birth of thousands of children with multiple defects. Despite the teratogenicity of thalidomide and its derivatives lenalidomide and pomalidomide, these immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) recently emerged as effective treatments for multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion-associated dysplasia. IMiDs target the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (known as CRL4(CRBN)) and promote the ubiquitination of the IKAROS family transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 by CRL4(CRBN). Here we present crystal structures of the DDB1-CRBN complex bound to thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide. The structure establishes that CRBN is a substrate receptor within CRL4(CRBN) and enantioselectively binds IMiDs. Using an unbiased screen, we identified the homeobox transcription factor MEIS2 as an endogenous substrate of CRL4(CRBN). Our studies suggest that IMiDs block endogenous substrates (MEIS2) from binding to CRL4(CRBN) while the ligase complex is recruiting IKZF1 or IKZF3 for degradation. This dual activity implies that small molecules can modulate an E3 ubiquitin ligase and thereby upregulate or downregulate the ubiquitination of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2156075763,"The viral reservoir represents a critical challenge for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) eradication strategies. However, it remains unclear when and where the viral reservoir is seeded during acute infection and the extent to which it is susceptible to early antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here we show that the viral reservoir is seeded rapidly after mucosal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus monkeys and before systemic viraemia. We initiated suppressive ART in groups of monkeys on days 3, 7, 10 and 14 after intrarectal SIVMAC251 infection. Treatment with ART on day 3 blocked the emergence of viral RNA and proviral DNA in peripheral blood and also substantially reduced levels of proviral DNA in lymph nodes and gastrointestinal mucosa as compared with treatment at later time points. In addition, treatment on day 3 abrogated the induction of SIV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Nevertheless, after discontinuation of ART following 24 weeks of fully suppressive therapy, virus rebounded in all animals, although the monkeys that were treated on day 3 exhibited a delayed viral rebound as compared with those treated on days 7, 10 and 14. The time to viral rebound correlated with total viraemia during acute infection and with proviral DNA at the time of ART discontinuation. These data demonstrate that the viral reservoir is seeded rapidly after intrarectal SIV infection of rhesus monkeys, during the 'eclipse' phase, and before detectable viraemia. This strikingly early seeding of the refractory viral reservoir raises important new challenges for HIV-1 eradication strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2032523448,"The timing of type I interferon signalling determines the disease course of SIV infection. Type I interferon (IFN-I) is shown here to have dual effects in rhesus macaques exposed to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV): it is beneficial at the onset of infection but as infection progresses it becomes detrimental. IFN signaling was manipulated in two ways. IFN-I receptor blockade results in increased plasma viraemia, accelerated CD4 T cell loss and progression to AIDS. In contrast, IFN-α2a administration prior to high-dose intrarectal SIV challenge increases resistance to systemic infection. However, continued IFN-α2a treatment induces IFN-I desensitization and facilitates SIV infection. Overall, the benefits of early antiviral activity appear to outweigh the detrimental effects of immune activation during acute SIV infection. Inflammation in HIV infection is predictive of non-AIDS morbidity and death1, higher set point plasma virus load2 and virus acquisition3; thus, therapeutic agents are in development to reduce its causes and consequences. However, inflammation may simultaneously confer both detrimental and beneficial effects. This dichotomy is particularly applicable to type I interferons (IFN-I) which, while contributing to innate control of infection4,5,6,7,8,9,10, also provide target cells for the virus during acute infection, impair CD4 T-cell recovery, and are associated with disease progression6,7,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Here we manipulated IFN-I signalling in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmission and acute infection with two complementary in vivo interventions. We show that blockade of the IFN-I receptor caused reduced antiviral gene expression, increased SIV reservoir size and accelerated CD4 T-cell depletion with progression to AIDS despite decreased T-cell activation. In contrast, IFN-α2a administration initially upregulated expression of antiviral genes and prevented systemic infection. However, continued IFN-α2a treatment induced IFN-I desensitization and decreased antiviral gene expression, enabling infection with increased SIV reservoir size and accelerated CD4 T-cell loss. Thus, the timing of IFN-induced innate responses in acute SIV infection profoundly affects overall disease course and outweighs the detrimental consequences of increased immune activation. Yet, the clinical consequences of manipulation of IFN signalling are difficult to predict in vivo and therapeutic interventions in human studies should be approached with caution."

We report a new monogenic cause of autoimmunity resulting from de novo germline activating STAT3 mutations in five individuals with a spectrum of early-onset autoimmune disease, including type 1 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2001981171,"Photosynthesis, a process catalysed by plants, algae and cyanobacteria converts sunlight to energy thus sustaining all higher life on Earth. Two large membrane protein complexes, photosystem I and II (PSI and PSII), act in series to catalyse the light-driven reactions in photosynthesis. PSII catalyses the light-driven water splitting process, which maintains the Earth's oxygenic atmosphere. In this process, the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII cycles through five states, S0 to S4, in which four electrons are sequentially extracted from the OEC in four light-driven charge-separation events. Here we describe time resolved experiments on PSII nano/microcrystals from Thermosynechococcus elongatus performed with the recently developed technique of serial femtosecond crystallography. Structures have been determined from PSII in the dark S1 state and after double laser excitation (putative S3 state) at 5 and 5.5 Å resolution, respectively. The results provide evidence that PSII undergoes significant conformational changes at the electron acceptor side and at the Mn4CaO5 core of the OEC. These include an elongation of the metal cluster, accompanied by changes in the protein environment, which could allow for binding of the second substrate water molecule between the more distant protruding Mn (referred to as the 'dangler' Mn) and the Mn3CaOx cubane in the S2 to S3 transition, as predicted by spectroscopic and computational studies. This work shows the great potential for time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography for investigation of catalytic processes in biomolecules."
https://openalex.org/W2005233485,"Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis depends critically on the NLRP3 inflammasome/interleukin-1 signalling axis. Mutations in the human NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex involved in innate immunity through the production of certain interleukins, were previously linked to rheumatoid arthritis. Further work on the nature of this relationship has been hampered by the lack of a relevant mouse model. This study shows that the pathology in the mouse model of inflammatory arthritis induced by myeloid-specific deletion of the rheumatoid susceptibility gene A20 depends critically on the NLRP3 inflammasome and interleukin-1 signalling axis. Thus, A20myel-KO mice provide an experimental model for the study of the role of inflammasomes in rheumatoid arthritis pathology and for testing therapies targeting inflammasomes and related cellular pathways. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoinflammatory disease that affects 1–2% of the world’s population and is characterized by widespread joint inflammation. Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of cartilage destruction in rheumatic diseases1, but our understanding of the upstream mechanisms leading to production of interleukin-1β in rheumatoid arthritis is limited by the absence of suitable mouse models of the disease in which inflammasomes contribute to pathology. Myeloid-cell-specific deletion of the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility gene A20/Tnfaip3 in mice (A20myel-KO mice) triggers a spontaneous erosive polyarthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in patients2. Rheumatoid arthritis in A20myel-KO mice is not rescued by deletion of tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (ref. 2). Here we show, however, that it crucially relies on the Nlrp3 inflammasome and interleukin-1 receptor signalling. Macrophages lacking A20 have increased basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression levels of the inflammasome adaptor Nlrp3 and proIL-1β. As a result, A20-deficiency in macrophages significantly enhances Nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis and interleukin-1β secretion by soluble and crystalline Nlrp3 stimuli. In contrast, activation of the Nlrc4 and AIM2 inflammasomes is not altered. Importantly, increased Nlrp3 inflammasome activation contributes to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis in vivo, because deletion of Nlrp3, caspase-1 and the interleukin-1 receptor markedly protects against rheumatoid-arthritis-associated inflammation and cartilage destruction in A20myel-KO mice. These results reveal A20 as a novel negative regulator of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, and describe A20myel-KO mice as the first experimental model to study the role of inflammasomes in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis."

https://openalex.org/W2048797519,"Peptide macrocycles are attracting increasing attention as tools for research and as potential therapeutics. The highly efficient butelase 1—homologous to proteases but specific for ligations—offers a new method for peptide cyclization. Proteases are ubiquitous in nature, whereas naturally occurring peptide ligases, enzymes catalyzing the reverse reactions of proteases, are rare occurrences. Here we describe the discovery of butelase 1, to our knowledge the first asparagine/aspartate (Asx) peptide ligase to be reported. This highly efficient enzyme was isolated from Clitoria ternatea, a cyclic peptide–producing medicinal plant. Butelase 1 shares 71% sequence identity and the same catalytic triad with legumain proteases but does not hydrolyze the protease substrate of legumain. Instead, butelase 1 cyclizes various peptides of plant and animal origin with yields greater than 95%. With Kcat values of up to 17 s−1 and catalytic efficiencies as high as 542,000 M−1 s−1, butelase 1 is the fastest peptide ligase known. Notably, butelase 1 also displays broad specificity for the N-terminal amino acids of the peptide substrate, thus providing a new tool for C terminus–specific intermolecular peptide ligations."
https://openalex.org/W2091492589,"The potential utility of synthetic macrocycles (MCs) as drugs, particularly against low-druggability targets such as protein-protein interactions, has been widely discussed. There is little information, however, to guide the design of MCs for good target protein-binding activity or bioavailability. To address this knowledge gap, we analyze the binding modes of a representative set of MC-protein complexes. The results, combined with consideration of the physicochemical properties of approved macrocyclic drugs, allow us to propose specific guidelines for the design of synthetic MC libraries with structural and physicochemical features likely to favor strong binding to protein targets as well as good bioavailability. We additionally provide evidence that large, natural product-derived MCs can bind targets that are not druggable by conventional, drug-like compounds, supporting the notion that natural product-inspired synthetic MCs can expand the number of proteins that are druggable by synthetic small molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2028251374,"On the basis of whole-genome sequences of clonal lines derived from normal mouse tissues, variation in mutational patterns and load across different tissues are described and early embryonic cell divisions are reconstructed. By whole-genome sequencing of clonal lines derived from multiple tissues of healthy mice, Michael Stratton and colleagues have reconstructed the early cell divisions of each animal, demonstrating the contributions of embryonic cells to adult tissues. They find that tissues differ by the numbers and types of mutations accumulated by each cell, probably as a result of the differences in the number of cell divisions they have undergone and varying contributions of different mutational processes. Thus, the number of somatic mutations can be used as a 'cell division clock', and if mutation rates are similar in mice and humans, this approach should also be applied to human cells. The somatic mutations present in the genome of a cell accumulate over the lifetime of a multicellular organism. These mutations can provide insights into the developmental lineage tree1, the number of divisions that each cell has undergone and the mutational processes that have been operative2. Here we describe whole genomes of clonal lines3 derived from multiple tissues of healthy mice. Using somatic base substitutions, we reconstructed the early cell divisions of each animal, demonstrating the contributions of embryonic cells to adult tissues. Differences were observed between tissues in the numbers and types of mutations accumulated by each cell, which likely reflect differences in the number of cell divisions they have undergone and varying contributions of different mutational processes. If somatic mutation rates are similar to those in mice, the results indicate that precise insights into development and mutagenesis of normal human cells will be possible."
https://openalex.org/W2093859044,"Kinases are principal components of signal transduction pathways and the focus of intense basic and drug discovery research. Irreversible inhibitors that covalently modify non-catalytic cysteines in kinase active sites have emerged as valuable probes and approved drugs. Many protein classes, however, have functional cysteines, and therefore understanding the proteome-wide selectivity of covalent kinase inhibitors is imperative. Here, we accomplish this objective using activity-based protein profiling coupled with quantitative MS to globally map the targets, both specific and nonspecific, of covalent kinase inhibitors in human cells. Many of the specific off-targets represent nonkinase proteins that, notably, have conserved active site cysteines. We define windows of selectivity for covalent kinase inhibitors and show that, when these windows are exceeded, rampant proteome-wide reactivity and kinase target-independent cell death conjointly occur. Our findings, taken together, provide an experimental road map to illuminate opportunities and surmount challenges for the development of covalent kinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2076544864,"Selective ubiquitin-dependent autophagy plays a pivotal role in the elimination of protein aggregates, assemblies, or organelles and counteracts the cytotoxicity of proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Following substrate ubiquitylation, the cargo is delivered to autophagosomes involving adaptors like human p62 that bind ubiquitin and the autophagosomal ubiquitin-like protein Atg8/LC3; however, whether similar pathways exist in lower eukaryotes remained unclear. Here, we identify by a screen in yeast a new class of ubiquitin-Atg8 adaptors termed CUET proteins, comprising the ubiquitin-binding CUE-domain protein Cue5 from yeast and its human homolog Tollip. Cue5 collaborates with Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase, and the corresponding yeast mutants accumulate aggregation-prone proteins and are vulnerable to polyQ protein expression. Similarly, Tollip depletion causes cytotoxicity toward polyQ proteins, whereas Tollip overexpression clears human cells from Huntington's disease-linked polyQ proteins by autophagy. We thus propose that CUET proteins play a critical and ancient role in autophagic clearance of cytotoxic protein aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2059895668,"Elevated levels of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the human brain are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that extracellular Aβ can bind to exosomes, which are cell-secreted nanovesicles with lipid membranes that are known to transport their cargos intercellularly. Such findings suggest that the exosomes are involved in Aβ metabolism in brain. Here, we found that neuroblastoma-derived exosomes exogenously injected into mouse brains trapped Aβ and with the associated Aβ were internalized into brain-resident phagocyte microglia. Accordingly, continuous intracerebral administration of the exosomes into amyloid-β precursor protein transgenic mice resulted in marked reductions in Aβ levels, amyloid depositions, and Aβ-mediated synaptotoxicity in the hippocampus. In addition, we determined that glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a group of membrane glycolipids, are highly abundant in the exosomes, and the enriched glycans of the GSLs are essential for Aβ binding and assembly on the exosomes both in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that intracerebrally administered exosomes can act as potent scavengers for Aβ by carrying it on the exosome surface GSLs and suggest a role of exosomes in Aβ clearance in the central nervous system. Improving Aβ clearance by exosome administration would provide a novel therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2086137483,"The HIV-1 restriction factor SAM domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is proposed to inhibit HIV-1 replication by depleting the intracellular dNTP pool. However, phosphorylation of SAMHD1 regulates its ability to restrict HIV-1 without decreasing cellular dNTP levels, which is not consistent with a role for SAMHD1 dNTPase activity in HIV-1 restriction. Here, we show that SAMHD1 possesses RNase activity and that the RNase but not the dNTPase function is essential for HIV-1 restriction. By enzymatically characterizing Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS)-associated SAMHD1 mutations and mutations in the allosteric dGTP-binding site of SAMHD1 for defects in RNase or dNTPase activity, we identify SAMHD1 point mutants that cause loss of one or both functions. The RNase-positive and dNTPase-negative SAMHD1D137N mutant is able to restrict HIV-1 infection, whereas the RNase-negative and dNTPase-positive SAMHD1Q548A mutant is defective for HIV-1 restriction. SAMHD1 associates with HIV-1 RNA and degrades it during the early phases of cell infection. SAMHD1 silencing in macrophages and CD4(+) T cells from healthy donors increases HIV-1 RNA stability, rendering the cells permissive for HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at T592 negatively regulates its RNase activity in cells and impedes HIV-1 restriction. Our results reveal that the RNase activity of SAMHD1 is responsible for preventing HIV-1 infection by directly degrading the HIV-1 RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2015141554,"To mediate its survival and virulence, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exports hundreds of proteins into the host erythrocyte. To enter the host cell, exported proteins must cross the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) within which the parasite resides, but the mechanism remains unclear. A putative Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) has been suggested to be involved for at least one class of exported proteins; however, direct functional evidence for this has been elusive. Here we show that export across the PVM requires heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), a ClpB-like AAA+ ATPase component of PTEX. Using a chaperone auto-inhibition strategy, we achieved rapid, reversible ablation of HSP101 function, resulting in a nearly complete block in export with substrates accumulating in the vacuole in both asexual and sexual parasites. Surprisingly, this block extended to all classes of exported proteins, revealing HSP101-dependent translocation across the PVM as a convergent step in the multi-pathway export process. Under export-blocked conditions, association between HSP101 and other components of the PTEX complex was lost, indicating that the integrity of the complex is required for efficient protein export. Our results demonstrate an essential and universal role for HSP101 in protein export and provide strong evidence for PTEX function in protein translocation into the host cell."

The 2.26-Gb genome of a female marmoset was assembled using Sanger read data (6×) and a whole-genome shotgun strategy. A first analysis has permitted comparison with the genomes of apes and Old World monkeys and the identification of specific features that might contribute to the unique biology of this diminutive primate, including genetic changes that may influence body size, frequent twinning and chimerism. We observed positive selection in growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor genes (growth pathways), respiratory complex I genes (metabolic pathways), and genes encoding immunobiological factors and proteases (reproductive and immunity pathways). In addition, both protein-coding and microRNA genes related to reproduction exhibited evidence of rapid sequence evolution. This genome sequence for a New World monkey enables increased power for comparative analyses among available primate genomes and facilitates biomedical research application."
https://openalex.org/W1967661330,"Beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) are similar to classical brown adipocytes in that they can burn lipids to produce heat. Thus, an increase in beige adipocyte content in WAT browning would raise energy expenditure and reduce adiposity. Here we report that adipose-specific inactivation of Notch1 or its signaling mediator Rbpj in mice results in browning of WAT and elevated expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), a key regulator of thermogenesis. Consequently, as compared to wild-type mice, Notch mutants exhibit elevated energy expenditure, better glucose tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity and are more resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity. By contrast, adipose-specific activation of Notch1 leads to the opposite phenotypes. At the molecular level, constitutive activation of Notch signaling inhibits, whereas Notch inhibition induces, Ppargc1a and Prdm16 transcription in white adipocytes. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling in obese mice ameliorates obesity, reduces blood glucose and increases Ucp1 expression in white fat. Therefore, Notch signaling may be therapeutically targeted to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2019229746,"The quantized changes in the photon number parity of a microwave cavity can be tracked on a short enough timescale, and with sufficiently little interference with the quantum state, for this parity observable to be used to monitor the occurrence of error in a recently proposed protected quantum memory. For quantum computers to work in practice, they need to incorporate error correction protocols. This involves monitoring quantum states without disturbing them, usually via entanglement with additional qubits. Luyan Sun et al. show that they can track individual quantum jumps in superconducting qubits in microwave cavities. The measurements are projected as parity information (whether there are odd or even number of microwave photons in the system) in an 'ancilla' or accessory qubit, a procedure that causes minimal interference with the qubit state. This parity information can be used for efficient error correction. The approach addresses the outstanding problem of fast and repeated monitoring of an error syndrome and paves the way to fault-tolerant quantum computing with superconducting circuits. Quantum error correction is required for a practical quantum computer because of the fragile nature of quantum information. In quantum error correction, information is redundantly stored in a large quantum state space and one or more observables must be monitored to reveal the occurrence of an error, without disturbing the information encoded in an unknown quantum state. Such observables, typically multi-quantum-bit parities, must correspond to a special symmetry property inherent in the encoding scheme. Measurements of these observables, or error syndromes, must also be performed in a quantum non-demolition way (projecting without further perturbing the state) and more quickly than errors occur. Previously, quantum non-demolition measurements of quantum jumps between states of well-defined energy have been performed in systems such as trapped ions1,2,3, electrons4, cavity quantum electrodynamics5,6, nitrogen–vacancy centres7,8,9 and superconducting quantum bits10,11. So far, however, no fast and repeated monitoring of an error syndrome has been achieved. Here we track the quantum jumps of a possible error syndrome, namely the photon number parity of a microwave cavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla quantum bit, whose only role is to facilitate quantum state manipulation and measurement. This quantity is just the error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme for a hardware-efficient protected quantum memory using Schrödinger cat states (quantum superpositions of different coherent states of light) in a harmonic oscillator12. We demonstrate the projective nature of this measurement onto a region of state space with well-defined parity by observing the collapse of a coherent state onto even or odd cat states. The measurement is fast compared with the cavity lifetime, has a high single-shot fidelity and has a 99.8 per cent probability per single measurement of leaving the parity unchanged. In combination with the deterministic encoding of quantum information in cat states realized earlier13,14, the quantum non-demolition parity tracking that we demonstrate represents an important step towards implementing an active system that extends the lifetime of a quantum bit."

Here we report equivalent imbalances at the mRNA and protein levels and increased total tau levels in the brains of subjects with Huntington's disease (HD) together with rod-like tau deposits along neuronal nuclei. These tau nuclear rods show an ordered filamentous ultrastructure and can be found filling the neuronal nuclear indentations previously reported in HD brains.

https://openalex.org/W1986535251,"Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative damage and neuronal cell death, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease. The present study aimed to examine the mechanism by which the anti-aging protein Klotho exerts neuroprotective effects against neuronal damage associated with neurodegeneration and oxidative stress. Pretreatment of rat primary hippocampal neurons and mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 with recombinant Klotho protected these cells from glutamate and oligomeric amyloid β (oAβ)-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, primary hippocampal neurons obtained from Klotho-overexpressing mouse embryos were more resistant to both cytotoxic insults, glutamate and oAβ, compared with neurons from wild-type littermates. An antioxidative stress array analysis of neurons treated with Klotho revealed that Klotho significantly enhances the expression of the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin (Trx/Prx) system with the greatest effect on the induction of Prx-2, an antioxidant enzyme, whose increase was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Klotho-induced phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a pathway important in apoptosis and longevity, was associated with sustained inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcription factor forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) and was essential for the induction of Prx-2. Down-regulation of Prx-2 expression using a lentivirus harboring shRNA almost completely abolished the ability of Klotho to rescue neurons from glutamate-induced death and significantly, but not completely, inhibited cell death mediated by oAβ, suggesting that Prx-2 is a key modulator of neuroprotection. Thus, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the neuroprotective role of Klotho and reveal a novel mechanism underlying this effect."

Comprehensive analysis of the entire set of 25,005 interface loops revealed common structural motifs and unique features that distinguish loop-mediated PPIs from other PPIs.

https://openalex.org/W2043085906,"Mesoderm is induced at the primitive streak (PS) and patterns subsequently into mesodermal subtypes and organ precursors. It is unclear whether mesoderm induction generates a multipotent PS progenitor or several distinct ones with restricted subtype potentials. We induced mesoderm in human pluripotent stem cells with ACTIVIN and BMP or with GSK3-β inhibition. Both approaches induced BRACHYURY+ mesoderm of distinct PS-like identities, which had differing patterning potential. ACTIVIN and BMP-induced mesoderm patterned into cardiac but not somitic subtypes. Conversely, PS precursors induced by GSK3-β inhibition did not generate lateral plate and cardiac mesoderm and favored instead somitic differentiation. The mechanism of these cell fate decisions involved mutual repression of NANOG and CDX2. Although NANOG was required for cardiac specification but blocked somitic subtypes, CDX2 was required for somitic mesoderm but blocked cardiac differentiation. In sum, rather than forming a common PS progenitor, separate induction mechanisms distinguish human mesoderm subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W1966742656,"Modulation of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) activity has been touted as a potential means of treating addiction, anxiety, depression, and neurodegeneration. Different agonists of CB1 are known to evoke varied responses in vivo. Functional selectivity is the ligand-specific activation of certain signal transduction pathways at a receptor that can signal through multiple pathways. To understand cannabinoid-specific functional selectivity, different groups have examined the effect of individual cannabinoids on various signaling pathways in heterologous expression systems. In the current study, we compared the functional selectivity of six cannabinoids, including two endocannabinoids (2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA)), two synthetic cannabinoids (WIN55,212-2 and CP55,940), and two phytocannabinoids (cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) on arrestin2-, Gα(i/o)-, Gβγ-, Gα(s)-, and Gα(q)-mediated intracellular signaling in the mouse STHdh(Q7/Q7) cell culture model of striatal medium spiny projection neurons that endogenously express CB1. In this system, 2-AG, THC, and CP55,940 were more potent mediators of arrestin2 recruitment than other cannabinoids tested. 2-AG, AEA, and WIN55,212-2, enhanced Gα(i/o) and Gβγ signaling, with 2-AG and AEA treatment leading to increased total CB1 levels. 2-AG, AEA, THC, and WIN55,212-2 also activated Gα(q)-dependent pathways. CP55,940 and CBD both signaled through Gα(s). CP55,940, but not CBD, activated downstream Gα(s) pathways via CB1 targets. THC and CP55,940 promoted CB1 internalization and decreased CB1 protein levels over an 18-h period. These data demonstrate that individual cannabinoids display functional selectivity at CB1 leading to activation of distinct signaling pathways. To effectively match cannabinoids with therapeutic goals, these compounds must be screened for their signaling bias."

https://openalex.org/W1986206637,"Hundreds of tail-anchored proteins, including soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptors (SNAREs) involved in vesicle fusion, are inserted post-translationally into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by a dedicated protein-targeting pathway. Before insertion, the carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains of tail-anchored proteins are shielded in the cytosol by the conserved targeting factor Get3 (in yeast; TRC40 in mammals). The Get3 endoplasmic-reticulum receptor comprises the cytosolic domains of the Get1/2 (WRB/CAML) transmembrane complex, which interact individually with the targeting factor to drive a conformational change that enables substrate release and, as a consequence, insertion. Because tail-anchored protein insertion is not associated with significant translocation of hydrophilic protein sequences across the membrane, it remains possible that Get1/2 cytosolic domains are sufficient to place Get3 in proximity with the endoplasmic-reticulum lipid bilayer and permit spontaneous insertion to occur. Here we use cell reporters and biochemical reconstitution to define mutations in the Get1/2 transmembrane domain that disrupt tail-anchored protein insertion without interfering with Get1/2 cytosolic domain function. These mutations reveal a novel Get1/2 insertase function, in the absence of which substrates stay bound to Get3 despite their proximity to the lipid bilayer; as a consequence, the notion of spontaneous transmembrane domain insertion is a non sequitur. Instead, the Get1/2 transmembrane domain helps to release substrates from Get3 by capturing their transmembrane domains, and these transmembrane interactions define a bona fide pre-integrated intermediate along a facilitated route for tail-anchor entry into the lipid bilayer. Our work sheds light on the fundamental point of convergence between co-translational and post-translational endoplasmic-reticulum membrane protein targeting and insertion: a mechanism for reducing the ability of a targeting factor to shield its substrates enables substrate handover to a transmembrane-domain-docking site embedded in the endoplasmic-reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2019292783,"Recent work has shown that the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies both possess the unexpected property that their dwarf satellite galaxies are aligned in thin and kinematically coherent planar structures. It is interesting to evaluate the incidence of such planar structures in the larger galactic population, because the Local Group may not be a representative environment. Here we report measurements of the velocities of pairs of diametrically opposed satellite galaxies. In the local Universe (redshift z < 0.05), we find that satellite pairs out to a distance of 150 kiloparsecs from the galactic centre are preferentially anti-correlated in their velocities (99.994 per cent confidence level), and that the distribution of galaxies in the larger-scale environment (out to distances of about 2 megaparsecs) is strongly clumped along the axis joining the inner satellite pair (>7σ confidence). This may indicate that planes of co-rotating satellites, similar to those seen around the Andromeda galaxy, are ubiquitous, and their coherent motion suggests that they represent a substantial repository of angular momentum on scales of about 100 kiloparsecs."
https://openalex.org/W2047531868,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have important functions in plant growth, development, and response to various stresses. The MAPKK and MAPKKK gene families in tomato have never been systematically analyzed. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the MAPKK and MAPKKK gene families in tomato and identified 5 MAPKK genes and 89 MAPKKK genes. Phylogenetic analyses of the MAPKK and MAPKKK gene families showed that all the MAPKK genes formed four groups (groups A, B, C, and D), whereas all the MAPKKK genes were classified into three subfamilies, namely, MEKK, RAF, and ZIK. Evolutionary analysis showed that whole genome or chromosomal segment duplications were the main factors responsible for the expansion of the MAPKK and MAPKKK gene families in tomato. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the majority of MAPKK and MAPKKK genes were expressed in all tested organs with considerable differences in transcript levels indicating that they might be constitutively expressed. However, the expression level of most of these genes changed significantly under heat, cold, drought, salt, and Pseudomonas syringae treatment. Furthermore, their expression levels exhibited significant changes in response to salicylic acid and indole-3-acetic acid treatment, implying that these genes might have important roles in the plant hormone network. Our comparative analysis of the MAPKK and MAPKKK families would improve our understanding of the evolution and functional characterization of MAPK cascades in tomato."
https://openalex.org/W2163911213,"Although antimicrobial histones have been isolated from multiple metazoan species, their role in host defense has long remained unanswered. We found here that the hemocytes of the oyster Crassostrea gigas release antimicrobial H1-like and H5-like histones in response to tissue damage and infection. These antimicrobial histones were shown to be associated with extracellular DNA networks released by hemocytes, the circulating immune cells of invertebrates, in response to immune challenge. The hemocyte-released DNA was found to surround and entangle vibrios. This defense mechanism is reminiscent of the neutrophil extracellular traps (ETs) recently described in vertebrates. Importantly, oyster ETs were evidenced in vivo in hemocyte-infiltrated interstitial tissues surrounding wounds, whereas they were absent from tissues of unchallenged oysters. Consistently, antimicrobial histones were found to accumulate in oyster tissues following injury or infection with vibrios. Finally, oyster ET formation was highly dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species by hemocytes. This shows that ET formation relies on common cellular and molecular mechanisms from vertebrates to invertebrates. Altogether, our data reveal that ET formation is a defense mechanism triggered by infection and tissue damage, which is shared by relatively distant species suggesting either evolutionary conservation or convergent evolution within Bilateria.

https://openalex.org/W2092683975,"Despite progress in identifying the cellular composition of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) niches, little is known about the molecular requirements of HSPC support. To address this issue, we used a panel of six recognized HSPC-supportive stromal lines and less-supportive counterparts originating from embryonic and adult hematopoietic sites. Through comprehensive transcriptomic meta-analyses, we identified 481 mRNAs and 17 microRNAs organized in a modular network implicated in paracrine signaling. Further inclusion of 18 additional cell strains demonstrated that this mRNA subset was predictive of HSPC support. Our gene set contains most known HSPC regulators as well as a number of unexpected ones, such as Pax9 and Ccdc80, as validated by functional studies in zebrafish embryos. In sum, our approach has identified the core molecular network required for HSPC support. These cues, along with a searchable web resource, will inform ongoing efforts to instruct HSPC ex vivo amplification and formation from pluripotent precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1973297092,"Mutations that deregulate Notch1 and Ras/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling are prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and often coexist. Here we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is active against primary T-ALLs from wild-type and KrasG12D mice, and addition of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 increases its efficacy. Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to γ-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling. These studies validate PI3K as a therapeutic target in T-ALL and raise the unexpected possibility that dual inhibition of PI3K and Notch1 signalling could promote drug resistance in T-ALL. Mutations that dysregulate Notch1 and Ras/PI3K signalling are common in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; here, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor is shown to induce drug resistance that is associated with downregulation of activated Notch1 signalling, suggesting that inhibition of both Notch1 and PI3K could promote drug resistance. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is closely associated with mutations that deregulate Notch1 and Ras/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signalling. Kevin Shannon and colleagues show that treatment with GDC-0941 (pictilisib), a PI3K inhibitor that is advancing in clinical development, induces resistance associated with downregulation of activated Notch signalling, cross-resistance to γ-secretase inhibitors and upregulated PI3K signalling. Inhibition of Notch1 activates the PI3K pathway, suggesting that the rational strategy of concurrently targeting activated Notch1 and PI3K in T-ALL is likely to accelerate drug resistance."

Amyloid plaque presents a core composed of misfolded amyloid β (Aβ) peptides of 37–43 amino acid lengths in the form of oligomers and amyloid fibrils. One of the pathogenic hypotheses to explain AD considers these aggregated Aβ species, particularly the soluble oligomers of Aβ but not monomers or insoluble amyloid fibrils (3.Lambert M.P.

In fact there are several pieces of evidence that correlate Aβ peptide with the pathological mechanism of AD, suggesting that Aβ occupies a crucial position in the etiopathology. The most abundant peptides are Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, the first being the prevalent fragment and the second the most amyloidogenic (8.Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A.

Recently Scheidt et al. (26.Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Dynamics of amyloid β fibrils revealed by solid-state NMR.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2017-2021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the three-four amino acid residues at the N terminus of the Aβ region also play an important role in the formation of a stable β-sheet secondary structure in the Aβ peptide. Familial AD forms are linked to mutations in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, or in amyloid precursor protein genes and usually show an autosomal pattern of inheritance with total penetrance (27.Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer's disease: genes, proteins, and therapy.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar). In 2009 we described a new amyloid precursor protein mutation (A673V) that causes early onset AD when in homozygosity. The missense mutation consists of a C-to-T transition resulting in an alanine-to-valine substitution at position 673 of amyloid precursor protein that corresponds to position 2 of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides (Aβ A2V peptides). Notably, heterozygous individuals do not develop AD even in advanced age. In fact, five A673V heterozygous performed well on the neuropsychological assessments, and in particular, the 88-year-old aunt of the proband showed excellent performance on all the tests despite the fact that she was non-educated. The amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the cardinal features of AD, were thought to underlie this chronic neurological disorder. Even today, after several years of research on AD, the Aβ peptides play a central role in the onset, development, and exacerbation of the AD in all of its forms of aggregation. However, the emerging soluble Aβ oligomers are now widely recognized as key pathogenic structures in AD (28.Tai L.M. Bilousova T. Jungbauer L. Roeske S.K. Youmans K.L. Yu C. Poon W.W. Cornwell L.B.

In fact, in light of recent findings and the realization that the amyloid cascade theory is insufficient to explain Alzheimer pathology, the amyloid hypothesis has been updated, as fibrils were considered the first and only species leading to AD pathogenesis (30.Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Alzheimer's disease: the amyloid cascade hypothesis.Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Recently, Aβ oligomers were identified as the main cause of synaptic dysfunction leading to alterations in both neuronal activity and cognitive function (31.Ferreira S.T. Klein W.L. The Aβ oligomer hypothesis for synapse failure and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2011; 96: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this study we generated Aβ1–42 oligomers from peptides spanning the wild type or the A2V sequences. Oligomers were produced from solutions of pure Aβ1–42WT, Aβ1–42A2V, and the equimolar solution of both (Aβ1–42MIX). This enabled us to investigate the structure and the formation of toxic oligomeric species. Moreover, we conducted a comparative chemico-physical study on Aβ1–42WT, Aβ1–42A2V, and Aβ1–42MIX molecular assembly to describe features of different oligomeric populations produced in the early phase of the oligomerization process. This revealed the influence of the A2V mutation in Aβ1–42 folding and produces evidence for the toxicity of Aβ1–42 and the protective effect displayed by the Aβ1–42MIX. Finally, the position of the A2V mutation in the N terminus of Aβ peptides definitely strengthens the relevance of this region for peptide structure and spatial shape re-arrangement. Aβ1–42 peptides were synthesized using depsipeptide method as previously described (32.Beeg M. Stravalaci M. Bastone A. Salmona M. Gobbi M.

Aβ1–42WT and Aβ1–42A2V were stored in acidic solution (water:trifluoroacetic acid, 0.02%) at a concentration of ∼200 μm. The depsipeptide method is a specific technique of synthesis used for amyloidogenic difficult sequences, and it allow us to obtain a batch with a low degree/level of aggregation free of either highly folded structures or fibrils and aggregates (seeds free) and as close as possible to monomeric conditions. In the case of Aβ1–42, the method consists of introducing an O-acyl isopeptide structure into the Gly-25–Ser-26 sequence, stable at acidic pH and able to inhibit the self-aggregation. Upon a change to basic pH (switching procedure), the peptide is converted to the Aβ1–42 native sequence. Before the switching procedure to minimize the pre-aggregated species and to obtain the best reproducibility, peptides were dissolved in acidic solution (water, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid) and clarified overnight (16–18 h) at 55,000 rpm to obtain seeds-free samples, filtered on a Microcon (centrifugal filter devices, cutoff 10 kDa, Millipore), and finally, concentrated on a Microcon (centrifugal filter devices, c.o. 3 kDa, Millipore) up to a concentration of ≥200 μm. The switching procedure of depsipeptide Aβ was carried out at basic pH; a mix of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) (ratio 3:1) was added to the peptide solutions (final pH of ∼10) and incubated on ice for 10–15 min. The preparation of MIX was done by adding an equimolar solution of both peptides before the switching procedure to obtain a Aβ1–42 peptide mixture with a concentration of ∼200 μm constituted by ½ Aβ1–42WT and ½ Aβ1–42A2V. Oligomers were prepared using the following procedure; after the switching procedure, Aβ1–42 solutions were brought to a final concentration of 100 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated for 24 h at 4 or 22 °C to obtain oligomer-rich preparations (36.Balducci C.

EM was used to investigate the structure of the peptide aggregates. 10 μl of Aβ1–42 oligomer preparations (Aβ1–42WT, Aβ1–42A2V, and Aβ1–42MIX) were dropped onto 300-mesh Formvar/carbon nickel grids (Electron Microscopy Science), and after 5 min the solution was removed. Samples were counterstained for 5 min with saturated solution of uranyl acetate, washed with MilliQ water to eliminate excess uranyl acetate, and allowed to air dry (38.Manzoni C. Colombo L.

EM analyses were performed with a Libra 120 apparatus operating at 120 kV equipped with a Proscan Slow Scan CCD camera (Carl Zeiss). AFM was carried out on a Multimode AFM with a Nanoscope V system operating in tapping mode using standard phosphorus-doped silicon probes (thickness range, 3.5–4.5 μm; length, 115–135 μm; width, 30–40 μm; spring constant, 20–80 newtons/m, Veeco/Digital Instruments) with a scan rate in the 0.5–1.2 Hz range, proportional to the area scanned. Freshly cleaved muscovite mica discs (Veeco/Digital Instruments) were used for deposition of peptide samples. Aβ1–42 oligomeric solutions were added to freshly cleaved mica at room temperature for 1 min and, then the samples were washed and dried under gentle nitrogen flow. AFM images of Aβ1–42 samples were analyzed for diameter and height with the Scanning Probe Image Processor (SPIP Version 5.1.6 (released April 13, 2011) data analysis package to describe oligomer structures. To exclude the interference of possible artifacts, extra control samples, such as freshly cleaved mica and freshly cleaved mica soaked with ultra-pure water, were also used. All the topographic patterns and SPIP characterization described in the text were confirmed by additional measurements in a minimum of 10 different, well separated areas. Aβ1–42WT, Aβ1–42A2V, and Aβ1–42MIX solutions were analyzed at final concentrations of 100 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 22 °C by parallel and independent static and dynamic laser light scattering (SLS and DLS). The homemade LLS apparatus is described elsewhere (40.Lago P. Rovati L. Cantù L. Corti M. A quasielastic light scattering detector for chromatographic analysis.Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1797-1802Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The average scattered intensity (SLS) readily reveals the emergence and growth of aggregates in solution, starting from monomers, as it is proportional to the square of the molecular mass of the scattering particles. The correlation function of the scattered intensity (measured by DLS) yielded the translational diffusion coefficients of particles in solution and then their average hydrodynamic diameter via the Stokes-Einstein relation. DLS data analysis was carried out using the method of cumulants, suitable to detect the evolution of the weight-average hydrodynamic size of particles in solution, and the non-negative least squares method (41.Lawson C.L. Hanson R.J. Solving Least Squares Problems. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, PA1995Crossref Google Scholar), to determine their size distribution at different incubation times. To obtain information on size, homogeneity, and shape of the Aβ peptide oligomers in solution on a local scale, we employed SAXS. Measurements were performed at the high brilliance ID02 beamline of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) with a beam cross-section of 0.3 × 0.8 mm and wavelength of 0.1 nm in the region of momentum transfer, q = (2π/λ)·sin(θ/2), 0.017 nm−1≤ q ≤ 4.65 nm−1, where θ is the scattering angle. Plastic capillaries (KI-beam, ENKI) were mounted horizontally onto a six-place sample holder allowing for nearly simultaneous measurements on sample and reference cells in the same environmental conditions. Samples were prepared as described for LLS analysis, and all measurements were performed at 22 °C. The exposure time of each measurement was very short, 0.1 s, to minimize any possible radiation damage. Several frames were collected on each sample, with 1-s sleeping times, carefully compared, and mediated if superimposable within experimental error. The measured SAXS profiles report the scattered radiation intensity as a function of the momentum transfer, q. Several spectra relative to the empty cells and the solvent were taken, carefully compared, and subtracted from each sample spectrum. To investigate a wide q-region, spectra relative to different q-ranges were compared and joined. Fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out using two specific probes, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene-sulfonate (ANS) and 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (Bis-ANS) (Sigma), to detect hydrophobicity in oligomer preparation at neutral pH, to probe high hydrophobic sites, and to monitor conformational changes. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on an LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a quartz cuvette with a 1-cm light path. Thirty μl of each oligomeric solution was added to 300 μl of 30 mm citrate buffer, pH 2.4, containing 25 μm ANS or Bis-ANS, and the fluorescence intensity was immediately recorded in the range of 400–600-nm emission wavelengths and with an excitation wavelength of 386 nm (42.LeVine 3rd, H. 4,4′-Dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonate: report on non-β-sheet conformers of Alzheimer's peptide β(1–40).Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The analysis was performed on three/four replicates for each sample. Fluorescence was also acquired in the absence of Aβ1–42 oligomers. Aβ1–42 oligomers were analyzed immediately after their dilution to the final concentration of 25 μm in μm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to avoid signal saturation in the spectra. The CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) at 4 °C from 190 to 260 nm (1.0-nm bandwidth and 0.1-nm resolution) using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. Generally, a sensitivity of 100 millidegrees, a response of 4 s, a scan speed of 50 nm/min, and 5 accumulations were used. Spectrum of appropriate buffer was subtracted from the Aβ1–42 spectra, and CD spectra were expressed as mean molar ellipticity (Φ). Means with standard error or standard deviation and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's analysis were performed using Prism GraphPad software, Version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The temporal window for the formation of oligomers during the aggregation process was analyzed. Comparative EM analyses between Aβ1–42WT and Aβ1–42A2V revealed the prevalence of two different structures. Aβ1–42WT showed a predominant presence of globulomers with a size in the range of 15–40 nm and few annular structures with a size of about 60 nm (Fig. 1, A and D), whereas Aβ1–42A2V was highly enriched with annular structures in the range of 7–70 nm (Fig. 1B and E), suggesting that the presence of the A2V mutation promoted a distinctive oligomerization pathway. As shown at higher magnification (Fig. 1E), Aβ1–42A2V annular aggregates had an electron-dense core that may suggest the formation of a pore where uranyl acetate solution was accumulated. The annular structures formed by Aβ1–42A2V continued the oligomerization process, as shown by the neoformed extension (see the inset of Fig. 1E). The co-incubation of Aβ1–42WT and Aβ1–42A2V was characterized by a morphology highly resembling the Aβ1–42WT peptide alone, with the presence of many globulomers and annular structures with smaller dimensions in the range of 9–25 nm (Fig. 1, C and F). Peptides were analyzed immediately after the switching procedure and after incubation for 24 h at 4 °C. Freshly prepared solutions contained only monomeric assemblies, whereas samples that underwent incubation disclosed the presence of small oligomers of different sizes (data not shown). SPIP software was used to analyze the distribution of oligomer population in terms of diameters (Fig. 2A) and heights (Fig. 2, B–D). This software enables the elaboration of AFM images, and it specifically takes into account the features of the tips and the tapping mode. Therefore, it is able to obtain very accurate data on the height and diameter of the molecular assemblies formed by Aβ peptides (43.Munz M.

Aβ1–42WT produced a family of oligomers with a range of highly defined dimension, the majority (65%) being between 5 and 20 nm in diameter, and no oligomeric aggregates larger than 60 nm were detected.

Previously, we and other groups reported that the α5 helix in the G protein α subunit plays a major role during this activation process. However, the precise signaling pathway between the α5 helix and the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding pocket remains elusive. Here, using structural, biochemical, and computational techniques, we probed different residues around the α5 helix for their role in signaling. Our data showed that perturbing the Phe-336 residue disturbs hydrophobic interactions with the β2-β3 strands and α1 helix, leading to high basal nucleotide exchange. However, mutations in β strands β5 and β6 do not perturb G protein activation. We have highlighted critical residues that leverage Phe-336 as a relay. Conformational changes are transmitted starting from Phe-336 via β2-β3/α1 to Switch I and the phosphate binding loop, decreasing the stability of the GDP binding pocket and triggering nucleotide release. When the α1 and α5 helices were cross-linked, inhibiting the receptor-mediated displacement of the C-terminal α5 helix, mutation of Phe-336 still leads to high basal exchange rates. This suggests that unlike receptor-mediated activation, helix 5 rotation and translocation are not necessary for GDP release from the α subunit.

https://openalex.org/W2092510449,"Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. Its activity is regulated by thioredoxin (TRX1) but the precise mechanism of this regulation is unclear due to the lack of structural data. Here, we performed biophysical and structural characterization of the TRX1-binding domain of ASK1 (ASK1-TBD) and its complex with reduced TRX1. ASK1-TBD is a monomeric and rigid domain that forms a stable complex with reduced TRX1 with 1:1 molar stoichiometry. The binding interaction does not involve the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Residues from the catalytic WCGPC motif of TRX1 are essential for complex stability with Trp(31) being directly involved in the binding interaction as suggested by time-resolved fluorescence. Small-angle x-ray scattering data reveal a compact and slightly asymmetric shape of ASK1-TBD and suggest reduced TRX1 interacts with this domain through the large binding interface without inducing any dramatic conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W2010574821,"In Parkinson's disease (PD), several studies have detected an impaired serotonin (5-HT) pathway, likely affecting both motor and non-motor domains. However, the precise impact of 5-HT impairment is far from established. Here, we have used a HPLC chromatographic method, in a homogenous cohort (n = 35) of non fluctuating, non dyskinetic PD patients, to assess the concentration of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA in peripheral cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from lumbar puncture (LP). LP was performed following three days of therapy withdrawal, in order to vanish the effects of prolonged released dopamine agonists (DA), and in absence of any serotonergic agent. The PD patient group showed a significantly reduced CSF level of both 5-HT and 5-HIAA compared to either age-matched control subjects (n = 18), or Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 20). However, no correlation emerged between 5-HT/5-HIAA concentrations and UPDRS-III (r = -0.12), disease duration (r = -0.1), age (r = -0.27) and MMSE (r = 0.11). Intriguingly, low CSF 5-HT levels did not differ for gender or for motor phenotype (in terms of non-tremor dominant subtype and tremor dominant subtype). Further, low CSF 5-HT levels did not correlate with the presence of depression, apathy or sleep disturbance. Our findings support the contention that 5-HT impairment is a cardinal feature of stable PD, probably representing a hallmark of diffuse Lewy bodies deposition in the brainstem. However, clinical relevance remains uncertain. Given these findings, an add-on therapy with serotonergic agents seems questionable in PD patients, or should be individually tailored, unless severe depression is present."

In the present study, we have biochemically characterized SerB2 enzyme and developed malachite green-based high throughput assay system to identify SerB2 inhibitors. We have identified 10 compounds that were structurally different from known PSP inhibitors, and few of these scaffolds were highly specific in their ability to inhibit SerB2 enzyme, were noncytotoxic against mammalian cell lines, and inhibited M. tuberculosis growth in vitro. Surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated the relative binding for these inhibitors. The two best hits identified in our screen, clorobiocin and rosaniline, were bactericidal in activity and killed intracellular bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. We have also identified amino acid residues critical for these SerB2-small molecule interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2066549850,"In diabetics, methylglyoxal (MG), a glucose-derived metabolite, plays a noxious role by inducing oxidative stress, which causes and exacerbates a series of complications including low-turnover osteoporosis. In the present study, while MG treatment of mouse bone marrow stroma-derived ST2 cells rapidly suppressed the expression of osteotrophic Wnt-targeted genes, including that of osteoprotegerin (OPG, a decoy receptor of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL)), it significantly enhanced that of secreted Frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP-4, a soluble inhibitor of Wnts). On the assumption that upregulated sFRP-4 is a trigger that downregulates Wnt-related genes, we sought out the molecular mechanism whereby oxidative stress enhanced the sFRP-4 gene. Sodium bisulfite sequencing revealed that the sFRP-4 gene was highly methylated around the sFRP-4 gene basic promoter region, but was not altered by MG treatment. Electrophoretic gel motility shift assay showed that two continuous CpG loci located five bases upstream of the TATA-box were, when methylated, a target of methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) that was sequestered upon induction of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a biomarker of oxidative damage to DNA. These in vitro data suggest that MG-derived oxidative stress (not CpG demethylation) epigenetically and rapidly derepress sFRP-4 gene expression. We speculate that under persistent oxidative stress, as in diabetes and during aging, osteopenia and ultimately low-turnover osteoporosis become evident partly due to osteoblastic inactivation by suppressed Wnt signaling of mainly canonical pathways through the derepression of sFRP-4 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1974296775,"DNR (dissimilative nitrate respiration regulator) is a heme-binding transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of denitrification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the ferrous deoxy state, the heme is 6-coordinate; external NO and CO can replace an internal ligand. Using fluorescence anisotropy, we show that high-affinity sequence-specific DNA binding occurs only when the heme is nitrosylated, consistent with the proposed function of DNR as NO sensor and transcriptional activator. This role is moreover supported by the NO “trapping” properties revealed by ultrafast spectroscopy that are similar to those of other heme-based NO sensor proteins. Dissociated CO-heme pairs rebind in an essentially barrierless way. This process competes with migration out of the heme pocket. The latter process is thermally activated (Ea ∼7 kJ/mol). This result is compared with other heme proteins, including the homologous CO sensor/transcription factor CooA, variants of the 5-coordinate mycobacterial sensor DosT and the electron transfer protein cytochrome c.

The origin of this finding and possible implications are discussed. Bacterial heme-based gas sensor proteins allow for adaptation to different environmental stimuli, which is crucial for survival of the organisms (1.Germani F. Moens L. Dewilde S. Haem-based sensors: a still growing old superfamily.in: Poole R.K. Advances in Microbial Physiology. Academic Press, Waltham, Massachusetts2013: 1-47Google Scholar, 2.Aono S.

Chem. 2013; 288: 13194-13203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Diatomic gas signaling molecules such as O2, CO, or NO are selectively sensed by a heme prosthetic group, and signaling is initiated by structural perturbation following formation or dissociation of the heme-ligand bond. Subsequently, intramolecular signal transmission events and long range structural changes take place to regulate physiological functions, including phosphorylation or DNA binding. Sensor proteins can contain heme in different coordination states when unliganded: in 5-coordinate heme-based sensors, an external effector molecule typically binds at the vacant distal position, whereas in 6-coordinate systems, an internal amino acid residue gets displaced in competition with an external gas molecule. These different sensing modes regulate ligand specificity and eventually determine downstream signaling events. A recently identified addition to the group of 6-coordinate heme gas sensor proteins is DNR (“dissimilative nitrate respiration regulator”). DNR is a member of the cAMP receptor protein/fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator family of transcriptional regulators and mediates NO-dependent induction of denitrification in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.Arai H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T.

Homodimeric DNR has been purified in its apo-form without a heme cofactor but is able to stoichiometrically bind hemin in vitro with high affinity (5.Castiglione N. Rinaldo S. Giardina G.

The protein is structurally similar to the bacterial heme-based CO sensor protein CooA of the cAMP receptor protein/fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator family (7.Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J.

For CooA, large conformational changes, including domain rearrangements, have been predicted between the inactive and the active, DNA-binding state (8.Roberts G.P. Kerby R.L. Youn H. Conrad M.

Acta. 2013; 1834: 1684-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An a priori unexpected feature of the DNR structure is the position of the sensing domain, which is rotated by ∼60° with regard to the inactive structure of CooA (11.Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Castiglione N. Caruso M. Cutruzzolà F. A dramatic conformational rearrangement is necessary for the activation of DNR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Crystal structure of wild-type DNR.Proteins. 2009; 77: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that DNR equally undergoes large conformational changes for DNA binding, although in a different manner from CooA (11.Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Castiglione N. Caruso M. Cutruzzolà F. A dramatic conformational rearrangement is necessary for the activation of DNR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Crystal structure of wild-type DNR.Proteins. 2009; 77: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). How precisely heme controls the NO-dependent response of DNR is not known. However, it is noteworthy that, whereas the ferrous deoxy complex is 6-coordinate, the ferrous heme-NO complex appears 5-coordinate (6.Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Johnson K.A. Di Matteo A. Brunori M. Cutruzzolà F. NO sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: structure of the transcriptional regulator DNR.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 1002-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a ligation form that is also observed in other heme-based NO sensing proteins, in particular in soluble guanylate cyclase (12.Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Soluble guanylate cyclase from bovine lung: activation with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide and spectral characterization of the ferrous and ferric states.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Qualitatively, it has been demonstrated that the DNR-NO complex binds to a promoter sequence associated with a denitrification enzyme (6.Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Johnson K.A. Di Matteo A. Brunori M.

One of the aims of the present study is to quantitatively investigate the DNA binding affinity of DNR using fluorescence anisotropy measurements and its dependence on the heme ligation state. Physiological ligand-sensitive DNA binding in the nanomolar affinity range was deduced. The primary processes in heme-based sensor switching mechanisms concern ligand binding to and ligand dissociation from heme (10.Liebl U. Lambry J.C. Vos M.H. Primary processes in heme-based sensor proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1834: 1684-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Photodissociation of the heme-ligand bond and subsequent monitoring of the spectroscopic changes occurring upon heme ligation provide an exquisitely sensitive probe of the heme-iron environment and allow characterizing the intraprotein migration of these diatomic gaseous molecules. Analysis of the dynamics of ligand binding and escape provides information about the mechanistic implication of these diatomic gases in early signaling events and insight into how the pathway of the dissociated ligand is controlled by the protein environment. Consequently, characterization of these primary processes, which typically occur on the picosecond time scale, is essential for a complete understanding of the switching mechanism in these sensors. Here, we investigated the recombination kinetics of CO and NO to the heme in DNR using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. We observe that CO recombination in DNR is multiexponential and occurs roughly on the same time scale as in CooA, but with markedly less efficiency. Near complete and very fast NO recombination, as in other NO-sensing proteins, provides further support for a role of DNR as physiological NO sensor. In general, in heme proteins, after dissociation of the heme-ligand bond, the yield of escape is considerably higher for CO than for NO or O2 (13.Vos M.H. Ultrafast dynamics of ligands within heme proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies of the heme-based, 6-coordinate sensor protein Dos from Escherichia coli (E. coli Dos) showed that ∼60% of dissociated CO rebinds to the heme on a nanosecond time scale (14.Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Lambry J.C. Négrerie M. Vos M.H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 2344-2352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The observation that rebinding and escape occur with similar rates made this sensor a suitable model for studying the activation barriers involved in these processes and revealed that CO rebinding is essentially barrierless, whereas CO escape is thermally activated (15.Yamashita T. Bouzhir-Sima L. Lambry J.C. Liebl U. Vos M.H. Ligand dynamics and early signalling events in the heme domain of the sensor protein Dos from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2344-2352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As in E. coli Dos the external gaseous ligand replaces an internal heme ligand, the question arises whether the escape enthalpic barrier experienced is related to this ligand competition. To investigate this question, we studied intraprotein CO migration and binding barriers in the physiological temperature range in DNR and CooA, with both being systems where the external gaseous ligand replaces an internal amino acid ligand. Comparison with a variant of the mycobacterial 5-coordinate heme sensor DosT, where no ligand is bound in the heme pocket in the absence of external ligands (16.Sousa E.H. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. DosT and DevS are oxygen-switched kinases in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1708-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and a ligand-binding variant of the electron transfer protein cytochrome c (17.Silkstone G. Jasaitis A. Vos M.H. Wilson M.T. Geminate carbon monoxide rebinding to a c-type haem.Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3489-3494Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which has no sensing role, indicates that CO rebinding from the heme pocket is a near-barrierless process and shines light on the factors determining the enthalpy barrier for ligand escape from the heme pocket. The dnr gene (4.Arai H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Expression of the nir and nor genes for denitrification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires a novel CRP/FNR-related transcriptional regulator, DNR, in addition to ANR.FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) from P. aeruginosa (684 bp) was subcloned into a pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen) using NdeI and BamH I restriction sites in frame with an N-terminal His6 sequence. The construct was confirmed by sequencing and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Transformants were grown in Luria Bertani medium containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For protein extraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 5 µg/ml DNase, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) followed by sonication. The His6-tagged polypeptide was purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography columns (Protino Ni-TED, Macherey-Nagel) and eluted in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, followed by imidazole elimination on a Sephadex G-25 gel column (Sigma-Aldrich). For heme reconstitution, 100 µm purified DNR apoprotein (in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) and 400 µm ferric hemin (in 10 mm NaOH) were incubated 2 h at room temperature. Excess of hemin was subsequently removed on an Econo-Pac 10 DG gravity flow column (Bio-Rad). CooA from Rhodospirillum rubrum was expressed and purified as described (18.Yamashita T. Hoashi Y. Watanabe K. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Uno T. Roles of heme axial ligands in the regulation of CO binding to CooA.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21394-21400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and suspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The wild type and Y169F mutant heme domains of DosT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were prepared as described (19.Vos M.H. Bouzhir-Sima L. Lambry J.C. Luo H. Eaton-Rye J.J. Ioanoviciu A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Liebl U. Ultrafast ligand dynamics in the heme-based GAF sensor domains of the histidine kinases DosS and DosT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl. Horse heart cytochrome c was purchased from Sigma. Carboxymethylated cytochrome c was formed by the addition of neutralized bromoacetic acid to the CN complex of native ferricytochrome c at pH 7. In this way, the intrinsic heme ligand, Met-80, is displaced from coordination and becomes available for reaction. Short incubation, 1 h at 25 °C, leads to minimal chemical modification (17.Silkstone G. Jasaitis A. Vos M.H. Wilson M.T. Geminate carbon monoxide rebinding to a c-type haem.Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3489-3494Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), limited to Met-80 and one other residue, probably Met-65. Cyanide was removed by dialysis. In the ferrous form, the protein undergoes a pH transition, pK 7.2, from a penta-coordinate form at low pH to a hexa-coordinate form at high pH 9, in which a lysine amino group coordinates to the heme iron. Both forms bind CO with high affinity, K = 1.3 109 m−1 at pH 5.9 and K = 8 107 m−1 at pH 9.2. The spectral properties of the CO adduct are pH independent in this range. The ligand-binding properties of the modified protein have been described previously by Wilson et al. (20.Wilson M.T. Brunori M. Rotilio G.C. Antonini E. Properties of modified cytochromes. II: Ligand binding to reduced carboxymethyl cytochrome c.J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8162-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final carboxymethylated cytochrome c complex was suspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. Fluorescence anisotropy-based DNA-binding assays with DNR were performed using 6.4 nm DNA. Purified DNR was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 100 mm NaCl at a heme concentration of 5 µm in a gastight 1 × 1 cm optical path length cell, degassed, and reduced with 0.5 mm dithionite to obtain ferrous deoxy-DNR. To obtain the nitrosyl and carbonmonoxy adducts, the deoxy form was equilibrated with 1–10% NO (formation of the 5-coordinate ferrous DNR-NO complex could be verified spectroscopically; ferric DNR can also bind NO (6.Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Johnson K.A. Di Matteo A. Brunori M. Cutruzzolà F. NO sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: structure of the transcriptional regulator DNR.J. Mol.

A 26-mer of double stranded DNA, corresponding to a fragment of the P. aeruginosa nor promoter (5.Castiglione N. Rinaldo S. Giardina G. Cutruzzolà F.

The 5′-extremity of the forward oligonucleotide was labeled with Texas Red. The oligonucleotides were heated 3 min at 80 °C followed by slow cooling down to room temperature to allow complete annealing. The DNA concentration in the assays was 6.4 nm. DNA was degassed in a gastight vial and, for the experiments with liganded DNR, equilibrated with a 10% NO or 100% CO atmosphere. Reduced DNR-NO or DNR-CO complex was added stepwise using a gastight Hamilton syringe up to concentrations of 300 nm. This procedure avoids loss of ligand from the DNR hemes upon addition. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured following a procedure as described (21.Creze C. Ligabue A. Laurent S. Lestini R. Laptenok S.P. Khun J. Vos M.H. Czjzek M. Myllykallio H. Flament D.

Anisotropy data were fitted to a hyperbolic binding curve (Langmuir equation) to determine the binding constant (Kd). For comparison, binding assays for CooA were performed similar as described in Ref. 22.Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Characterization of variants altered at the N-terminal proline, a novel heme-axial ligand in CooA, the CO-sensing transcriptional activator.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, using two strands of complementary 26-mer oligonucleotides containing PcooF (5′-ATAACTGTCATCTGGCCGACAGACGG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCTGTCGGCCAGATGACAGTTAT-3′) (Eurogentec), with the 5′-extremity of the forward oligonucleotide labeled with Atto-390, and as a control, using the above-described nor promoter fragment, similarly Atto-390 labeled. In these experiments, the excitation beam was centered at 390 nm, and the Atto-390 emission spectrum was scanned. For ultrafast spectroscopy experiments, the samples were prepared as described for the DNA binding assays, but at a heme concentration of ∼40 µm, in 1-mm optical path length gastight cells. Experiments on the DNR-NO complex were performed in the absence or presence of unlabeled nor promoter at a stoichiometric amount (one double-stranded DNA per dimeric DNR complex). Most multicolor femtosecond absorption experiments were performed as described (23.Silkstone G. Jasaitis A. Wilson M.T. Vos M.H. Ligand dynamics in an electron-transfer protein: picosecond geminate recombination of carbon monoxide to heme in mutant forms of cytochrome c.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1638-1649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with a ∼30-fs pump pulse centered at 565 nm and a <30-fs white light continuum probe pulse, at a repetition rate of 30 Hz. Full spectra of the test and reference beams were recorded using a combination of a polychromator and a CCD camera. The sample was maintained in a thermostatted sample holder that was continuously moved perpendicular to the beams to ensure sample renewal between shots. At temperatures below 10 °C, nitrogen gas was blown over the cell surfaces to avoid condensation. Multicolor femtosecond absorption experiments on the DNR-NO complex were performed on a 500 kHz repetition rate setup as described (24.Lukacs A. Eker A.P. Byrdin M. Villette S. Pan J. Brettel K. Vos M.H. Role of the middle residue in the triple tryptophan electron transfer chain of DNA photolyase: ultrafast spectroscopy of a Trp→Phe mutant.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 15654-15658Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) based on a Quantronix Integra-C Ti-Saph oscillator/amplifier system, with a pump pulse centered at 570 nm. In this system, both test and reference probe beams pass through the sample, which is rastered with a Lissajous scanner. Correlated noise in the data sets was diminished by Singular Value Decomposition filtering. Data were globally analyzed in terms of multiexponential decay using the Glotaran package (25.Snellenburg J.J. Laptenok S.P. Seger R. Mullen K.M. van Stokkum I.H.M. Glotaran: a Java-based graphical user interface for the R package TIMP.J. Stat. Software. 2012; 49: 1-22Crossref Scopus (865) Google Scholar). As NO-dependent activation of DNR is thought to occur through a heme-induced conformational change (11.Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Castiglione N. Caruso M. Cutruzzolà F. A dramatic conformational rearrangement is necessary for the activation of DNR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Crystal structure of wild-type DNR.Proteins. 2009; 77: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), quantitative DNA-binding assays based on fluorescence anisotropy were carried out to determine the affinity of the transcriptional regulator DNR for nor promoter DNA in the active NO-bound form. Absorption spectroscopic analysis showed that NO was saturating under assay conditions. Addition of reduced DNR-NO to the labeled DNA increased the fluorescence anisotropy of the label, because formation of the DNR-DNA complex increases the volume of the labeled complex and hence slows down its rotational movement. From the saturation curve, a binding constant (Kd) of 44 ± 9 nm was determined (Fig. 1A). The reduced unliganded and CO-bound forms of DNR exhibit almost constant anisotropy values and no saturation under the same conditions, consistent with low affinity and nonspecific DNA-binding. We similarly determined the affinity of the CooA-CO complex for CooA-specific DNA at 16 ± 6 nm (Fig. 1B), consistent with the report of Ref. 22.Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Serate J. Roberts G.P. Characterization of variants altered at the N-terminal proline, a novel heme-axial ligand in CooA, the CO-sensing transcriptional activator.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39332-39338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. As a control of specificity, a CooA binding assay was also performed under the same conditions using the nor promoter DNA. This assay did not result in observable specific anisotropy changes (Fig. 1B). Due to the limited stability of the DNR-NO complex, ultrafast transient spectra can be obtained only with relatively poor signal to noise. Nevertheless, it is clear that photodissociation of the heme-NO bond in the 5-coordinate DNR-NO complex leads to formation of a 4-coordinate complex. After subpicosecond dynamics reflecting the heme photophysics, the transient spectrum (Fig. 2A, inset) is a typical 4-coordinate minus 5-coordinate nitrosyl spectrum (26.Négrerie M. Bouzhir L. Martin J.L. Liebl U. Control of nitric oxide dynamics by guanylate cyclase in its activated state.J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 5053-5062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This spectrum subsequently decays in ∼7 ps for >90% (Fig. 2A). These kinetics are similar to those obtained for the internal residue, suggesting that they reflect the intrinsic, barrierless bond formation between NO and heme. Heme-NO recombination generally has a very fast phase of 5–10 ps (13.Vos M.H. Ultrafast dynamics of ligands within heme proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but for most naturally ligand-binding proteins, additional phases and sizeable escape yield have been observed. A notable exception is the mammalian NO receptor GC (26.Négrerie M. Bouzhir L. Martin J.L. Liebl U. Control of nitric oxide dynamics by guanylate cyclase in its activated state.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46815-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in which monophasic near unity QY recombination occurs. In the presence of nor promoter DNA, the spectral evolution is identical within the signal/noise to what has been observed without target DNA (Fig. 2A), although the complex was significantly more stable in this case. This allowed us to determine that the decay phase amounts to >95% under these conditions. DNR has a predominantly 6-coordinate heme iron in the oxidized and reduced form (6.Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Johnson K.A. Di Matteo A. Brunori M. Cutruzzolà F. NO sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: structure of the transcriptional regulator DNR.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 1002-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and binding of a gaseous signaling molecule will occur in competition with an internal amino acid residue ligand. Fig. 2 shows transient spectra at different delay times (B) and kinetics (C) after dissociation of CO from DNR. The transient spectra, with a minimum at 424 nm and a maximum at 442 nm, reflect the formation of a 5-coordinate heme upon CO dissociation. The shape of the transient spectrum remains virtually unchanged on the time scale of a few picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. This indicates that the spectral evolution reflects only CO rebinding to the heme and no formation of a 6-coordinate complex with two intrinsic residues. Upon dissociation, CO is located within the heme pocket, from which it can either rebind to the heme (geminate rebinding) or migrate out of the protein. The decay of the amplitude of the transient spectra implies that CO partially recombines on the picosecond-nanosecond time scale. The kinetics of rebinding are qualitatively similar to those of CooA (29.Benabbas A. Karunakaran V. Youn H. Poulos T.L. Champion P.M. Effect of DNA binding on geminate CO recombination kinetics in CO-sensing transcription factor CooA.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21729-21740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30.Kumazaki S. Nakajima H. Sakaguchi T. Nakagawa E. Shinohara H. Yoshihara K. Aono S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38378-38383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the amplitude of the recombination phase is much lower and as much as ∼35% of the dissociated CO escapes the heme pocket. The rebinding kinetics can be well described by two exponential phases of ∼100 (30%) and ∼900 (35%) ps. These data indicate that in a substantial fraction of the proteins heme-CO recombination occurs on a similar time scale as CO escape from the heme pocket. Therefore, these kinetics are expected to be sensitive to parameters affecting the competition between CO escape and recombination to heme. Fig. 3A shows that in DNR, upon increase of the solvent viscosity by adding glycerol, the escape yield of the dissociated CO strongly"

The reason for the failure of a Th2 cell to reexpress Il4 in a given restimulation could be either a rate-limiting, stochastic availablility of transcription factors controlling Il4 expression in the nucleus, leading to monoallelic expression of the Il4 gene, with some cells not expressing it at all (16.Guo L. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. Probabilistic regulation in TH2 cells accounts for monoallelic expression of IL-4 and IL-13.Immunity. 2005; 23: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alternatively, one transcription factor could control the assembly of the Il4 transcriptional complex in an all-or-none fashion. This has been demonstrated for the control of reexpression of the cytokine IL-2, which is dependent on translocation of NFATc2 into the nucleus (17.Podtschaske M. Benary U. Zwinger S. Höfer T. Radbruch A. Baumgrass R. Digital NFATc2 activation per cell transforms graded T cell receptor activation into an all-or-none IL-2 expression.PLoS One. 2007; 2: e935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This translocation is dependent on complete dephosphorylation of NFATc2 at 13 positions by calcineurin (18.Okamura H. Aramburu J. García-Rodríguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Concerted dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NFAT1 induces a conformational switch that regulates transcriptional activity.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), a reaction of second order, resulting in an all-or-none translocation of NFATc2 into the nucleus in individual Th2 cells. In addition, dephosphorylation at serine residues in the N-terminal transactivation domain is required for transcriptional activation. Here, we show that in restimulated Th2 cells NFATc2 controls the reexpression of Il4 in an all-or-none fashion. NFATc2 translocation into the nucleus is required for assembly of the transcription factor complex at the Il4 promoter, which occurs only in IL-4-expressing Th2 cells, upon restimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR). Modulation of TCR signaling strength by graded inhibition of NFAT results in decreasing frequencies of IL-4-expressing Th2 cells. The amount of IL-4 produced by expressing cells is not affected. Thus, in Th2 cells NFAT serves as a molecular switch that translates graded differences in TCR signal strength into a digital decision to express IL-4 or not. BALB/c, C57BL/6, OVA-TCRtg/tg DO11.10 (kind gift of Dennis Y. Loh and Kenneth Murphy, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO), and OT-II mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in our animal facility. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional, state, and federal guidelines. All antibodies used in these experiments were either conjugated in-house or purchased as indicated. Anti-IL-4 (11B11), anti-IL-12 (C17.18), anti-IFNγ (AN17.18.24), and anti-CD4 (GK1.5) antibodies were purified from hybridoma supernatants at the German Rheumatism Research Center and used at 10 µg/ml final concentration. FITC-conjugated anti-IFNγ (AN18.17.24; BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany), phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IL-4 (11B11; BD Pharmingen, and BVD4–1D11; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were used for intracellular cytokine staining. For the chromatin immunoprecipitation, the following antibodies were used: anti-c-MAF, anti-RNA polymerase II, anti-p300 and anti-STAT6 (polyclonal rabbit IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-NFATc2 and -NFATc1 (polyclonal rabbit IgG; ImmunoGlobe Antikörpertechnik GmbH, Himmelstadt, Germany), anti-GATA-3 (mouse monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-NF-kB (polyclonal goat IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Brg1 (rabbit antiserum; Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). For the image cytometry, anti-NFATc2 (rabbit monoclonal, clone D4B1, Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, The Netherlands) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (coupled to Alexa Fluor 647, Molecular probes A31573, Darmstadt, Germany) were used. CD4+CD62L+ cells from 6–8-week-old DO11.10 or OT-II mice were isolated and differentiated into Th1 and Th2 lineages as described (19.Chang H.D. Helbig C. Tykocinski L. Kreher S. Koeck J. Niesner U. Radbruch A. Expression of IL-10 in Th memory lymphocytes is conditional on IL-12 or IL-4, unless the IL-10 gene is imprinted by GATA-3.Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In short, for Th1 differentiation, cells were stimulated in the presence of recombinant IL-12 (5 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) and anti-IL4 (11B11) antibody for 6 days. For Th2 differentiation, cells were stimulated in the presence of IL-4 (100 ng/ml, culture supernatant of HEK293T cells transfected with murine IL-4 cDNA), anti-IL12 (C17.8), and anti-IFNγ (AN18.17.24) antibodies. Viable IL-4 secreting cells were isolated as described previously (14.Löhning M. Richter A. Stamm T. Hu-Li J. Assenmacher M. Paul W.E. Radbruch A. Establishment of memory for IL-10 expression in developing T helper 2 cells requires repetitive IL-4 costimulation and does not impair proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12307-12312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The secreted IL-4 was detected with an anti-IL4 phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (Miltenyi Biotec). The IL-4 producing cells and the IL-4 non-producing cells were separated by MACS using anti-phycoerythrin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). After sorting, the purity of the sort was confirmed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (19.Chang H.D. Helbig C. Tykocinski L. Kreher S. Koeck J. Niesner U. Radbruch A. Expression of IL-10 in Th memory lymphocytes is conditional on IL-12 or IL-4, unless the IL-10 gene is imprinted by GATA-3.Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: Il4 promoter up, 5′-GGCCCAGAATAACTGACAATCT-3′ and Il4 promoter down, 5′-GCAATGCTGGCAGAGGTC-3′; CIRE up, 5′-CACTTGAGAGAGATCATCGG-3′ and CIRE down, 5′-CCACCTCTCTAGCAACTCAG-3′; Il4 hypersensitivity site (HSS) Va up, 5′-TTGGGTTCTCAGTCCAACAGA-3′ and Il4 HSS Va up, 5′-CCAGGGCACTTAAACATTGC-3′; CNS1 up, 5′-GGGAGTTTCTTAGGCCCTCT-3′ and CNS1 down, 5′-CCCCCTCTCACTGTGAAAAC-3′; LCRRad50 up, 5′-CCACACACTGGGATGTGTAGCTCA-3′ and LCRRad50 down, 5′-AGACCCAGCTCCTCAGAAGGTAGT-3′; and Ifng promoter up, 5′-TTTCAGAGAATCCCACAAGAATG-3′ and Ifng promoter down, 5′-TCGGGATTACGTATTTTCACAAG-3′. For intracellular cytokine staining, the cultured Th cells are harvested and restimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1 µg/ml ionomycin (Sigma) for 2 h followed by additional 2 h in the presence of 5 µg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma Chemicals). The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde (Merck-Millipore). The cell membrane was permeabilized with 0.5% sapinon in PBS/BSA for intracellular staining. The staining was measured with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) or with a MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar). For calcineurin/NFAT inhibition, cyclosporin A, BTP1 (3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole), or 11R-VIVIT (Calbiochem) was given to the cells at the indicated concentrations 15 min prior to addition of PMA and ionomycin. For siRNA-mediated inhibition of NFATc2, Accell siRNA (A-054724-16; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) specific for NFATc2 and control siRNA (D-001910-03-05; Dharmacon) were used as described in Ref. 20.Stittrich A.B.

The microRNA miR-182 is induced by IL-2 and promotes clonal expansion of activated helper T lymphocytes.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar. Knockdown efficiency was determined by RT-PCR using the following primers: NFATc2 up, 5′-GGTTGCTCCTCTGCCCGCAG-3′ and NFATc2 down, 5′-TTGGAGGGGATCCCGCAGGG-3′. Th2 cells were harvested and restimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 3 h in the presence of 7 nm cyclosporin A (CsA). The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Cytokine staining was performed in 0.5% saponin. NFATc2 staining was done in Foxp3 staining buffer (eBioscience). Staining was analyzed using the Imagestream MKII (Amnis Merck-Millipore). For nuclear staining, DAPI was added before analysis. Data analysis was performed using the IDEAS software (Amnis). Nuclear localization of NFATc2 was determined by “similarity” of NFATc2 and DAPI on a per cell basis. The similarity score is a log-transformed Pearson's correlation coefficient of the pixel values of the DAPI and NFATc2 staining. We generated Th2 cells by stimulating naive CD4+CD62L+ T cells from ovalbumin-specific T cell receptor transgenic DO11.10 mice with OVA323–339 for 12 days in the presence of recombinant IL-4 and antibodies blocking IFN-γ and IL-12. On day 6, fresh antigen-presenting cells, antigen, IL-4, and antibodies were added. On day 12, the resting Th2 cells were either fixed directly or restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 3 h and used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to assay for binding of RNA polymerase II and the transcription factors NFATc2, NFATc1, NF-κB p65, c-Maf, p300, Brg1, STAT6, and GATA-3 to the Il4 promoter and the Il4 HSS Va. Binding of GATA-3 to CIRE was also assayed. Binding to the Ifnγ promoter was used as negative control. In resting Th2 cells, in which no IL-4 is detectable by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 1A), none of the transcription factors with the exception of STAT6 bound to any of the regions tested (Fig. 1B). STAT6 bound to both the Il4 promoter and Il4 HSS Va to the same degree in unstimulated and restimulated cells. In restimulated Th2 cells, all transcription factors analyzed bound to the Il4 promoter, except for GATA-3, which does not have a binding site there. NFATc2, NFATc1, p300, Brg1, and GATA-3 also bound to the Il4 HSS Va. GATA-3 also bound to the CIRE. Thus, the assembly of TCR dependent and independent transcription factors at the Il4 gene of Th2 cells is dependent on TCR stimulation, i.e. the activation of one or more TCR-dependent transcription factors. To determine the kinetics of transcription factor assembly to the Il4 locus, we fixed in vitro-generated Th2 cells before restimulation (0 h) and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h following restimulation with PMA/ionomycin. Activated Th2 cells showed detectable levels of IL-4 mRNA already after 1 h and reached a maximum expression at 3 h, after which it declined again (Fig. 2A). IL-4 protein expression follows a similar time course (14.Löhning M. Richter A. Stamm T. Hu-Li J. Assenmacher M. Paul W.E. Radbruch A. Establishment of memory for IL-10 expression in developing T helper 2 cells requires repetitive IL-4 costimulation and does not impair proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12307-12312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Binding of RNA polymerase II to the Il4 promoter reached a maximum after 3h, with an abrupt drop to baseline levels after 4 h (Fig. 2B). The transcription factors NFATc2, NFATc1, c-MAF, p300, and Brg1 reached their maximal binding to the Il4 promoter after 3 h. The transcription factors analyzed bound with similar kinetics also to the Il4 HSS Va. No significant binding to the Ifnγ promoter could be detected at any time point. STAT6 bound to the Il4 promoter and Il4 HSS Va at all time points tested. NFATc2 and Brg1 also bound to the locus control region, located in the Rad50 gene (LCRRad50), reaching maximum binding after 3 h. GATA-3 binding to the CIRE increases after PMA/ionomycin restimulation and continues to increase until 6 h after the onset of restimulation, the end of the period of observation. The kinetics of transcription factor assembly at the Il4 gene indicates the coordinated, interdependent assembly of all factors. Th2 cells were restimulated with PMA/ionomycin, and the IL-4 expression was determined (Fig. 3A). Of the Th2 cells, 55% expressed IL-4, whereas 45% did not express any detectable IL-4. IL-4-expressing and non-expressing Th2 cells were physically separated to >95% purity, using the IL-4 cytokine secretion assay, which we had developed earlier (14.Löhning M. Richter A. Stamm T. Hu-Li J. Assenmacher M. Paul W.E. Radbruch A. Establishment of memory for IL-10 expression in developing T helper 2 cells requires repetitive IL-4 costimulation and does not impair proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12307-12312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IL-4 protein expression correlated with IL-4 mRNA expression as analyzed by quantitative PCR in the sorted populations (Fig. 3B). Both the IL-4 expressing and non-expressing Th cells expressed equal amounts of GATA-3, qualifying both fractions as bona fide Th2 cells (Fig. 3C). Relative to the binding of the transcription factors to the Ifnγ promoter, no significant binding to any of the Il4 gene regions analyzed from IL-4-non-expressing cells was observed for NF-κB p65, c-Maf, and RNA polymerase II. NFATc2, NFATc1, p300, and Brg1 did not bind to the promoter and CIRE regions, whereas STAT6 and GATA-3 did (Fig. 3D). STAT6 and GATA-3 also bound to the CIRE, LCRRad50, and HSS Va regions of Th2 cells not expressing IL-4 (Fig. 3D). For all regions of Il4 analyzed, significantly more RNA polymerase II, NFATc2, NFATc1, NF-κB p65, c-Maf, p300, and Brg1 was detected in IL-4 expressing versus non-expressing cells. Thus, the transcription factor complex, with the exception of GATA-3 and STAT6, efficiently assembles only at Il4 genes of IL-4-expressing Th2 cells. Naive DO11.10 TCR transgenic CD4+ Th cells were stimulated under Th2-polarizing conditions for 12 days and then restimulated with PMA/ionomycin. IL-4 expression was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining showing that 34% of the Th2 cells reexpressed IL-4. When the NFATc2 dephosphorylation by calcineurin was selectively blocked by 25 nm of the specific inhibitor BTP1, a 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole derivative (21.Trevillyan J.M. Chiou X.G. Chen Y.W. Ballaron S.J. Sheets M.P. Smith M.L. Wiedeman P.E. Warrior U. Wilkins J. Gubbins E.J. Gagne G.D. Fagerland J. Carter G.W. Luly J.R. Mollison K.W. Djuric S.W. Potent inhibition of NFAT activation and T cell cytokine production by novel low molecular weight pyrazole compounds.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48118-48126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), IL-4 reexpression was completely blocked (Fig. 4A). In those cells, binding of RNA polymerase II, p300, NFATc2, c-Maf, Brg1, and NF-κB p65 to the Il4 promoter, 3 h after restimulation (Fig. 4B), was decreased to levels observed for IL-4-non-expressing Th2 cells (Fig. 3D). This shows that the dephosphorylation of NFATc2 by calcineurin is critical for the assembly of a transcriptional activator complex at the Il4 gene. Calcineurin, thus, translates graded differences in TCR signaling into an all-or-none expression of Il4 of restimulated Th2 cells. This became evident when calcineurin was inhibited by CsA in different concentrations. Increasing CsA concentrations resulted in dose-dependent, decreased frequencies of IL-4 expressing Th2 cells following restimulation with PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 4C) or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies (data not shown). However, the amount of IL-4 expressed by individual IL-4-expressing cells remained the same. As CsA has been described to also affect NF-κB activation (22.Frischbutter S. Gabriel C. Bendfeldt H. Radbruch A. Baumgrass R. Dephosphorylation of Bcl-10 by calcineurin is essential for canonical NF-κB activation in Th cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), NFAT dephosphorylation was also blocked by the specific peptide inhibitor 11R-VIVIT (Fig. 4D) (23.Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. López-Rodríguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Affinity-driven peptide selection of an NFAT inhibitor more selective than cyclosporin A.Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and by specific siRNA targeting NFATc2 (Fig. 4E). Specific inhibition of either NFAT desphosphorylation by 11R-VIVIT or knockdown of NFATc2 itself by siRNA resulted in the reduction of the frequency of IL-4-expressing Th2 cells but not the amount of IL-4 expressed per cell. To visualize the nuclear translocation of NFATc2 in Th2 cells on the single cell level, in vitro-generated Th2 cells were restimulated with PMA/ionomycin in the presence of 7 nm CsA and stained for NFATc2 and IL-4. The cells were analyzed by image cytometry. Among all IL-4-expressing Th2 cells (Fig. 5A), NFATc2 showed nuclear localization which was defined by a high similarity score representing the correlation coefficient between the NFATc2 fluorescent signal and the nuclear DAPI fluorescent signal (Fig. 5, B and C). Th2 cells that did not reexpress IL-4 showed a bimodal distribution having either only cytoplasmic or only nuclear NFATc2 (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, our data indicate that in individual Th2 cells, calcineurin, by cooperative activating dephosphorylation of NFATc2, digitalizes graded differences in TCR signaling into all-or-none decisions to express IL-4. Here, we show that in the TCR signaling cascade, calcineurin, by cooperative dephosphorylation of NFATc2, translates differences of signaling strength in individual, restimulated Th2 lymphocytes into an all-or-none decision to express or not the signature cytokine IL-4. NFAT is required to assemble at the Il4 gene a transcription factor complex containing GATA-3, RNA polymerase II, NFATc2, NFATc1, NF-κB p65, c-Maf, CBP/p300, Brg1, and STAT6. Of these, only STAT6 and GATA-3 can bind in the absence of NFAT in Th2 cells not expressing IL-4. Th2 lymphocytes are imprinted epigenetically by DNA demethylation and histone modification of the Il4 gene (7.Tykocinski L.O. Hajkova P. Chang H.D. Stamm T. Sözeri O. Löhning M. Hu-Li J. Niesner U.

The transcription factor GATA-3 is necessary and sufficient for Th2 cytokine gene expression in CD4 T cells.Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar), to express the signature cytokine IL-4 when restimulated by antigen. Surprisingly, and as noted early on, not all Th2 cells express IL-4 in a given restimulation (15.Hu-Li J. Pannetier C. Guo L. Löhning M. Gu H. Watson C. Assenmacher M. Radbruch A. Paul W.E. Regulation of expression of IL-4 alleles: analysis using a chimeric GFP/IL-4 gene.Immunity. 2001; 14: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This is not a matter of lack of competence, as Th2 cells not expressing IL-4 in a given restimulation can express IL-4 in a subsequent restimulation at frequencies equal to cells that had expressed IL-4 (15.Hu-Li J. Pannetier C. Guo L. Löhning M. Gu H. Watson C. Assenmacher M. Radbruch A. Paul W.E.

It has been speculated that the infidelity of IL-4 reexpression by individual Th2 cells might be due to stochastic, monoallelic expression of the Il4 gene, with some cells not expressing it at all. It remained unclear, whether accessibility of the Il4 gene (26.Lee G.R. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A.

Moreover, in these studies, monoallelic expression of Il4 was analyzed for genetically modified T lymphocytes that had one Il4 allele marked by knock-in of a reporter gene, either green fluorescent protein (Gfp) (15.Hu-Li J. Pannetier C. Guo L. Löhning M. Gu H. Watson C. Assenmacher M. Radbruch A. Paul W.E.

Sunshine M.J. Littman D.R. Regulation of IL-4 expression by activation of individual alleles.Immunity. 1998; 9: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For the Gfp knock-in Th lymphocytes, we have shown previously that the genetic insertion had replaced the GATA-3 binding site CIRE, disabling the epigenetic imprinting of the modified Il4 allele (7.Tykocinski L.O. Hajkova P. Chang H.D. Stamm T. Sözeri O. Löhning M. Hu-Li J. Niesner U. Kreher S. Friedrich B. Pannetier C. Grütz G. Walter J. Paul W.E. Radbruch A. A critical control element for interleukin-4 memory expression in T helper lymphocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28177-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For wild-type Th2 cells, stochastic monoallelic expression of Il4 would predict a subpopulation of cells expressing both alleles and consequently twice as much as the cells expressing only one allele. This was not observed. Here, we show that reexpression of Il4 by Th2 lymphocytes is not only due to stochastic variations but is determined by activation of NFATc2 by calcineurin. NFAT has 23 phosphorylation sites, which are dephosphorylated by calcineurin in a cooperative fashion, i.e. with strictly sigmoid kinetics, resulting in a “molecular switch” (30.Salazar C. Höfer T. Activation of the transcription factor NFAT1: concerted or modular regulation?.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NFAT has to be dephosphorylated at 13 of these sites to expose its nuclear translocation sequence. Dephosphorylation at serine residues at the N-terminal transactivation domain is required for NFAT to bind to its target DNA sequence (18.Okamura H. Aramburu J. García-Rodríguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Concerted dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NFAT1 induces a conformational switch that regulates transcriptional activity.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Translocation of NFATc2 into the nucleus of activated T lymphocytes, thus, is an all-or-none event (Fig. 5B) (17.Podtschaske M. Benary U. Zwinger S. Höfer T. Radbruch A. Baumgrass R. Digital NFATc2 activation per cell transforms graded T cell receptor activation into an all-or-none IL-2 expression.PLoS One. 2007; 2: e935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For human Th lymphocytes, this results in all-or-none reexpression of IL-2, which is dependent on TCR signaling strength and mediated by calcineurin (17.Podtschaske M. Benary U. Zwinger S. Höfer T. Radbruch A. Baumgrass R. Digital NFATc2 activation per cell transforms graded T cell receptor activation into an all-or-none IL-2 expression.PLoS One. 2007; 2: e935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Calcineurin and NFATc2, thus, qualify as molecular analog-to-digital converters, translating TCR signaling strength into different frequencies of cells expressing NFAT-dependent genes. In established Th effector/memory cells, it is the epigenetic imprint of a cell determining which genes are accessible, as we show here for murine Th2 lymphocytes. Interestingly, independent of the frequency of IL-4-expressing cells in a given restimulation, the average amount of IL-4 expressed by the individual Th2 cell is the same, with stochastic cell-to-cell variability (31.Mariani L. Schulz E.G. Lexberg M.H. Helmstetter C. Radbruch A. Löhning M. Höfer T. Short-term memory in gene induction reveals the regulatory principle behind stochastic IL-4 expression.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 359Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This shows that under the conditions analyzed, none of the transcription factors required for Il4 expression is rate-limiting, except NFAT, as is evident from selective inhibition by BTP1 (32.Frischbutter S. Schultheis K. Pätzel M. Radbruch A. Baumgrass R. Evaluation of calcineurin/NFAT inhibitor selectivity in primary human Th cells using bar-coding and phospho-flow cytometry.Cytometry A. 2012; 81: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), 11R-VIVIT (22.Frischbutter S. Gabriel C. Bendfeldt H. Radbruch A. Baumgrass R. Dephosphorylation of Bcl-10 by calcineurin is essential for canonical NF-κB activation in Th cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or siRNA. NFAT is required to assemble GATA-3, RNA polymerase II, NFATc2, NFATc1, NF-κB p65, c-Maf, CBP/p300, Brg1, and STAT6 at the regulatory regions of the Il4 gene. The transcriptional activator complex may contain more proteins, which have not been analyzed here. STAT6 and GATA-3 did bind to the Il4 gene also in the absence of NFAT in restimulated Th2 cells not expressing IL-4, and GATA-3 remained bound to the Il4 gene in Th2 cells expressing IL-4 at late time points of restimulation. Apparently, on their own, they are not competent to assemble any of the other transcription factors analyzed to the Il4 gene, in particular not CBP/p300 and Brg1, which have been connected to epigenetic imprinting (12.Wurster A.L.

Although GATA-3 itself has been shown to be critical for epigenetic imprinting of the Il4 gene (26.Lee G.R. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A.

Löhning M. Gao Z. Assenmacher M. Ranganath S. Radbruch A. Murphy K.M.

The transcription factor GATA-3 is necessary and sufficient for Th2 cytokine gene expression in CD4 T cells.Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar), it is not required for the maintenance of the Th2 phenotype, with respect to IL-4 expression. Unlike inhibition of NFATc2 activity as shown here, conditional deletion of GATA-3 in already established Th2 cells did not change the frequency of Th2 cells reexpressing IL-4 but instead reduced the amount of IL-4 expressed per cell (6.Zhu J. Min B. Hu-Li J. Watson C.J. Grinberg A. Wang Q. Killeen N. Urban Jr., J.F. Guo L. Paul W.E. Conditional deletion of Gata3 shows its essential function in T(H)1-T(H)2 responses.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the Th2 cells analyzed here, GATA-3 expression obviously was not rate-limiting, as both Th2 cells, expressing IL-4 or not, expressed similar amounts of GATA-3. The conversion of graded, analog differences in antigen receptor signal strength into expression of defined packages of cytokines in activated T lymphocytes by the calcineurin/NFAT switch, teaches us that in immune reactions, communication between individual cells via NFAT-dependent cytokines occurs in an all-or-none fashion, probably by direct contact and contact-directed secretion (34.Kupfer A. Mosmann T.R. Kupfer H. Polarized expression of cytokines in cell conjugates of helper T cells and splenic B cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is analogous to the signal transduction in neurons, where a stimulus leads to the opening of ion channels and the firing of an action potential. Increasing the strength of the stimulus does not increase the size of the action potential but rather increases the frequency of action potentials (35.Walmsley B. Alvarez F.J. Fyffe R.E. Diversity of structure and function at mammalian central synapses.Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This all-or-none principle ensures that neural signals are passed on in full strength once a certain threshold is passed. Our data indicate that in adapting the magnitude of the immune response to different concentrations of antigens, it is the frequencies of responding cells among those able to respond, which is regulated by the calcineurin/NFAT switch. The advantage of this analog-to-digital conversion would be that the immune system is able to mount immune responses, even if by only a few cells, to antigens of low abundance, and it defines a threshold of reaction for the individual cell, minimizing background expression of potentially harmful genes, i.e. immunopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2066668336,"Amine oxidase copper-containing 1 (AOC1; formerly known as amiloride-binding protein 1) is a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the degradation of putrescine and histamine. Polyamines and their diamine precursor putrescine are ubiquitous to all organisms and fulfill pivotal functions in cell growth and proliferation. Despite the importance of AOC1 in regulating polyamine breakdown, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control its expression. We report here that the Wilms tumor protein, WT1, which is necessary for normal kidney development, activates transcription of the AOC1 gene. Expression of a firefly luciferase reporter under control of the proximal AOC1 promoter was significantly enhanced by co-transfection of a WT1 expression construct. Binding of WT1 protein to a cis-regulatory element in the AOC1 promoter was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Antisense inhibition of WT1 protein translation strongly reduced Aoc1 transcripts in cultured murine embryonic kidneys and gonads. Aoc1 mRNA levels correlated with WT1 protein in several cell lines. Double immunofluorescent staining revealed a co-expression of WT1 and AOC1 proteins in the developing genitourinary system of mice and rats. Strikingly, induced changes in polyamine homeostasis affected branching morphogenesis of cultured murine embryonic kidneys in a developmental stage-specific manner. These findings suggest that WT1-dependent control of polyamine breakdown, which is mediated by changes in AOC1 expression, has a role in kidney organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089318066,"Haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) is a component of a minor subspecies of high density lipoproteins (HDL) that function in innate immunity. Here we show that assembly of Hpr into HDL is mediated by its retained N-terminal signal peptide, an unusual feature for a secreted protein and the major difference between Hpr and the soluble acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp). The 18-amino acid signal peptide is necessary for binding to HDL and interacts directly with the hydrocarbon region of lipids. Utilizing model liposomes, we show that the rate of assembly and steady-state distribution of Hpr in lipid particles is mediated by the physical property of lipid fluidity. Dye release assays reveal that Hpr interacts more rapidly with fluid liposomes. Conversely, steady-state binding assays indicate that more rigid lipid compositions stabilize Hpr association. Lipid association also plays a role in facilitating hemoglobin binding by Hpr. Our data may offer an explanation for the distinct distribution of Hpr among HDL subspecies. Rather than protein-protein interactions mediating localization, direct interaction with phospholipids and sensitivity to lipid fluidity may be sufficient for localization of Hpr and may represent a mechanism of HDL subspeciation.

https://openalex.org/W2044928678,"Two studies provide evidence that the protein complex PTEX is needed for export of malaria-parasite proteins into the cytoplasm of infected cells, and that such export is essential for parasite survival. See Letters p.587 & p.592 The malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, infects and remodels the host's red blood cells, a process that requires the export of hundreds of proteins into the cytosol. This a considerable topological feat, as the parasite initially resides in a compartment known as the parasitophorous vacuole. A protein complex known as PTEX (Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins) was thought to be involved in this process, but evidence of function was circumstantial and indirect. Two reports in this issue of Nature use contrasting techniques to demonstrate that PTEX is essential for the export of malaria parasite proteins into the cytoplasm of infected cells, and that such export is essential for the parasite's life cycle. Brendan Elsworth et al. generated conditional mutants of PTEX components HSP101 and PTEX150, and show that when PTEX function is perturbed the export of proteins including the major virulence factor PfEMP1 is much reduced. Josh Beck et al. use an innovative dihydrofolate reductase based destabilization domain approach to inactivate the HSP101 and show that it is needed for the secretion of all classes of exported malarial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2046950750,"The JAK2V617F mutation is found in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Transgenic expression of the mutant gene causes MPN-like phenotypes in mice. We have produced JAK2V617F mice with p53 null background. Some of these mice developed acute erythroleukemia. From one of these mice, we derived a cell line designated J53Z1. J53Z1 cells were stained positive for surface markers CD71 and CD117 but negative for Sca-1, TER-119, CD11b, Gr-1, F4/80, CD11c, CD317, CD4, CD8a, CD3e, B220, CD19, CD41, CD42d, NK-1.1, and FceR1. Real time PCR analyses demonstrated expressions of erythropoietin receptor EpoR, GATA1, and GATA2 in these cells. J53Z1 cells grew rapidly in suspension culture containing fetal bovine serum with a doubling time of ∼18 hours. When transplanted into C57Bl/6 mice, J53Z1 cells induced acute erythroleukemia with massive infiltration of tumor cells in the spleen and liver. J53Z1 cells were responsive to stimulation with erythropoietin and stem cell factor and were selectively inhibited by JAK2 inhibitors which induced apoptosis of the cells. Together, J53Z1 cells belong to the erythroid lineage, and they may be useful for studying the role of JAK2V617F in proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells and for identifying potential therapeutic drugs targeting JAK2."
