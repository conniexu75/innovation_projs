https://openalex.org/W2981727226,"Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has led to an unprecedented understanding of gene expression and regulation in individual cells. Many scRNA-Seq approaches rely upon the template switching property of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-type reverse transcriptases. Template switching is believed to happen in a sequential process involving nontemplated addition of three protruding nucleotides (+CCC) to the 3′-end of the nascent cDNA, which can then anneal to the matching rGrGrG 3′-end of the template-switching oligo (TSO), allowing the reverse transcriptase (RT) to switch templates and continue copying the TSO sequence. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of template switching biases with respect to the RNA template, specifically of the role of the sequence and nature of its 5′-end (capped versus noncapped) in these biases. Our findings confirmed that the presence of a 5′-m7G cap enhances template switching efficiency. We also profiled the composition of the nontemplated addition in the absence of TSO and observed that the 5′-end of RNA template influences the terminal transferase activity of the RT. Furthermore, we found that designing new TSOs that pair with the most common nontemplated additions did little to improve template switching efficiency. Our results provide evidence suggesting that, in contrast to the current understanding of the template switching process, nontemplated addition and template switching are concurrent and competing processes.

https://openalex.org/W2981444094,"Objective Previous studies have shown that workers chronically exposed to occupational stress have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and sleep problems (SPs). The purpose of this study was to verify whether SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS. Method A 5-year prospective cohort study included 242 police officers from a rapid response unit engaged exclusively in maintaining law and order. Perceived stress levels were measured repeatedly with the demand-control-support and the effort-reward-imbalance questionnaires; insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; excessive daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. MetS and its components were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up. Results During 5-year follow-up period, 26 new cases of MetS were identified. Both occupational stress and SPs were significantly related to incident cases of MetS. Insomnia symptoms showed a highly significant association with MetS (aOR 11.038; CI95% 2.867–42.493). Mediation analysis confirmed that SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS. A reciprocal relationship was found between job stress and SPs. Work-related stress was a significant predictor of insomnia symptoms, short sleep duration, sleep dissatisfaction, and sleepiness. Compared to the reference group, police officers with SPs at baseline had significantly higher odds of reporting high stress at follow-up. Conclusion SPs play a mediating role in the relationship between occupational stress and MetS. Prevention of MetS must include the control of stress factors and an increase in the resilience of workers, but correct sleep hygiene is also an essential factor."

https://openalex.org/W2981993554,"The prevalence of social media platforms that share photos and videos could prove useful for wildlife research and conservation programs. When social media users post pictures and videos of animals, near real-time data like individual identification, sex, location, or other information are made accessible to scientists. These data can help inform researchers about animal occurrence, behavior, or threats to survival. The endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi) population has only 1,400 seals remaining in the wild. A small but growing population of seals has recently reestablished itself in the human-populated main Hawaiian Islands. While this population growth raises concerns about human-seal interactions it also provides the opportunity to capitalize on human observations to enhance research and conservation activities. We measured the potential utility of non-traditional data sources, in this case Instagram, to supplement current population monitoring of monk seals in the main Hawaiian Islands. We tracked all Instagram posts with the identifier #monkseal for a one-year period and assessed the photos for biological and geographical information, behavioral concerns, human disturbance and public perceptions. Social media posts were less likely to provide images suitable for individual seal identification (16.5%) than traditional sighting reports (79.9%). However, social media enhanced the ability to detect human-seal interactions or animal disturbances: 22.1%, of the 2,392 Instagram posts examined showed people within 3 meters of a seal, and 17.8% indicated a disturbance to the animal, meanwhile only 0.64% of traditional reports noted a disturbance to the animal. This project demonstrated that data obtained through social media posts have value to monk seal research and management strategies beyond traditional data collection, and further development of social media platforms as data resources is warranted. Many conservation programs may benefit from similar work using social media to supplement the research and conservation activities they are undertaking."
https://openalex.org/W2981480017,"During the late phase of the HIV-1 replication cycle, the viral Gag polyproteins are targeted to the plasma membrane for assembly. The Gag-membrane interaction is mediated by binding of Gag's N-terminal myristoylated matrix (MA) domain to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein is then recruited to the assembly sites and incorporated into budding particles. Evidence suggests that Env incorporation is mediated by interactions between Gag's MA domain and the cytoplasmic tail of the gp41 subunit of Env (gp41CT). MA trimerization appears to be an obligatory step for this interaction. Insufficient production of a recombinant MA trimer and unavailability of a biologically relevant membrane system have been barriers to detailed structural and biophysical characterization of the putative MA-gp41CT-membrane interactions. Here, we engineered a stable recombinant HIV-1 MA trimer construct by fusing a foldon domain (FD) of phage T4 fibritin to the MA C terminus. Results from NMR experiments confirmed that the FD attachment does not adversely alter the MA structure. Employing hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS, we identified an MA-MA interface in the MA trimer that is implicated in Gag assembly and Env incorporation. Utilizing lipid nanodiscs as a membrane mimetic, we show that the MA trimer binds to membranes 30-fold tighter than does the MA monomer and that incorporation of PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine enhances the binding of MA to nanodiscs. These findings advance our understanding of a fundamental mechanism in HIV-1 assembly and provide a template for investigating the interaction of MA with gp41CT."

Tel1ATM kinase is activated synergistically by naked dsDNA and the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2NBS1 complex (MRX). A multisubunit protein complex, which is related to human shelterin, protects telomeres from being recognized as DSBs, thereby preventing a Tel1ATM checkpoint response. However, at very short telomeres, Tel1ATM can be recruited and activated by the MRX complex, resulting in telomere elongation. Conversely, at long telomeres, Rap1-interacting-factor 2 (Rif2) is instrumental in suppressing Tel1 activity. Here, using an in vitro reconstituted Tel1 kinase activation assay, we show that Rif2 inhibits MRX-dependent Tel1 kinase activity. Rif2 discharges the ATP-bound form of Rad50, which is essential for all MRX-dependent activities. This conclusion is further strengthened by experiments with a Rad50 allosteric ATPase mutant that maps outside the conserved ATP binding pocket. We propose a model in which Rif2 attenuates Tel1 activity at telomeres by acting directly on Rad50 and discharging its activated ATP-bound state, thereby rendering the MRX complex incompetent for Tel1 activation. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanism by which Rif2 controls telomere length.

https://openalex.org/W2981412624,"The acoustic properties of vocalizations in common marmosets differ between populations. These differences may be the result of social vocal learning, but they can also result from environmental or genetic differences between populations. We performed translocation experiments to separately quantify the influence of a change in the physical environment (experiment 1), and a change in the social environment (experiment 2) on the acoustic properties of calls from individual captive common marmosets. If population differences were due to genetic differences, we expected no change in the vocalizations of the translocated marmosets. If differences were due to environmental factors, we expected vocalizations to permanently change contingent with environmental changes. If social learning was involved, we expected that the vocalizations of animals translocated to a new population with a different dialect would become more similar to the new population. In experiment 1, we translocated marmosets to a different physical environment without changing the social composition of the groups or their neighbours. Immediately after the translocation to the new facility, one out of three call types showed a significant change in call structure, but 5–6 weeks later, the calls were no longer different from before the translocation. Thus, the novel physical environment did not induce long lasting changes in the vocalizations of the marmosets. In experiment 2, we translocated marmosets to a new population with a different dialect. Importantly, our previous work had shown that these two populations differed significantly in vocalization structure. The translocated marmosets were still housed in their original social group, but after translocation they were surrounded by the vocalizations from neighbouring groups of the new population. The vocal distance between the translocated individuals and the new population decreased for two out of three call types over 16 weeks. Thus, even without direct social contact or interaction, the vocalizations of the translocated animals converged towards the new population, indicating that common marmosets can modify their calls due to acoustic input from conspecifics alone, via crowd vocal learning. To our knowledge, this is the first study able to distinguish between different explanations for vocal dialects as well as to show crowd vocal learning in a primate species."
https://openalex.org/W2981362190,"Considered as a key component of human capital, mental health has drawn substantial scholarly attention for its effect on people's health status and economic outcome. When facing the challenge of stress, people's heterogeneity in cognitive ability and non-cognitive ability causes difference in patterns of coping, resulting in different manifestations in mental health. Previous researches have shown that cognitive and non-cognitive abilities have positively direct or indirect effects on mental health, but few studies research their role of coping with air pollution. We used the China Family Panel Survey (CFPS) and matched individual data with county or district level PM2.5 information from NASA. The study found that air pollution has negative effect on mental health with every increase of 1μg/m3 in PM2.5 deteriorating mental health by 0.038 standard deviation, which is the total effect of air pollution. However, the direct effect of air pollution on mental health will decrease to 0.028 in absolute value when considering mediating effects. By employing different approaches, we found positive mediating effects via cognitive ability and non-cognitive ability. Individuals with high cognitive and non-cognitive abilities are able to accurately diagnose problems and select the optimal coping strategies, thus restoring positive mental health."

In this study, plantlets of healthy and root-rot pathogen-infected G. hybrida were used as plant materials for transcriptome analyis using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technique. A total 108,135 unigenes were generated with an average length of 727 nt and N50 equal to 1274 nt out of which 611 genes were identified as DEGs by DESeq analyses. Among DEGs, 228 genes were up-regulated and 383 were down-regulated. Through this annotated data and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), molecular interaction network, transcripts accompanying with tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were thoroughly observed considering expression pattern. The involvement of DEGs in tyrosine metabolism pathway was validated by real-time qPCR. We found that genes related with tyrosine metabolism were activated and up-regulated against stress response. The expression of GhTAT, GhAAT, GhHPD, GhHGD and GhFAH genes was significantly increased in the leaves and petioles at four and six dpi (days post inoculation) as compared with control. The study predicts the gene sequences responsible for the tyrosine metabolism pathway and its responses against root-rot resistance in gerbera plant. In future, identification of such genes is necessary for the better understanding of rot resistance mechanism and to develop a root rot resistance strategy for ornamental plants."
https://openalex.org/W2981409346,"As acute stroke services improve, more persons experience mild stroke and need to cope daily with hidden disabilities, which may be influenced by how they perceive stroke, cognitively and emotionally.To investigate cognitive illness beliefs and emotional responses in persons with mild stroke and their possible influences on daily coping.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 persons with mild stroke, on average 7.5 months (±0.89) after stroke occurrence. A thematic analysis on verbatim transcripts was guided by the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation.All participants experienced difficulties constructing an illness identity at both acute and chronic phase. Behavioral risk factors were less accepted as causes of stroke. Lack (or inappropriate timing) of information from healthcare providers led to limited medication knowledge and low perceived control of stroke recurrence which generated anxiety, fear, and low involvement in coping. Participants who considered stroke a chronic condition experienced more difficulties. Perceived support from relatives and healthcare providers was beneficial for participation in recovery and health behaviour change.Despite having mildly disabilities, participants reported difficulties developing illness beliefs conducive to coping, and dealing with their emotional responses. These elements should be considered in tailored programs to improve coping with hidden disabilities post-stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2981512690,"Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) implicate 16q22.1 locus in risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying oncogenic mechanisms remain unknown. Here, through comprehensive filtration, we prioritized rs7198799, a common SNP in the second intron of the CDH1, as the putative causal variant. In addition, we found an association of CRC-risk allele C of rs7198799 with elevated transcript level of biological plausible candidate gene ZFP90 via expression quantitative trait loci analysis. Mechanistically, causal variant rs7198799 resides in an enhancer element and remotely regulate ZFP90 expression by targeting the transcription factor NFATC2. Remarkably, CRISPR/Cas9-guided single-nucleotide editing demonstrated the direct effect of rs7198799 on ZFP90 expression and CRC cellular malignant phenotype. Furthermore, ZFP90 affects several oncogenic pathways, including BMP4, and promotes carcinogenesis in patients and in animal models with ZFP90 specific genetic manipulation. Taken together, these findings reveal a risk SNP-mediated long-range regulation on the NFATC2-ZFP90-BMP4 pathway underlying the initiation of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2982042535,"Spathiphyllum is a very important tropical plant used as a small, potted, ornamental plant in South China, with an annual output value of hundreds of millions of yuan. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the complete nucleotide sequence of the Spathiphyllum 'Parrish' chloroplast genome. The whole chloroplast genome is 168,493 bp in length, and includes a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions (IRa and IRb, each 31,600 bp), separated by a small single-copy (SSC, 15,799 bp) region and a large single-copy (LSC, 89,494 bp) region. Our annotation revealed that the S. 'Parrish' chloroplast genome contained 132 genes, including 87 protein coding genes, 37 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. In the repeat structure analysis, we detected 281 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) which included mononucleotides (223), dinucleotides (28), trinucleotides (12), tetranucleotides (11), pentanucleotides (6), and hexanucleotides (1), in the S. 'Parrish' chloroplast genome. In addition, we identified 50 long repeats, comprising 18 forward repeats, 13 reverse repeats, 17 palindromic repeats, and 2 complementary repeats. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion/deletion (indel) analyses of the chloroplast genome of the S. 'Parrish' relative S. cannifolium revealed 962 SNPs in S. 'Parrish'. There were 158 indels (90 insertions and 68 deletions) in the S. 'Parrish' chloroplast genome relative to the S. cannifolium chloroplast genome. Phylogenetic analysis of five species found S. 'Parrish' to be more closely related to S. kochii than to S. cannifolium. This study identified the characteristics of the S. 'Parrish' chloroplast genome, which will facilitate species identification and phylogenetic analysis within the genus Spathiphyllum."
https://openalex.org/W2982285115,"The snow leopard Panthera uncia is a vulnerable wild felid native to mountainous regions of 12 Asian countries. It faces numerous overlapping threats, including killings by herders retaliating against livestock losses, the illegal wildlife trade, loss of prey and habitat, infrastructure, energy and mining developments, and climate change. The species ranges over large territories that often lie outside of protected areas (PA), so coexistence with human populations across its range is key to its persistence. Human attitudes to snow leopards may be an important factor to consider in reducing overlapping threats to this species. However, this nexus has not been widely studied to date. Attitudes to snow leopard conservation, including actors and interventions, may also be a significant aspect of coexistence. These have also received limited empirical attention. This study therefore explored human attitudes to snow leopards and to snow leopard conservation, the motivations for these attitudes and the individual factors that best explained them. Using systematic sampling, a quantitative questionnaire was administered to 705 households at two sites in the Nepal Himalayas: Sagarmatha National Park, with a less decentralised governance model, and Annapurna Conservation Area, with a more decentralised model. Linear regression models were the main form of analysis. Based on these, attitudes to snow leopard conservation emerged as the strongest influence on local attitudes to snow leopards, and vice versa. This was true in both PAs, despite their differing management regimes. Other important explanatory factors included numbers of livestock owned, years of education, household livelihoods and age. Furthermore, a positive intrinsic motivation was the most common reason given by respondents to explain their attitudes to both snow leopards and snow leopard conservation. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to the usual suite of factors that influence attitudes to a species, the way in which its conservation is pursued and perceived also needs consideration. How the snow leopard is conserved may strongly influence its coexistence with local communities."
https://openalex.org/W2981545667,"Reconstructed human adipose tissues represent novel tools available to perform in vitro pharmaco-toxicological studies. We used adipose-derived human stromal/stem cells to reconstruct, using tissue engineering techniques, such an adipose tridimensional model. To determine to what extent the in vitro model is representative of its native counterpart, adipogenic differentiation, triglycerides accumulation and phospholipids profiles were analysed. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed pathways enriched with differentially-expressed genes between native and reconstructed human adipose tissues. Interestingly, genes related to fatty acid metabolism were downregulated in vitro, which could be explained in part by the insufficient amount of essential fatty acids provided by the fetal calf serum used for the culture. Indeed, the lipid profile of the reconstructed human adipose tissues indicated a particular lack of linoleic acid, which could interfere with physiological cell processes such as membrane trafficking, signaling and inflammatory responses. Supplementation in the culture medium was able to influence the lipid profile of the reconstructed human adipose tissues. This study demonstrates the possibility to directly modulate the phospholipid profile of reconstructed human adipose tissues. This reinforces its use as a relevant physiological or pathological model for further pharmacological and metabolic studies of human adipose tissue functions."
https://openalex.org/W2981774884,"Background and objectives Agitation is common in people living with dementia especially at the end of life. We examined how staff interpreted agitation behavior in people with dementia nearing end of life, how this may influence their responses and its impact on the quality of care. Research design Ethnographic study. Structured and semi-structured non-participant observations (referred to subsequently in this paper as “structured observations”) of people living with dementia nearing the end of life in hospital and care homes (south-east England) and in-depth interviews with staff, conducted August 2015-March 2017. Methods Three data sources: 1) detailed field notes, 2) observations using a structured tool and checklist for behaviors classed as agitation and staff and institutional responses, 3) staff semi-structured qualitative interviews. We calculated the time participants were agitated and described staff responses. Data sources were analyzed separately, developed continuously and relationally during the study and synthesized where appropriate. Results We identified two main ‘ideal types’ of staff explanatory models for agitation: In the first, staff attribute agitated behaviors to the person’s “moral judgement”, making them prone to rejecting or punitive responses. In the second staff adopt a more “needs-based” approach in which agitation behaviors are regarded as meaningful and managed with proactive and investigative approaches. These different approaches appear to have significant consequences for the timing, frequency and quality of staff response. While these models may overlap they tend to reflect distinct organizational resources and values. Conclusions Care worker knowledge about agitation is not enough, and staff need organizational support to care better for people living with dementia towards end of life. Positional theory may help to explain much of the cultural-structural context that produces staff disengagement from people with dementia, offering insights on how agitation behavior is reframed by some staff as dangerous. Such behavior may be associated with low-resource institutions with minimal staff training where the personhood of staff may be neglected."
https://openalex.org/W2981457875,"Motivation Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) represents the diversity of cell populations that make up cancer tissue. The level of ITH in a tumor is usually measured by a genomic variation profile, such as copy number variation and somatic mutation. However, a recent study has identified ITH at the transcriptome level and suggested that ITH at gene expression levels is useful for predicting prognosis. Measuring ITH levels at the spliceome level is a natural extension. There are serious technical challenges in measuring spliceomic ITH (sITH) from bulk tumor RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) due to the complex splicing patterns. Results We propose an information-theoretic method to measure the sITH of bulk tumors to overcome the above challenges. This method has been extensively tested in experiments using synthetic data, xenograft tumor data, and TCGA pan-cancer data. As a result, we showed that sITH is closely related to cancer progression and clonal heterogeneity, along with clinically significant features such as cancer stage, survival outcome and PAM50 subtype. As far as we know, it is the first study to define ITH at the spliceome level. This method can greatly improve the understanding of cancer spliceome and has great potential as a diagnostic and prognostic tool."
https://openalex.org/W2981459585,"A myriad of protein partners modulate the activity of the human DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), whose interactions with these other proteins are frequently altered during oncogenesis. We show here that the tumor suppressor p53 decreases DNMT3A activity by forming a heterotetramer complex with DNMT3A. Mutational and modeling experiments suggested that p53 interacts with the same region in DNMT3A as does the structurally characterized DNMT3L. We observed that the p53-mediated repression of DNMT3A activity is blocked by amino acid substitutions within this interface, but surprisingly, also by a distal DNMT3A residue, R882H. DNMT3A R882H occurs frequently in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, and our results suggest that the effects of R882H and other DNMT3A mutations may go beyond changes in DNMT3A methylation activity. To further understand the dynamics of how protein-protein interactions modulate DNMT3A activity, we determined that p53 has a greater affinity for DNMT3A than for DNMT3L and that p53 readily displaces DNMT3L from the DNMT3A:DNMT3L heterotetramer. Interestingly, this occurred even when the preformed DNMT3A:DNMT3L complex was actively methylating DNA. The frequently identified p53 substitutions (R248W and R273H), whereas able to regulate DNMT3A function when forming the DNMT3A:p53 heterotetramer, no longer displaced DNMT3L from the DNMT3A:DNMT3L heterotetramer. The results of our work highlight the complex interplay between DNMT3A, p53, and DNMT3L and how these interactions are further modulated by clinically derived mutations in each of the interacting partners.

Several studies suggest a link between p53 and DNA methylation.

However, definitive evidence of the functional consequences of a DNMT3A:p53 complex on DNMT3A activity remains elusive. Our interest lies in exploring whether p53 binding to DNMT3A alters DNMT3A activity, and if well-studied DNMT3A and p53 mutants, such as R882H (DNMT3A) and p53 mutants R248W and R273H, alter this regulation.

Additionally, R882H displays altered interactions with components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 compared with WT DNMT3A, thereby leading to transcriptional silencing in a DNA methylation-independent manner (29Koya J.

These observations suggest that compared with WT DNMT3A, the R882H substitution may lead to altered binding and/or regulation by partner proteins. Given that the p53 gene is a recurring target for mutations in a wide-range of human cancers, there is growing interest in understanding how mutations in p53 contribute to disease onset and progression (30Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408 (10.1038/35042675, 11099028): 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5413) Google Scholar, 31Petitjean A. Mathe E. Kato S. Ishioka C.

In addition to a high mutation frequency, p53 R273H and R248W form aberrant protein complexes that affect the activity of interacting partner proteins (32Song H. Hollstein M.

Our goal is to understand the dynamics and functional consequences of complex assembly involving the WT catalytic domain of DNMT3A (DNMT3AWT) and the R882H substitution (DNMT3AR882H) under a variety of conditions. Furthermore, we seek to better understand the functional consequences of protein complexes involving two or more proteins to better understand the cellular basis of enzyme function. Previous cell-based evidence implicates direct and indirect DNMT3A and p53 interactions (24Tovy A. Spiro A. McCarthy R. Shipony Z. Aylon Y. Alton K. Ainbinder E. Furth N. Tanay A. Barton M. Oren M. p53 is essential for DNA methylation homeostasis in naïve embryonic stem cells, and its loss promotes clonal heterogeneity.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (10.1101/gad.299198.117, 28607180): 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Wang Y.A.

Ther. 2005; 4 (10.4161/cbt.4.10.2073, 16131836): 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse embryonic stem cells, p53 indirectly regulates DNMT3A-mediated methylation by restricting the expression of DNMT3A (24Tovy A. Spiro A. McCarthy R. Shipony Z. Aylon Y. Alton K. Ainbinder E. Furth N. Tanay A. Barton M. Oren M. p53 is essential for DNA methylation homeostasis in naïve embryonic stem cells, and its loss promotes clonal heterogeneity.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (10.1101/gad.299198.117, 28607180): 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Alternatively, direct binding of DNMT3A to p53 suppresses p53-mediated transcription of p21 in a DNA methylation-independent manner, implying that DNMT3A may allosterically regulate p53 activity (25Wang Y.A. Kamarova Y. Shen K.C. Jiang Z. Hahn M.J. Wang Y. Brooks S.C. DNA methyltransferase-3a interacts with p53 and represses p53-mediated gene expression.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4 (10.4161/cbt.4.10.2073, 16131836): 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we sought to determine whether p53 has any effect on the DNA methylation activity of DNMT3A. Given that the DNMT3A catalytic domain and full-length enzyme have comparable kinetic parameters (kcat, KmDNA, KmAdoMet, processivity, and DNMT3L stimulation), the catalytic domain of DNMT3A has proven to be a suitable model for in vitro studies and is commonly employed (35Purdy M.M. Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. Identification of a second DNA binding site in human DNA methyltransferase 3A by substrate inhibition and domain deletion.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 498 (10.1016/j.abb.2010.03.007, 20227382): 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Kareta M.S. Botello Z.M. Ennis J.J. Chou C. Chédin F.

Chem. 2006; 281 (10.1074/jbc.M603140200): 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal domains in full-length DNMT3A, including the ATX-DNMT3A-DNMT3L (ADD) and PWWP domains, are known to interact with numerous partner proteins that may modulate the enzymatic activities of DNMT3A (37Galonska C. Charlton J. Mattei A.L. Donaghey J. Clement K. Gu H. Mohammad A.W. Stamenova E.K. Cacchiarelli D. Klages S. Timmermann B. Cantz T. Schöler H.R. Gnirke A. Ziller M.J. Meissner A. Genome-wide tracking of dCas9-methyltransferase footprints.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (10.1038/s41467-017-02708-5, 29426832): 597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lei Y. Huang Y.H. Goodell M.A. DNA methylation and de-methylation using hybrid site-targeting proteins.Genome Biol. 2018; 19 (30400938): 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the effect of p53WT on the methylation activity of the DNMT3A catalytic domain and full-length enzymes by preincubating p53 with equimolar concentrations of DNMT3A for 1 h prior to initiating the reaction by the addition of poly(dI-dC). We observed comparable levels of p53WT-mediated DNMT3A inhibition with the catalytic domain (Fig. 1, A and B) or the full-length DNMT3A (Fig. 1, A and C). The comparable inhibition indicates that the N-terminal portion of DNMT3A is not essential for p53WT-DNMT3A interactions and does not perturb p53WT acting on the catalytic domain of DNMT3A. The consensus DNA binding sequence of p53 (5′-RRRC(A/T)(A/T)GYYY(0–14 bases)RRRC(A/T)(A/T)GYYY-3′; A= adenine, G= guanine, C= cytosine and T= thymine) differs from that of DNMT3A, which displays a strong preference toward CpG sites (39el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Definition of a consensus binding site for p53.Nat. Genet. 1992; 1 (10.1038/ng0492-45, 1301998): 45-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that p53WT inhibition of DNMT3A (full-length and catalytic domain) enzymatic activity is attributable to the DNA-binding ability of p53. To assess whether the inhibitory effect of p53WT on DNA methylation is specific to DNMT3A, the activity of the bacterial methyltransferase M.HhaI, which recognizes 5′-GCGC-3′ sites in dsDNA, was challenged with increasing concentrations of p53WT. Although p53WT led to roughly a 50% decrease in DNMT3A (full-length and catalytic domain) activity (Fig. 1), DNA methylation by M.HhaI was unaltered in similar reactions involving p53 at 1:1 and 3:1 relative to M.HhaI (Fig. 1, A and D). Like DNMT3A, M.HhaI is a C-5 cytosine-specific methyltransferase that possesses a remarkably similar structure to that of the DNMT3A catalytic domain (40Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. Mammalian DNA methyltransferases: a structural perspective.Structure. 2008; 16 (10.1016/j.str.2008.01.004, 18334209): 341-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Despite the shared similarities of DNMT3A and M.HhaI, here we show that p53 inhibition is specific to DNMT3A. To further characterize the interactions between DNMT3AWT and p53, the apparent binding affinities (KD,app) of p53WT and p53R248W for DNMT3AWT were determined. For comparison, we also determined the KD,app of DNMT3L for DNMT3AWT, which has a well-characterized interaction. KD,app was assessed by measuring the activity of DNMT3AWT with increasing levels of DNMT3L (Fig. S1A) or p53 (Fig. S1B), and subsequently determining the fold-stimulation or inhibition by DNMT3L or p53WT and p53R248W, respectively. Although DNMT3L resulted in a KD,app of 80 ± 12 nm, p53WT displayed a nearly 5-fold stronger binding affinity for DNMT3AWT with a KD,app of 17 ± 3 nm, followed by p53R248W, which resulted in a KD,app of 41 ± 6 nm (calculated from supporting Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, compared with the DNMT3AWT-DNMT3L complex, DNMT3AWT-p53WT and -p53R248W complexes are more energetically favorable. Previous work by Wang et al. (25Wang Y.A. Kamarova Y. Shen K.C. Jiang Z. Hahn M.J. Wang Y. Brooks S.C. DNA methyltransferase-3a interacts with p53 and represses p53-mediated gene expression.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4 (10.4161/cbt.4.10.2073, 16131836): 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that DNMT3A interacts with the C-terminal tetramerization domain of p53 (amino acids 319–393, Fig. S3). No such information is available for the region on DNMT3A that is associated. We previously used alanine scanning to identify residues on the DNMT3A tetramer interface that largely contribute to tetramer stability and alter the ability of DNMT3A to form higher order complexes (41Holz-Schietinger C. Matje D.M. Harrison M.F. Reich N.O. Oligomerization of DNMT3A controls the mechanism of de novo DNA methylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (10.1074/jbc.M111.284687): 41479-41488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, we employed docking-based modeling of protein-protein interfaces using monomeric forms of DNMT3A (PDB code 5YX2; residues 628–914) and p53 (PDB code 3TS8; 94–356) to predict a surface on DNMT3A for interactions with p53. Computational models generated in ZDOCK and RosettaDock servers were used to predict the DNMT3A tetramer interface as a likely surface for DNMT3A-p53 interactions (Fig. S2) (42Pierce B.G. Wiehe K. Hwang H. Kim B.H. Vreven T. Weng Z. ZDOCK server: interactive docking prediction of protein–protein complexes and symmetric multimers.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 (10.1093/bioinformatics/btu097, 24532726): 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 43Lyskov S. Gray J.J. The RosettaDock server for local protein–protein docking.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (18442991): W233-W238Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Based on this rationale, p53WT inhibition of the DNMT3A catalytic activity was assessed in a subset of alanine mutations on the DNMT3A tetramer interface (R729A, E733A, R736A, R771A), which are also commonly observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (26Ley T.J. Ding L. Walter M.J. McLellan M.D. Lamprecht T. Larson D.E. Kandoth C. Payton J.E. Baty J. Welch J. Harris C.C. et al.DNMT3A mutations in acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J.

The extent of p53WT inhibition varied across the mutations examined in this study: the fold-inhibition of DNMT3AR771A (Fig. 2, B and C, green square) and DNMT3AE733A (Fig. 2, B and C, blue square) was greater than WT, whereas the fold-inhibition of DNMT3AR729A (Fig. 2, B and C, orange square) was less than WT and DNMT3AR736A (Fig. 2, B and C, red square) displayed no inhibition. The results obtained implicate the DNMT3A tetramer interface as a potential surface on DNMT3A for interactions with p53 and suggest that residue Arg-736 on the DNMT3A tetramer interface contributes to the necessary contacts for p53 inhibition of DNMT3A. Given that DNMT3A exists in several multiprotein complexes associated with transcriptional regulation, we sought to assess the extent of DNMT3A modulation in the presence of multiple regulatory partner proteins (5Thillainadesan G.

Our mutational mapping and modeling results suggest that the DNMT3A tetramer interface (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2) interacts with both DNMT3L and p53. Given that the DNMT3A-DNMT3L co-crystal structure (46Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Structure of Dnmt3a bound to Dnmt3L suggests a model for de novo DNA methylation.Nature. 2007; 449 (10.1038/nature06146, 17713477): 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) presents the DNMT3A tetramer interface as an established surface for regulation of DNMT3A activity by an additional partner protein, we assessed whether DNMT3L and p53WT regulation of DNMT3AWT is mutually exclusive using poly(dI-dC) as a substrate. After demonstrating DNMT3AWT is responsive to DNMT3L (Fig. 3A, green square) and p53WT (Fig. 3A, blue square), we observed that p53WT modulation of DNMT3AWT is dominant over that of DNMT3L in DNMT3AWT-DNMT3L-p53WT co-incubations (Fig. 3A, red square). We previously showed that p53WT inhibition of DNMT3AWT does not rely on DNA binding by p53 (Fig. 1). Therefore, the use of poly(dI-dC) as a substrate allowed us to investigate the isolated effects of p53-mediated inhibition of DNMT3A activity.

As we observed for poly(dI-dC), p53WT-dependent inhibition of DNMT3AWT activity is dominant over DNMT3L stimulation as DNMT3AWT-p53WT-DNMT3L co-incubations (Fig. 3B, yellow square) displayed comparable levels of activity as reactions consisting of DNMT3AWT-p53WT (Fig. 3B, red square) with the Cyclin-dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A/P21 promoter as a DNA substrate. Furthermore, equimolar concentrations of all proteins were used in DNMT3AWT-DNMT3L-p53WT co-incubations (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that the dominant modulation of DNMT3AWT activity by p53WT over DNMT3L was not due to stoichiometric differences. The stability of the DNMT3AWT:p53WT complex is greater than the DNMT3AWT:DNMT3L complex (Fig. S1) and DNMT3L and p53 likely share a binding interface on DNMT3A (Fig. 2). To further investigate the dynamics of DNMT3AWT-DNMT3L-p53WT interactions, we next assessed the effect of adding regulatory proteins to actively catalyzing heterotetrameric complexes, which is arguably a better representation of what occurs within the cell. We observed that addition p53WT disrupts the DNMT3AWT:DNMT3L complex during catalysis (Fig. 3C, red square). This not only supports our observation that the DNM"
https://openalex.org/W2981671997,"Objectives The main objective of this study was to evaluate community pharmacists’ awareness and perception about medication reconciliation service and to assess the completeness of collecting patients’ medication histories in the community pharmacy setting. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between February to March 2018 in Amman-Jordan. During the study period, 150 community pharmacists were invited to participate in the study. Each pharmacist completed a validated structured questionnaire evaluating their awareness, current practice, perceived attitude and perceived barriers towards the implementation of medication reconciliation and the collection of medication histories at the community pharmacy setting. Results A total of 121 pharmacists agreed to participate and filled the questionnaire. Our results showed that only 13.2% of the pharmacists were able to define “medication reconciliation” correctly, and around 31% have a misconception that the medication reconciliation process should be performed only at the inpatient setting. Only 19.8% (n = 24) of the participating pharmacists stated that they ask all patients for a complete current medication list of medications when they arrive at the pharmacy site. Medication histories for most patients were lacking information about the dosage, route, frequency, and time of the last refill for each medication listed. “Patients lack of awareness about all the medications they are receiving” was the main barrier discouraging community pharmacists from collecting medication histories and participating in reconciliation service. Conclusion Community pharmacists in Jordan showed a low awareness about the medication reconciliation concept and demonstrated a modest role in obtaining medication histories in community pharmacies. But still, they showed a positive attitude towards their role in implementing the different steps of medication reconciliation. This suggests that educational workshops to increase pharmacists’ awareness about their role and responsibilities in collecting a complete and accurate medication history are warrented."
https://openalex.org/W2981870909,"The structure and function of the sarcomere of striated muscle is well studied but the steps of sarcomere assembly and maintenance remain under-characterized. With the aid of chaperones and factors of the protein quality control system, muscle proteins can be folded and assembled into the contractile apparatus of the sarcomere. When sarcomere assembly is incomplete or the sarcomere becomes damaged, suites of chaperones and maintenance factors respond to repair the sarcomere. Here we show evidence of the importance of the M-line proteins, specifically myomesin, in the monitoring of sarcomere assembly and integrity in previously characterized zebrafish muscle mutants. We show that myomesin is one of the last proteins to be incorporated into the assembling sarcomere, and that in skeletal muscle, its incorporation requires connections with both titin and myosin. In diseased zebrafish sarcomeres, myomesin1a shows an early increase of gene expression, hours before chaperones respond to damaged muscle. We found that myomesin expression is also more specific to sarcomere damage than muscle creatine kinase, and our results and others support the use of myomesin assays as an early, specific, method of detecting muscle damage."
https://openalex.org/W2981463615,"Background Despite the beneficial effects of peer support on breastfeeding, research on the process of peer support is scarce. In Lebanon, exclusive breastfeeding is only 15% in infants below six months. A multidisciplinary team launched a multi-component breastfeeding support intervention, with peer support, and professional lactation support provided by International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLs) to target this decline. Aim To describe the experiences of breastfeeding mothers and peer support providers with the process of breastfeeding support, and the influence of the intervention on their social support system. Methods Using a qualitative methodology, a purposive sample of breastfeeding and support mothers was accessed from among those who completed their six months interview in the trial taking place in two hospitals in Beirut, Lebanon. Data were collected from 43 participants using in-depth interviews and following the data saturation principle. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted, guided by the principles of grounded theory. Results Breastfeeding mothers were satisfied with their breastfeeding experience, and extremely appreciative of the support provided by their peers and the IBCLCs. They experienced these forms of support differently. Peer support was perceived to be important in encouraging breastfeeding continuation, whereas IBCLC support was influential in problem solving. Conclusion These findings can improve our understanding of the peer and professional lactation support process within the social context, and the realities of breastfeeding mothers, and help facilitate the scaling up of interventions in similar contexts."

A subset of missense mutations within TB4 cause stiff skin syndrome (SSS), a rare autosomal dominant form of scleroderma. The fibrotic phenotype is thought to be regulated by changes in the ability of fibrillin-1 to mediate integrin binding.

Our data show that 7 of the 8 RGD-binding integrins can mediate adhesion to fibrillin-1. A single amino acid substitution responsible for SSS (W1570C) markedly inhibited adhesion mediated by integrins α5β1, αvβ5, and αvβ6, partially inhibited adhesion mediated by αvβ1, and did not inhibit adhesion mediated by α8β1 or αIIbβ3. Adhesion mediated by integrin αvβ3 depended on the cell surface expression level. In the SSS mutant background, the presence of a cysteine residue in place of highly conserved tryptophan 1570 alters the conformation of the region containing the exposed RGD sequence within the same domain to differentially affect fibrillin's interactions with distinct RGD-binding integrins.

https://openalex.org/W2981546548,"Photolysis is one of the main transformation pathways for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) released into the environment. Upon exposure to sunlight, TNT is known to undergo both oxidation and reduction reactions with release of nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium ions, followed by condensation reactions of the oxidation and reduction products. In this study, compound classes of transformation products from the aqueous and solid phase photodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) have been identified by liquid and solid state 13C and 15N NMR. Aqueous phase experiments were performed on saturated solutions of T15NT in deionized water, natural pond water (pH = 8.3, DOC = 3.0 mg/L), pH 8.0 buffer solution, and in the presence of Suwannee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM; pH = 3.7), using a Pyrex-filtered medium pressure mercury lamp. Natural sunlight irradiations were performed on TNT in the solid phase and dissolved in the pond water. In deionized water, carboxylic acid, aldehyde, aromatic amine, primary amide, azoxy, nitrosophenol, and azo compounds were formed. 15N NMR spectra exhibited major peaks centered at 128 to 138 ppm, which are in the range of phenylhydroxylamine and secondary amide nitrogens. The secondary amides are proposed to represent benzanilides, which would arise from photochemical rearrangement of nitrones formed from the condensation of benzaldehyde and phenylhydroxylamine derivatives of TNT. The same compound classes were formed from sunlight irradiation of TNT in the solid phase. Whereas carboxylic acids, aldehydes, aromatic amines, phenylhydroxylamines, and amides were also formed from irradiation of TNT in pond water and in pH 8 buffer solution, azoxy and azo compound formation was inhibited. Solid state 15N NMR spectra of photolysates from the lamp irradiation of unlabeled 2,6-dinitrotoluene in deionized water also demonstrated the formation of aromatic amine, phenylhydroxylamine/ 2° amide, azoxy, and azo nitrogens."
https://openalex.org/W2982140571,"Background Treatment of mental health problems (MHP) is often delayed or absent due to the lack of systematic detection and early intervention. This study evaluates the potential of a new screening algorithm to identify children with MHP. Methods The study population comprises 2,015 children from the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 whose mental health was assessed at age 11–12 years and who had no prior use of specialised mental health services. A new algorithm based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is utilised to identify MHP by combining parent-reported scores of emotional and behavioural problems and functional impairments. The screening is done on historical data, implying that neither parents, teachers nor health care professionals received any feedback on the screening status. The screening status and results of an IQ-test were linked to individual-level data from national registries. These national registers include records of each child’s school performance at the end of compulsory schooling, their health care utilisation, as well as their parents’ socio-economic status and health care utilisation. Results 10% of the children screen positive for MHP. The children with MHP achieve a significantly lower Grade Point Average on their exams, independently of their IQ-score, perinatal factors and parental characteristics. On average, the children with MHP also carry higher health care costs over a five-year follow-up period. The higher health care costs are only attributed to 23% of these children, while the remaining children with MHP also show poorer school performance but receive no additional health care. Conclusions The results demonstrate that children with MHP and a poor prognosis can be identified by the use of the brief standardised questionnaire SDQ combined with a screening algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2981337151,"The Early Celtic site of the Heuneburg (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany) has long been understood as a hallmark of early urbanization in Central Europe. The rich collection of Mediterranean imports recovered from the settlement, the elite burials in its surroundings and the Mediterranean-inspired mudbrick fortification wall further point to the importance of intercultural connections with the Mediterranean as a crucial factor in the transformation of Early Iron Age societies. We describe a new facet of this process by studying the transformation of consumption practices, especially drinking habits, brought about by intercultural encounters from the late 7th to the 5th century BC through the analysis of organic remains in 133 ceramic vessels found at the Heuneburg using Organic Residue Analysis (ORA). During the Ha D1 phase, fermented beverages, including Mediterranean grape wine, were identified in and appear to have been consumed from local handmade ceramics. The latter were recovered from different status-related contexts within the Heuneburg, suggesting an early and well-established trade/exchange system of this Mediterranean product. This contrasts with the results obtained for the drinking and serving vessels from the Ha D3 phase that were studied. The consumption of fermented beverages (wine and especially bacteriofermented products) appears to have been concentrated on the plateau. The ORA analyses presented here seem to indicate that during this time, grape wine was consumed primarily from imported vessels, and more rarely from local prestigious fine wheel-made vessels. In addition to imported wine, we demonstrate the consumption of a wide variety of foodstuffs, such as animal fats (especially dairy products), millet, plant oils and waxy plants, fruit and beehive products as well as one or several other fermented beverage(s) that were probably locally produced. Through this diachronic study of vessel function from different intra-site contexts, we inform on changing and status-related practices of food processing and consumption."

However, efficient in vivo delivery of RNA-based therapeutics remains a challenge. We have developed a delivery platform for RNA-based therapeutics by exploiting the physicochemical properties of enveloped viruses. By physically attaching cationic liposome/RNA complexes onto the viral envelope of vaccinia virus, we were able to deliver mRNA, self-replicating RNA as well as miRNA inside target cells.

https://openalex.org/W2981778575,"Background Half of under-5 deaths in South Africa occur at home, however the reasons remain poorly described and data on the care pathways during fatal childhood illness is limited. This study aimed to better describe care-seeking behavior in fatal childhood illness and to assess barriers to healthcare and modifiable factors that contribute to under-5 deaths in rural South Africa. Methods We conducted a social autopsy study on all under-5 deaths in two rural South African health and demographic surveillance system sites. Descriptive analyses based on the Pathways to Survival Framework were used to characterise how caregivers move through the stages of seeking and providing care for children during their final illness and to identify modifiable factors that contributed to death. Findings Of 53 deaths, 40% occurred outside health facilities. Rates of antenatal and perinatal preventative care-seeking were high: over 70% of mothers had tested for HIV, 93% received professional assistance during delivery and 79% of children were reportedly immunised appropriately for age. Of the 48 deaths tracked through the stages of the Pathways to Survival Framework, 10% died suddenly without any care, 23% received home care of whom 80% had signs of severe or possibly severe illness, and 85% sought or attempted to seek formal care outside the home. Although half of all children left the first facility alive, only 27% were referred for further care. Conclusions Modifiable factors for preventing deaths during a child’s final illness occur both inside and outside the home. The most important modifiable factors occurring inside the home relate to caregivers’ recognition of illness and appreciation of urgency in response to the severity of the child’s symptoms and signs. Outside the home, modifiable factors relate to inadequate referral and follow-up by health professionals. Further research should focus on identifying and overcoming barriers to referral."
https://openalex.org/W2981842273,"Physical exercise has a neuromodulatory effect on the central nervous system (CNS) partially by modifying expression of neuropeptides produced and secreted by neurons and glial cells, among which the best examined are brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Because both neurotrophins can cross the brain-blood barrier (BBB), their blood levels indirectly reflect their production in the CNS. Moreover, both neuropeptides are involved in modulation of dopaminergic and serotoninergic system function. Because limited information is available on the effects of exercise to volition exhaustion and acute hypoxia on CNS, BDNF and GDNF formation, the aims of the present study were to verify whether 1) acute exercise to exhaustion in addition to neurons also activates glial cells and 2) additional exposure to acute normobaric moderate hypoxia affects their function. In this feasibility study we measured blood concentrations of BDNF, GDNF, and neuropeptides considered as biomarkers of brain damage (bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP) in seven sedentary healthy young men who performed a graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer under normoxic (N) and hypoxic conditions: 2,000 m (H2; FiO2 = 16.6%) and 3,000 m altitude (H3; FiO2 = 14.7%). In all conditions serum concentrations of both BDNF and GDNF increased immediately after cessation of exercise (p<0.01). There was no effect of condition or interaction (condition x time of measurement) and exercise on any of the brain damage biomarkers: bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP. Moreover, in N (0<0.01) and H3 (p<0.05) exercise caused elevated serum 5-HT concentration. The results suggest that a graded effort to volitional exhaustion in normoxia, as well as hypoxia, simultaneously activates both neurons and astrocytes. Considering that s100B, GFAP, bFGF, and NGF (produced mainly by astrocytes) are markers of brain damage, it can be assumed that a maximum effort in both conditions is safe for the CNS."

Methods A population-based, quasi-experimental policy analysis was undertaken of the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion provision on or after January 1, 2014. The 2010–16 American Community Survey provided data on 3,874,432 Medicaid-eligible adults aged 19–64 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The outcome measures were no health insurance coverage and Medicaid coverage. The predictor variables were marital status and sex, with controls for family size, poverty status, race/ethnicity, education, employment status, immigration status, and metropolitan residence. Results In 2016, the uninsured rate for married men and women in a Medicaid expansion state was 21.2% and 17.1%, respectively, compared to 37.4% for married men and 35.8% for married women in a non-expansion state. The Medicaid coverage rate grew between 14.8% to 19.3% in Medicaid expansion states, which contrasts with less than a 5% growth in non-expansion states. Triple differences analysis suggests that, for women of all age groups, Medicaid expansion resulted in a 1.6 percentage point lower uninsured rate for married women compared to unmarried women. For men, there was not a statistically significant difference in the uninsured rate for married compared to unmarried men. For women of all age groups, there was a 2.6 percentage point higher Medicaid coverage rate for married compared to unmarried women. For men, there was a 1.8 percentage point higher Medicaid coverage rate for married compared to unmarried men. Conclusion Medicaid expansion under the ACA differentially lowered uninsurance and improved Medicaid coverage for married persons, especially married women, more than unmarried persons."

Their involvement in the development of portal vein thrombosis, frequent in decompensated liver cirrhosis, is still not investigated.Therefore, we used pro-thrombotic venous milieu generation by bare metal stent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion, to study the role of prostanoids in decompensated liver cirrhosis. Here, 89 patients receiving transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion were included in the study, and baseline levels of thromboxane B2, prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 were measured in the portal and the hepatic vein.While the hepatic vein contained higher levels of thromboxane B2 than the portal vein, levels of prostaglandin E2 and D2 were higher in the portal vein (all P<0.0001). Baseline concentrations of thromboxane B2 in the portal vein were independently associated with an increase of portal hepatic venous pressure gradient during short term follow-up, as an indirect sign of thrombogenic potential (multivariable P = 0.004). Moreover, severity of liver disease was inversely correlated with portal as well as hepatic vein levels of prostaglandin D2 and E2 (all P<0.0001).Elevated portal venous thromboxane B2 concentrations are possibly associated with the extent of thrombogenic potential in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03584204."

Herein we aimed to gain a better understanding of the professional profile of non-physician licensed therapists, focusing on acupuncture, osteopathy, and European naturopathy.This cross-sectional study was based on an online anonymous survey conducted from March to June 2017.All 1549 non-physician registered osteopaths, acupuncturists, and naturopaths in the French-speaking part of Switzerland were asked to complete the survey.We measured the therapists' demographics, training and practice characteristics, and workload.A total of 426 therapists returned the questionnaire (response rate: 27.5%). The mean age of the respondents was 46.0 years (SD 11.6) and most were women (67.8%). CM represented the main professional activity for a majority of therapists (82.8%), most of whom were independent (86.3%). The length and number of consultations per month varied across professions. Multivariate analysis showed that acupuncturists and naturopaths performed significantly fewer consults per month than osteopaths did. However, consultation length was significantly longer for acupuncturists and naturopaths than for osteopaths. Acupuncturists (71.6%) and naturopaths (64.4%) were significantly more favorable than osteopaths (27.7%) to have consultation costs covered by basic health insurance. Professional profiles differed between osteopaths, on the one hand, and naturopaths and acupuncturists, on the other, mainly regarding workload, treatment duration, and main reasons to consult.This first study to investigate a variety of therapist profiles in Switzerland provides useful information about their activities and role within the Swiss healthcare system. Although all three professions are encompassed under the same umbrella term (CM), our study showed that they have specific work cultures and areas of intervention in the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2981913153,"Background Robust Artificial-neural-networks for k-space Interpolation (RAKI) is a recently proposed deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithm for parallel imaging. Its main premise is to perform k-space interpolation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on subject-specific autocalibration signal (ACS) data. Since training is performed individually for each subject, the reconstruction time is longer than approaches that pre-train on databases. In this study, we sought to reduce the computational time of RAKI. Methods RAKI was implemented using CPU multi-processing and process pooling to maximize the utility of GPU resources. We also proposed an alternative CNN architecture that interpolates all output channels jointly for specific skipped k-space lines. This new architecture was compared to the original CNN architecture in RAKI, as well as to GRAPPA in phantom, brain and knee MRI datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results The optimized GPU implementations were approximately 2-to-5-fold faster than a simple GPU implementation. The new CNN architecture further improved the computational time by 4-to-5-fold compared to the optimized GPU implementation using the original RAKI CNN architecture. It also provided significant improvement over GRAPPA both visually and quantitatively, although it performed slightly worse than the original RAKI CNN architecture. Conclusions The proposed implementations of RAKI bring the computational time towards clinically acceptable ranges. The new CNN architecture yields faster training, albeit at a slight performance loss, which may be acceptable for faster visualization in some settings."
https://openalex.org/W2981913640,"Background It has been advocated that older adults should concomitantly spend less time in sedentary behaviour (SB), and engage in sufficient physical activity (PA), to reduce their risk of cardio-metabolic diseases. However, it is not clear what intensity of PA must be done to offset SB engagement. Aim Model how cardio-metabolic profiles could change if older adults replaced an hour per day (hr·day-1) of a physical behaviour intensity with 1 hr·day-1 of another physical behaviour of a different intensity. Methods Older adults (n = 93, 60–89 years old, 55% female) wore a thigh-mounted triaxial accelerometer for seven consecutive free-living days to estimate mean daily hourly engagement in SB, Standing, Light Intensity PA (LIPA), sporadic moderate to vigorous physical activity (sMVPA, bouts <10 continuous minutes), and 10-minute MVPA (10MVPA, bouts ≥10 continuous minutes. Fasting whole blood concentration of plasma glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and glycated haemoglobin (%), along with serum concentration of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procollagen III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP) were measured. Results Isotemporal Substitution, with covariate adjustment, suggested that: total cholesterol concentration could theoretically decrease when 1 hr·day-1 of SB is replaced with Standing, when 1 hr.day-1 of LIPA is replaced with Standing, and when 1 hr·day-1 of sMVPA is replaced with Standing. Triglyceride concentration theoretically decreased when 1 hr·day-1 of SB, Standing, LIPA, or sMVPA is replaced with 10MVPA. Triglyceride concentration theoretically increases when 1 hr·day-1 of 10MVPA is replaced with SB, Standing, or LIPA. No associations with time reallocation appears to exist for LPL, HbA1c, IL-6, and PIIINP. Conclusion The type of physical behaviour being replaced could be crucial for total cholesterol maintenance. Engagement in 10MVPA could be necessary to improve triglyceride concentration."

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, TORC1 is essential for vegetative growth, and its activity is regulated in response to nitrogen quantity and quality. Yet, how TORC1 senses nitrogen is poorly understood. Rapamycin, a specific TOR inhibitor, inhibits growth in S. pombe only under conditions in which the activity of TORC1 is compromised. In a genetic screen for rapamycin-sensitive mutations, we isolated caa1-1, a loss-of-function mutation of the cytosolic form of aspartate aminotransferase (Caa1). We demonstrate that loss of caa1+ partially mimics loss of TORC1 activity and that Caa1 is required for full TORC1 activity. Disruption of caa1+ resulted in aspartate auxotrophy, a finding that prompted us to assess the role of aspartate in TORC1 activation. We found that the amino acids glutamine, asparagine, arginine, aspartate, and serine activate TORC1 most efficiently following nitrogen starvation. The glutamine synthetase inhibitor l-methionine sulfoximine abolished the ability of asparagine, arginine, aspartate, or serine, but not that of glutamine, to induce TORC1 activity, consistent with a central role for glutamine in activating TORC1. Neither addition of aspartate nor addition of glutamine restored TORC1 activity in caa1-deleted cells or in cells carrying a Caa1 variant with a catalytic site substitution, suggesting that the catalytic activity of Caa1 is required for TORC1 activation.

Two TOR kinases are present in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Tor1 and Tor2.

TORC1 activity is sensitive to nutritional starvation. In particular, withdrawal of the glucose or nitrogen from the growth medium leads to de-activation of TORC1 in fission yeast (16Nakashima A. Otsubo Y. Yamashita A. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Tamanoi F. Psk1, an AGC kinase family member in fission yeast, is directly phosphorylated and controlled by TORC1 and functions as S6 kinase.J.

The direct signal mechanisms for the activation of TORC1 are as yet unknown; however, a large body of evidence suggests that the nitrogen source and amino acids (which may also serve as nitrogen source) play a key and conserved role in TORC1 activation (17González A. Hall M.N. Nutrient sensing and TOR signaling in yeast and mammals.EMBO J. 2017; 36 (10.15252/embj.201696010, 28096180): 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 18Kim J.

Nitrogen is an essential element required for synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and other cellular components. Yeast cells can sense, take up, and assimilate several sources of nitrogen. Studies in S. cerevisiae defined high quality nitrogen sources, such as glutamine, by their ability to promote rapid growth and suppress nitrogen-catabolite-repression (NCR) genes (19Cooper T.G. Transmitting the signal of excess nitrogen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the Tor proteins to the GATA factors: connecting the dots.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26 (10.1111/j.1574-6976.2002.tb00612.x, 12165425): 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fission yeast, withdrawal of the nitrogen source from the growth medium, or its replacement with a low quality source of nitrogen (for example, proline instead of ammonia), results in down-regulation of TORC1 activity. This is best manifested by a dramatic reduction in the phosphorylation of Psk1, the kinase that lies directly downstream to S. pombe TORC1 (orthologue to human p70 S6 kinase, or in short p70S6K), or reduction in the phosphorylation of the substrate of Psk1, the ribosomal proteins Rps601 and Rps602 (S6 in human) (16Nakashima A.

Nitrogen starvation is a strong cue for S. pombe cells to exit the cell cycle and enter the sexual development pathway.

S. pombe TORC1 is activated by two distinct, highly conserved guanosine triphosphate GTPases: Gtr (Rag in higher eukaryotes) and Rhb1 (Rheb in higher eukaryotes).

The AMPK kinase that plays a central role in cellular energy homeostasis activates TSC1-TSC2 to inhibit mTORC1 via the control of Rheb (31Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L.

Interestingly, rapamycin does not inhibit growth of WT S. pombe cells, indicating that under normal growth conditions, the essential function of TORC1 is resistant to rapamycin (35Weisman R.

However, rapamycin inhibits growth and induces nitrogen starvation responses when the general activity of TORC1 is reduced. Thus, for example, the growth of S. pombe cells becomes sensitive to rapamycin when the activity of tor2+ is reduced (13Hayashi T. Hatanaka M. Nagao K. Nakaseko Y. Kanoh J. Kokubu A. Ebe M.

Here we report the isolation of a loss of function mutation of caa1+, encoding the cytosolic isoform of aspartate aminotransferase, as a rapamycin-sensitive mutation. We demonstrate that Caa1 is required for full activation of TORC1. We discuss our findings in view of the roles of specific amino acids in TORC1 activation following nitrogen starvation. S. pombe TORC1 is essential for cell proliferation, yet rapamycin does not inhibit vegetative cell growth in this organism (35Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y.

Following their growth on nonselective plates, cells were replica plated to 0.1 μg/ml of rapamycin plates. A screen of 50,000 colonies led to the isolation of six rapamycin-sensitive (RS) mutants. Rapamycin sensitivity was confirmed by re-streaking each candidate on nutrient-rich (YE) or minimal (Edinburgh minimal medium) medium in the presence or absence of rapamycin. Here we describe the characterization of one of these mutants, RS42. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, the RS42 mutant strain was sensitive to rapamycin on nutrient-rich plates (YE), compared with the parental strain used for mutagenesis, TA16. When examined on minimal plates (EMM, ammonia used as a nitrogen source), RS42 failed to grow either in the presence or absence of rapamycin. The parental strain shows rapamycin sensitivity on EMM plates due to leucine auxotrophy and the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on leucine uptake, as was previously shown (38Weisman R. Roitburg I. Nahari T. Kupiec M. Regulation of leucine uptake by tor1+ in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is sensitive to rapamycin.Genetics. 2005; 169 (10.1534/genetics.104.034983, 15466417): 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The RS42 strain was crossed with the auxotrophic, but the otherwise, WT strain TA2. Tetrad analysis of diploid cells resulting from the cross of TA2 and RS42 revealed a 2:2 segregation of small versus normal-sized colonies (Fig. 1B). The small colonies were rapamycin-sensitive, whereas the large colonies were rapamycin-resistant (data not shown), indicating that the rapamycin-sensitive phenotype depends on a single mutation and co-segregates with the small-sized colony phenotype. To identify the mutation that confers rapamycin sensitivity in RS42, RS42 cells were transformed with the S. pombe Norbury pREP3X-cDNA library and plated onto minimal medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml of rapamycin. Following incubation of 5 days at 30 °C, six of 28,000 transformants formed colonies on the selective conditions. DNA sequencing of plasmids recovered from these cells showed that they all contained the SPAC10F6.13c gene, a predicted aspartate aminotransferase that shows high similarity with AAT2, the S. cerevisiae cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase gene (YLR027C). We named the SPAC10F6.13c gene caa1+, for cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase. The aspartate aminotransferase enzyme catalyzes the reversible transfer of the amino group from l-aspartate to 2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) to form oxaloacetate and l-glutamate (Fig. 1C). It plays a critical role in the metabolism of both carbon and nitrogen in all organisms (39Cronin V.B. Maras B. Barra D. Doonan S. The amino acid sequence of the aspartate aminotransferase from baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).Biochem.

DNA sequencing of the caa1+ gene in the RS42 mutant revealed the presence of a mutation in nucleotide number 76 that results in a stop codon close to the N-terminal region of the gene; hereafter this mutation is referred to as caa1-1. S. cerevisiae strains lacking AAT2 are viable in rich medium, but require aspartate in minimal medium (41Verleur N. Elgersma Y. Van Roermund C.W.T. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2982166036,"Bridges in America are aging and deteriorating, causing substantial financial strain on federal resources and tax payers' money. Of the various deterioration issues in bridges, one of the most common and costly is malfunctioning of expansion joints, connecting two bridge spans, due to accumulation of debris and dirt in the joint. Although expansion joints are small components of bridges' superstructure, their malfunction can result in major structural problems and when coupled with thermal stresses, the demand on the structural elements could be further amplified. Intuitively, these additional demands are expected to even worsen if one considers potential future temperature rise due to climate change. Indeed, it has been speculated that climate change is likely to have negative effect on bridges worldwide. However, to date there has been no serious attempts to quantify this effect on a larger spatial scale with no studies pertaining to the integrity of the main load carrying girders. In this study, we attempt to quantify the effect of clogged joints and climate change on failure of the superstructure of a class of steel bridges around the U.S. We surprisingly find that potentially most of the main load carrying girders, in the analyzed bridges, could reach their ultimate capacity when subjected to service load and future climate changes. We further discover that out of nine U.S. regions, the most vulnerable bridges, in a descending order, are those located in the Northern Rockies & Plains, Northwest and Upper Midwest. Ultimately, this study proposes an approach to establish a priority order of bridge maintenance and repair to manage limited funding among a vast inventory in an era of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2982198353,"Limestone karsts can form terrestrial habitat islands for calcium-dependent organisms. In Vietnam, many karst habitats are threatened, while their rich biodiversity is still far from being thoroughly explored. Given that conservation of karst biota strongly relies on correct species identification, the presence of undetected cryptic species can pose severe problems. The present study focuses on cryptic diversity among karst-inhabiting land snails of the genus Cyclophorus in northern Vietnam, where specimens with a similar shell morphology have been reported from various regions. In order to examine the diversity and evolutionary history of this ""widespread morphotype"", we generated a Bayesian phylogeny based on DNA sequence data. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and the Bayesian implementation of the Poisson tree processes model (bPTP) contributed to species delimitation and analyses of shell shape and size aided the morphological characterisation of individual species. We found that the examined specimens of the widespread morphotype did not form a single monophyletic group in the phylogeny but clustered into several different clades. We delimited nine different species that develop the widespread morphotype and described four of them as new. Processes of convergent evolution were probably involved in the origin of the delimited species, while their generally allopatric distribution could result from interspecific competition. Our findings indicate ongoing processes of speciation and a potential case of morphological character displacement. The high degree of morphological overlap found among the species underlines the importance of DNA sequence data for species delimitation and description in the genus Cyclophorus. Given the findings of the present study and the high potential that as yet undiscovered cryptic taxa have also evolved in other groups of karst-inhabiting organisms, we argue for a systematic and efficient detection and description of Vietnam's karst biodiversity to provide a solid basis for future conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W2982213141,"Theory predicts that individuals behave altruistically towards their relatives. Hence, some form of kin recognition is useful for individuals to optimize their behavior. In species that display bi-parental care and are subject to extra-pair matings, kin recognition theoretically can allow cuckolded fathers to reduce their parental investment, and thus optimize their fitness. Whether this is possible remains unclear in birds. This study investigates whether males provide differential parental care depending on relatedness, as a proxy to recognizing chicks in their nest as kin or not. We cross-fostered House sparrow (Passer domesticus) chicks after hatching, and then expected that fathers would show a decrease in their parental efforts when tending to a clutch of unrelated offspring. House sparrow males are able to adjust their parental care to the identity of their partner, making them an ideal study species. However, there was no significant effect of relatedness on provisioning rates. This suggests that sparrows may not be capable of kin recognition, or at least do not display kin discrimination despite its apparent evolutionary advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2981447177,"To investigate morphological characteristics and generation mechanism of the machined gears surface, image characteristics of machined surface morphology including profile roughness, fractal and textural characteristics were studied. the change of profile curves for the surface image is subject to the normal probability density function and the W-M function. The orientation angle of surface texture is 0°, the surface profile curves are the smoothest and have the most uniform, regular textures. When the texture orientation is 45° or 135°, the surface profile curves show large fluctuations, while surface image textures present the deepest grooves and are shown to be distributed most irregularly. Additionally, the influence mechanism of different grinding parameters on the morphological characteristics of machined surface was investigated. The quality of machined surfaces increased with the grinding speed while deteriorated with increasing radial, or axial, feed speeds."
https://openalex.org/W2981355618,"Red blood cells (RBCs) undergo irreversible biochemical and morphological changes during storage, contributing to the hemorheological changes of stored RBCs, which causes deterioration of microvascular perfusion in vivo. In this study, a home-built optofluidic system for laser speckle imaging of flowing stored RBCs through a transparent microfluidic channel was employed. The speckle decorrelation time (SDT) provides a quantitative measure of RBC changes, including aggregation in the microchannel. The SDT and relative light transmission intensity of the stored RBCs were monitored for 42 days. In addition, correlations between the decorrelation time, RBC flow speed through the channel, and relative light transmission intensity were obtained. The SDT of stored RBCs increased as the storage duration increased. The SDTs of the RBCs stored for 21 days did not significantly change. However, for the RBCs stored for over 35 days, the SDT increased significantly from 1.26 ± 0.27 ms to 6.12 ± 1.98 ms. In addition, we measured the relative light transmission intensity and RBC flow speed. As the RBC storage time increased, the relative light transmission intensity increased, whereas the RBC flow speed decreased in the microchannel. The optofluidic laser speckle image decorrelation time provides a quantitative measure of assessing the RBC condition during storage. Laser speckle image decorrelation analysis may serve as a convenient assay to monitor the property changes of stored RBCs."

https://openalex.org/W2982001980,"Short term funding is a common funding model for informatics projects. Funders are interested in maximizing the sustainability and accessibility of the outputs, but there are no commonly accepted practices to do so in the Earth sciences informatics field. We constructed and applied a framework for sustainability drawing from other disciplines that have more published work focusing on sustainability of projects. This framework had seven sustainability influences (outputs modified, code repository used, champion present, workforce stability, support from other organizations, collaboration/partnership, and integration with policy), and three ways of defining sustainability (at the individual-, organization-, and community-level). Using this framework, we evaluated outputs of projects funded by the U.S. Geological Survey's Community for Data Integration (CDI). We found that the various outputs are widely accessible, but not necessarily sustained or maintained. Projects with most sustainability influences often became institutionalized and met required needs of the community. Even if proposed outputs were not delivered or sustained, knowledge of lessons learned could be spread to build community capacity in a topic, which is another type of sustainability. We conclude by summarizing lessons for individuals applying for short-term funding, and for organizations managing programs that provide such funding, for maximizing sustainability of project outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2982079252,"As people spend more and more time inside, the quality of indoor air becomes crucial matter. This study explores the germicidal potential of two dark-operating germicidal composite materials designed to be applied for the indoor air disinfection under flow conditions. The first material, MnO2/AlPO4/γ-Al2O3 beads, is a donor-acceptor interactive composite capable of creating hydroxyl radicals HO∙. The second one is a ZnO/γ-Al2O3 material with intercropped hexagons on its surface. To determine the antimicrobial efficiency of these materials in life-like conditions, a pilot device was constructed that allows the test of the materials in dynamic conditions and agar diffusion inhibitory tests were also conducted. The results of the tests showed that the MnO2/AlPO4/γ-Al2O3 material has a germicidal effect in static conditions whereas ZnO/γ-Al2O3 does not. In dynamic conditions, the oxidizing MnO2/AlPO4/γ-Al2O3 material is the most efficient when using low air speed whereas the ZnO/γ-Al2O3 one becomes more efficient than the other materials when increasing the air linear speed. This ZnO/γ-Al2O3 dark-operating germicidal material manifests the ability to proceed the mechanical destruction of bacterial cells. Actually, the antimicrobial efficiency of materials in dynamic conditions varies regarding the air speed through the materials and that static tests are not representative of the behavior of the material for air disinfection. Depending on the conditions, the best strategy to inactivate microorganisms changes and abrasive structures are a field that needs further exploration as they are in most of the conditions tested the best way to quickly decrease the number of microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2981518820,"Increased African-American research participation is critical to the applicability and generalizability of biomedical research, as population diversity continues to increase both domestically and abroad. Yet numerous studies document historical origins of mistrust, as well as other barriers that may contribute to resistance in the African-American community towards participation in biomedical research. However, a growing body of more recent scientific evidence suggests that African-Americans value research and are willing to participate when asked. In the present study, we set out to determine factors associated with research participation of African-American families in postmortem human brain tissue donation for neuropsychiatric disorders as compared with Caucasian families, from same-day medical examiner autopsy referrals. We retrospectively reviewed brain donation rates, as well as demographic and clinical factors associated with donation in 1,421 consecutive referrals to three medical examiner's offices from 2010-2015. Overall, 69.7% of all next-of-kin contacted agreed to brain donation. While Caucasian families consented to donate brain tissue at a significantly higher rate (74.1%) than African-American families (57.0%) (p<0.001), African-American brain donation rates were as high as 60.5% in referrals from Maryland. Neither African-American nor Caucasian donors differed significantly from non-donors on any demographic or clinical factors ascertained, including age, sex, diagnosis of the donor, or in the relationship of the next-of-kin being contacted (p>0.05). However, Caucasian donors were significantly older, had more years of education, were more likely to be referred for study due to a psychiatric diagnosis, more likely to have comorbid substance abuse, and more likely to have died via suicide, as compared with African-American donors (p<0.05). When African-American participants are identified and approached, African-American families as well as Caucasian families are indeed willing to donate brain tissue on the spot for neuropsychiatric research, which supports the belief that African-American attitudes towards biomedical research may be more favorable than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2981777837,"Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is more common in women who have had pregnancy complications such as spontaneous pregnancy loss. We used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank Imaging Enhancement Study to determine whether pregnancy loss is associated with cardiac or vascular remodelling in later life, which might contribute to this increased risk. Methods Pregnancy history was reported by women participating in UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 at age 40–69 years using a self-completed touch-screen questionnaire. Associations between self-reported spontaneous pregnancy loss and cardiovascular measures, collected in women who participated in the Imaging Enhancement Study up to the end of 2015, were examined. Cardiac structure and function were assessed by magnetic resonance (CMR) steady-state free precession imaging at 1.5 Tesla. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurements were taken for both common carotid arteries using a CardioHealth Station. Statistical associations with CMR and carotid measures were adjusted for age, BMI and other cardiovascular risk factors. Results Data were available on 2660 women of whom 111 were excluded because of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and 30 had no pregnancy information available. Of the remaining 2519, 446 were nulligravid and 2073 had a history of pregnancies, of whom 622 reported at least one pregnancy loss (92% miscarriages and 8% stillbirths) and 1451 reported no pregnancy loss. No significant differences in any cardiac or carotid parameters were evident in women who reported pregnancy loss compared to other groups (Table 1). Conclusion Women who self-report pregnancy loss do not have significant differences in cardiac structure, cardiac function, or carotid structure in later life to explain their increased cardiovascular risk. This suggests any cardiovascular risks associated with pregnancy loss operate through other disease mechanisms. Alternatively, other characteristics of pregnancy loss, which we were not able to take account of, such as timing and number of pregnancy losses may be required to identify those at greatest cardiovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W2982074107,"The development of sequencing technologies has enabled the discovery of markers that are abundantly distributed over the whole genome. Knowledge about the marker locations in reference genomes provides further insights in the search for causal regions and the prediction of genomic values. The present study proposes a Bayesian functional approach for incorporating the marker locations into genomic analysis using stochastic methods to search causal regions and predict genotypic values. For this, three scenarios were analyzed: F2 population with 300 individuals and three different heritability levels (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), along with 12,150 SNP markers that were distributed through ten linkage groups; F∞ populations with 320 individuals and three different heritability levels (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), along with 10,020 SNP markers that were distributed through ten linkage groups; and data related to Eucalyptus spp. to measure the model performance in a real LD setting, with 611 individuals whose phenotypes were simulated from QTLs distributed through a panel of 36,812 SNPs with known positions. The performance of the proposed method was compared with those of other genome selection models, namely, RR-BLUP, Bayes B and Bayesian Lasso. The Bayesian functional model presented higher or similar predictive ability when compared with those classical regressions methods in simulated and real scenarios on different LD structures. In general, the Bayesian functional model also achieved higher computational efficiency, using 12 SNPs per MCMC round. The model was efficient in the identification of causal regions and showed high flexibility of analysis, as it is easily adaptable to any genomic selection model."
https://openalex.org/W2981476830,"The parental allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes has been evolutionarily well conserved, although its functional constraints and associated mechanisms are not fully understood. In the current study, we generated a mouse mutant with switched active alleles driving the switch from paternal-to-maternal expression for Peg3 and the maternal-to-paternal expression for Zim1. The expression levels of Peg3 and Zim1, but not the spatial expression patterns, within the brain showed clear differences between wild type and mutant animals. We identified putative enhancers localized upstream of Peg3 that displayed allele-biased DNA methylation, and that also participate in allele-biased chromosomal conformations with regional promoters. Most importantly, these data suggest for the first time that long-distance enhancers may contribute to allelic expression within imprinted domains through allele-biased interactions with regional promoters."

Patients with a diagnosis of SNHL was enrolled in the study group after exclusion and a propensity score matched group without SNHL was served as the control group with a 1:2 ratio. The main outcome was regarded as the emergence of AMD diagnostic codes. Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to analyze the incidence and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of AMD in the multivariate model. A total of 15,686 patients with SNHL were included in the study group while another 31,372 non-SNHL patients served as the control group. After a follow-up interval up to 16 years, there were 484 AMD events occurred in the study group and 660 AMD cases in those non-SNHL patients with a significantly higher aHR compared to the control group after adjusting for multiple potential risk factors (aHR: 1.399, 95% CI: 1.244-1.574). Other prominent risk factors for AMD included older age, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, Alzheimer's disease, liver disease and kidney disease. Besides, a higher cumulative probability of AMD was observed in the study group (log-rank P <0.0001).The patients with SNHL demonstrated a higher incidence of developing AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2981814796,"There has been strong interest in the role of metals in neurodegeneration, and how ageing may predispose the brain to related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Recent work has also highlighted a potential interaction between different metal species and various components of the cytoskeletal network in the brain, which themselves have a reported role in age-related degenerative disease and other neurological disorders. Neurofilaments are one such class of intermediate filament protein that have a demonstrated capacity to bind and utilise cation species. In this study, we investigated the consequences of altering the neurofilamentous network on metal ion homeostasis by examining neurofilament light (NFL) gene knockout mice, relative to wildtype control animals, at adulthood (5 months of age) and advanced age (22 months). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy demonstrated that the concentrations of iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) varied across brain regions and peripheral nerve samples. Zn and Fe showed statistically significant interactions between genotype and age, as well as between genotype and region, and Cu demonstrated a genotype and region interaction. The most substantial difference between genotypes was found in Fe in the older animals, where, across many regions examined, there was elevated Fe in the NFL knockout mice. This data indicates a potential relationship between the neurofilamentous cytoskeleton and the processing and/or storage of Fe through ageing."

While the semantic coherence of such texts should not be over-estimated, the grammatical correctness and stylistic qualities of these artificial texts are at times remarkably convincing. In this paper, we report a study into crowd-sourced authenticity judgments for such artificially generated texts. As a case study, we have turned to rap lyrics, an established sub-genre of present-day popular music, known for its explicit content and unique rhythmical delivery of lyrics. The empirical basis of our study is an experiment carried out in the context of a large, mainstream contemporary music festival in the Netherlands. Apart from more generic factors, we model a diverse set of linguistic characteristics of the input that might have functioned as authenticity cues. It is shown that participants are only marginally capable of distinguishing between authentic and generated materials. By scrutinizing the linguistic features that influence the participants' authenticity judgments, it is shown that linguistic properties such as 'syntactic complexity', 'lexical diversity' and 'rhyme density' add to the user's perception of texts being authentic. This research contributes to the improvement of the quality and credibility of generated text. Additionally, it enhances our understanding of the perception of authentic and artificial art."
