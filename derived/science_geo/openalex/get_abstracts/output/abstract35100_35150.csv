https://openalex.org/W2066980099,"The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, Rb, is suspected to suppress cell growth. Rb is a 110-114 kd nuclear phosphoprotein. We have previously demonstrated that SV40 T antigen binds only to unphosphorylated Rb, and not pp112-114Rb, the family of phosphorylated Rb. Here we demonstrate the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Rb. In G0/G1 cells, virtually all the Rb is unphosphorylated. In contrast, during S and G2, it is largely, if not exclusively, phosphorylated. Rb phosphorylation occurs at the G1/S boundary in several cell types tested. A 14 residue peptide, corresponding to the SV40 T domain required for transformation, is able to compete effectively with SV40 T for binding to p110Rb. We propose a model to explain how Rb may suppress cell growth by acting as a cell cycle regulatory element."
https://openalex.org/W1499310995,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the todC1C2BADE genes which encode the first three enzymes in the catabolism of toluene by Pseudomonas putida F1 was determined. The genes encode the three components of the toluene dioxygenase enzyme system: reductaseTOL (todA), ferredoxinTOL (todB), and the two subunits of the terminal dioxygenase (todC1C2); (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (todD); and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE). Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the tod genes was used to construct clones of Escherichia coli JM109 that overproduce toluene dioxygenase (JM109(pDT-601]; toluene dioxygenase and (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase (JM109(pDTG602]; and toluene dioxygenase, (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase, and 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (JM109(pDTG603]. The overexpression of the tod-C1C2BADE gene products was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The three E. coli JM109 strains harboring the plasmids pDTG601, pDTG602, and pDTG603, after induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, oxidized toluene to (+)-cis-(1S, 2R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene, 3-methylcatechol, and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoate, respectively. The tod-C1C2BAD genes show significant homology to the reported nucleotide sequence for benzene dioxygenase and cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase from P. putida 136R-3 (Irie, S., Doi, S., Yorifuji, T., Takagi, M., and Yano, K. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 5174-5179). In addition, significant homology was observed between the nucleotide sequences for the todDE genes and the sequences reported for cis-1,2-dihydroxy-6-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene dehydrogenase and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (Furukawa, K., Arimura, N., and Miyazaki, T. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 427-429)."
https://openalex.org/W2092017548,"Depletion of the essential poly(A) binding protein (PAB) in S. cerevisiae by promoter inactivation or by the utilization of a temperature-sensitive mutation (pab1-F364L) results in the inhibition of translation initiation and poly(A) tail shortening. Reversion analysis of pab1-F364L yielded seven independent, extragenic cold-sensitive mutations (spb1-spb7) that also suppress a PAB1 deletion. These mutations allow translation initiation without significantly changing poly(A) tail lengths in the absence of PAB, and they affect the amount of 60S ribosomal subunit. Consistent with this, SPB2 encodes the ribosomal protein L46. These data suggest that the 60S subunit mediates the PAB requirement of translation initiation, thereby ensuring that only intact poly(A)+ mRNA will be translated efficiently in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2013548303,"While there is convincing evidence implicating Drosophila int-1 in pattern regulation, the normal role of int-1 in vertebrate development is unclear. We have injected Xenopus eggs with mouse int-1 RNA and monitored subsequent development. Injected RNA is translated and the protein widely distributed. Embryos develop into apparently normal gastrulae, but almost all surviving neurulae have a bifurcated anterior and expanded posterior neural plate. Bifurcation of the neural plate was abolished by substitution of a single, conserved cysteine residue and was dependent on the presence of a signal peptide sequence in the int-1 protein. Histological examination indicates that underlying axial mesodermal structures were duplicated. This result suggests that ectopic int-1 expression leads to dual axis formation and points to a role for int-1 in patterning processes in vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W2103345065,"The phbC gene encoding the third enzyme of the poly-β-hydroxybutyrate biosynthetic pathway, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate polymerase, in Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 has been identified by the complementation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate negative mutants of A. eutrophus H16. These results demonstrate that the three enzymes of the poly-β-hydroxybutyrate biosynthetic pathway are organized phbC-phbA-phbB. Expression of all three genes in Escherichia coli results in a significant level (50% dry cell weight) of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate production. phbC encodes a polypeptide of Mr = 63,900 which has a hydropathy profile distinct from typical membrane proteins indicating that poly-β-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis probably does not involve a membrane complex."
https://openalex.org/W1548437752,"Abstract Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by vascular endothelial cells. We have cloned the whole length of the human preproendothelin-1 (PPET-1) gene and the corresponding cDNA and determined the complete nucleotide sequences. The 2026-nucleotide human mRNA for PPET-1 (excluding the polY(A) tail) is encoded in five exons distributed over 6836 base pairs of the genome. The 5'-flanking region of the gene contains (i) octanucleotide sequences for the phorbol ester-responsive elements, also known as the binding elements for FOS.JUN complex; (ii) consensus motifs for the binding site of nuclear factor 1, which may mediate the induction described previously of PPET-1 mRNA by transforming growth factor-beta; (iii) hexanucleotide sequences for the acute phase reactant regulatory elements that may be involved in the induction of endothelin-1 under acute physical stress in vivo. Further, the 3'-nontranslated sequence of human PPET-1 mRNA contains three AUUUA motifs, which may mediate selective translation-dependent destabilization of the mRNA. Northern blot analysis in cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins shows that PPET-1 mRNA is in fact rapidly induced by the active phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate within 10 min. Analysis of mRNA life span by using actinomycin D demonstrates that PPET-1 mRNA has a short intracellular half-life of about 15 min and is superinduced by cycloheximide. This superinduction is found to be due to the stabilization of the mRNA by cycloheximide, as in the case of other known AUUUA-containing mRNAs. These findings suggest that the regulation of expression of PPET-1 mRNA may be mediated in part by these sequence elements."
https://openalex.org/W2015464447,"The messenger RNAs specifying certain proteins involved in the inflammatory response and certain oncoproteins contain a conserved UA-rich sequence in the 3′ untranslated region. This sequence, which is composed of several interspersed repeats of the octanucleotide UUAUUUAU, has been shown to destabilize mRNA in some eukaryotes. However, this effect is not seen when mRNAs are transferred to Xenopus oocytes, which made it possible to separate stability from translational regulation. For interferon, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and c-fos RNAs, the UA-rich sequence was observed to preclude mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W1995282093,"Endothelial cells and activated platelets express integrin-type receptors responsible for adhesion to fibrinogen. We have located distinct integrin-directed endothelial cell and platelet attachment sites on immobilized fibrinogen using a combination of synthetic peptides, fibrinogen fragments, and specific anti-peptide monoclonal antibodies. Endothelial cells exclusively recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp-containing site near the C-terminus of the α chain (α residues 572–574) but fail to recognize the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence in the N-terminal region of the same chain (α residues 95–97). In contrast, platelets do not require either Arg-Gly-Asp sequence for binding to intact fibrinogen and are capable of recognizing, in addition to the α 572–574 sequence, a site at the C-terminus of the γ chain (γ residues 400–411). These data suggest a molecular mechanism whereby platelets and endothelial cells interact with distinct sites on the fibrinogen molecule during hemostasis and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1529218396,"Abstract The poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate biosynthetic thiolase gene from Zoogloea ramigera was used as a hybridization probe to screen restriction digests of Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 DNA. Specific hybridization signals were obtained and two fragments (a 2.3-kilobase PstI fragment and a 15-kilobase EcoRI fragment) cloned in the Escherichia coli vector pUC8 (plasmids pAeT3/pAeT10 and pAeT29, respectively). Biochemical analysis of lysates of E. coli cells containing each plasmid identified significant levels of beta-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase enzyme activities in lysates of E. coli cells containing plasmids pAeT10 or pAeT29. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the pAeT10 insert identified two open reading frames which encode polypeptides of Mr = 40,500 and Mr = 26,300 corresponding to the structural genes for beta-ketothiolase (phbA) and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phbB), respectively. Amino acid sequence homologies between the two bacterial and two mammalian thiolases are discussed with respect to the chain length specificity exhibited by the different thiolase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2018419028,"Calmodulin is implicated as the primary transducer of the calcium signal in pancreatic beta cells, where it is present at very high concentrations. We have produced three lines of transgenic mice carrying a calmodulin minigene regulated by the rat insulin II promoter. Immunohistochemistry and hybridization analyses indicated a 5-fold increase in the content of calmodulin and its mRNA in beta cells. Transgenic mice developed severe diabetes within hours of birth. The diabetes was progressive and characterized by elevated blood glucose and glucagon that coincided with reduced serum and pancreatic insulin. The disease appears to have both secretory and cell destruction components. beta Cell pathology was evident in the diabetic neonate but not in the fetus, suggesting that the early onset of diabetes exacerbated possible toxic effects of excess calmodulin. These animals provide a new diabetes model to evaluate how abnormal calcium homeostasis alters the carefully programmed secretory activity and development of the beta cell."
https://openalex.org/W1494025494,"Abstract The expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene and the phosphorylation of the GR protein has been studied as a function of time after hormone addition to NIH 3T3 cells. We detected a ligand-induced decrease of GR gene expression at both the level of RNA and protein. GR mRNA declined to 25% of the control within 3 h of dexamethasone treatment and remained at this level for at least 24 h. GR protein was analyzed with a monospecific antiserum directed against the DNA- and hormone-binding domains of the rat GR synthesized in Escherichia coli. Pulse-chase experiments revealed a decrease in GR half-life from 8 h in the absence of hormone to 3 h following hormone treatment. Both effects resulted in a reduction of total GR protein to 20% as determined by quantitative immunoblotting. The level of the GR protein returned to that of untreated cells within 24 h after withdrawal of hormone. Furthermore, dexamethasone treatment led to a 3-4-fold increase in GR phosphorylation within 60 min. The glucocorticoid antagonist 17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-17 alpha-(1-propynyl)-oestra-4,9-dien-3-one (RU 486) did not change the phosphorylation state of the receptor, but a down-regulation of the GR was still observed. These results suggest that ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation is not involved in down-regulation of the GR but may be important in the transcriptional activation of hormone responsive genes."

https://openalex.org/W2095577460,"The nuclear NAC2 locus of C. reinhardtii encodes a trans-acting factor that confers stability on the chloroplast message for the D2 protein of photosystem II (PS II). A mutant that carries a lesion in the NAC2 gene is unable to accumulate the psbD transcript encoding D2, but synthesizes all other PS II proteins normally. However, the PS II complex is completely unstable in the nac2–26 mutant, and all major PS II polypeptides, including the three oxygen-evolving enhancing proteins, are absent or greatly reduced in this strain because of posttranslational degradation. In C. reinhardtii the second exon of the trans-spliced psaA mRNA is cotranscribed with psbD (Choquet et al., 1988), but the nac2–26 mutation normally has no effect on psaA message maturation or stability. However, in double mutants carrying the nac2–26 mutation, as well as a mutation that prevents psaA splicing, splicing intermediates carrying psbD sequences are degraded. These results suggest that the NAC2 gene product acts in a very specific manner to control the half-life of psbD transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2065164093,"During T cell development, the processes of selection and tolerance act on the universe of expressed T cell receptors in the thymic cortex to form the repertoire of mature T cells that will respond to foreign antigen in the context of self-MHC in that animal. We have subdivided the cortical thymocytes into three functionally distinct populations: one population which is antigen-receptor negative, a second population which is antigen-receptor positive and is resistant to deletion by signaling through the antigen receptor, and a third population which is also antigen-receptor positive but is sensitive to deletion. These results have implications for the cellular compartments in which positive and negative selection occur and for the biochemical mechanisms that mediate selection and tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2005039766,"We have investigated the interaction between BglF and BglG, two proteins that regulate expression of the E. coli bgl operon. BglF is both a negative regulator of operon expression and a phosphotransferase involved in uptake of beta-glucosides. BglG is a positive regulator that functions as a transcriptional antiterminator. We show here that BglF is phosphorylated by the soluble components of the phosphotransferase system: Enzyme I, HPr, and the phosphate donor phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphorylated BglF can then transfer phosphate either to beta-glucosides or to wild-type BglG. Mutant BglG derivatives, which give constitutive expression of the bgl operon, show little or no phosphorylation by BglF. Hence BglF exerts its negative effect on operon expression by phosphorylating BglG, blocking its action as an antiterminator. BglG is dephosphorylated only in the presence of both BglF and beta-glucosides. Based on these results, we propose the following mechanism: In the absence of beta-glucosides, BglG is phosphorylated by BglF and is inactive in antitermination. Addition of inducer stimulates BglF to dephosphorylate BglG, allowing BglG to function as a positive regulator of operon expression. Beta-Glucosides are then phosphorylated and transported into the cell by BglF."
https://openalex.org/W1601712487,"Mini-F plasmid has the trans-acting genes sopA and sopB and the cis-acting site sopC which are essential for accurate partitioning of plasmid DNA molecules into both daughter cells. In this study, we purified independently SopA and SopB proteins, analyzed the in vitro DNA-binding activity of these proteins by the gel retardation assay, and determined the precise binding sites of DNA by the footprinting method. SopA binds to four repeated sequences (CTTTGC) located in the promoter-operator region of the sopAB operon. The SopA binding activity is enhanced by the addition of SopB protein. SopB protein itself does not bind to this DNA region. These results suggest that the complex of SopA and SopB proteins autoregulate the expression of the sopA-sopB operon. On the other hand, SopB protein binds to the sopC region, in which 12 direct repeats of 43-base pairs nucleotides exist. SopB protein recognizes the inverted repeats of 7 base pairs in each direct repeats. SopA protein does not affect the SopB binding activity to the sopC DNA segment."
https://openalex.org/W2047577950,"The expression of the late genes in bacteriophage T4 development is closely connected to viral DNA replication. Three T4-encoded DNA polymerase accessory proteins are shown to stimulate transcription at T4 late promoters in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis-requiring process. The properties of the activation resemble those found for enhancers of eukaryotic transcription. However, the nature of the enhancer of T4 late transcription is novel in that it is a structure--a break in the nontranscribed DNA stand--to which the three replication proteins bind, rather than a sequence. Since the three DNA polymerase accessory proteins are carried on the moving replication fork as part of the replisome, we postulate that viral DNA replication forks act, in vivo, as the mobile enhancers of T4 late gene transcription. Whereas Escherichia coli RNA polymerase bearing the T4 gene 55 protein can selectively recognize T4 late promoters, it is only capable of responding to the transcription-enhancing activity of the three replication proteins on acquiring an additional T4-specific modification."
https://openalex.org/W2067411028,"A hybrid Fv fragment of the dinitrophenyl-binding immunoglobulin A (IgA), MPOC315, has been generated by reconstituting a recombinant variable light chain (VL) produced in Escherichia coli with a variable heavy chain (VH) derived from the antibody. The Tyr34 residue of VL was substituted by His in order to introduce a catalytic imidazole into the combining site for the ester hydrolysis. The His mutant Fv accelerated the hydrolysis of the 7-hydroxycoumarin ester of 5-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-aminopentanoic acid 90,000-fold compared to the reaction with 4-methyl imidazole at pH 6.8 and had an initial rate that was 45 times as great as that for the wild-type Fv. The hydrolyses of aminopropanoic and aminohexanoic homologs were not significantly accelerated. Thus a single deliberate amino acid change can introduce significant catalytic activity into an antibody-combining site, and chemical modification data can be used to locate potential sites for the introduction of catalytic residues."
https://openalex.org/W1589331383,"The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (LHCP) is synthesized in the cytosol as a precursor (pLHCP) that is imported into chloroplasts and assembled into thylakoid membranes. Under appropriate conditions, either pLHCP or LHCP will integrate into isolated thylakoids. We have identified two situations that inhibit integration in this assay. Ionophores and uncouplers inhibited integration up to 70%. Carboxyl-terminal truncations of pLHCP also interfered with integration. A 22-residue truncation reduced integration to about 25% of control, whereas a 93 residue truncation completely abolished it. When pLHCP was imported into chloroplasts in the presence of uncouplers or when truncated forms of pLHCP were used, significant amounts of the imported proteins failed to insert into thylakoids and instead accumulated in the aqueous stroma. Accumulation of stromal LHCP occurred at uncoupler concentrations required to dissipate the trans-thylakoid proton electrochemical gradient and was enhanced at reduced levels of ATP. The latter effect may be a secondary consequence of a reduction in ATP-dependent degradation within the stroma. These results indicate that the stroma is an intermediate location in the LHCP assembly pathway and provide the first evidence for a soluble intermediate during biogenesis of a chloroplast membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W2051352904,"Structural abnormalities of the c-abl proto-oncogene are found in hematopoietic cells of more than 90 percent of individuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Therefore c-abl may be important in normal as well as malignant hematopoiesis. Normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells were exposed to three different c-abl sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, and the effects on myeloid and erythroid colony formation were examined. The c-abl antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited myeloid, but not erythroid, colony formation. The c-abl sense oligodeoxynucleotides and bcr sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were not inhibitory in this assay. These data show that c-abl is critical in normal myelopoiesis and may explain the relatively selective expansion of leukocytes in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1836240501,"Abstract Investigation of the role of the polypeptide chain elongation factor 3 (EF-3) of yeast indicates that EF-3 participates in the elongation cycle by stimulating the function of EF-1 alpha in binding aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the ribosome. In the yeast system, the binding of the ternary complex of EF-1 alpha.GTP.aa-tRNA to the ribosome is stoichiometric to the amount of EF-1 alpha. In the presence of EF-3, EF-1 alpha functions catalytically in the above mentioned reaction. The EF-3 effect is manifest in the presence of ATP, GTP, or ITP. A nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP does not replace ATP in this reaction, indicating a role of ATP hydrolysis in EF-3 function. The stimulatory effect of EF-3 is, in many respects, distinct from that of EF-1 beta. Factor 3 does not stimulate the formation of a binary complex between EF-1 alpha and GTP, nor does it stimulate the exchange of EF-1 alpha-bound GDP with free GTP. The formation of a ternary complex between EF-1 alpha.GTP.aa-tRNA is also not affected by EF-3. It appears that the only reaction of the elongation cycle that is stimulated by EF-3 is EF-1 alpha-dependent binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosome. Purified elongation factor 3, isolated from a temperature-sensitive mutant, failed to stimulate this reaction after exposure to a nonpermissive temperature. A heterologous combination of ribosomal subunits from yeast and wheat germ manifest the requirement for EF-3, dependent upon the source of the ribosomal subunit. A combination of 40 S subunits from yeast and 60 from wheat germ showed the stimulatory effect of EF-3 in polyphenylalanine synthesis (Chakraburtty, K., and Kamath, A. (1988) Int. J. Biochem. 20, 581-590). However, we failed to demonstrate the effect of EF-3 in binding aa-tRNA to such a heterologous combination of the ribosomal subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1502995912,"In the present study, lactose permease mutants were isolated which have an enhanced recognition toward maltose (an alpha-glucoside) and diminished recognition for cellobiose (a beta-glucoside). Nine mutants were isolated from a strain encoding a wild-type permease (pTE18) and nine from a strain encoding a mutant permease which recognizes maltose (pB15). All 18 mutants were subjected to DNA sequencing, and it was found that all mutations are single base substitutions within the lac Y gene effecting single amino acid substitutions within the protein. From the pTE18 parent, substitutions involved Tyr-236 to Phe or His; Ser-306 to Thr; and six independent mutants in which Ala-389 was changed to Pro. From pB15, Tyr-236 was changed to Phe or Asn, Ser-306 to Thr or Leu, Lys-319 to Asn, and His-322 to Tyr, Asn, or Gln. All 18 mutants exhibited enhanced recognition for maltose (compared with the pTE18 strain) and a diminished recognition for cellobiose. In addition, all mutants showed a diminished recognition toward beta-galactosides as well. The Phe-236, His-236, Leu-306, Asn-319, Tyr-322, Asn-322, and Gln-322 mutants were completely defective in the uphill accumulation of methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside whereas the Asn-236, Thr-306, and Pro-389 mutants could effectively accumulate methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside against a concentration gradient. The mutants obtained in this study, together with previous lactose permease mutants, tend to be found on transmembrane segments, and those which are on the same transmembrane segment are often found three or four amino acids away from each other. This pattern is consistent with a protein structure in which important amino acid side chains project from several transmembrane segments in such a way as to form a hydrophilic channel for the recognition and transport of H+ and galactosides. It is proposed that the mechanism for H+/lactose cotransport is consistent with a flanking gate model in which the protein contains a single recognition site for galactosides within the channel which is flanked on either side by gates."
https://openalex.org/W1576226005,"Abstract Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) is an integral membrane protein found at the plasma membrane of many cell types and is especially abundant at the apical membrane of the kidney proximal tubules. The enzyme consists of a short amino-terminal cytosolic domain of 27 amino acids, a single hydrophobic sequence which is believed to be responsible for anchoring the enzyme in the plasma membrane, and a large extracellular domain containing the active site. This model is consistent with the proposed function of neutral endopeptidase, which is believed to play an important role in the inactivation of small regulatory peptides at the cell surface. Site-directed mutagenesis has allowed the identification of 1 glutamic acid and 2 histidine residues essential for catalysis. All are located near the COOH terminus of the protein. We do not know, however, whether other segments of the protein are involved in the structure of the active site. The exact role of the cytosolic and transmembrane domains is also unknown. In this report, we have induced the secretion of a soluble form of recombinant neutral endopeptidase in COS-1 cells by fusing in-frame, the cDNA encoding the signal peptide of a secreted protein (pro-opiomelanocortin) to the cDNA sequences of the complete ectodomain of neutral endopeptidase. Characterization of the secreted recombinant protein indicated that it has the same catalytic properties as the membrane-bound recombinant enzyme or as the enzyme extracted from kidney brush border membranes. Thus the extracellular domain alone is sufficient for conferring full catalytic activity to neutral endopeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1510985594,"Abstract Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11, NEP) is an integral membrane protein of human neutrophils. NEP is identical with the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) of leukemic cells. The expression of NEP on the surface of neutrophils is down-regulated by endocytosis which can be induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 37 degrees C. The activity of the enzyme on the surface of intact cells decreases by 76% within 5 min. The activity can be recovered, however, if the cells are lysed within 5 min of the endocytosis. After 30 min, only 32% of the NEP activity is present in the neutrophil lysates. The loss of activity is presumably due to proteolytic inactivation. Diacylglycerol and monoclonal antibody to CALLA/NEP also induce internalization of NEP. PMA induces endocytosis even at 4 degrees C, but NEP is not inactivated at that temperature. The disappearance of NEP activity after adding PMA was inhibited by various agents. Among the most active were the phospholipase inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl bromide and a combination of the serine protease and cathepsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate and N-ethylmaleimide. The employment of fluorescent monoclonal antibody confirmed the down-regulation and internalization of NEP antigen on the neutrophils. Since NEP inactivates chemotactic peptides and thereby affects chemotaxis of neutrophils (Painter, R. G., Dukes, R., Sullivan, J., Carter, R., Erdos, E. G., and Johnson, A. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9456-9461), the down-regulation of NEP activity on the cell membrane may modulate the function of these cells in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1575149476,"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a finite life span, limited by the number of generations the cell can undergo. Yeast cells display a variety of changes as they age. In order to determine whether age-associated changes occur in the prevalence of specific mRNAs, a differential hybridization screen has been used to identify yeast genes that are preferentially expressed in either young or in old cells. In this screen, a yeast genomic DNA library was probed with cDNA prepared to the poly(A)+ mRNA of young and old cells. Six clones representing distinct genes that showed differential patterns of expression throughout the life span were isolated, as determined by genomic blot and RNA dot blot analyses. On the basis of their expression patterns five of the genes were classified as young- and one as old-specific. These genes were all derived from the nuclear genome. Analysis of the expression during the cell cycle of two of these genes, one young cell-specific and the other old-cell-specific, revealed that it was not growth state-dependent. These results suggest that aging in yeast is accompanied by defined alterations in the levels of certain gene transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1567479299,"Abstract Human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells exhibit rapid induction of membrane ruffling in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (Kadowaki, T., Koyasu, S., Nishida, E., Sakai, H., Takaku, F., Yahara, I., and Kasuga, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16141-16147). We have analyzed the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in this response. Treatment of KB cells with 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (100 ng/ml) for 30 min caused translocation of PKC to the membrane. This treatment completely inhibited the induction of membrane ruffling by EGF, insulin, and IGF-I. Prolonged treatment with PDBu (200 ng/ml for 15 h) induced complete depletion of the PKC activity in the cells. Under these conditions, EGF binding to cells and autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor occurred normally, while EGF could not induce membrane ruffling. In contrast, insulin- or IGF-I-induced membrane ruffling occurred normally in the PKC-depleted cells. Moreover, H-7 (PKC inhibitor) inhibited only EGF-induced membrane ruffling in a dose-dependent manner. We further found that EGF, but not insulin/IGF-I, caused transient translocation of PKC to the membrane. All these results suggest that PKC is required for the membrane ruffling induced by EGF but not for that induced by insulin/IGF-I. Therefore, there are PKC-dependent and independent pathways in the growth factor-induced membrane ruffling. Furthermore, we propose dual roles of PKC in the EGF signaling, a signal transmitting role and a negative feedback role."
https://openalex.org/W1561283023,"Abstract Comparison of the precursor sequence for several peptide hormones of Xenopus laevis skin revealed a consensus sequence around a single arginine cleavage site which is 100% conserved on four residues Arg-Xaa-Val-Arg-Gly (RXVRG). A tetradecapeptide substrate (Asp-Val-Asp-Glu-Arg-Asp-Val-Arg-Gly-Phe-Ala-Ser-Phe-Leu-NH2) was used as a probe to purify and characterize the putative processing endoprotease. A hydrophobic enzyme was purified at least 9000-fold from Xenopus skin exudate by a four-step procedure. This highly specific activity cleaves the Arg-Gly bond and has no effect on the Arg-Xaa bond. It was strongly inhibited by divalent ion chelators, moderately by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and 1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, but was insensitive to soybean trypsin inhibitor. Tetradecapeptide derivatives selectively modified on each of the amino acids of the consensus sequence demonstrated the relevance of this conserved pattern to endoprotease action. This enzyme, which we refer to as RXVRG-endoprotease, is proposed to be involved in the post-translational processing of pro-caerulein, promagainin, pro-xenopsin, pro-glycyl-leucine amide, and pro-levitide of X. laevis skin secretory granules."

https://openalex.org/W1522320308,"Abstract A synthetic gene encoding Cerebratulus lacteus neurotoxin B-IV has been designed, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Although expression of the toxin alone appears to be incompatible with host viability, large amounts could be synthesized as a fusion protein with either E. coli beta-galactosidase or the gene 9 protein of bacteriophage T7, the latter system being the more efficient. The fusion protein has been purified, and, after Factor Xa-catalyzed hydrolysis at a customized linker site, we have obtained the equivalent of 12 mg of pure toxin B-IV per liter of bacterial culture. The recombinant protein is identical with B-IV isolated from Cerebratulus with respect to high performance liquid chromatography mobility and secondary structure, and its amino acid composition differs only by the presence of an amino-terminal methionine residue and replacement of Hyp10 by Pro. Quantal bioassay indicates that the cloned protein is comparable to the natural toxin in specific toxicity. The small differences observed in comparing the activities of the two proteins are most likely due to the presence of the methionine extension at the amino terminus of the recombinant, although lack of hydroxylation of Pro10 may also contribute."
https://openalex.org/W1548955405,"Abstract Reaction of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) with single-stranded M13 phage DNA in vitro produced monofunctional platinum-DNA adducts on guanine and bifunctional lesions with either two guanine bases (GG) or one adenine and one guanine (AG). When DNA containing a majority of monofunctional platinum-DNA lesions was dialyzed against 10 mM NaCIO4 at 37 degrees C, conversion of monoadducts to bifunctional lesions was observed. We examined the effect of post-treatment formation of bifunctional lesions on DNA synthesis by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and highly purified eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha from Drosophila melanogaster and calf thymus. Arrest sites on the platinated template were determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Monofunctional lesions did not appear to block DNA synthesis. Inhibition of replication increased as bifunctional platinum-DNA lesions formed during post-treatment incubation; GG adducts inhibited replication more than AG. These results suggest that bifunctional GG platinum-DNA adducts may be the major toxic damage of cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W1578016329,"The bacteriophage T4 genes uvsX (recombination protein), 40 (stimulates head formation), and 41 (DNA replication protein, part of the primase-helicase) are located together on the T4 genome (5'----3' uvsX-40-41). Previous analyses have indicated that all three proteins are expressed within 5 min after infection and that the level of 41 protein is less than that of uvsX. The mapping of transcripts from this region (reported here) shows that this expression arises from polycistronic messages detected between 2-4 min after infection, a time when phage-encoded factors are beginning to alter the host transcriptional apparatus. Major RNA 5' ends, 900 and 200 bases upstream of uvsX, show homology with previously deduced T4 transcription sites dependent on the T4 transcription factor motA (Guild, N., Gayle, M., Sweeney, R., Hollingsworth, T., Modeer, T., and Gold, L. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 199, 241-258). Analysis of the 3' end of uvsX RNAs shows that initially most transcripts extend through gene 40 and 41, although approximately equal to one-fourth end just past uvsX (within gene 40). Later, more of the uvsX messages are monocistronic, having 5' ends close to the gene (200 and 55 bases upstream) and having the 3' end within gene 40. Thus, during infection the level of 41 RNA is lowered relative to uvsX message. Mapping of RNA expressed from an uvsX-40-41 plasmid in an uninfected cell gives 5' ends 700, 450, and 55 bases upstream of uvsX, i.e. positions different from those during T4 infection. This indicates that infection significantly changes the 5' ends for uvsX RNA, either by altering transcription initiation or RNA processing sites. In contrast, the majority of the uvsX RNAs expressed by plasmid in the uninfected cell do end at the stop mapped during infection. Thus, the host alone can produce this 3' end."
https://openalex.org/W1492834300,"Abstract To clarify contradicting observations on the identity of inactive renin and prorenin, inactive renin was completely purified from native human chorion laeve and the culture medium of human chorion cells. A 720,000-fold purification with 14% recovery was achieved from chorion laeve in 6 steps, including immunoaffinity chromatography on a monoclonal antibody to human renin coupled to Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. A 3,100-fold purification with 40% recovery was achieved from chorion culture medium in 4 steps, including immunoaffinity chromatography. Inactive renin purified from the two different sources migrated as a single protein band with the same molecular weight of 47,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and consisted of multiple components that could be resolved by isoelectric focusing. Both had the same pI values which shifted downward upon activation by trypsin; however, relative peak heights were different between the two preparations. The purified inactive renin from chorion laeve was completely inactive and did not bind to pepstatin-aminohexyl-Sepharose; however, that from chorion culture medium was partially active and completely bound to the pepstatin gel, indicating that each molecule is partially activated. Trypsin-activated inactive renins from both sources were identical with human renal renin in terms of pH optimum and Km. Specific activities of trypsin-activated inactive renin from chorion laeve and chorion culture medium were 529 Goldblatt units/mg of protein and 449 Goldblatt units/mg of protein, respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis of both of the purified inactive renin preparations demonstrated a leucine residue at the amino terminus. The sequence of 11 additional amino acids was identical in both and agreed with that predicted from the base sequence of the renin gene. These findings indicate that preprorenin is converted to prorenin following removal of a 23-amino acid signal peptide and that the native inactive renin, whose amino acid sequence commences with Leu-Pro-Thr..., is prorenin."
https://openalex.org/W1597647800,"The flavoenzyme mercuric ion reductase from Bacillus sp. strain RC607 was purified by dye-ligand affinity chromatography. The protein was crystallized from solutions of high ionic strength, and one of the two crystal forms obtained has proven suitable for x-ray diffraction studies. Preliminary analysis showed that these crystals belong to the tetragonal space group 1422. The unit cell dimensions are a = b = 180.7 A; c = 127.9 A. The diffraction pattern extends to better than 3 A resolution. Crystal density measurements are consistent with one enzyme dimer of 2 × 69,000 Da comprising the asymmetric unit. Trypsin treatment of the native enzyme resulted in the removal of 157 amino acids at the N terminus. After purification, the remaining fragment (amino acids 158–631), which is still fully active in vitro, could be crystallized under the same conditions as native enzyme. Twinning problems, however, did not allow complete analysis of these crystals."
https://openalex.org/W1515152089,"Human protein C, like other serine proteases, is normally secreted as an inactive zymogen. It is converted to its active form extracellularly by limited proteolysis with the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. This activation results from the removal of a 12-residue activation peptide from the NH2 terminus of the heavy (COOH-terminal) chain. We report here a successful strategy for the activation of human protein C during post-translational cellular processing, resulting in the secretion of activated protein C from transfected mammalian cells. Deletion of the nucleotides encoding the activation peptide resulted in the expression of a protease with less than 5% of the expected activity. However, the replacement of the activation peptide with an 8-residue sequence (Pro-Arg-Pro-Ser-Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg) involved in the proteolytic processing of the human insulin receptor precursor resulted in the direct expression of fully activated protein C. The mutant protein was shown to be correctly processed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis. This strategy for successful expression of an activated form of protein C may apply to the expression of active forms of other proteases which are naturally expressed as zymogens."
https://openalex.org/W1625887094,"The hydroxyl group of Tyr alpha 42 in human hemoglobin forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Asp beta 99 which is considered to be one of the most important hydrogen bonds for stabilizing the However, no spontaneous mutation at position 42 of the alpha subunit has been reported, and the role of the tyrosine has not been tested experimentally. Two artificial human mutant hemoglobins in which Tyr alpha 42 was replaced by phenylalanine or histidine were synthesized in Escherichia coli, and their proton NMR spectra were studied with particular attention to the hyperfine-shifted and hydrogen-bonded proton resonances. The site-directed mutagenesis of the Tyr alpha 42----Phe removes the hydrogen bond described above and prevents transition to the T-state so that the mutant Hb is rather similar to the R-state even when deoxygenated. On the other hand, the mutation from tyrosine to histidine causes less drastic structural changes, and its quaternary and tertiary structures are almost the same as native deoxy-Hb A. This may be attributed to the formation of a new hydrogen bond between His alpha 1(42) and Asp beta 2(99). These observations indicate that the hydrogen bond formed between Tyr alpha 42 and Asp beta 99 is required to convert unliganded Hb to the T-state."
https://openalex.org/W1516806522,"Yeast expression vectors were constructed containing complementary DNA encoding the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-subunits of the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor under the control of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. All four plasmids were integrated into the yeast genome of a single yeast cell. The resulting yeast strain synthesized polypeptides novel to yeast that had the molecular weights and antigenic properties similar to the authentic T. californica receptor alpha-, gamma, and delta-subunits. The beta-subunit polypeptide could not be detected in this yeast strain, even though the poly(A)+ RNA from this strain contained all the information necessary for the expression of functional acetylcholine receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The replacement of the beta-subunit mRNA 5'-untranslated leader and its N-terminal signal sequence by the corresponding alpha-subunit sequences, however, resulted in the expression of the beta-subunit polypeptide in yeast grown at 5 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1594467907,"Abstract A gene coding for the flavodoxin from Clostridium MP was designed, synthesized, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The sequence of the coding region was derived from the published amino acid sequence of the protein (Tanaka, M., Haniu, M., Yasunobu, K.T., and Mayhew, S. G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4393-4397) and was designed for optimal expression and for use of the cassette mutagenesis approach. The structural gene was subassembled in three sections, each of which was constructed by the enzymatic ligation of three complementary pairs of chemically synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides having short single-stranded ends complementary to that of the adjacent pair. Coligation of the three sections produced the final structural gene which consists of 420 nucleotides. The synthetic gene was cloned behind the hybrid tac promoter (Amman, E., Brosius, J., and Ptashne, M. (1983) Gene (Amst.) 25, 167-178) in the pKK223-3 vector or adjacent to the strong T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the pET-3a expression vector (Rosenberg, A.H., Lade, B. N., Chui, D-S., Lin, S-W., Dunn, J. J., and Studier, F. W. (1987) Gene (Amst.) 56, 125-135) for expression in E. coli. Upon induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, the flavodoxin polypeptide was expressed from the artificial gene to levels approaching 20% of total extractable proteins using either expression system. The flavodoxin was purified from cellular extracts as the holoprotein containing bound flavin mononucleotide. The recombinant flavodoxin protein was found to have an ultraviolet/visible spectrum, amino-terminal sequence, and amino acid composition identical to the wild-type flavodoxin protein purified from Clostridium MP. This work represents the first chemical synthesis and expression in E. coli of an artificial gene coding for a bacterial flavodoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1558352233,"The frequency of nonstereospecific hydride transfers to and from the C-4 of NAD+ by porcine heart lactate dehydrogenase has been determined to be less than 1 out of every 10(7) hydride transfers, using a method employing a dynamic equilibrium which allows for the detection of extremely rare (less than 1 in 10(8] nonstereospecific transfers. A detailed protocol is presented. The inability to detect unequivocally a nonstereospecific transfer either to or from the si face of the nicotinamide ring (pro-4S hydrogen to NADH) indicates that the transition state for the more favorable transfer of the pro-4R hydrogen is at least 10 kcal/mol lower in energy."

https://openalex.org/W1517698908,"Bacterial signal peptides display little amino acid sequence homology despite their shared role in mediating protein transport. This heterogeneity may exist to permit the establishment of signal peptide conformations that are appropriate for transport of particular proteins. In this paper we explore how signal peptides are composed of structural units that may interact with each other and with the mature protein to effect transport. Using a new application of cassette mutagenesis, we have replaced the hydrophobic core of the Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase signal peptide with cores from the signals of maltose-binding protein, OmpA, and M13 major coat protein. The core regions from maltose-binding protein and OmpA effectively replaced the alkaline phosphatase core; the resultant hybrid signals performed as well as wild type in periplasmic transport and processing of alkaline phosphatase. However, the core region from M13 major coat protein generated a transport-incompetent hybrid signal peptide. Elimination of a proline-containing portion of the M13 major coat protein core did not improve transport effectiveness. However, restoration of the procoat cleavage region and the negatively charged amino terminus of the mature protein did ameliorate the transport defect. These results suggest that at least in the case of these procoat-derived signal peptide mutants, there is a requirement for complementarity among the hydrophobic core, cleavage region, and part of the mature protein in order for efficient protein transport to occur."

https://openalex.org/W1497302514,"The attenuation model for transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli pyrBI operon is based on the assumption that transcription terminates upstream of the structural genes at a rho-independent terminator when cells contain high levels of UTP. When, however, the cells are limited for pyrimidines, the presence of ribosomes translating the short leader peptide is presumed to cause an alteration in the secondary structure of the terminator in a way that allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the entire operon. These two premises of transcriptional regulation were tested by using exonuclease protection assays to map the 3' ends of transcripts extracted from cells containing either ample or depleted concentrations of pyrimidines. The results support the model since 99% of the pyrBI transcripts terminated at the (G + C)-rich region of dyad symmetry upstream of the structural genes when cells were grown in excess uracil. In addition, a significant portion (36%) of the pyrBI transcripts extracted from cells containing reduced pyrimidine concentrations extended past the dyad into the structural genes. This observation correlated with the amounts of aspartate transcarbamoylase synthesized in cells under the various conditions. The mapping technique was also used to determine the position of the 5' ends of the transcripts to measure contributions of two potential start sites (P1 and P2) to the pool of pyrBI transcripts. The results show that under all conditions no more than 3% of the total transcripts had 5' ends corresponding to the upstream promoter, P1. In cells lacking P1 virtually all transcripts from P2 terminated at the (G + C)-rich hairpin when the cellular level of pyrimidines was high. Conversely 57% of the transcripts extended past the terminator when cells were grown in UMP. The S1 nuclease technique also provided a measure of the steady state level of transcripts originating at P2. In cells depleted of pyrimidines there was a 5-10-fold increase in these transcripts depending on the number of copies of pyrBI. This increase, which is independent of attenuation, is caused by a different regulatory mechanism which as yet has not been identified."
https://openalex.org/W1555581200,"Several enzymes of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) biosynthesis interact in T4 phage-infected Escherichia coli to form a multienzyme aggregate, the T4 dNTP synthetase complex. To test the specificity of enzyme interactions seen in vitro with this complex, we analyzed bacteria infected with four T4 gene 42 amber mutants, which specify truncated forms of dCMP hydroxymethylase, one of the constituent enzymes in the complex. Mutants that specify a nearly full length gene 42 product can form an intact complex, as revealed by two criteria: kinetic coupling among constituent enzymes in crude extracts of infected bacteria, and co-elution of enzyme activities from a gel filtration column. By these criteria, mutations that specify truncated proteins less than half the size of the full length protein cause disruption of the complex. These findings suggest that an enzymatically inactive form of dCMP hydroxymethylase can contribute toward assembly of an intact complex, so long as the incomplete protein is of sufficient size to fold normally, allowing interaction with other proteins in the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1519868668,"Abstract Bacteriophage T4 gene 41 protein is an essential replication protein, part of the primase-helicase required for lagging strand DNA synthesis. In a T4+ infection, 41 RNA is first expressed as a polycistronic transcript attached to the upstream RNA of genes uvsX (recombination protein) and 40 (stimulates head formation (Hinton, D. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14432-14439). As infection proceeds, less of the upstream RNA extends into gene 41 due to an RNA 3' end, approximately equal to 60 bases downstream of uvsX. DNA sequence analysis of this region positions this end within gene 40, immediately after a GC-rich hairpin. This end probably arises from host factor-dependent transcription termination or RNA processing since it is observed in RNA expressed by a uvsX-40-41 plasmid in vivo, but is not seen after in vitro transcription with purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The E. coli transcription termination (rho) mutant rho026 has been characterized as a rho mutation whose terminating activity is not effectively overcome by phage lambda antitermination (Das, A., Gottesman, M. E., Wardwell, J., Trisler, P., and Gottesman, S. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 5530-5534). During a T4+ abortive infection of rho026, the levels of some phage proteins, including 41, are depressed; a T4 phage mutant in goF gives wild type protein patterns in rho026 (Stitt, B. L., and Mosig, G. (1989) J. Bacteriol., in press). The RNA analyses presented here demonstrate that the severalfold decrease in 41 protein in rho026 is accompanied by a similar decrease in 41 RNA. There is both a general reduction in polycistronic uvsX-40-41 RNA and a 2-2.5-fold increase in the proportion of uvsX RNA ending at the 3' end. Infection of rho026 by T4 goF1 returns the relative amount of RNA reading into 41 versus that stopped to near a wild type level. These results suggest that host rho and the T4 goF are involved in the expression of T4 41 RNA."
