https://openalex.org/W4290830194,"The magnitude of the 2022 multi-country monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak has surpassed any preceding outbreak. It is unclear whether asymptomatic or otherwise undiagnosed infections are fuelling this epidemic. In this study, we aimed to assess whether undiagnosed infections occurred among men attending a Belgian sexual health clinic in May 2022. We retrospectively screened 224 samples collected for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing using an MPXV PCR assay and identified MPXV-DNA-positive samples from four men. At the time of sampling, one man had a painful rash, and three men had reported no symptoms. Upon clinical examination 21-37 days later, these three men were free of clinical signs, and they reported not having experienced any symptoms. Serology confirmed MPXV exposure in all three men, and MPXV was cultured from two cases. These findings show that certain cases of monkeypox remain undiagnosed and suggest that testing and quarantining of individuals reporting symptoms may not suffice to contain the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W4290860519,"Abstract Oncogenic RET fusions occur in diverse cancers. Pralsetinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of RET receptor tyrosine kinase. ARROW ( NCT03037385 , ongoing) was designed to evaluate pralsetinib efficacy and safety in patients with advanced RET -altered solid tumors. Twenty-nine patients with 12 different RET fusion–positive solid tumor types, excluding non-small-cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, who had previously received or were not candidates for standard therapies, were enrolled. The most common RET fusion partners in 23 efficacy-evaluable patients were CCDC6 (26%), KIF5B (26%) and NCOA4 (13%). Overall response rate, the primary endpoint, was 57% (95% confidence interval, 35–77) among these patients. Responses were observed regardless of tumor type or RET fusion partner. Median duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival were 12 months, 7 months and 14 months, respectively. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (31%) and anemia (14%). These data validate RET as a tissue-agnostic target with sensitivity to RET inhibition, indicating pralsetinib’s potential as a well-tolerated treatment option with rapid, robust and durable anti-tumor activity in patients with diverse RET fusion–positive solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4290839787,"Adult brain activities are generally believed to be dominated by chemical and electrical transduction mechanisms. However, the importance of mechanotransduction mediated by mechano-gated ion channels in brain functions is less appreciated. Here, we show that the mechano-gated Piezo1 channel is expressed in the exploratory processes of astrocytes and utilizes its mechanosensitivity to mediate mechanically evoked Ca2+ responses and ATP release, establishing Piezo1-mediated mechano-chemo transduction in astrocytes. Piezo1 deletion in astrocytes causes a striking reduction of hippocampal volume and brain weight and severely impaired (but ATP-rescuable) adult neurogenesis in vivo, and it abolishes ATP-dependent potentiation of neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation in vitro. Piezo1-deficient mice show impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning and memory behaviors. By contrast, overexpression of Piezo1 in astrocytes sufficiently enhances mechanotransduction, LTP, and learning and memory performance. Thus, astrocytes utilize Piezo1-mediated mechanotransduction mechanisms to robustly regulate adult neurogenesis and cognitive functions, conceptually highlighting the importance of mechanotransduction in brain structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W4290839803,"Parietal cortex is implicated in a variety of behavioral processes, but it is unknown whether and how its individual neurons participate in multiple tasks. We trained head-fixed mice to perform two visual decision tasks involving a steering wheel or a virtual T-maze and recorded from the same parietal neurons during these two tasks. Neurons that were active during the T-maze task were typically inactive during the steering-wheel task and vice versa. Recording from the same neurons in the same apparatus without task stimuli yielded the same specificity as in the task, suggesting that task specificity depends on physical context. To confirm this, we trained some mice in a third task combining the steering wheel context with the visual environment of the T-maze. This hybrid task engaged the same neurons as those engaged in the steering-wheel task. Thus, participation by neurons in mouse parietal cortex is task specific, and this specificity is determined by physical context."
https://openalex.org/W4291398697,"Inositol is an essential metabolite that serves as a precursor for structural and signaling molecules. Although perturbation of inositol homeostasis has been implicated in numerous human disorders, surprisingly little is known about how inositol levels are regulated in mammalian cells. A recent study in mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that nuclear translocation of inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) mediates repression of myo-inositol-3-P synthase (MIPS), the rate-limiting inositol biosynthetic enzyme. Binding of IP6K1 to phosphatidic acid (PA) is required for this repression. Here, we elucidate the role of PA in IP6K1 repression. Our results indicate that increasing PA levels through pharmacological stimulation of phospholipase D (PLD) or direct supplementation of 18:1 PA induces nuclear translocation of IP6K1 and represses expression of the MIPS protein. We found that this effect was specific to PA synthesized in the plasma membrane, as endoplasmic reticulum-derived PA did not induce IP6K1 translocation. Furthermore, we determined that PLD-mediated PA synthesis can be stimulated by the master metabolic regulator 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We show that activation of AMPK by glucose deprivation or by treatment with the mood-stabilizing drugs valproate or lithium recapitulated IP6K1 nuclear translocation and decreased MIPS expression. This study demonstrates for the first time that modulation of PA levels through the AMPK-PLD pathway regulates IP6K1-mediated repression of MIPS."
https://openalex.org/W4291594986,"Extracellular DNA-binding proteins such as histones are danger-associated molecular pattern released by the injured tissues in trauma and sepsis settings, which trigger host immune response and vascular dysfunction. Molecular events leading to histone-induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction remain poorly understood. This study performed comparative analysis of H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone subunits effects on human pulmonary EC permeability and inflammatory response. Analysis of transendothelial electrical resistance and EC monolayer permeability for macromolecues revealed that H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A, or H2B caused dose-dependent EC permeability accompanied by disassembly of adherens junctions. At higher doses, H3 and H4 activated nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory cascade leading to upregulation EC adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, E-selectin, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitory receptor analysis showed that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR1/2 or receptor for advanced glycation end inhibition significantly attenuated deleterious effects of H3 and H4 histones. Inhibitor of Rho-kinase was without effect, while inhibition of Src kinase caused partial preservation of cell-cell junctions, H3/H4-induced permeability and inflammation. Deleterious effects of H3/H4 were blocked by heparin. Activation of Epac-Rap1 signaling restored EC barrier properties after histone challenge. Intravenous injection of histones in mice caused elevation of inflammatory markers and increased vascular leak. Post-treatment with pharmacological Epac/Rap1 activator suppressed injurious effects of histones in vitro and in vivo. These results identify H3 and H4 as key histone subunits exhibiting deleterious effects on pulmonary vascular endothelium via TLR4-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, elevation of circulating histones may represent a serious risk of exacerbated acute lung injury (ALI) and multiple organ injury during severe trauma and infection."
https://openalex.org/W4291901975,"Retinal ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common cause of visual impairment. To date, no effective treatment is available for retinal I/R injury. In addition, the precise pathological mechanisms still need to be established. Recently, pemafibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) modulator, was shown to be a promising drug for retinal ischemia. However, the role of pemafibrate in preventing retinal I/R injury has not been documented. Here, we investigated how retinal degeneration occurs in a mouse model of retinal I/R injury by elevation of intraocular pressure and examined whether pemafibrate could be beneficial against retinal degeneration. Adult mice were orally administered pemafibrate (0.5 mg/kg/day) for 4 days, followed by retinal I/R injury. The mice were continuously administered pemafibrate once every day until the end of the experiments. Retinal functional changes were measured using electroretinography. Retina, liver, and serum samples were used for western blotting, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Retinal degeneration induced by retinal inflammation was prevented by pemafibrate administration. Pemafibrate administration increased the hepatic PPARα target gene expression and serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 21, a neuroprotective molecule in the eye. The expression of hypoxia-response and pro-and anti-apoptotic/inflammatory genes increased in the retina following retinal I/R injury; however, these changes were modulated by pemafibrate administration. In conclusion, pemafibrate is a promising preventive drug for ischemic retinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4290851990,"Work-related stress is significantly higher among healthcare workers (HCWs) than in the general population. Elevated occupational stress has been linked to burnout syndrome and depression. Moreover, medical professionals working during infectious disease outbreaks are at especially high risk for these problems. The aim of the present study was to examine the mental health status of HCWs and possible predictors of mental health status related to the COVID-19 outbreak utilizing a complex comprehensive model.In a countrywide cross-sectional survey among HCWs (N = 2087), work-related stress, COVID-19 -related objective work factors (displacement, frontline working) and subjective work factors (insecurity, unpredictability, workload), perceived stress, work-related stress, burnout and depression were assessed between the second and third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary.COVID-19-related objective factors did not predict directly stress, burnout, and depression, whereas feelings of insecurity and unpredictability in relation to the COVID-19 situation at work had a significant medium-sized total effect (also considering the indirect effect via stress) on burnout and depression.In order to prevent subsequent mental health problems during crisis situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare management should create a more predictable work environment and a safer work experience for healthcare workers and provide mental health support."
https://openalex.org/W4290988149,"Sodium-pumping rhodopsins (NaRs) are membrane transporters that utilize light energy to pump Na+ across the cellular membrane. Within the NaRs, the retinal Schiff base chromophore absorbs light, and a photochemically induced transient state, referred to as the ""O intermediate"", performs both the uptake and release of Na+. However, the structure of the O intermediate remains unclear. Here, we used time-resolved cryo-Raman spectroscopy under preresonance conditions to study the structure of the retinal chromophore in the O intermediate of an NaR from the bacterium Indibacter alkaliphilus. We observed two O intermediates, termed O1 and O2, having distinct chromophore structures. We show O1 displays a distorted 13-cis chromophore, while O2 contains a distorted all-trans structure. This finding indicated that the uptake and release of Na+ are achieved not by a single O intermediate but by two sequential O intermediates that are toggled via isomerization of the retinal chromophore. These results provide crucial structural insight into the unidirectional Na+ transport mediated by the chromophore-binding pocket of NaRs."
https://openalex.org/W4291005981,"Breakdown of the blood-central nervous system barrier (BCNSB) is a hallmark of many neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Using a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we show that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) occurs in the CNS before the onset of clinical symptoms and plays a major role in the breakdown of BCNSB function. EndoMT can be induced by an IL-1β-stimulated signaling pathway in which activation of the small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) leads to crosstalk with the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-SMAD1/5 pathway. Inhibiting the activation of ARF6 both prevents and reverses EndoMT, stabilizes BCNSB function, reduces demyelination, and attenuates symptoms even after the establishment of severe EAE, without immunocompromising the host. Pan-inhibition of ALKs also reduces disease severity in the EAE model. Therefore, multiple components of the IL-1β-ARF6-ALK-SMAD1/5 pathway could be targeted for the treatment of a variety of neuroinflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4290802303,"Structural plasticity in the brain often necessitates dramatic remodeling of neuronal processes, with attendant reorganization of the cytoskeleton and membranes. Although cytoskeletal restructuring has been studied extensively, how lipids might orchestrate structural plasticity remains unclear. We show that specific glial cells in Drosophila produce glucocerebrosidase (GBA) to locally catabolize sphingolipids. Sphingolipid accumulation drives lysosomal dysfunction, causing gba1b mutants to harbor protein aggregates that cycle across circadian time and are regulated by neural activity, the circadian clock, and sleep. Although the vast majority of membrane lipids are stable across the day, a specific subset that is highly enriched in sphingolipids cycles daily in a gba1b-dependent fashion. Remarkably, both sphingolipid biosynthesis and degradation are required for the diurnal remodeling of circadian clock neurites, which grow and shrink across the day. Thus, dynamic sphingolipid regulation by glia enables diurnal circuit remodeling and proper circadian behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4290988185,"Biomolecular condensates are self-organized membraneless bodies involved in many critical cellular activities, including ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, and gene transcription. Aliphatic alcohols are commonly used to study biomolecular condensates, but their effects on transcription are unclear. Here, we explore the impact of the aliphatic dialcohol, 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD), on Pol II transcription and nucleosome occupancy in budding yeast. As expected, 1,6-HD, a reagent effective in disrupting biomolecular condensates, strongly suppressed the thermal stress-induced transcription of Heat Shock Factor 1-regulated genes that have previously been shown to physically interact and coalesce into intranuclear condensates. Surprisingly, the isomeric dialcohol, 2,5-HD, typically used as a negative control, abrogated Heat Shock Factor 1-target gene transcription under the same conditions. Each reagent also abolished the transcription of genes that do not detectably coalesce, including Msn2/Msn4-regulated heat-inducible genes and constitutively expressed housekeeping genes. Thus, at elevated temperature (39 °C), HDs potently inhibit the transcription of disparate genes and as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation do so by abolishing occupancy of RNA polymerase in chromatin. Concurrently, histone H3 density increased at least twofold within all gene coding and regulatory regions examined, including quiescent euchromatic loci, silent heterochromatic loci, and Pol III-transcribed loci. Our results offer a caveat for the use of HDs in studying the role of condensates in transcriptional control and provide evidence that exposure to these reagents elicits a widespread increase in nucleosome density and a concomitant loss of both Pol II and Pol III transcription."
https://openalex.org/W4291799537,"The Ajuba LIM protein Jub mediates regulation of Hippo signaling by cytoskeletal tension through interaction with the kinase Warts and participates in feedback regulation of junctional tension through regulation of the cytohesin Steppke. To investigate how Jub interacts with and regulates its distinct partners, we investigated the ability of Jub proteins missing different combinations of its three LIM domains to rescue jub phenotypes and to interact with α-catenin, Warts and Steppke. Multiple regions of Jub contribute to its ability to bind α-catenin and to localize to adherens junctions in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cultured cells identified a specific requirement for LIM2 for binding to Warts. However, in vivo, both LIM1 and LIM2, but not LIM3, were required for regulation of wing growth, Yorkie activity, and Warts localization. Conversely, LIM2 and LIM3, but not LIM1, were required for regulation of cell shape and Steppke localization in vivo, and for maximal Steppke binding in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These observations identify distinct functions for the different LIM domains of Jub."
https://openalex.org/W4290851097,"Purpose von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by a mutation of the VHL gene and characterized by the development of retinal hemangioblastomas (RH). Current pathophysiologic mechanisms of RH development and progression are still insufficient to predict RH behavior. VHL gene is involved in the cellular response to hypoxia and in many intracellular signaling pathways expressed both in angiogenesis and inflammation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows to identify hyper-reflective retinal foci (HRF) known as aggregates of activated microglial cells as possible in vivo biomarker of local inflammation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of HRF in patients with genetically confirmed VHL disease. Methods In this cross-sectional study, patients with VHL underwent complete ophthalmological examination and OCT with HRA + OCT Spectralis. HRF were manually identified and calculated in inner (IR), outer (OR) and full retina. Age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. Results 113 eyes of 63 VHL patients and 56 eyes of 28 healthy subjects were evaluated. HRF number was significantly higher in VHL than in controls in IR (28.06 ± 7.50 vs 25.25 ± 6.64, p = 0.042). No difference was observed in OR and in full retina (OR: 7.73 ± 2.59 vs 7.95 ± 2.51, p = 0.599; full retina: 35.79 ± 8.77 vs 33.20 ± 7.47, p = 0.093). Conclusion The increase of HRF, which mirror retinal microglial activation, characterizes VHL eyes. The role of activated microglia in the retina of VHL eyes needs to be better investigated, mainly considering local VHL disease manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W4290851959,"We studied the structure and attachment modes of the teeth of adult Anoplogaster cornuta using light- and scanning-electron microscopic techniques. All teeth were monocuspid, composed solely of orthodentin, and lacked a covering enameloid cap. Fourteen teeth were present in the oral jaws, with three teeth each on the left and right premaxilla and four teeth each on the left and right dentary. The anteriormost premaxillary and dentary teeth were considerably larger than the more posteriorly located ones. The oral jaw teeth were transparent, non-depressible and firmly ankylosed to their respective dentigerous bone by a largely anosteocytic bone of attachment. No evidence for replacement of the large oral jaw teeth was found in the analyzed adult specimens. The bone of attachment exhibited lower calcium and phosphorus concentrations and a higher Ca/P ratio than the orthodentin. The connection between dentinal tooth shaft and bone of attachment was stabilized by a collar of mineralized collagen fibers. In contrast to the oral jaw teeth, the pharyngeal teeth exhibited a ring-like fibrous attachment to their supporting bones. This mode of attachment provides the teeth with some lateral mobility and allows their depression relative to their supporting bones, which may facilitate intra-pharyngeal prey transport. In contrast, a firm ankylosis was observed in numerous small teeth located on the branchial arches. The function of these teeth is presumably to increase the tightness of the pharyngeal basket and thereby the retention of small prey items in a species living in a habitat with only sparse food supply. Our findings corroborate earlier statements on the tooth attachment modes of the oral jaw teeth of Anoplogaster cornuta , but provide new findings for the attachment modes of pharyngeal teeth in this species."

Further, E186X, a single-nucleotide CIDEC variant is associated with lipodystrophy, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. To establish the unknown mechanistic link between CIDEC and maintenance of systemic glucose homeostasis, we generated transgenic mouse models expressing CIDEC (Ad-CIDECtg) and CIDEC E186X variant (Ad-CIDECmut) transgene specifically in the adipose tissue. We found that Ad-CIDECtg but not Ad-CIDECmut mice were protected against high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance. Furthermore, we revealed the role of CIDEC in lipid metabolism using transcriptomics and lipidomics. Serum triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoproteins were lower in high-fat diet-fed Ad-CIDECtg mice compared to their littermate controls. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CIDEC regulates the enzymatic activity of adipose triglyceride lipase via interacting with its activator, CGI-58, to reduce free fatty acid release and lipotoxicity. In addition, we confirmed that CIDEC is indeed a vital regulator of lipolysis in adipose tissue of obese humans, and treatment with recombinant CIDEC decreased triglyceride breakdown in visceral human adipose tissue. Our study unravels a central pathway whereby adipocyte-specific CIDEC plays a pivotal role in regulating adipose lipid metabolism and whole-body glucose homeostasis. In summary, our findings identify human CIDEC as a potential ‘drug’ or a ‘druggable’ target to reverse obesity-induced lipotoxicity and glucose intolerance.

The identification of new therapeutic avenues aimed at maintaining lipid homeostasis and glucose tolerance is crucial to meet the need for the treatment of obesity and associated comorbidities. Lipolysis of TGs stored in adipose tissue releases fatty acids (FAs) under conditions of metabolic need. Lipolysis of TGs to FFAs and glycerol requires three consecutive steps that involve three different enzymes: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL; also called desnutrin and PNPLA2), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). ATGL is the rate-limiting enzyme for lipolysis in adipocytes and catalyzes the first step of hydrolysis of triglycerides to diacylglycerol (5Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B.

The present study establishes a direct link between human CIDEC and the maintenance of systemic lipid and glucose homeostasis. To investigate the adipose-specific role of human CIDEC and determine its mechanism of action, we generated two innovative transgenic mouse models expressing either full-length or mutant human CIDEC (E186X) in adipose tissue. We performed clinical human and experimental animal model investigations to identify a novel mechanism of CIDEC-mediated regulation of the lipolysis to protect against high-fat diet (HFD)–induced glucose intolerance. Obese human subjects undergoing planned bariatric surgery were recruited for the study; each provided paired subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) samples at baseline, which were partitioned for different experiments. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of all participants. Glycerol release, a measure of lipolysis, was assessed in adipose tissue samples isolated during bariatric surgery. As expected (32Arner P. Differences in lipolysis between human subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues.Ann. Med. 1995; 27: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), higher lipolysis was observed in VAT compared to SAT (Fig. 1A). Given this ∼2.5-fold difference, we measured the expression of lipases ATGL and HSL, which catalyze the breakdown of TGs. Unexpectedly, gene and protein expression of ATGL and HSL revealed no significant difference between VAT and SAT depots (Fig. 1, B–E). This was surprising because ATGL and HSL are major enzymes for lipolysis in adipocytes (33Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S.

Accumulation of visceral fat has been more closely and clinically linked to metabolic dysfunction, and we determined that CIDEC expression was significantly lower in VAT compared to SAT (Fig. 1, F and G).Table 1Clinical characteristics of obese human subjectsParameterObese (n=52)Age (years)41 ± 14Female (%)87.3BMI (kg/m2)44.1 ± 7Waist circumference (cm)123 ± 7Weight (kg)120 ± 18Insulin (mIU/ml)17.1 ± 14Glucose (mg/dl)111 ± 49HbA1C (%)6.1 ± 1.9HOMA-IR6.5 ± 8.5hsCRP (mg/dl)9.0 ± 7.6Triglycerides (mg/dl)121 ± 60Total cholesterol (mg/dl)177 ± 48HDL-C (mg/dl)43.1 ± 10LDL-C (mg/dl)110 ± 37Systolic BP (mmHg)131.1 ± 14Diastolic BP (mmHg)74.5 ± 12Diabetes mellitus (%)35Hypertension (%)40Hypercholesterolemia (%)43Data are mean ± SD.BP, blood pressure.

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of CIDEC-regulated adipose lipolysis and its effect on whole-body metabolism, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing human CIDEC without altering endogenous mouse Cidec expression (Fig. 2A). To generate transgenic animals, a floxed stop codon followed by the human CIDEC expression cassette was inserted into the mouse Rosa26 locus. To generate mice expressing human CIDEC in adipose tissue depots (Ad-CIDECtg), floxed mice were bred with B6.FVB-Tg (Adipoq-cre)1Evdr/J mice from Jackson Laboratory that express Cre recombinase enzyme under the control of mouse adiponectin promoter/enhancer regions (Fig. 2A). Specific primer pairs for human CIDEC and Cre recombinase were used to confirm the presence of either transgene (see Experimental procedures) (Fig. 2B). Mice expressing only human CIDEC were used as floxed controls, whereas mice expressing both human CIDEC and Cre, termed Ad-CIDECtg, were used as experimental models. To validate the adipose-specific expression of CIDEC, we performed quantitative RT-PCR and analyzed relative gene expression levels in various organs of Ad-CIDECtg mice. Quantitative RT-PCR results confirmed that CIDEC was expressed in adipose depots only (i.e., perigonadal, inguinal, and brown adipose depots) (Fig. 2C). CIDEC protein expression was assessed using Western blot analysis in insulin-sensitive organs. The antibody could not distinguish between human and mouse isoforms of CIDEC, so we expected increased expression of CIDEC in adipose tissue depots. Indeed, there was higher expression of total CIDEC protein (approximately 3-fold increase) in adipose depots (Fig. 2D). Ad-CIDECtg and floxed-littermate control mice were fed regular chow or HFD (60% kcal from fat) beginning at 3 months of age. Metabolic phenotyping was performed after 10 weeks of regular chow or HFD feeding. Body weight assessment indicated an almost equal increase in weight among transgenic and control mice (Fig. S1A). The slightly higher weight gain in Ad-CIDECtg mice was not statistically significant. White adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and liver collected after the completion of the metabolic study also did not significantly differ in weight between the same diet groups (Fig. S1B). Differences in food intake (Fig. S1C) and energy intake were not significant between floxed and Ad-CIDECtg mice fed a similar diet (Fig. S1D) nor was fat or lean mass normalized to body weight (Fig. S1, E and F). There was no significant difference in oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide exhalation, respiratory exchange ratio, energy expenditure, or ambulatory activity between Ad-CIDECtg mice and their littermate floxed controls (Fig. S1, G and H and S2). We next evaluated the effect of HFD on glucose homeostasis in Ad-CIDECtg and their floxed-littermate controls. Ad-CIDECtg mice showed significantly higher glucose tolerance in an i.p. glucose tolerance test (GTT) compared to floxed-control mice fed HFD (Fig. 3A). Insulin (0.75 IU/kg) was injected i.p. in fasted mice. Consistent with GTT, Ad-CIDECtg mice exhibited improved insulin tolerance (Fig. 3B). Thus, Ad-CIDECtg mice were protected against HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Measurement of fasting blood glucose revealed a significant reduction in glucose levels in Ad-CIDECtg mice fed HFD (Fig. 3C), indicating improved glucose homeostasis in Ad-CIDECtg mice. Serum leptin levels exhibited a decreasing trend, whereas serum adiponectin was unchanged in HFD-fed Ad-CIDECtg mice (Fig. 3, D and E). The leptin/adiponectin ratio, which positively correlates with type 2 diabetes (35Lopez-Jaramillo P. Gomez-Arbelaez D. Lopez-Lopez J. Lopez-Lopez C. Martinez-Ortega J. Gomez-Rodriguez A. et al.The role of leptin/adiponectin ratio in metabolic syndrome and diabetes.Horm. Mol. Biol. Clin. Investig. 2014; 18: 37-45PubMed Google Scholar), exhibited a decreasing trend in HFD-fed Ad-CIDECtg mice (Fig. 3F). Finally, to assess the effect of adipose tissue–specific expression of human CIDEC on organ-specific insulin sensitivity, mice were injected with insulin (i.p.) and measured AKT phosphorylation. AKT is a nodal protein in the insulin signaling pathway and a measure of insulin signaling in perigonadal adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. Ad-CIDECtg mice, when fed HFD, showed improved AKT phosphorylation in perigonadal adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, suggestive of improved systemic insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3, G and H). Also, we measured insulin levels before and after glucose injection in HFD-fed floxed-controls and Ad-CIDECtg mice. As expected, HFD-fed Ad-CIDECtg mice had slightly lower basal insulin levels compared to HFD-fed floxed-control mice. After the glucose injection, the control group showed higher levels of circulating insulin compared to transgenic mice at 2 min and 5 min time points. However, the significance could not be achieved due to the high level of variability in the insulin levels of floxed-controls compared to the Ad-CIDECtg mice. Subsequent time points showed comparable levels of circulating insulin in both groups. These data suggest that the pancreas is normal in both the groups and Ad-CIDECtg mice are more insulin sensitive when fed a HFD (Fig. S3). Overall, these results led us to conclude that adipose-specific expression of CIDEC regulates whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. To identify changes in gene expression and metabolic pathways triggered by adipose tissue expression of human CIDEC in Ad-CIDECtg mice, we performed RNA-seq analysis in adipose tissue paired with pathway enrichment analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between floxed and Ad-CIDECtg mice were identified using the EdgeR tool. After filtering by p < 0.05 (false discovery rate) and Log2FoldChange>1, we detected 1431 DEGs. Among these, 670 were downregulated and 761 were upregulated. Pathway analysis of these DEGs revealed 26 upregulated pathways (Fig. 4A) and 12 downregulated pathways (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, many upregulated genes were associated with lipid metabolism pathways. A volcano plot depicting upregulated (red), downregulated (blue), and unaltered (gray) DEGs is displayed in Figure 4C. Interestingly, most of the upregulated genes in adipose tissue of Ad-CIDEC"

Whereas most studies focused on 2D-based estimation of static LA volume (LAV), we used a fully-automatic convolutional neural network (CNN) for time-resolved (CINE) volumetry of the whole LA on cardiac MRI (cMRI). Aim was to investigate associations between functional parameters from fully-automated, 3D-based analysis of the LA and current classification schemes in AF.We retrospectively analyzed consecutive AF patients who underwent cMRI on 1.5T systems including a stack of oblique-axial CINE series covering the whole LA. The LA was automatically segmented by a validated CNN. In the resulting volume-time curves, maximum, minimum and LAV before atrial contraction were automatically identified. Active, passive and total LA emptying fractions (LAEF) were calculated and compared to clinical classifications (AF Burden score (AFBS), increased stroke risk (CHA2DS2VASc≥2), AF type (paroxysmal/persistent), EHRA score, and AF risk factors). Moreover, multivariable linear regression models (mLRM) were used to identify associations with AF risk factors.Overall, 102 patients (age 61±9 years, 17% female) were analyzed. Active LAEF (LAEF_active) decreased significantly with an increase of AFBS (minimal: 44.0%, mild: 36.2%, moderate: 31.7%, severe: 20.8%, p<0.003) which was primarily caused by an increase of minimum LAV. Likewise, LAEF_active was lower in patients with increased stroke risk (30.7% vs. 38.9%, p = 0.002). AF type and EHRA score did not show significant differences between groups. In mLRM, a decrease of LAEF_active was associated with higher age (per year: -0.3%, p = 0.02), higher AFBS (per category: -4.2%, p<0.03) and heart failure (-12.1%, p<0.04).Fully-automatic morphometry of the whole LA derived from cMRI showed significant relationships between LAEF_active with increased stroke risk and severity of AFBS. Furthermore, higher age, higher AFBS and presence of heart failure were independent predictors of reduced LAEF_active, indicating its potential usefulness as an imaging biomarker."

These lectures incorporated selected instructional design principles from the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML). Specifically, thirty-two multimedia lectures which differentially employed the signalling, segmenting and embodiment principles from the CTML were delivered to a cohort of 92 students throughout an academic trimester. Engagement with each multimedia lecture was measured in three domains: affective engagement was measured using a Likert-style survey that accompanied each multimedia lecture; behavioural engagement was measured using the web logs provided by YouTube Studio analytics (average watch time); cognitive engagement was measured using students’ average score on a quiz that accompanied each multimedia lecture. Separate multiple linear regression analyses for measures of affective, behavioural and cognitive engagement revealed that multimedia lectures that ‘stacked’ the instructional design principles of embodiment (whereby the lecture was interspersed with clips of an enthusiastic onscreen instructor), segmenting (where lectures were divided into shorter, user-paced segments) and signalling (where onscreen labels highlighted important material) increased measures of engagement, including overall watch time, number of survey submission and number of quiz attempts ( P &lt; 0.05). There was no association between any of the tested principles and students’ quiz scores or their responses on the Likert-style survey. This study adds to the available literature demonstrating the effectiveness of the signalling, segmenting and embodiment principles for increasing learner engagement with multimedia lectures."

Multivariate analysis was performed using the Poisson regression model with a robust variance, observing the hierarchical model proposed and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to obtain the cutoff point for mortality incidence in relation the total length of hospital stay. Significance level was set as p < 0.05. The analyses were conducted using the SAS 9.4 software.The mean hospital mortality rate among the 402 patients involved was 18.4%, and the associations made with the outcome mortality were per relevance: respiratory infection, age over 90 years, high preoperative cardiovascular risk, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as comorbidity, serum hemoglobin level ≤ 10 and other infections. Mortality also showed association with longer total length of hospital stay, as well as with prolonged postoperative period.Hip fractures in the elderly due to osteoporosis indicate a relationship between the sicker profile of the aging elderly population and the prevalence of chronic diseases strongly associated with in-hospital infections, contributing to increased mortality. There were fewer early interventions, and mortality was also associated with prolonged postoperative period. The aim of this study was not to compare independent variables with each other, but suggests the relationship between the presence of comorbidities, which predisposes to the development of infections, directly linked to mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4290852038,"Objectives The pathologic nodal stage of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients is classified according to the number of lymph nodes (LNs), as revised in 2018. Previous studies showed that the LN ratio (LNR) could be also a significant prognostic factor in head and neck cancer, but there are few studies on the LNR in HPV-related [HPV(+)] OPC. The aim of the present study was to analyze the predictive value of the LNR for survival and recurrence in HPV(+) OPC patients. Materials and methods HPV(+) OPC patients treated with surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy from January 2000 to March 2019 were evaluated. The patients were divided into two sets of three groups, according to LN numbers based on pathologic nodal stages, and LNRs by a cutoff value of 0.05. The medical records were reviewed, and the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, locoregional recurrence, and distant metastasis incidence were analyzed. Results Ninty patients were included and the median follow-up period was 38.2 months. There were no significant differences in OS in the LN number groups. However, there was a significant difference in OS in the LNR groups (P = 0.010). The incidence of distant metastasis in the LNR groups was significantly different (P = 0.005). Conclusion The LNR in HPV(+) OPC patients may be a more useful tool to predict survival and distant metastasis than the LN number. Additional research and consensus on surgical pathology are needed before applying the LNR to adjuvant treatment decisions and pathologic nodal staging."

The objective of the present study was to address the genomic status of the British Lop and its relationship with other breeds and identify a small set of genomic markers that uniquely characterize and distinguish British Lop animals. Results have shown that the British Lop is a relatively distinct population with reduced genomic diversity and effective size consistent with its status as a rare breed. Furthermore, we demonstrated the genetic closeness of the British Lop to phenotypically similar breeds such as Landrace and Welsh as well Large White, Middle White and Pietrain. Finally, a set of 75 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms distributed across multiple chromosomes were identified and validated as markers that can consistently distinguish British Lops from other closely related breeds.

In this study, the effects of dulaglutide on glucose-lowering efficacy and changes in renal function were analyzed. Methods This retrospective study involved 197 patients with type 2 diabetes with mild-to-severe CKD treated with dulaglutide for at least 3 months between January 2017 and December 2020 at two tertiary hospitals in Korea. Changes in the creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and HbA1c were compared before and after the use of dulaglutide in each patient. Results The number of patients and mean eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in CKD 2, 3a, 3b, and 4 were 94 (75.0 ± 8.5), 46 (54.8 ± 6.3), 31 (38.8 ± 4.4), and 26 (22.5 ± 5.4), respectively. Mean HbA1c level and body mass index (BMI) at the initiation of dulaglutide were 8.9% ± 1.4% and 29.1 ± 3.6 kg/m 2 , the median duration of the use of dulaglutide was 16 months. The use of dulaglutide was associated with a mean decrease in HbA1c by 0.9% ± 1.5% and the glucose-lowering efficacy was similar across all stages of CKD. Also, it was associated with a reduced decline in the eGFR; the mean eGFR change after the use of dulaglutide was –0.76 mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year, whereas it was –2.41 mL/min/1.73 m 2 before use (paired t -test, P = 0.003). The difference was more pronounced in patients with an eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Subgroup analysis showed that the renal protective effect was better in patients with proteinuria, age ≤ 65 years, and HbA1c &lt; 9.0%, but showed no association with BMI. Conclusions The use of dulaglutide provided adequate glycemic control irrespective of CKD stage and was associated with a reduced decline in the eGFR in the CKD population."

Stool samples were evaluated using a modified Kato-Katz technique. Cure rate (CR) and egg reduction rate (ERR) were assessed at 3 weeks following a 3-day course of 400mg albendazole treatment and infection status were observed again at 6 weeks. Baseline positivity of trichuriasis, ascariasis and hookworm infections were 56.1%, 11.9% and 20.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed age below 18 years old (P = 0.004), without latrine in house (P = 0.042) and indiscriminate defecation (P = 0.032) were associated with STH infections. In the longitudinal study (N = 89), CR for trichuriasis was 64.6%, while CR of 100% was observed for both ascariasis and hookworm. ERR was above 90% for all three STH species. A rapid increased of Trichuris trichiura egg output was observed at 6 weeks. In conclusion, STH infections are highly prevalent among indigenous communities. Children and teenagers, poor sanitation and hygiene behaviour were determinants for STH infections. Triple dose albendazole is found to be efficacious against Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm infections but has moderate curative effect with high ERR against T. trichiura. Although triple dose albendazole regimen has logistic challenges and may not be a routine option, consideration of this treatment regime may still be necessary in selective communities to reduce high intensity of T. trichiura infection."
https://openalex.org/W4290988197,"During translation initiation, the underlying mechanism by which the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G components of eIF4F coordinate their binding activities to regulate eIF4F binding to mRNA is poorly defined. Here, we used fluorescence anisotropy to generate thermodynamic and kinetic frameworks for the interaction of uncapped RNA with human eIF4F. We demonstrate that eIF4E binding to an autoinhibitory domain in eIF4G generates a high-affinity binding conformation of the eIF4F complex for RNA. In addition, we show that the nucleotide-bound state of the eIF4A component further regulates uncapped RNA binding by eIF4F, with a four-fold decrease in the equilibrium dissociation constant observed in the presence versus the absence of ATP. Monitoring uncapped RNA dissociation in real time reveals that ATP reduces the dissociation rate constant of RNA for eIF4F by ∼4-orders of magnitude. Thus, release of ATP from eIF4A places eIF4F in a dynamic state that has very fast association and dissociation rates from RNA. Monitoring the kinetic framework for eIF4A binding to eIF4G revealed two different rate constants that likely reflect two conformational states of the eIF4F complex. Furthermore, we determined that the eIF4G autoinhibitory domain promotes a more stable, less dynamic, eIF4A-binding state, which is overcome by eIF4E binding. Overall, our data support a model whereby eIF4E binding to eIF4G/4A stabilizes a high-affinity RNA-binding state of eIF4F and enables eIF4A to adopt a more dynamic interaction with eIF4G. This dynamic conformation may contribute to the ability of eIF4F to rapidly bind and release mRNA during scanning."
https://openalex.org/W4291397588,"TRIO encodes a cytoskeletal regulatory protein with three catalytic domains-two guanine exchange factor (GEF) domains, GEF1 and GEF2, and a kinase domain-as well as several accessory domains that have not been extensively studied. Function-damaging variants in the TRIO gene are known to be enriched in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Disease variants in the GEF1 domain or the nine adjacent spectrin repeats (SRs) are enriched in NDDs, suggesting that dysregulated GEF1 activity is linked to these disorders. We provide evidence here that the Trio SRs interact intramolecularly with the GEF1 domain to inhibit its enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that SRs 6-9 decrease GEF1 catalytic activity both in vitro and in cells and show that NDD-associated variants in the SR8 and GEF1 domains relieve this autoinhibitory constraint. Our results from chemical cross-linking and bio-layer interferometry indicate that the SRs primarily contact the pleckstrin homology region of the GEF1 domain, reducing GEF1 binding to the small GTPase Rac1. Together, our findings reveal a key regulatory mechanism that is commonly disrupted in multiple NDDs and may offer a new target for therapeutic intervention for TRIO-associated NDDs."
https://openalex.org/W4291617747,"Research concerning rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) and autonomous and controlled motivation within athletic settings is burgeoning. It is proposed that irrational beliefs (i.e., illogical, rigid, and extreme) together with controlled forms of motivation, can determine psychological well-being and physical health in these contexts. For example, research indicates that extreme negative self-evaluation (i.e., self-depreciation) is related to more controlled (less autonomous) motivation regulation, which may underpin poorer health. Though, research is yet to understand the concomitant influence of both irrational beliefs and motivation regulation on work related variables such as presenteeism, persistence and turnover intention, as well as non-work-related variables such as life satisfaction and mental-wellbeing. The present two study paper examines the latent profile structure of irrational beliefs and motivation regulation, and how these latent profiles relate to health and work-related variables. Across studies 1 and 2, results indicated a two-class profile whereby class 1 is characterised by low irrational beliefs and high self-determined motivation ( low irrational engagement ), and class 2 is characterised by high irrational beliefs and low self-determined motivation ( high irrational engagement ). Those in Class 2 reported poorer life satisfaction, persistence, and presenteeism, as well as greater depression, anxiety, stress, intention to quit, and absenteeism than those in class 1. Thus, findings indicate that poorer work and health outcomes are associated with greater irrational work engagement. The findings are discussed in relation to the practical implications for occupational workers."
https://openalex.org/W4291617749,"Although it is well established that cosmetic makeup enhances perceived facial attractiveness, few studies have examined whether facial makeup modulates neural responses to face images. This study investigated behavioral and attractiveness-related brain responses to self-applied makeup, focusing on the N170, early posterior negativity, P300, and late positive potential components of event-related brain potentials. A total of 77 Japanese women participated in two experiments (N = 34 and 43 for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). Experiment 1 assessed the effects of self-applied makeup on attractiveness-related event-related potential amplitudes using facial images during a makeup identification task in which makeup was directly relevant to task demands. Experiment 2 examined the effects of self-applied makeup using images of one's own face and another female's face when performing a gender classification task, where the presence of makeup had no explicit connection to facial gender classification. In both experiments, faces with makeup were rated as more attractive and elicited more negative early posterior negativity and more positive late positive potential components, regardless of the participant's own face or another person's face. These findings suggest that people are spontaneously motivated to pay visual attention to faces with makeup, which supports the idea that makeup adds reward value to the facial appearance of the human. Moreover, neural evidence empirically confirmed that the benefits of makeup are not just limited to how others see your face but also extend to how you see your own face."

Therefore, various play-based interventions have been developed to support those developmental areas of autistic children. Although researchers have previously reported the overall effectiveness of different types of play-based interventions on the social communication and language skills of autistic children, no previous systematic reviews have yet evaluated the effectiveness of parent-mediated play-based interventions in preschool autistic children. The overarching aims of the study will be to (i) report the key characteristics and (ii) synthesise the results of studies evaluating parent-mediated play-based interventions targeting the social communication and language skills of preschool autistic children using experimental designs. A comprehensive search for and screening of the relevant studies published between 2000 and 2021 will be undertaken. To be included, studies will have to (i) use either a randomised control trial or quasi-experimental design, (ii) focus on preschool autistic children aged six years old or younger, (iii) deliver a play-based intervention in non-educational settings, and (iv) include at least one parent as the mediator of the intervention. Data extraction of all included studies will be undertaken using a specially devised template and they will also be assessed for risk of bias using an adapted form from the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The overall characteristics of the included studies will be reported and a narrative synthesis of the results of the included studies will be undertaken. A meta-analysis may be performed (if justified) to report the pooled effect size of the parent-mediated play-based interventions on the social communication and language skills of preschool autistic children. Trial registration: The current study protocol was pre-registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022302220)."
https://openalex.org/W4291905256,"Given the concern over contact allergy risk associated with aromatherapy, information regarding the use of essential oils (EOs) is crucial for consumer dermal exposure assessment. In this study we mainly aim to describe the usage patterns of EOs among Chinese consumers to provide important data for exposure assessment to fragrance allergens in EOs. A web survey was conducted in April 2020 among 1,518 potential Chinese EO consumers to assess consumer usage patterns. The usage patterns of 11 types of EOs were collected among female consumers (N = 457; ages 0–70). For females aged 0–14, they used Lavanda (42.9%) and Tea tree (57.1%) oils only. Among the senior age groups (15–70), Lavanda oil was the most used EO with 46.7%, 51%, 68.1%, and 50% for females aged 15–24, 25–39, 40–59 and 60–70, respectively. The majority of females aged 25–59 used Rose, Lavanda, Sandalwood, Frankincense and Jasmine oil on their whole face more than three times a week at diverse dilution rates. Usage patterns are described for all age groups. In consideration of usage pattern of females aged 25–59, co-exposure to fragrance allergens contained in EOs and cosmetics could make them vulnerable to contact allergy. This study provides valuable information for dermal exposure assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4291907973,"Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) is a noninvasive repetitive brain stimulation protocol that suppresses the excitability of the primary motor cortex. It induces cerebral cortical inhibition by increasing inhibitory interneuronal excitability that is associated with increases in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in the stimulated cortices. cTBS has been applied in the rehabilitation of stroke patients to modulate interhemispheric imbalance. However, the precise mechanisms of cTBS in remote brain areas remain uncertain. We evaluated cTBS-induced GABA level changes in bilateral sensorimotor cortices using GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy, alternations of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and resting-state networks (RSNs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 24 healthy right-handed adults (mean age: 34.4 ± 5.0 years). GABA levels in the stimulated left hemisphere significantly increased from baseline (p = 0.013), which was comparable with those of previous reports. GABA levels in the unstimulated right hemisphere showed a trend decrease. cTBS induced a significant decrease in right hand-MEP amplitudes (22.06% ± 43.50%) from baseline (p = 0.026) in accordance with GABA concentrations. However, multiple RSNs, including the default mode and primary motor networks, did not show any obvious differences between pre- and post-stimulus comparisons in the sensorimotor network using the dual regression approach. These results suggest that cTBS simultaneously increases ipsilateral GABA in the stimulated left hemisphere and decreases contralateral GABA in the unstimulated right hemisphere. Neuromodulation following cTBS may be associated with the interhemispheric inhibition because of alterations in GABA levels between the stimulated and unstimulated cortices."
https://openalex.org/W4290988112,"Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway that converts the polyamine synthesis byproduct 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) into methionine. Inactivation of MTAP, often by homozygous deletion, is found in both solid and hematologic malignancies and is one of the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer. Previous work established that MTAP-deleted cells accumulate MTA and contain decreased amounts of proteins with symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA). These findings led to the hypothesis that accumulation of intracellular MTA inhibits the protein arginine methylase (PRMT5) responsible for bulk protein sDMAylation. Here, we confirm that MTAP-deleted cells have increased MTA accumulation and reduced protein sDMAylation. However, we also show that addition of extracellular MTA can cause a dramatic reduction of the steady-state levels of sDMA-containing proteins in MTAP+ cells, even though no sustained increase in intracellular MTA is found because of catabolism of MTA by MTAP. We determined that inhibition of protein sDMAylation by MTA occurs within 48 h, is reversible, and is specific. In addition, we have identified two enhancer-binding proteins, FUBP1 and FUBP3, that are differentially sDMAylated in response to MTAP and MTA. These proteins work via the far upstream element site located upstream of Myc and other promoters. Using a transcription reporter construct containing the far upstream element site, we demonstrate that MTA addition can reduce transcription, suggesting that the reduction in FUBP1 and FUBP3 sDMAylation has functional consequences. Overall, our findings show that extracellular MTA can inhibit protein sDMAylation and that this inhibition can affect FUBP function."
https://openalex.org/W4290997059,"The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP A1 is a nucleocytoplasmic-shuttling RNA-binding protein that plays an important role in nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression regulation. The function of hnRNP A1 is determined in part by its specific location within the cell. Although some work has been done to elucidate the signaling pathways that regulate the cellular localization of hnRNP A1, the precise mechanism(s), including physiological and pathophysiological conditions that alter hnRNP A1 localization, are not known. We previously conducted an unbiased RNAi-based kinome-wide screen to identify kinases that regulate hnRNP A1 localization during hypertonic stress. One of the hits from this screen is AMPK-related protein kinase 5 (ARK5). Here, we validate ARK5 as the kinase responsible for controlling hnRNP A1 subcellular localization in response to hypertonic stress. We find using immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay methods that ARK5 directly interacts with and phosphorylates hnRNP A1 on serine residues within the F-peptide region. We further show that the M9 motif of hnRNP A1 is essential for the ARK5-hnRNP A1 interaction and subsequent phosphorylation. In addition, the silencing of ARK5 increases the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL and consequently delays caspase activation during hypertonic stress. Our results indicate that ARK5 phosphorylates hnRNP A1 and regulates its subcellular localization during hypertonic stress."
https://openalex.org/W4291145333,"Abstract The cellular prion protein PrP C partners with caveolin-1 (CAV1) in neurodegenerative diseases but whether this interplay occurs in cancer has never been investigated. By leveraging patient and cell line datasets, we uncover a molecular link between PrP C and CAV1 across cancer. Using cell-based assays, we show that PrP C regulates the expression of and interacts with CAV1. PrP C additionally controls the expression of the amyloid precursor protein APP and of the Aβ generating enzyme BACE1, and regulates the levels of Aβ, whose accumulation is a central event in Alzheimer’s disease. We further identify DKK1 and DKK3, involved in both Alzheimer’s disease and cancer progression, as targets of the PrP C -dependent axis. Finally, we establish that antibody-mediated blocking of the Aβ-PrP C interaction delays the growth of prostate cancer cell line-derived xenografts and prevents the development of metastases. Our data additionally support an enrichment of the Aβ-PrP C -dependent pathway in the basal subtype of prostate cancer, associated with anti-hormonal therapy resistance, and in mesenchymal colon cancer, associated with poor prognosis. Thus, based on a parallel with neurodegenerative diseases, our results bring to light an Aβ-PrP C axis and support the potential of targeting this pathway in patients with selected subtypes of prostate and colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4291214644,"Abstract Transcriptomic analyses of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have identified two major epithelial subtypes with distinct biology and clinical behaviours. Here, we aimed to clarify the role of FGFR1 and FGFR4 in the definition of aggressive PDAC phenotypes. We found that the expression of FGFR4 is exclusively detected in epithelial cells, significantly elevated in the classical PDAC subtype, and associates with better outcomes. In highly aggressive basal-like/squamous PDAC, reduced FGFR4 expression aligns with hypermethylation of the gene and lower levels of histone marks associated with active transcription in its regulatory regions. Conversely, FGFR1 has more promiscuous expression in both normal and malignant pancreatic tissues and is strongly associated with the EMT phenotype but not with the basal-like cell lineage. Regardless of the genetic background, the increased proliferation of FGFR4-depleted PDAC cells correlates with hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Downregulation of FGFR4 in classical cell lines invariably leads to the enrichment of basal-like/squamous gene programs and is associated with either partial or full switch of phenotype. In sum, we show that endogenous levels of FGFR4 limit the malignant phenotype of PDAC cells. Finally, we propose FGFR4 as a valuable marker for the stratification of PDAC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4291617773,"Halocynthia aurantium is a marine organism that has been considered a promising source for bio-functional materials. Total lipids were extracted from H. aurantium tunic, and then they were separated into neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids. In the present study, fatty acid profiles of three lipids and their anti-inflammatory effects in RAW264.7 cells were investigated. Among the lipid classes, phospholipids showed the diversity of fatty acid constituents, compared with the glycolipids and neutral lipids. Three lipids contain different contents of fatty acids depending on the kinds of lipids. The most contents were saturated fatty acids (SFAs, 53-69% of the fatty acids) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, 15-17% of fatty acids) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, 14-32% of fatty acids) are followed. H. aurantium lipids not only dose-dependently inhibited nitric oxide production but also reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. It was also demonstrated that the expression of COX-2 was dose-dependently suppressed. Moreover, H. aurantium lipids decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB p-65, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK, suggesting that three lipids from H. aurantium tunic provide anti-inflammatory effects through NF-κB and MAPK signaling. These results indicate that H. aurantium is a potential source for anti-inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4291676775,"Malaria is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year. The lack of an effective vaccine and the global spread of multidrug resistant parasites hampers the fight against the disease and underlines the need for new antimalarial drugs. Central to the pathogenesis of malaria is the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites within human erythrocytes. Parasites invade erythrocytes via a coordinated sequence of receptor-ligand interactions between the parasite and the host cell. Posttranslational modifications such as protein phosphorylation are known to be key regulators in this process and are mediated by protein kinases. For several parasite kinases, including the Plasmodium falciparum glycogen synthase kinase 3 (PfGSK3), inhibitors have been shown to block erythrocyte invasion. Here, we provide an assessment of PfGSK3 function by reverse genetics. Using targeted gene disruption, we show the active gene copy, PfGSK3β, is not essential for asexual blood stage proliferation, although it modulates efficient erythrocyte invasion. We found functional inactivation leads to a 69% decreased growth rate and confirmed this growth defect by rescue experiments with wildtype and catalytically inactive mutants. Functional knockout of PfGSK3β does not lead to transcriptional upregulation of the second copy of PfGSK3. We further analyze expression, localization, and function of PfGSK3β during gametocytogenesis using a parasite line allowing conditional induction of sexual commitment. We demonstrate PfGSK3β-deficient gametocytes show a strikingly malformed morphology leading to the death of parasites in later stages of gametocyte development. Taken together, these findings are important for our understanding and the development of PfGSK3 as an antimalarial target."
https://openalex.org/W4291787610,"Mechanical loading on the skeleton stimulates bone formation. Although the exact mechanism underlying this process remains unknown, a growing body of evidence indicates that the Wnt signaling pathway is necessary for the skeletal response to loading. Recently, we showed that Wnts produced by osteoblast lineage cells mediate the osteo-anabolic response to tibial loading in adult mice. Here, we report that Wnt1 specifically plays a crucial role in mediating the mechano-adaptive response to loading. Independent of loading, short-term loss of Wnt1 in the Osx-lineage resulted in a decreased cortical bone area in the tibias of 5-month-old mice. In females, strain-matched loading enhanced periosteal bone formation in Wnt1F/F controls, but not in Wnt1F/F; OsxCreERT2 knockouts. In males, strain-matched loading increased periosteal bone formation in both control and knockout mice; however, the periosteal relative bone formation rate was 65% lower in Wnt1 knockouts versus controls. Together, these findings show that Wnt1 supports adult bone homeostasis and mediates the bone anabolic response to mechanical loading."
https://openalex.org/W4291798890,"The social structure of estuarine-resident bottlenose dolphins is complex and varied. Residing in habitats often utilized for resource exploitation, dolphins are at risk due to anthropogenic pressures while still federally protected. Effective conservation is predicated upon accurate abundance estimates. In North Carolina, two estuarine-resident stocks (demographically independent groups) of common bottlenose dolphin have been designated using spatiotemporal criteria. Both stocks are subjected to bycatch in fishing gear. The southern North Carolina estuarine stock was estimated at <200 individuals from surveys in 2006, which is outdated per US guidelines. Thus, we conducted a new capture-mark-recapture survey in 2018, identifying 547 distinct individuals, about three times higher than the prior abundance estimate. We compared those individuals to our long-term photo-identification catalog (1995-2018, n = 2,423 individuals), matching 228 individuals. Of those 228, 65 were also included in the 2013 abundance estimate for the northern North Carolina estuarine stock. Using sighting histories for all individuals in the long-term catalog, we conducted a social network analysis, which is independent of a priori stock assignments. The three primary clusters identified were inconsistent with current stock designations and not defined by spatiotemporal distribution. All three clusters had sighting histories in the estuary and on the coast, however, that with the highest within-cluster associations appeared to use estuarine waters more often. The within-cluster association strength was low for one cluster, possibly due to only part of that cluster inhabiting the southern North Carolina estuarine system. Between-cluster differences occurred in infestation rates by the pseudostalked barnacle, Xenobalanus globicipitis, but that did not predict clusters. We suggest the need to re-evaluate the stock structure of estuarine-resident common bottlenose dolphins in North Carolina and currently have insufficient information to assign an abundance estimate to a currently designated stock."
https://openalex.org/W4291900983,"As a key approach to mediate cholesterol metabolism, the role of the CYP27A1/27-HC axis in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. Analysis of CYP27A1 expression from public databases and metastatic cases in our center suggested that CYP27A1 was obviously downregulated in RCC tissues, and survival analysis further showed its correlation with favorable clinicopathological features and prognosis. In vitro, up and downregulation of CYP27A1 expression in RCC cell lines could definitely illustrate its anticipation involving apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, migration, and clonality. This could be achieved through upregulation of 27-HC concentration, which mediates the activation of signaling pathways of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Further, recovery of CYP27A1 expression could definitely inhibit the proliferation of RCC tumors in vivo. This is the first study to explore the role of the CYP27A1/27-HC axis in RCC. Attempts to maintain the normal function of the axis may be a potential strategy in the treatment of RCC, and the predictive value of CYP27A1 detection on the efficacy of targeted therapy in metastatic RCC is also worthy of attention."
https://openalex.org/W4290852053,"Aims of the study Since 2014, the Swiss Hepatitis Strategy (SHS) has targeted the elimination of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in Switzerland. The epidemiology of HCV is diverse across Swiss cantons, therefore cantonal-level screening and treatment strategies should be developed. This study aimed to identify scenarios to achieve HCV elimination in the canton of Bern by 2030. Methods A preexisting Markov disease burden model was populated with data for Bern, and used to forecast the current and future prevalence of HCV, annual liver-related deaths (LRDs), and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and decompensated cirrhosis until 2030. Scenarios were developed to assess the current standard of care and potential long-term impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the HCV infected population. Additionally, potential scenarios for achieving the WHO 2030 targets and the SHS 2025 and 2030 targets (reduction of new cases of HCV, HCV-related mortality and viremic HCV cases) were identified. Results In 2019, there were an estimated 4,600 (95% UI: 3,330–4,940) viremic infections in the canton of Bern and 57% (n = 2,600) of viremic cases were diagnosed. This modelling forecasted a 10% increase in LRDs (28 in 2020 to 31 in 2030) with the current standard of care and a 50% increase in LRDs in a scenario assuming long-term delays. To achieve the WHO and SHS targets, the canton of Bern needs to increase the annual number of patients diagnosed (from 90 in 2019 to 250 per year in 2022–2024 [WHO], or 500 per year in 2022–2025 [SHS]) and treated (from 130 in 2019 to 340 per year in 2022–2024 [WHO] or 670 per year in 2022–2025 [SHS]). Conclusions The SHS goals and the WHO targets for HCV elimination can be achieved in the Swiss canton of Bern by 2030; however, not at the current pace of screening, linkage to care and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4290852061,"Among Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) which generally cause opportunistic infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts, Mycobacterium simiae (M. simiae) is one of the most important NTM, associated with pulmonary disease. The main concern about M. simiae infections is the extreme resistance of this NTM to antibiotics. There are limited studies about drug susceptibility testing (DST) and the causes of drug resistance in M. simiae. Hence, the current study aimed to identify the M. simiae isolates and to assess the drug resistance of the isolates using phenotypic and molecular methods.In this study, 50 clinical pulmonary isolates suspected of NTM were collected from regional tuberculosis reference laboratories in Iran. The isolates were identified as M. simiae by using standard biochemical tests and molecular methods. DST was performed for identified M. simiae isolates and additional 35 M. simiae isolates from the department archive, against eight drugs. The mutations in gyrA, gyrB, and rrl genes in clarithromycin and moxifloxacin resistant isolates were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing.Out of 50 suspected NTM isolates, 25 isolates were detected as M. simiae species based on the biochemical tests, and 18 isolates were verified based on the rpoB gene sequence analysis to achieve a total of 53 isolates when the archive isolates were included. DST results showed that all 53 isolates were resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, and clofazimine. The rate of resistance to ethambutol and linezolid were 34 (64%), and 40 (76%) respectively. The highest susceptibility rate was demonstrated for amikacin 53 (100%) and clarithromycin 45(85%), followed by moxifloxacin 35(66%). Sequence analysis showed mutations in positions 2058 and 2059 of the rrl gene, as well non-synonymous mutation at codons 389, 444, and 571 of the gyrB gene. Sequence analysis showed no mutation in the gyrA gene. drug-resistant isolates with mutations showed higher MICs compared to non-mutant resistant isolates.This study revealed amikacin, clarithromycin, and moxifloxacin as the most effective antibiotics. However, since M. simiae exhibited a high level of antibiotic resistance in vitro, therefore, species identification and determining the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates are essential before treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4291397887,"The activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is determined by the expression and localization of the regulatory B-subunits. PP2A-B56α is the dominant isoform of the B'-family in the heart. Its role in regulating the cardiac response to β-adrenergic stimulation is not yet fully understood. We therefore generated mice deficient in B56α to test the functional cardiac effects in response to catecholamine administration versus corresponding WT mice. We found the decrease in basal PP2A activity in hearts of KO mice was accompanied by a counter-regulatory increase in the expression of B' subunits (β and γ) and higher phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ regulatory and myofilament proteins. The higher phosphorylation levels were associated with enhanced intraventricular pressure and relaxation in catheterized KO mice. In contrast, at the cellular level, we detected depressed Ca2+ transient and sarcomere shortening parameters in KO mice at basal conditions. Consistently, the peak amplitude of the L-type Ca2+ current was reduced and the inactivation kinetics of ICaL were prolonged in KO cardiomyocytes. However, we show β-adrenergic stimulation resulted in a comparable peak amplitude of Ca2+ transients and myocellular contraction between KO and WT cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we propose higher isoprenaline-induced Ca2+ spark frequencies might facilitate the normalized Ca2+ signaling in KO cardiomyocytes. In addition, the application of isoprenaline was associated with unchanged L-type Ca2+ current parameters between both groups. Our data suggest an important influence of PP2A-B56α on the regulation of Ca2+ signaling and contractility in response to β-adrenergic stimulation in the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W4291564171,"The dorsal hippocampus plays a pivotal role in spatial memory. However, the role of subregion-specific molecular pathways in spatial cognition remains unclear. We observed that the transcriptional coregulator C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) presented CA3-specific enrichment in expression. RNAi interference of CtBP2 in the dorsal CA3 (dCA3) neurons, but not the ventral CA3 (vCA3), specifically impaired spatial reference memory and reduced the expression of GluR2, the calcium permeability determinant subunit of AMPA receptors. Application of an antagonist for GluR2-absent calcium permeable AMPA receptors rescued spatial memory deficits in dCA3 CtBP2 knockdown animals. Transcriptomic analysis suggest that CtBP2 may regulate GluR2 protein level through post-translational mechanisms, especially by the endocytosis pathway which regulates AMPA receptor sorting. Consistently, CtBP2 deficiency altered the mRNA expression of multiple endocytosis-regulatory genes, and CtBP2 knockdown in primary hippocampal neurons enhanced GluR2-containing AMPA receptor endocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence that the dCA3 regulates spatial reference memory by the CtBP2/GluR2 pathway through the modulation of calcium permeable AMPA receptors."

Maternal and Child Health (MCH) continuum provides a great opportunity for postpartum FP (PPFP) interventions integration especially antenatal targeted FP information giving and gauging of fertility intentions. However, there is no protocol for structured, targeted antenatal FP information giving and behavioural contracting to influence postpartum fertility intentions of mothers before delivery. Knowledge gap regarding fertility intentions and best antenatal strategies for postpartum FP still exists. The available evidence differs across settings and demography. Equally, there has been inadequate exploration of operationally-feasible ways to integrate FP counselling into existing ANC services with limited number of methodologically rigorous trials. The current protocol will therefore examine the effectiveness of targeted antenatal family planning information provision on early postpartum FP uptake using a randomized control trial in Kisumu County, Kenya. The protocol will assess socio-cultural beliefs towards PPFP and perceived individual control of PPFP choice, analyze knowledge and intention for PPFP, and finally compare and examine the determinants of PPFP uptake between study groups. Through simple sampling, a group of 246 antenatal mothers will be randomly assigned to control, community and facility intervention groups as per eligibility criteria in the study facilities. After at least 3 months of intervention and postpartum follow-up, clinical superiority will be used to gauge which intervention was effective and the model superiority. Questionnaire and Case Report Forms will be the main source of data. The participant will form the unit of analysis which will be by intention to treat. Bivariate analysis will be applied as the selection criteria for inclusion of predictors of intention and uptake in the final logistic regression model. Odds Ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be used to demonstrate significance and the strength of association between selected variables. Dissemination will be through conference presentations and peer reviewed journals. The trial has been registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry PACTR202109586388973 on the 28 th September 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4291617752,"Hydrosalpinx is a chronic inflammatory condition with high recurrence rate, and it is reported among female population having fallopian tubal factor infertility. Previously, we have reported that interventional ultrasound sclerotherapy improves endometrial receptivity and pregnancy rate with negligible adverse effects in patients suffering from hydrosalpinx. During present investigation, we have used next generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize the isomiR profiles from the endometrium of patients suffering from hydrosalpinx before and after interventional ultrasound sclerotherapy. Our results indicated that miRNA arm shift and switch remained unaffected when compared in patients before and after interventional ultrasound sclerotherapy. We observed that isomiRs with trimming at 3' and isomiRs with canonical sequences were lower in post-treatment than in pre-treatment group. Gene ontology (GO) annotation and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the expression of mature mir-30 was significantly lower in the pre-treatment as compared to post treatment group while the expression of mir-30 isomiR was 4.26-fold higher in pre-treatment when compared with the post-treatment group. These different expression patterns of mir-30 mature miRNA and mir-30 isomiRs in two groups are affecting the physiological function of the endometrium. Our results suggested that differential isomiR distribution in hydrosalpinx patients before and after treatment plays an important role in hydrosalpinx incidence and can help in designing novel strategy for the treatment of hydrosalpinx in female population."
https://openalex.org/W4291617887,"Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a history of recurrent ectopic pregnancy (EP) on pregnancy outcomes of subsequent in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Methods A retrospective cohort study involving 457 women with a history of recurrent EP (REP group), 912 women with a history of single EP (SEP group), and 1169 women with a history of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP group) as the control group, was conducted. IVF outcomes were compared for each cohort. Results The incidence of EP in the REP group after IVF treatment was significantly lower than those in the SEP group (2.4% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.011), and similar to those in the IUP group (2.4% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.830). No significant differences were observed in the clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and live birth rate among the three groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrent EP rate between the salpingectomy and salpingostomy treatments. Adjusting for maternal and treatment factors did not influence live birth rates for women with previous REP compared with women with previous SEP and those with IUP. The odds of EP were 82.2% lower (OR 0.178, 95% CI 0.042–0.762; P = 0.020) in women who had blastocyst transfer compared with cleavage embryo transfer in the SEP group. The odds of EP were over six times (OR 6.260, 95% CI 1.255–31.220; P = 0.025) in women who underwent double embryo transfer as opposed to single embryo transfer in the IUP group. Conclusion Our results indicate that women with previous recurrent EP have a lower risk of EP after IVF in comparison with women with previous single EP. Previous EP has no significant adverse effect on the main IVF outcomes. The salpingostomy and salpingectomy treatments of EP do not significantly affect the incidence of recurrent EP after IVF."
https://openalex.org/W4291798893,"Temperature can have influences on the toxicities and efficacies of insecticides. Therefore, it is important to accurately evaluate the temperature effect (TE) on the toxicities of insecticides to insects. Previous studies have shown that the pre-exposure of insects to temperatures before their contact with insecticides, caused variations in their toxicities. However, most of these studies focused on the TE of the insecticides post-treatment. In this study we hypothesized that pre-exposure time of insect at different temperature can influence the toxicities of insecticides. We then evaluated the influence of different pre-exposure time (0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h) on toxicities of three different temperature effect insecticides (TEIs) to Apolygus lucorum at 15, 25 and 35°C respectively. We found that all toxicities of three TEIs to A. lucorum did not vary with pre-exposure time at 25°C. The LC50 of hexaflumuron (positive TEI) only decreased (from 1800.06 to 237.40 mg/L) at 15°C, with an increase in the pre-exposure time. Whereas the LC50 of β-cypermethrin (negative TEI) decreased from 225.43 to 60.79 mg/L at 35°C. These results also showed that the temperature coefficients (TCs) of the toxicities were influenced by pre-exposure time at different temperatures. For hexaflumuron, all the TCs at 25°C and 35°C decreased, as the pre-exposure time increased. For β-cypermethrin, the TCs decreased significantly only at 35°C. The toxicity and TCs of phoxim (non-effect TEI) showed no obvious fluctuation at the tested temperatures. These results showed that when the pre-exposure times were extended, the toxicities of the positive / negative TEI showed an increase at the temperature where the pest was less sensitive to the insecticides. These results can be applied to determine the toxicities / bioactivities of different insecticides accurately at different temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W4291906463,"Confounding by indication is a serious threat to comparative studies using real world data. We assessed the utility of automated data-adaptive analytic approach for confounding adjustment when both claims and clinical registry data are available.We used a comparative study example of carotid artery stenting (CAS) vs. carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 2005-2008 when CAS was only indicated for patients with high surgical risk. We included Medicare beneficiaries linked to the Society for Vascular Surgery's Vascular Registry >65 years old undergoing CAS/CEA. We compared hazard ratios (HRs) for death while adjusting for confounding by combining various 1) Propensity score (PS) modeling strategies (investigator-specified [IS-PS] vs. automated data-adaptive [ada-PS]); 2) data sources (claims-only, registry-only and claims-plus-registry); and 3) PS adjustment approaches (matching vs. quintiles-adjustment with/without trimming). An HR of 1.0 was used as a benchmark effect estimate based on CREST trial.The cohort included 1,999 CAS and 3,255 CEA patients (mean age 76). CAS patients were more likely symptomatic and at high surgical risk, and experienced higher mortality (crude HR = 1.82 for CAS vs. CEA). HRs from PS-quintile adjustment without trimming were 1.48 and 1.52 for claims-only IS-PS and ada-PS, 1.51 and 1.42 for registry-only IS-PS and ada-PS, and 1.34 and 1.23 for claims-plus-registry IS-PS and ada-PS, respectively. Estimates from other PS adjustment approaches showed similar patterns.In a comparative effectiveness study of CAS vs. CEA with strong confounding by indication, ada-PS performed better than IS-PS in general, but both claims and registry data were needed to adequately control for bias."
https://openalex.org/W4291907543,"Solving the problems that replication forks encounter when synthesizing DNA is essential to prevent genomic instability. Besides their role in DNA repair in the G2 phase, several homologous recombination proteins, specifically RAD51, have prominent roles in the S phase. Using different cellular models, RAD51 has been shown not only to be present at ongoing and arrested replication forks but also to be involved in nascent DNA protection and replication fork restart. Through pharmacological inhibition, here we study the specific role of RAD51 in the S phase. RAD51 inhibition in non-transformed cell lines did not have a significant effect on replication fork progression under non-perturbed conditions, but when the same cells were subjected to replication stress, RAD51 became necessary to maintain replication fork progression. Notably, the inhibition or depletion of RAD51 did not compromise fork integrity when subjected to hydroxyurea treatment. RAD51 inhibition also did not decrease the ability to restart, but rather compromised fork progression during reinitiation. In agreement with the presence of basal replication stress in human colorectal cancer cells, RAD51 inhibition reduced replication fork speed in these cells and increased γH2Ax foci under control conditions. These alterations could have resulted from the reduced association of DNA polymerase α to chromatin, as observed when inhibiting RAD51. It may be possible to exploit the differential dependence of non-transformed cells versus colorectal cancer cells on RAD51 activity under basal conditions to design new therapies that specifically target cancer cells."
