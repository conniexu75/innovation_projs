https://openalex.org/W2069535294,"(Z)- 5-(1-Decenyl)dihydro-2(3H)-furanone, isolated from virgin female Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica) attracted males of the species infield bioassays. However, the synthesized racemic mixture of this compound did not attract male Japanese beetles. The Z and E isomers and the saturated analog of both enantiomers of this compound were synthesized stereospecifically. Pure synthetic (R,Z)-5-(1-decenyl)dihydro-2(3H)-furanone was competitive with live females and with the pheromone isolated from live females in attracting males. Male response was strongly inhibited by small amounts of the S,Z isomer. Although the E isomer and the saturated analog of the pheromone are present in the material obtained from females, the role of these compounds in mediating the insect's behavior is unclear."

Aggressive intervention is more likely against a solitary male than against a group, and forced copulations are more likely immediately after a rape and especially when the rape appears to have been successful. This behavior pattern reflects, strategies consistent with maximizing individual male fitness."

Phytopathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas phaseolicola and Pseudomonas tomato, did not adhere to the plant cell wall nor were they encapsulated. Bean lectins may be involved in the attachment and encapsulation processes."

https://openalex.org/W2018215424,A rocket-borne spectrograph detected H I Lyman alpha emission from the disk of Saturn and from the vicinity of the planet. The signal is consistent with an emission brightness of 700 rayleighs for the disk and 200 rayleighs for the vicinity of Saturn. The emission from the vicinity of the planet may be due to a hydrogen atmosphere associated with the saturnian ring system.

Comparisons between referable fossil and extant taxa indicate a high level of phytochemical fidelity. The preservation of O-glycosides indicates a mild postdepositional environment during fossilization."

This fracture zone is the eastern analog of the Vema fracture zone, with its associated troughs, and of the Barracuda Fault. The Guinea fracture zone marks the northern boundary on the African coast of a wide zone of left lateral shear in the equatorial Atlantic."

Thermolytic rates and products for various regimes, as determined by gas chromatography—mass spectroscopy, indicate the potential usefulness of flavonoids as thermometric indicators in sediments. The parametric factors affecting flavonoid stability are used to geochemically characterize angiosperm ""green leaves"" (36 to 25 × 106 years old) from Succor Creek and indicate that these sediments have not experienced temperatures higher than 80°C or extreme pH shifts (beyond the range 6.3 to 7.2) during postdepositional maturation."

The highest eupelagic clay rates for the Atlantic found to date are in the Argentine Basin, and the lowest are on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge."
https://openalex.org/W2081848935,"New research orientations are emerging in behavioral science approaches to agricultural development. These new orientations are the product of both experience gained during the era that followed the Green Revolution and a response to changing goals in agricultural development that now place a greater emphasis on considerations of participation and equity. They also reflect a more general concern with the relation of technology and society growing out of efforts to understand energy and environmental problems. These orientations are characterized by a shift away from a conceptual perspective emphasizing communication to one in which technology and social organization are deemed essential in understanding and promoting agricultural development. This changing conceptual perspective is being manifested in the research process from which technology develops. Use of ecological systems approaches to the study of farming systems is increasing. The importance of understanding traditional agriculture is becoming evident and technology development methodologies are beginning to simulate farm conditions at the research center and to conduct experimental research on the farm. The appreciation of technology as a variable is leading to the development of alternative technologies adapted to different socionatural situations. As these emerging orientations become elaborated, they enhance the contributions which behavioral scientists can make to agricultural development."
https://openalex.org/W2043360585,"Single crystals of oxalic acid dihydrate are difficult to grow from pure water solution, but good single crystals of the material may be obtained by growth from mixtures of acetone and water. The solvent markedly affects the crystal habit. Crystals grown in mixtures of acetone and water develop the prismatic habit, while those grown in water alone develop the tabular or equant habit. The forms {001}, {110}, and {101} predominate in all cases. Single crystals of anhydrous oxalic acid may also be grown from solution in glacial acetic acid, although specimens more than 2 centimeters in length are difficult to produce."
https://openalex.org/W2084249292,"A discussion showed that the wood products industry now derives 1 quadrillion Btu, or 40% of its total energy needs, from burning bark and mill wastes. ERDA funding for studies on the conversion of biomass to liquid and gaseous fuels is at the $9.7 million level compared with $300 million for coal-based synthetic fuels. The California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission has developed a gasifier which can convert any kind of dry agricultural or wood wastes to low-Btu gas with an efficiency of 80 to 85%. This gasifier has an immediate potential for displacing 0.1 quadrillion Btu of oil and natural gas in California alone. According to a study by Stanford Research Institute, 277 million tons/y of US agricultural residues are potentially collectable as well as an additional 26 million tons/y of manure. According to a study by Battelle Memorial Institute, ethanol produced from biomass (e.g., sugarcane and sweet sorghum) in a full-scale plant could sell for $1.00 to $1.25/gal compared with about $1.15/gal for ethanol produced from ethylene. Other aspects of the use of biomass as fuel are also discussed, such as a proposal by H. Wilcox (Nav. Undersea Cent., La Jolla) to grow huge rafts of kelpmore » in the open ocean as sources of methane, animal feeds, and chemicals.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2074708307,"The lifetime of a massive star before it begins to deplete its nuclear fuel is less than 5 million years (1). In contrast, the age of the galaxy is more than 10 billion
years (2); nevertheless, many massive and short-lived stars have been identified by observations at optical wavelengths.
These massive stars must have formed very recently relative to the age of the galaxy, and therefore star formation
must be occurring in the galaxy at the present time."

https://openalex.org/W2021923029,Calcium carbonate dissolution in the presence of excess carbon dioxide increased the specific conductance of sea water by approximately 6 × 10-5 ohm-1cm-1 per millimole of carbonate dissolved. The observed conductance increase can be explained by the partial equivalent conductance of calcium bicarbonate and by the hindrance effect of uncharged carbon dioxide dissolved in sea water.
