https://openalex.org/W2012986282,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis has been implicated in the development of multiple diseases. However, the in vivo signaling pathways are still not fully understood. In this report, through the use of genetically deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and their matched wild-type controls, we have demonstrated that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway mediated by Apaf-1 is an integral part of ER stress-induced apoptosis and that ER stress activates different caspases through Apaf-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In search of the molecular link between ER stress and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, we have discovered that in MEFs, ER stress selectively activates BH3-only proteins PUMA and NOXA at the transcript level through the tumor suppressor gene p53. In p53-/- MEFs, ER stress-induced apoptosis is partially suppressed. The p53-independent apoptotic pathway may be mediated by C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-12, as their activation is intact in p53-/- MEFs. In multiple MEF lines, p53 is primarily nuclear and its level is elevated upon ER stress. To establish the role of NOXA and PUMA in ER stress-induced apoptosis, we have shown that, in MEFs deficient in NOXA or PUMA, ER stress-induced apoptosis is reduced. Reversibly, overexpression of NOXA or PUMA induces apoptosis as evidenced by the activation of BAK and caspase-7. Our results provide new evidence that, in MEFs, in addition to PUMA, p53 and NOXA are novel components of the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway, and both contribute to ER stress-induced apoptosis.

As a major intracellular calcium storage compartment, the ER also plays a critical role toward maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis. Disruption of these physiological functions by ER stress has been implicated in a wide variety of human diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, neuronal damage by ischemia, prion disease, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes mellitus (1Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). ER stress could also be elicited in the cell culture system by pharmacological agents including tunicamycin (Tun), a protein N-glycosylation inhibitor; brefeldin A (BFA), which blocks protein transport from ER to Golgi; and thapsigargin (TG), which blocks ER uptake of calcium by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (2Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). A variety of ER stresses result in unfolded protein accumulation, which triggers the unfolded protein response (1Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 3Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). For survival, the cells induce ER chaperone proteins to alleviate protein aggregation, transiently attenuate translation, and activate the proteasome machinery to degrade misfolded proteins. Nonetheless, under severe and prolonged ER stress, unfolded protein response activates unique pathways that lead to cell death through apoptosis (4Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Currently, several pathways have been directly implicated in ER stress-induced apoptosis. For example, the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 is induced by ER stress at the transcript level, which sensitizes cells to ER stress through down-regulating BCL-2 and activating GADD34 and ERO1Î±, an ER oxidase (5Marciniak S.J.

Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). ER stress also activates the ER transmembrane protein kinases type I ER membrane protein kinase (IRE1) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), which have been implicated in the activation of the pro-apoptotic c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (7Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 8Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ER stress leads to proteolytic cleavage of caspase-12 (C-12) in mouse and caspase-4 (C-4) in human, both of which localize to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (9Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. Tsujimoto Y. Tohyama M. J.

Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Evidence is also emerging that there is cross-talk between the ER and the mitochondria. The mitochondria-initiated apoptotic pathway is a major one in mammalian cells and is tightly regulated by BCL-2 family proteins. BAX and BAK are pro-apoptotic members activated by a variety of apoptotic stimuli, leading to oligomerization and insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane to release cytochrome c (4Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 11Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J.

Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and caspase-9 (C-9), resulting in the activation of C-9 and the subsequent activation of caspase-3 (C-3) and caspase-7 (C-7) and ultimately cell death. Recent evidence reveals that BAX/BAK can also localize to the ER and are activated in response to ER stress, leading to calcium depletion and murine caspase 12 (C-12) activation (13Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar, 14Zong W.X. Li C. Hatzivassiliou G. Lindsten T. Yu Q.C. Yuan J. Thompson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In MEFs deficient in BAX or BAK, ER stress-mediated C-12 cleavage is abolished but can be restored by the introduction of ER-targeted BAK. However, because BAX/BAK can activate apoptosis from both the mitochondria and the ER, it remains to be determined how dependent the mitochondria-initiated apoptotic pathways are on ER stress-induced apoptosis in vivo. Also, this raises the important issue regarding the molecular links between ER stress and initiation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. In mitochondria-initiated apoptosis, the activation of BAX/BAK involves members of the BH3-only BCL-2 family proteins, which are essential initiators of apoptotic cell death. This large group of proteins share only the BH3 domain, which is used for binding to the anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family and for inducing apoptosis (15Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 16Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Among this group of proteins, only a subset is under stringent transcriptional control. Interestingly, one such protein, PUMA, has recently been identified as strongly inducible by ER stress in human neuroblastoma cells and may contribute to ER stress-induced apoptosis in human colon cancer cells (17Reimertz C. Kogel D. Rami A. Chittenden T. Prehn J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). PUMA is both a target and mediator of p53-mediated apoptosis. In this report, through the use of genetically deficient MEFs and their matched wild-type controls, we investigated the dependence of ER stress-mediated caspase activation and apoptosis on the mitochondria in vivo. In search of regulators of ER stress activation of BAK/BAX in addition to PUMA, we identified NOXA as a novel BH3-only protein that is activated by ER stress at the transcript level. We further showed that the induction of Noxa and Puma by ER stress in MEFs is largely dependent on the tumor suppressor gene p53 and both proteins contribute to ER stress-induced apoptosis. In MEFs, p53 is primarily nuclear, and its level is elevated in MEFs upon ER stress. Further, ER stress-induced apoptosis is partially suppressed in p53-/- MEFs, whereas the activation of C-12 and the induction of CHOP remain intact in p53-/- MEFS, suggesting both p53-dependent and -independent pathways. Our results provide new evidence that, in addition to PUMA, p53 and NOXA are novel components of the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways. The relationship of these novel findings in MEFs to previous results obtained with other established cell lines is discussed. Cell CultureâPaired wild-type (WT Apaf-1+/+) and Apaf-1-/- MEFs (18Honarpour N. Du C. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Wang X. Herz J. Dev.

The fibroblasts and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine and antibiotics. All cells were plated 1 day prior to drug treatment. PlasmidsâThe full-length murine Noxa cDNA was made by reverse-transcribed PCR using total RNA from WT MEFs and the following primers: sense, 5â²-TTC TGA GAT GCC CGG GAG AA-3â² and antisense, 5â²-GGG AGG TCC CTT CTT GCA AA-3â². The PCR product was directly subcloned into PCR2.1 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and was verified by DNA sequencing. For Northern blots, the cDNA probe was purified after digesting with EcoRI. For expression plasmids, a full-length murine Noxa cDNA flanked with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites was generated using PCR2.1-Noxa as a template and the following primers: sense, 5â²-GCG GGA TCC TGC CCG GGA GAA AGG CGC-3â² and antisense, 5â²-GCG GAA TTC TCA GGT TAC TAA ATT GAA GAG-3â². The cDNA was then cloned into pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences) to generate pEGFP-Noxa. PUMA expression vector pCMV-Puma (22Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. K. H. Vousden (Beatson Institute for Cancer Research). Antibodies and ReagentsâDetection of protein expression was performed by standard immunoblotting techniques using primary antibodies against C-3 (rabbit polyclonal antiserum, Cell Signaling), C-7 (mouse IgG1, Pharmingen), C-12 (rabbit polyclonal antiserum, Cell Signaling), CHOP (B3, mouse IgG1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GFP (mouse IgG, BD Biosciences), GRP78 (rabbit polyclonal antiserum, Stressgene), NOXA (M16, goat anti-mouse polyclonal antiserum, Santa Cruz Biotechnology.), p53 (Pab241, mouse IgG2a for MEF immunostaining, Calbiochem; Pab240, mouse IgG1, for Western blot, Santa Cruz Biotechnology.), PUMAÎ± (N-terminal, rabbit polyclonal antiserum for mouse cells, Sigma; N-20, goat polyclonal antiserum for human cells, Santa Cruz Biotechnology.), and Î²-actin (AC15, mouse IgG, Sigma). ER stress inducers TG, Tun, and BFA were purchased from Sigma. Etoposide (Etop) was from Calbiochem. Detection of BAK ActivationâAnalysis of the conformational changes of BAK was performed as described previously (14Zong W.X. Li C. Hatzivassiliou G. Lindsten T. Yu Q.C. Yuan J. Thompson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected with pEGFP or pEGFP-Noxa. Forty-eight hours later, a portion of the cells was used for GFP detection. The rest of the cells were fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 1:50 anti-mouse IgG1 (BD Biosciences) or anti-BAK (AM03; Oncogene Research Products) in 100 Î¼g/ml digitonin (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min. After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were incubated with 1:100 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse Ig for 30 min. The cells were subjected to analysis by flow cytometry (FACstar; BD Biosciences). Apoptosis AssaysâCell apoptosis of MEFs was assessed by flow cytometry after staining with annexin-V-FITC (Pharmingen) and propidium iodide (PI, Roche Applied Science) as described previously (23Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays, 293 cells were transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-Noxa, pCMV-Puma alone, or in combination using Polyfect (Qiagen). The final concentration of the plasmid was adjusted to the same amount using pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin-V and 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD). The apoptosis of GFP-positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. For kinetics, cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis following permeabilization and staining with PI. Essentially, ER-stressed cells were trypsinized, washed in ice-cold PBS, and fixed in -20 Â°C 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The cells were stored in -20 Â°C before preparation for analysis. The fixed cells were washed with cold PBS and treated with DNase-free RNase (200 units/ml, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Cellular DNA was stained with 50 Î¼g/ml PI for at least 15 min at room temperature. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results represent the mean of triplicate determinations in which a minimum of 10,000 cells were assayed for each determination. Any sub-G1 population was counted as apoptotic cells. Northern Blot AnalysisâTotal RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's procedure. Ten micrograms of total RNA per sample was subjected to Northern blot analysis, which was carried out as previously described (24Hong M. Luo S. Baumeister P. Huang J.M. Gogia R.K. Li M. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11354-11363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Probes were made by reverse-transcribed PCR using total RNA from WT MEFs and the following primers: BimL sense, 5â²-GCA CCC ATG AGT TGT GAC AA-3â² and antisense, 5â²-TCA ATG CCT TCC CAT ACC AG-3â²; Bnip3 sense, 5â²-GCT CCC AGA CAC CAC AAG AT-3â² and antisense, 5â²-CAA GCC AAT GGC CAG CAG AT-3â²; Dp-5 sense, 5â²-GGA GGA AGC TGG TTC CTG TT-3â² and antisense, 5â²-CCC ACC GGT CCA TGT AAG TT-3â²; Nix sense, 5â²-GAG ATG CAT ACC AGC AGG GA-3â² and antisense, 5â²-CAC TTC ACA GGC CAC ACG AA-3â². The PCR products were subcloned into PCR2.1 and were verified by DNA sequencing. The cDNA probes were purified after digesting with EcoRI. Probes for Puma and Spike were prepared from cDNA clones (IMAGE identification numbers 6310857 and 2811290, respectively, Open Biosystems) after digesting with EcoRI/BamHI and EcoRI/HindIII, respectively. The probe for human Bik (25Mathai J.P. Germain M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. G. C. Shore (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), and the probe for human Chop (26Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D. Bernier M. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. N. Holbrook (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Probes for Grp78 and GAPDH were prepared from expression plasmids as described previously (24Hong M. Luo S. Baumeister P. Huang J.M. Gogia R.K. Li M. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11354-11363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels were quantitated by a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics) using GAPDH as the loading control. The fold of induction was calculated by dividing the relative mRNA level by that of the untreated sample that is set as 1. Western Blot AnalysisâThe cell lysates from treated or untreated cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml of lysis buffer, Roche Applied Science). After incubation on ice for 20 min, the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 revolutions/min for 15 min at 4 Â°C. Thirty micrograms of total protein of the clarified supernatants was separated by 12 or 14% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (23Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). All immunoblots were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence StainingâCells were plated in 4-well Lab-Tek II glass slides (Nalge Nunc International) a day before treatment and then exposed to TG (2 Î¼m) or Etop (50 Î¼g/ml) for 0, 3, 6, or 24 h. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described (27Meplan C. Mann K. Hainaut P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31663-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, the treated cells were washed in PBS, fixed in -20 Â°C 1:1 (v/v) methanol:acetic acid for 5 min, incubated for 1 h in PBS/Nonidet P-40 0.1% containing 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 Â°C, labeled with the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody Pab241 (1:300 dilution) overnight at 4 Â°C, and followed by staining with FITC-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution, Vector Laboratories). The cells were mounted in Vectashield with propidium iodide mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 dual photon confocal microscope. Apaf-1 Is an Integral Component of ER Stress-induced Apoptosisâ Apaf-1 binds to cytochrome c released from the mitochondria and recruits pro-C-9 to form the apoptosome and subsequently activates C-9 and downstream effector caspases (C-3, C-7). Thus, the activation of Apaf-1 serves as a major indicator for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. To investigate the requirement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, especially Apaf-1, in ER stress-induced apoptosis, Apaf-1-/- and matched WT (Apaf-1+/+) MEFs were either untreated or treated with ER stress inducers TG, Tun, and BFA. Following 24 h of ER stress treatment, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry after staining with annexin-V and propidium iodide. For comparison, the cells were also treated with Etop, a DNA-damaging agent known to initiate apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (28Perkins C.L. Fang G. Kim C.N. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1645-1653PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, there was substantial reduction in the percentage of apoptotic cells in Apaf-1-/- MEFs under all treatment conditions, as compared with WT control. Although these results suggest that Apaf-1-mediated apoptotic pathways contribute significantly to cell death during the early phase (within 24 h) of ER stress treatment, it remains possible that, with more severe ER stress treatment and for a longer period of treatment, Apaf-1 could be dispensable. To test this, the same set of cells was treated with higher doses of TG, Tun, and BFA. The kinetics of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis following PI staining during the treatment period of up to 40 h. Our results reveal that, even under more severe ER stress conditions for prolonged periods of time, MEFs deficient in Apaf-1 were more resistant to apoptosis (20â40% apoptotic cells) as compared with WT cells (>80%) for all three ER stress inducers (Fig. 1B). The same was observed for Etop-treated cells. These observations provide direct evidence that Apaf-1 is an integral part of ER stress-induced cell death in vivo. On the other hand, it is also evident that the inhibition of apoptosis in Apaf-1-/- MEFs is not complete, indicating that pathways independent of Apaf-1 are in operation to execute ER stress-induced apoptosis. ER Stress Activates Caspases through Apaf-1-dependent and -independent PathwaysâTo examine the effect of Apaf-1 deficiency on caspase activation following ER stress, cell lysates were prepared from Apaf-1-/- and their matched WT MEFs treated with ER stress inducers (TG, Tun, and BFA) and Etop, under conditions as described for Fig. 1A and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, for WT cells, C-7 was activated by TG, Tun, and BFA, as indicated by the detection of the cleaved form of C-7. For C-3, its cleaved form was observed in cells treated with TG but was below the detection limit in cells treated with Tun or BFA. As a control, Etop strongly activated both C-3 and C-7. In Apaf-1-/- MEFs, the activation of both C-3 and C-7 was largely inhibited (Fig. 2). In contrast, C-12 activation by TG and BFA, as evidenced by the appearance of its cleaved form, was independent of Apaf-1 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, in MEFs, Tun only weakly activated C-12, and its cleavage was detected after Etop treatment. The effectiveness of the ER stress inducers was confirmed by their ability to increase the level of the ER chaperone protein GRP78/BiP, and the loading of the protein samples were monitored by Î²-actin levels. These results indicate that ER stress strongly activates C-7 primarily by mitochondrial pathways downstream of Apaf-1, whereas C-12 activation by ER stress, such as with TG and BFA, is Apaf-1-independent and may contribute to Apaf-1-independent apoptosis in murine MEF cells. The BH3-only Proteins PUMA and NOXA Are Selectively Activated at the Transcript Level upon ER StressâBH3-only BCL-2 family proteins are regulators of BAK/BAX; as such, they are initiators for the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Among the mammalian BH3-only proteins, the transcript levels of BimL, Dp-5, Bnip-3, Nix, Puma, and Noxa could be induced by a variety of stimuli. Their mRNA levels, as well as those encoding Bik and Spike, were measured in primary MEFs following treatment with TG, Tun, and BFA by Northern blot. The induction of Chop served as a positive control, and mRNA loading was monitored by GAPDH levels. Examples of the Northern blots are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, and the relative mRNA levels after TG treatment were quantitated, normalized against the loading control, and summarized in Fig. 3C. Our results show that Bnip-3, Spike, Nix, Bik, and BimL transcript levels were either not affected by ER stress or that the effect was transient and marginal. The level of Dp-5 mRNA was undetectable in MEFs (data not shown). In contrast, Puma and Noxa mRNA levels increased by â¼3â4-fold within 2â4 h under all three ER stress treatment conditions and persisted for at least 16 h. The doublet appearance of the Puma transcripts is consistent with alternative splicing as previously reported (22Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar, 29Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). As a positive control, their mRNA levels were also strongly activated in MEFs treated with Etop (Fig. 3B). Puma and Noxa are target genes of p53 and are critical mediators of the apoptotic responses induced by p53. To test whether the ER stress induction of Puma and Noxa is p53-dependent, mRNA levels of Puma and Noxa were measured in p53-/- and matched WT (p53+/+) MEFs treated with either ER stress inducers (TG, Tun, BFA) or Etop as a positive control. ER stress induction was monitored by Chop mRNA activation and mRNA loading by GAPDH levels. Examples of the Northern blots are shown in Fig. 4A, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4B. We observed that, in primary MEFs, induction of Noxa by all three ER stress inducers was highly dependent on p53, as the induction level was suppressed drastically in p53-/- MEFs. For Puma, mRNA induction by TG, Tun, and BFA was also dependent on p53, although a low level of residual activation could be detected at 4 h. As a positive control, Etop induction of Noxa and Puma transcripts were blocked in p53-/- MEFs. These results indicate that, in MEFs, both Puma and Noxa mRNA induction by ER stress is largely p53-dependent. Suppression of ER Stress-induced Apoptosis in p53-/- MEFsâAs induction of Puma and Noxa by ER stress is largely dependent on p53 in MEFs and p53 itself has recently been shown to have a direct signaling role at the mitochondria in the induction of apoptosis (30Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), we investigated the requirement of p53 in ER stress-induced apoptosis by utilizing the matched pair of WT (p53+/+) and p53-/- MEFs. Etop treatment was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 5A, apoptosis induced by TG treatment for 24 h was inhibited by â¼50% in p53-/- MEFs compared with WT cells. This result was confirmed when the kinetics of apoptotic cell death were monitored during a 40-h period (Fig. 5B). These results reveal p53 as a novel component of the ER stress-induced apoptotic signaling pathway in MEFs. Nonetheless, the suppression of apoptosis in the p53 null cells was only partial, indicating that other independent pathways are involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis. ER Stress Induces p53 Level in MEFs and Activates CHOP and C-12 Independent of p53âBecause ER stress-induced apoptosis was inhibited in p53-/- MEFs, we examined whether p53 itself undergoes ER stress-induced changes. In WT (Puma+/+) MEFs, by 16 h of TG stress treatment, increase in p53 protein was evident (Fig. 6A). As a positive control, the level of CHOP was elevated by ER s"

One of the downstream targets of NADPH oxidase-derived radicals is the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-ÎºB, which controls the expression of a large array of genes involved in immune function and cell survival. Here we show that NF-ÎºB itself is a key factor in controlling NADPH oxidase expression and function. In monocytic and microglial cell lines, the expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox was induced by lipopolysaccharide/interferon Î³ treatment and was inhibited in cells constitutively expressing IÎºBÎ±. Furthermore, inducible reactive oxygen species production was inhibited in IÎºBÎ± overexpressing cells. gp91phox expression was very low in RelA-/- fibroblasts and could be induced by reconstituting these cells with p65/RelA. Thus, gp91phox expression is dependent on the presence of p65/RelA. We also found that gp91phox transcription is dependent on NF-ÎºB and we identified two potential cis-acting elements in the murine gp91phox promoter that control NF-ÎºB-dependent regulation. The findings raise the possibility of a positive feedback loop in which NF-ÎºB activation by oxidative stress leads to further radical production via NADPH oxidase.

The superoxide-generating phagocytic NADPH oxidase is an essential component of the antimicrobial host defense system and is therefore highly expressed in granulocytes and macrophages. It catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide (O2Â·Â¯) by using NADPH as an electron donor.

Because of the destructive action of most of these radicals, NADPH oxidase activity must be tightly regulated. NADPH oxidase is composed of five subunits, p40phox (phox for phagocytic oxidase), p47phox, p67phox, p22phox, and gp91phox. The latter two are membrane associated and together constitute the flavocytochrome b558, whereas the other components are located in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Upon activation, the cytoplasmic components translocate to the cell membrane where they bind to flavocytochrome b558, thus forming the active NADPH oxidase (reviewed in Ref. 1Vignais P.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In addition to the five classical subunits, the small GTPases Rac1 (2Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A.

More recent evidence indicates that NADPH oxidase is also present in non-myeloid cells, such as myocytes (4Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ.

However, in these cells gp91phox (Nox2) might not constitute the dominant catalytic subunit, as Nox1 is the major form expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (10Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Szocs K.

In most non-myeloid cells, NADPH oxidase seems to have a regulatory role in controlling or modulating several signaling cascades initiated by such molecules as low density lipoproteins (12Aviram M.

Therefore, in addition to diseases related to the immune system, NADPH oxidase has also been implicated in hypertension, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and stroke (14Della Bianca V. Dusi S.

In cells of the myelomonocytic lineage CYBB expression is tightly regulated by transcriptional activators and repressors. A special role is attributed to the lineage specific transcription factor PU.1, which binds alone or in a complex with Elf-1, IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor-1), and ICSBP (interferon consensus sequence-binding protein), and combined is termed HAF-1 (hematopoiesis-associated factor-1), to the CYBB promoter (19Suzuki S.

In immature myelocytes, binding of transactivators is inhibited by repressors CDP (CCAAT displacement protein), HOXA10 (homeobox protein A10), and SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1), which are down-regulated or deactivated during functional maturation (26Skalnik D.G.

The ubiquitously expressed NF-ÎºB is a key transcription factor in regulating expression of pro-inflammatory, immune modulatory, and anti-apoptotic genes (29Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). NF-ÎºB is a homo- or heterodimeric complex composed of Rel family proteins p50, p52, Bcl3, RelB, cRel, and p65 (30Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Cellular activation by a broad array of stimuli including cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, viruses, and radiation results in liberation of dimeric NF-ÎºB from cytoplasmic inhibitory molecules (IÎºBs). Upon nuclear import and binding to specific decameric recognition motifs, which are reflected by the consensus GGGRHTYYCC (R = purine, Y = pyrimidine, and H = not G), NF-ÎºB dimers function as trans-acting elements in the promoter region of NF-ÎºB-dependent genes (30Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). It has been shown that NF-ÎºB can be activated by NADPH oxidase through ROS intermediates (31Clark R.A. Valente A.J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2004; 125: 799-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Brar S.S. Kennedy T.P. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Hoidal J.R. Am. J.

In this study we investigated whether subunits of NADPH oxidase might be regulated by NF-ÎºB itself, thus establishing a potential self-perpetuating activation cycle. We show that in mouse monocytic and microglial cell lines, as well as embryonic fibroblasts, inducible expression of gp91phox is dependent on the presence of the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB. The monocytic murine J774.A1 cell line was purchased from ATCC. BV-2 murine microglial cells, which were developed in the laboratory of Dr. Virginia Bocchini (35Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), were obtained from Dr. Sunghee Cho (Weill Medical College). MEF isolated from RelA-/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. A. Beg (Columbia University, New York) and have been described previously (36Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). All cells were grown at 37 Â°C in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (MediaTech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin B (all Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Endotoxin levels of all cell culture reagents were â¤0.24 endotoxin units/ml. LPS was purchased from Sigma (L-7261) and recombinant murine IFNÎ³ was from Calbiochem. Expression VectorsâThe porcine IÎºBÎ± cDNA containing Ser to Ala substitutions at amino acid positions 32 and 36 (IÎºBÎ± AA) and therefore coding for a stabilized form of IÎºBÎ± was a kind gift from Rainer De Martin (Department of Vascular Biology & Thrombosis Research, Medical University of Vienna, Austria). The cDNA was cloned into the retroviral expression vector pQCXIN (Clontech). Retroviral vectors carrying the human p65 cDNA and its serine mutants have been described previously (37Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The full-length coding region of murine gp91phox was amplified from cDNA prepared from LPS/IFNÎ³-stimulated J774.A1 cells using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequence of the 5â²-primer, which contained a BsiWI restriction site, was 5â²-ATTACGTACGCCAACACTTAACCTTTGCTAACAT-3â², and the sequence of the 3â²-primer containing a BamHI restriction site was 5â²-ATTAGGATCCCATTTGGCAGCATACACTGG-3â², respectively. The amplicon was digested with BsiWI/BamHI and cloned into pQCXIP retroviral vector (Clontech). siRNA VectorsâA double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide encoding a siRNA duplex targeting murine RelA (upper strand: 5â²-GATCCGAAGACAGCCTTTACTGAAATTCAAGAGATTTCAGTAAAGGCTGTCTTTTTTTTG-3â²) was cloned into the retroviral pSiren-RetroX (Clontech) vector. A control vector was constructed by inserting a similar codon that efficiently targets firefly Luciferase (Clontech). A DNA fragment spanning from +38 to-1935 (relative to the transcriptional start site) of the murine CYBB promoter was amplified by PCR from C57/BL6 genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using SacI and NcoI restriction sites. Similarly, a reporter spanning +38 to -1605 was constructed using NcoI and NheI restriction sites. Reporter constructs carrying a tandem repeat of respective ÎºB sites were constructed in analogy to previously published procedures (37Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Inserted sequences of all plasmid constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing using Dye Terminator chemistry. Reporter gene assays in MEF were performed as described previously (37Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Raw 264.7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected 24 h later. One Î¼g of DNA was mixed with 3 Î¼l of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Biochemicals) in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers suggestions and the mixture was added directly to the cells. A plasmid carrying Î²-galactosidase under control of the elongation factor-1Î± promoter (pEF4-V5-His-LacZ, Invitrogen) was used to normalize luciferase levels in Raw cells. To minimize endotoxin exposure, plasmid DNA used in transfections was cleared of contaminating endotoxin (EndoFree, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Retrovirus containing supernatants were obtained after transiently transfecting EcoPack2-293 ecotropic or AmphoPak amphotropic packaging cell lines (Clontech) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Vesicular stomatitis virus-G pseudotyped viral particles were generated by transfecting GP-293 cells with the respective construct and pVSV-G vector (Clontech). Viral titers were determined by titration on NIH 3T3 cells and were >1 Ã 105/ml. RelA-/- MEF were infected as described (37Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). J774.A1 and BV-2 cells were infected with amphotropic or vesicular stomatitis virus-G pseudotyped virus using centrifugal delivery (38Bahnson A.B. Dunigan J.T. Baysal B.E. Mohney T. Atchison R.W. Nimgaonkar M.T. Ball E.D. Barranger J.A. J. Virol. Methods. 1995; 54: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to retroviral supernatants in the presence of 8 Î¼g/ml Polybrene and centrifuged at 2000 Ã g for 2 h at 25Â°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in fresh medium and returned to the incubator. Transduced cell pools were selected 72 h after infection in medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin or 1.5 Î¼g/ml puromycin over 14-21 days after which cells were used for experiments. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out using SYBR Green chemistry (Invitrogen) on a Chromo4 continuous fluorescence monitoring thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) as described previously (37Anrather J.

All primer pairs used in real-time PCR amplified a single band with expected molecular weight as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To determine that the CYBB sequence amplified from cDNA of J774, BV-2, or MEF origin were identical, PCR products were purified over silica gel columns (Qiagen) and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) vector. Two clones for each cell line were sequenced. All clones showed 100% sequence homology to the published murine CYBB sequence (GenBankÂ® accession number U43384). Western blots using anti-p65 (sc-372), anti-p22phox (sc-20781), anti-p47phox (sc-17845, all Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA), or anti-gp91phox (BD Biosciences) were carried out as described (39Brostjan C.

J774.A1 cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and IFNÎ³ (100 units/ml) for 2 h. Cells were washed once in cold Hanksâ balanced salt solution and collected by scraping. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 Â°C and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl). After 15 min incubation on ice, cells were lysed by applying 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using the tight fitting pestle. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and stored at -70 Â°C until use. Nuclei (2 Ã 107 in 200 Î¼l of storage buffer) were thawed at room temperature and mixed with an equal amount of 2Ã reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.3 m KCl, 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, UTP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 24 Î¼g/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 24 mm creatine phosphate). After addition of 120 Î¼Ci of [Î±-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), nuclei were incubated at 30 Â°C for 30 min with continuous agitation. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 Î¼l of 1 mg/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Biochemicals).

The following plasmids (5 Î¼g) were linearized with ScaI and immobilized to nitrocellulose membranes: ICAM-1 (pGEM-T containing a 685-bp fragment of the murine ICAM-1 coding sequence), gp91phox (pGEM-T containing a 1565-bp fragment of the murine gp91 coding sequence), and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (pGEM-T containing a 1054-bp fragment of the murine hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase coding sequence). ChIP was performed by a combination of published protocols (42Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F.

A. 2004; 101: 13572-13577Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde (1% final) directly to the growth medium. Plates were agitated on an orbital shaker for 10 min at room temperature. After two washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were collected in 5 ml of cell collection buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4 and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 15 min and subsequently at 30 Â°C for 15 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 Î¼l of lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.5% EmpigenBB). Lysates were incubated for 10 min on ice and sonicated 4 times for 15 s at 20% of maximal amplitude (Sonifier Cell Disruptor 250, Branson, Danbury, CT). This led to DNA fragments spanning from 0.3 to 1.5 kb as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Chromatin was cleared by a 10-min centrifugation at 16,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C and stored at -70 Â°C. Soluble chromatin derived from 2 Ã 106 cells was used for each immunoprecipitation. Samples were diluted with 10 volumes of dilution buffer (0.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 Î¼g of anti-p65 (sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 2 Î¼g of preimmune IgG overnight after a 1-h preclearing at 4 Â°C with protein A-Sepharose (80 Î¼l of 50% slurry in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 19.2 Î¼g of glycogen). 1/100 volume of the soluble chromatin was removed after preclearing (input). Complexes were recovered by a 1-h incubation at 4 Â°C with 80 Î¼l of blocked protein A-Sepharose slurry. Precipitates were serially washed for 5 min with 300 Î¼l of Wash Buffer I (2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl), twice with Wash Buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), once with Wash Buffer III (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.25 m LiCl), and then twice with TE. All buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors. Precipitated chromatin complexes were removed from the beads by a 30-min incubation with 50 Î¼l of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) on a rocking platform. This step was repeated twice, with a 10-min incubation. Eluates were separated from the remaining agarose beads by centrifugation over 0.45-Î¼m pore size spin columns. Cross-linking was reversed by 4 h to overnight incubation at 65 Â°C. Immunoprecipitated and input DNA was purified with QIAquick purification columns (Qiagen) as described (42Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). DNA was analyzed for the presence of CYBB promoter sequences by real-time PCR using SYBR Green chemistry (Invitrogen) as described above using ChIP primer set 1 (5â²-TTATGGGAACAGCCTTTCAGTT-3â² and 5â²-TGTTGGTTCTGCCTCTCTTCT-3â²; 138-bp amplicon) and ChIP primer set 2 (5â²-GCTTCAGTGAGGACCCAATC-3â² and 5â²-CCACTTTTCCATCATCCATGT-3â²; 139-bp amplicon). Input DNA was amplified for each sample in parallel and amounts of sequence-specific immunoprecipitated DNA were expressed as the percentile fraction of input DNA. Both primer pairs amplified a single band with the expected molecular weight as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were purified over silica gel columns (Qiagen) and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) vector. Two individual clones were sequenced to verify the correctness of the amplicon. ROS production was assayed by flow cytometry in 2â²,7â²-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (DHDCF)-labeled cells. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Subconfluent cells were pretreated for 4 h with LPS/IFNÎ³ as indicated. Cells were washed once with RPMI 1640 (without phenol red) and incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 10 Î¼m DHDCF in the presence or absence of 3.2 Î¼m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 30 min at 37 Â°C. After two more washes, cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry on a Beckman-Coulter XL flow cytometer (Weill Medical College, Flow Cytometry Core Facility). Propidium iodide-positive cells were excluded from the analysis. Data were analyzed using WinMDI version 2.8 software (The Scripps Institute, Flow Cytometry Core Facility). Î²-NADPH-dependent O2Â·Â¯ production was measured in cell-membrane fractions by an enhanced luminol-based assay as described previously (44Ago T. Kitazono T. Kuroda J. Kumai Y. Kamouchi M. Ooboshi H. Wakisaka M. Kawahara T. Rokutan K. Ibayashi S. Iida M. Stroke. 2005; 36: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in Hanksâ balanced salt solution and collected by centrifugation. After resuspension in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Î¼m leupeptin, 1 Î¼m pepstatin A, and 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin), cells were disrupted on ice by sonication for three 10-s bursts at 11% power output separated by 30-s intervals. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 60 min at 4 Â°C. The pellet, which constitutes the membrane fraction, was dissolved in assay buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium azide, 10 Î¼m FAD) by sonication for two 5-s bursts. 50 Î¼g of protein were incubated with 50 Î¼l of Diogenes reagent (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Reactions were started by automated injection of Î²-NADPH (0.2 mm final) and light emission was integrated over the first 30 s of the reaction. Parallel reactions included 100 units of superoxide dismutase and results are reported as superoxide dismutase-inhibitable light emission. The specificity of the assay was determined by including 100 Î¼m NG-nitro-l-arginine, 100 Î¼m indomethacin, 100 Î¼m oxypurinol, or 10 Î¼m diphenyleneiodonium. Only superoxide dismutase and diphenyleneiodonium blocked O2Â·Â¯ production (supplemental figure). All data were derived from at least three independent experiments. Data were expressed as mean Â± S.E. Two-group comparisons were analyzed by the two-tailed t test for dependent or independent samples, as appropriate. Multiple comparisons were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukeyâs tests. Statistical significance was considered for p < 0.05. Regulation of gp91phox mRNA Levels by NF-ÎºBâTo test whether the expressi"

Subsequent work in prostate cancer cells provided evidence for: 1) inhibition of HDAC; 2) increased histone acetylation, globally, as well as locally in association with P21 and bax promoters; 3) increased p21 and Bax mRNA and protein expression; and 4) activation of caspases. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of SFN on HDAC in vivo, and investigate suppression of intestinal polyps in the Apcmin mouse.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. SFN and SFN-N-acetylcysteine (SFN-NAC) inhibit HDAC activity in mouse colonic mucosaAn initial comparison of SFN with one of its metabolitesânamely, SFN-NACâshowed that both compounds inhibited HDAC activity significantly in mouse colonic mucosa, 6 h after single oral gavage treatment (Fig. 1â¤» A).

Mutations in a third gene, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), were recently associated to this disease. PCSK9 acts as a natural inhibitor of the low density lipoprotein receptor pathway, and both genes are regulated by depletion of cholesterol cell content and statins, via sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). Here we investigated the regulation of PCSK9 gene expression during nutritional changes. We showed that PCSK9 mRNA quantity is decreased by 73% in mice after 24 h of fasting, leading to a 2-fold decrease in protein level. In contrast PCSK9 expression was restored upon high carbohydrate refeeding. PCSK9 mRNA increased by 4â5-fold in presence of insulin in rodent primary hepatocytes, whereas glucose had no effect. Moreover, insulin up-regulated hepatic PCSK9 expression in vivo during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in mice. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of a dominant or negative form of SREBP-1c confirmed the implication of this transcription factor in insulin-mediated stimulation of PCSK9 expression. Liver X receptor agonist T0901317 also regulated PCSK9 expression via this same pathway (a 2-fold increase in PCSK9 mRNA of primary hepatocytes cultured for 24 h in presence of 1 Î¼m T0901317). As our last investigation, we isolated PCSK9 proximal promoter and verified the functionality of a SREBP-1c responsive element located from 335 bp to 355 bp upstream of the ATG.

The most common and severe form of monogenic hypercholesterolemia is familial hypercholesterolemia, caused by mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLr) (1Rader D.J. Cohen J. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by elevated plasma LDL-cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease. Another form of this disease, familial defective apolipoprotein (apo)B100, is caused by mutations in the LDLr binding domain of ApoB100 (1Rader D.J. Cohen J. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). ApoB100 is synthesized by the liver and is the major protein component of very low density lipoprotein and LDL. Recently, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) has been identified as the third gene involved in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (5Cohen J. Pertsemlidis A. Kotowski I.K. Graham R. Garcia C.K. Hobbs H.H. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Proprotein convertases are proteolytic enzymes that cleave their substrate, producing a biologically active molecule (2Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). We showed that patients mutated in PCSK9 prodomain (mutation S127R) have decreased LDL catabolism and increased very low density lipoprotein, intermediary density lipoprotein, and LDL production (3Ouguerram K.

Studies on knock-out mice and plasma lipid profiles of patients with nonsense mutations, showed that PCSK9 deficiency results in low circulating LDL-cholesterol concentrations (4Brunham L. Clin.

Although it is established that PCSK9 impairs the LDLr pathway by increasing the degradation of the receptor, its effect on apoB production is still controversial (7Benjannet S. Rhainds D.

Indeed, the transcription of both genes is activated by cholesterol cell content depletion, via the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) (11Dubuc G. Chamberland A. Wassef H. Davignon J.

In mice, PCSK9 is down-regulated by dietary cholesterol, and moderately up-regulated by the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. PCSK9 expression is higher in livers of transgenic mice overexpressing truncated nuclear forms of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 (13Maxwell K.N. Soccio R.E. Duncan E.M. Sehayek E. Breslow J.L. J.

However, in vitro, data obtained in HepG2 cells did not support a direct regulation of PCSK9 by LXR and SREBP-1 (11Dubuc G. Chamberland A. Wassef H. Davignon J. Seidah N.G. Bernier L. Prat A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1454-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Therefore, although it is admitted that PCSK9 is regulated by SREBP2 and cholesterol, the existence of a regulation by SREBP1 isoforms is unclear. SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2, are synthesized as transmembrane precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum (16Eberle D. Hegarty B. Bossard P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). When cellular sterols are low, SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 are cleaved into a mature, truncated, peptide that is directed to the nucleus, where it activates its target genes. SREBP-1a and -1c are products from another gene than SREBP-2 and correspond to two different mRNA species. In the liver, SREBP-1c is the main SREBP-1 and therefore seems the most relevant physiologically (17Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, whereas SREBP-1c and -1a preferentially activate genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis or carbohydrate metabolism, including fatty acid synthetase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or glucokinase (GK) (18Foretz M.

Contrary to what had been observed in vitro, cholesterol cell content does not affect SREBP-1c in vivo (25Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore it constitutes a promising therapeutic target (31Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). However, LXR activators activate directly, or indirectly via SREBP-1c, the genes of fatty acid synthesis and promote hypertriglyceridemia (27Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M.

Interestingly, insulin also increases the LDLr transcription via SREBP (34Streicher R. Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Siemeister G. Munck M. Avci H. Krone W. J. Biol.

These data, together with the ability of T0901317 to activate PCSK9 in vivo, which could be an indirect effect mediated by SREBP-1c, prompted us to investigate whether insulin could activate PCSK9 transcription via SREBP-1c. Here we show that fasting decreases PCSK9 expression and that insulin increases PCSK9 via SREBP-1c in primary mouse and rat hepatocytes, as well as in vivo, during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps performed on mice. The non-steroidal LXR agonist T0901317 increased PCSK9 mRNA quantity in primary hepatocytes through the same pathway. As our last investigation, we demonstrated the functionality of a SREBP-1c response element spanning from â355 bp to â335 bp of the PCSK9 proximal promoter. These results suggest that PCSK9 might play a role in insulin-related pathologies like type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome.

Immunoreactive bands were revealed using the ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Real Time PCRâTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit and Qiashredder mini columns, as well as Rnase free DNase I (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). First strand cDNA was synthesized with random primers using a Superscript II RNaseH-reverse transcriptase reagent kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR analysis was performed on the 7000 Sequence Detection System with SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). Oligonucleotides were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystem).

Primary Culture of Hepatocytes and Adenoviral InfectionâAt 9:00 a.m., hepatocytes were isolated from the liver of fed male rats or mice by the collagenase method (36Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell. Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar), modified as described elsewhere (24Dentin R. Pegorier J.P. Benhamed F. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Fauveau V. Magnuson M.A. Girard J.

Briefly, livers were perfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution and washed at a rate of 5 ml/min using the inferior vena cava before collagenase (0.025%) was added. Dead cells were eliminated through a density gradient using Percoll, and viable cells were plated at a density of 7.54/cm2 on collagen-coated plates. Cells were given a time span of 2 h to attach in William's medium E with Glutamax (Invitrogen) 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 Î¼g/ml of streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 nm dexamethasone, and 100 nm insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). After attachment, adenoviral infection was performed for 3 h when indicated. Cultures were washed twice with 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 nm dexamethasone overnight. Both adenovirus vectors containing the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1â403) of SREBP-1c (AdSREBP-1c, 6 plaque-forming units/cell) and the dominant negative form of SREBP-1 (AdSREBP-1cDN, 15 plaque-forming units/cell) were generous gifts from Dr. Foufelle (INSERM U465, Paris, France) and have been described previously (30Foretz M.

Collin H. Rouche A. Hagege A. Schwartz K. Fiszman M.Y. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). T0901317 (Sigma) was dissolved with Me2SO. Animal StudiesâAll studies were approved by the institutional review boards for the care and use of experimental animals. C57BL/6 mice were housed with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Before initiation of diet studies, the mice were maintained on a standard laboratory chow diet (UAR AO3, Villemoison sur Orge, France). For the fasting and refeeding experiments, 8â12 week-old female mice were divided into three groups: non-fasted, fasted, and refed. The non-fasted group was fed ad libitum with the standard chow diet and killed at 9:00 a.m. The fasted group was fasted 24 h before sacrifice (from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.), and the refed group was subjected to an additional refeeding with a high carbohydrate/low fat diet (Harlan Teklad TD88122, Madison, Wisconsin) for 6 or 24 h. The high carbohydrate diet contained 48% sucrose, 16% corn starch, 22% casein, 5.5% cellulose, 1% corn oil, 4% mineral, and 1% vitamin. Blood and Tissue SamplingâPlasma glucose concentrations were determined using AccuCheck active. Plasma insulin levels were measured using a solid phase two-site enzyme immunoassay (Mercodia AB, Sweden). The mice were sacrificed, and their livers were removed and immediately frozen in liquid N2 and then stored at â80 Â°C until further analysis. Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic ClampâC57Bl/6 mice were equipped with a permanent catheter in the right atrium via the jugular vein, and allowed to recover for 4 days before the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp experiment was performed. The mice were infused for 6 h with two solutions after a 9-h fasting period. The first solution contained 40 Î¼g/ml somatostatin (UCB, Breda, Netherlands), 200 mg/ml glucose, and insulin (Actrapid). This solution contained insulin (Actrapid), leading to an insulin infusion rate of 10 milliunits/kg/min. This solution was infused at a constant flow rate of 0.135 ml/h. The second solution contained 300 mg/ml glucose, and its infusion rate was adjusted according to measured blood glucose levels to maintain euglycemic conditions. Promoter AnalysisâThe PCSK9 proximal promoter was identified using Genomatix software. We arbitrarily annotated the first base of the translated ATG as +1. A human genomic fragment spanning â4 to â1460 bp was amplified by PCR and cloned into TopoTA vector (Invitrogen) using the following oligonucleotides, forward 5â²-TTCTTGCTCCAGGGGAGGCCTTTGATG and reverse 5â²-GGCCAGGGGAGAGGTTGCTGTCCTGGCGAG. The fragment was transferred to PGL3 basic vector between KpnI and XhoI sites. A mutated version was produced using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the following oligonucleotides: 5â²-GGCTCTGGTGGCGCAATCTGCGCGCCCC forward and 5â²-GGGGCGCGCAGATTGCGCCACCAGAGCC reverse (mutations are indicated by bold italicized characters). Short versions, spanning from â4 bp to â1027 bp, were produced by enzymatic digestion, using Sac-1. The constructs (long/short hPCSK9wt and long/short hPCSK9mut) were verified by sequencing. TransfectionsâThe day before the experiment, HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 350,000 cells/well, out of 24-well plates, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium glucose 4.5 g/liter, SVF 10%, 10 Î¼g/ml of streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin. The transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen), and cells were maintained in the same culture medium without serum for 20 h. We used hPCSK9wt or hPCSK9mut (0.150 Î¼g/well) together with pRL-CMVrenilla (5 ng/well) and/or expression vectors for mature transcriptionally active SREBP-1c (7.5 ng/well), generous gift from H. Vidal and B. Spiegelman. The analysis was performed with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)âEMSA were performed as described elsewhere (39Costet P. Lalanne F. Gerbod-Giannone M.C. Molina J.R. Fu X. Lund E.G. Gudas L.J. Tall A.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7756-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c expression vector was translated in vitro using TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega). Oligonucleotides containing the wild type (wtSRE) or mutated SRE (mutSRE) were wtSRE, 5â²-ATGGGGCTCTGGTGGCGTGATCTGCG forward and 5â²-GCGCGCAGATCACGCCACCAGAGCC reverse; mutSRE, 5â²-ATGGGGCTCTGGTGGCGCAATCTGCG forward and 5â²-GCGCGCAGATTGCGCCACCAGAGCC reverse. Mutations are indicated as underlined italicized characters. After oligonucleotides were annealed, probes were labeled with 32P using Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase I (Invitrogen). The probes (40,000 cpm) were separately incubated with in vitro translated SREBP-1c in presence or absence of a 30 m excess cold competitors. Anti-SREBP1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-367x). StatisticsâEach experiment is representative of at least two independent experiments with a minimum of triplicates per condition. All values are reported as means Â± S.E. Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's unpaired t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Hepatic PCSK9 Expression Is Decreased by Fasting and Restored upon RefeedingâTo determine whether PCSK9 expression is modulated by glycemia and/or insulinemia, C57BL/6 female mice were subjected to a 24-h fasting period followed by refeeding with a carbohydrate-rich diet for 6 and 24 h; their glycemia and insulinemia were determined at each time point, and PCSK9 mRNA and protein levels were analyzed afterward (Fig. 1). After 24 h of fasting, PCSK9 mRNA levels dropped dramatically, to almost undetectable levels. In contrast, PCSK9 expression was restored by refeeding, showing appreciable levels (27% of control fed mice) as soon as 6 h after refeeding; mRNA levels subsequently returned to their non-fasted state after 24 h of refeeding. Accordingly, PCSK9 protein (pro- and mature peptide) was decreased by 2.25-fold (p < 0.05) after the fasting period and restored to control value after 24 h of refeeding. Although the SREBP-1c cytosolic content was dramatically altered by fasting, no change was observed for the nuclear form. However, a significant increase was observed after refeeding (2.2-fold for nSREBP-1c versus ânon-fastedâ, p < 0.001). The LDLr protein quantity did not change during fasting or refeeding, accordingly with what has been published (40Kraemer F.B. Laane C. Park B. Sztalryd C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E26-E32PubMed Google Scholar). PCSK9 mRNA Accumulates in the Presence of Insulin in Rodent HepatocytesâTo assess whether insulin and/or glucose mediates the increased PCSK9 expression in response to CHO refeeding, we chose the primary rodent hepatocyte model (Fig. 2, A and B). When mouse cells were cultured in the presence of physiological (5 mm) or high doses (25 mm) of glucose, no change was observed in PCSK9 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A, left panel). Our positive control, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, responded to the treatment by a 5-fold increase of its mRNA levels (p < 0.01), suggesting that in vitro PCSK9 is not regulated by glucose. As expected, both SREBP-1c and LDLr mRNA expression did not vary in response to high glucose concentrations (Fig. 2A, right panel). When using a constant glucose concentration (5 mm), PCSK9 mRNA levels increased by 2.3-fold (p < 0.01) in the presence of 100 nm insulin compared with cells cultured without insulin (Fig. 2B, left panel). Similar results were obtained using high glucose concentration (25 mm) (data not shown). As expected, mRNA levels for GK, which is regulated by insulin via SREBP-1c, increased by 2.8-fold (p < 0.001) (18Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Accordingly, SREBP-1c mRNA increased in presence of insulin (2-fold, p < 0.05). A similar profile was obtained for the LDLr (Fig. 2B, right panel). To verify that PCSK9 response to insulin is not species-specific we cultured rat primary hepatocytes in similar conditions (Fig. 2C). We detected a comparable 4-fold increase in PCSK9 and SREBP-1c mRNA levels (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) but no difference for SREBP-2. Next, we verified that insulin stimulates PCSK9 expression in vivo by performing a 6-h long hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, PCSK9 mRNA levels were significantly increased at the end of the clamp (2-fold, p < 0.001) as well as our positive control GK (4-fold, p < 0.05), confirming that, in vivo, PCSK9 is up-regulated by insulin. Although not statistically significant, there was a tendency toward decreasing amounts of SREBP-1c mRNAs and no change in SREBP-2 mRNA levels. SREBP-1c Mediates PCSK9 Insulin-dependent ActivationâBecause it is known that SREBP-1c mediates insulin action on gene transcription, we analyzed PCSK9 expression in response to insulin in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes infected by an adenovirus expressing an active nuclear truncated SREBP-1c protein (AdSREBP-1cDP), a dominant negative form (AdSREBP-1cDN) (Fig. 3), or a sham control adenovirus (Adnul). The upper panel describes the relative endogenous versus adenoviral SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 cell content. Although it does not seem that SREBP-2 protein levels are affected, real time PCR analysis showed that Ad SREBP-1c-DN and AdSREBP-1c-DP constructs decreased by 2-fold SREBP-2 mRNA leve"

PON1 lactonase activity is stimulated by apoA-I by â¼7-fold relative to PC/FC particles. Wild-type (WT) PON1 bound to rHDL inhibited macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation and stimulated cholesterol efflux from the cells to 2.3- and 3.2-fold greater extents, respectively, compared with WT PON1 bound to PC/FC particles without apoA-I. We also tested PON1 catalytic histidine dyad mutants (H115Q and H134Q) that are properly folded and that bind HDL in a similar mode compared with WT PON1, but that exhibit almost no lactonase activity. These could not inhibit macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation or stimulate rHDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the cells. Furthermore, whereas HDL-bound WT PON1 induced the formation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in macrophages, the His dyad mutants did not, suggesting that the above anti-atherogenic properties of HDL-associated PON1 involve LPC release. Indeed, enrichment of macrophages with increasing concentrations of LPC resulted in inhibition of the cells' capability to oxidize LDL and in stimulation of HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages in an LPC dose-dependent manner. Thus, we provide the first direct indication that the anti-atherogenic properties of PON1 are related to its lipolactonase activity and propose a model in which PON1 acts as a lipolactonase to break down oxidized lipids and to generate LPC.

Volkova N. Aviram M. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, PON1 was shown to cause inhibition of macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis (24Rozenberg O. Shih D.M. Aviram M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Moreover, despite obvious similarities between PON1 and secreted phospholipase A2 in both the catalytic mechanism and interfacial activation (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S.

Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The existence of an active site unrelated to the paraoxonase/arylesterase activity (in which Cys284 plays a role) has also been suggested (18Aviram M. Billecke S. Sorenson R. Bisgaier C.L.

However, the recently solved crystal structure of PON1 indicates that this residue is completely buried in the hydrophobic core of the enzyme (30Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B.

Mutations of Cys284 therefore may have a global effect on the stability and solubility of PON1 (30Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A.

The main features of the PON1 active site are a catalytic calcium ion and a histidine dyad composed of His115 and His134 (30Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R.

Gaidukov L. Yagur S. Toker L. Silman I. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and apoA-I expressed in Escherichia coli (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), thus ruling out the participation of any contaminating serum components. We have previously shown that recombinant PON1, which exhibits catalytic properties that are essentially identical to those of serum-purified human PON1 (32Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Yagur S. Toker L. Silman I. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), also binds to HDL and is stimulated by apoA-I (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This stimulation increases PON1 stability by well over 300-fold and its lipolactonase activity by <20-fold relative to the delipidated form or by â¼10-fold relative to the detergent-associated form. We now show that, under these conditions, recombinant PON1 also inhibits copper ion-induced LDL oxidation and stimulates macrophage cholesterol efflux, two major anti-atherosclerotic activities. We also show that the H115Q and H134Q mutants of PON1, which exhibit diminished lactonase activity, also exhibit greatly reduced or even no anti-atherogenic activities. These results therefore provide the first direct evidence for the hypothesis that the anti-atherogenic functions of PON1 are mediated by its lipolactonase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant PON1 VariantsA recombinant PON1 variant named G3C9 (WT PON1) generated by directed evolution for expression in E. coli was used in this study. PON1 G3C9 is almost identical in sequence to rabbit PON1 (32Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Yagur S. Toker L. Silman I. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and exhibits kinetic parameters and HDL binding properties that are essentially identical to those of serum-purified rabbit and human PON1 (5Gaidukov L.

The preparation and characterization of recombinant PON1 G3C9 and its active-site histidine mutants have been described (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S.

The histidines at positions 115 and 134 were substituted with glutamine (H115Q and H134Q, respectively). The double histidine mutant used was H115Q/H134Q. Purified PON1 mutants were stored in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Tergitol supplemented with 0.02% sodium azide and 10% glycerol. The PON1 variants were briefly dialyzed before use against activity buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mm CaCl2) to remove azide and glycerol, which interfere with the oxidation assays and HDL binding.Preparation of Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) and Phosphatidylcholine/Free Cholesterol (PC/FC) ParticlesRabbit apoA-I containing an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Discoidal rHDL containing apoA-I and PC/FC particles with no apolipoprotein component were prepared by the cholate dialysis method as described previously (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) using an egg PC/FC/recombinant apoA-I starting molar ratio of 100:5:1. The concentration of rHDL was determined on the basis of apoA-I concentration, assuming an apoA-I/rHDL ratio of 2:1 (33Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1938; 750: 353-364Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogeneity of the preparations was assessed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which indicated the formation of â¼10-nm particles. rHDL particles were used without further purification.Binding of PON1 Mutants to rHDLDialyzed PON1 samples were delipidated using Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) as described (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) to minimize the amount of detergent present in the protein samples. Delipidated proteins were diluted in activity buffer (to 0.2 Î¼m for enzyme assays and to 8 Î¼m for LDL oxidation and cholesterol efflux studies) and incubated with rHDL (10 Î¼m) for 3 h at 37 Â°C.PON1 Enzyme AssaysThe catalytic activities of recombinant PON1 and its histidine mutants were determined in detergent-containing buffer or in the presence of rHDL particles as described (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type (WT) PON1 and its mutants were diluted in activity buffer to 0.01-1 Î¼m or incubated with a large excess (50-fold) of rHDL, and enzyme activities were detected spectrophotometrically with various substrates at 0.4-1 mm: paraoxon (1 mm), phenyl acetate (1 mm), 5-(thiobutyl)-butyrolactone (0.4 mm), and Î³-nonanoic lactone (0.4 mm). Hydrolysis of paraoxon and phenyl acetate was detected in activity buffer at 405 and 270 nm, respectively. Hydrolysis of 5-(thiobutyl)butyrolactone was assayed in activity buffer using 5,5â²-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) for product detection at 412 nm (35Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of Î³-nonanoic lactone was assayed in 2.5 mm Bicine (pH 8.3), 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 in the presence of 0.2 mm of cresol purple indicator. Proton release by the carboxylic acid product was detected at 577 nm (6Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar).CellsJ774A.1 murine macrophage cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum.Human LDL and HDL PreparationLDL and HDL were prepared from the serum of fasted normolipidemic human volunteers by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation (36Aviram M. Biochem. Med. 1983; 30: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The HDLs were then dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4), and their protein content was determined with the Folin phenol reagent (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).LDL Oxidation StudiesCell-free SystemâLDL (100 Î¼g/ml protein) in phosphate-buffered saline was preincubated with no addition (control LDL) or with the above PON1 preparations for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 5 Î¼m CuSO4 was added to all test tubes for further incubation for 1.5 h at 37 Â°C. The extent of LDL oxidation was measured by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) assay (38Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10628) Google Scholar) and by the lipid peroxide assay (39El-Saadani M. Esterbauer N. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Macrophage-mediated Oxidation of LDLâBefore oxidation, LDL (1 mg/ml protein) was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. LDL (100 Î¼g/ml protein) in RPMI 1640 medium (without phenol red) was incubated without cells or with J774A.1 cells (2 Ã 106) in the presence of 2.5 Î¼m CuSO4 for 5 h at 37 Â°C or 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h. WT PON1 and its histidine mutants (either in free form or bound to rHDL or PC/FC) were added to the incubation medium of LDL with the cells. The extent of cell-mediated oxidation was then determined by the TBARS assay (38Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10628) Google Scholar).Cholesterol Efflux from MacrophagesThe cells (1 Ã 106/ml) were washed and incubated with [3H]cholesterol for 1 h at 37 Â°C. After washing, the cells were further incubated with no addition, with human HDL (100 Î¼g/ml protein), or with human HDL that was preincubated with WT PON1 or its mutants (20 Î¼g/ml). In the experiments with recombinant PON1 bound to rHDL or PC/FC, the cells were incubated with rHDL or PC/FC (1.3 Î¼g/ml cholesterol). After a 3-h incubation at 37 Â°C, 500 Î¼l of the medium was collected. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1 n NaOH was added. Cellular and medium 3H labels were quantitated, and the percentage of cholesterol efflux was calculated as the ratio of (3H label in the medium Ã 100) to (3H label in the medium + 3H label in the cells) (25Rosenblat M. Vaya J. Shih D.M. Aviram M. Atherosclerosis. 2005; 179: 69-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). HDL- or PC/FC-mediated cholesterol efflux is the value obtained in the presence of HDL or PC/FC minus the value obtained in cells incubated without HDL or PC/FC. The extent of cholesterol efflux with no addition of HDL or PC/FC was â¼5%.Macrophage Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) ContentJ774A.1 macrophages (6 Ã 106) were incubated for 3 h at 37 Â°C with control rHDL (1.3 Î¼g/ml cholesterol) or with rHDL preincubated with WT PON1 or its mutants. The cells were then washed and lipid-extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v). The hexane phase was collected and dried under nitrogen. The identification and quantitative determination of LPC were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (Micromass Quattro Ultima mass spectrometer) using a direct injection method at positive mode electrospray ionization. The identification of LPC was based on the characteristic mass spectra of standard LPC constructed from a 2:1 mixture of palmitate/stearate esters (25Rosenblat M. Vaya J. Shih D.M. Aviram M. Atherosclerosis. 2005; 179: 69-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).StatisticsStatistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t test when comparing the mean of two groups.

We have found that the first two activities are mediated by a His dyad composed of His115 and His134, in which His115 acts as a general base to deprotonate a water molecule and to prompt the attack of the lactone or aryl ester carbonyl, and His134 acts as a proton shuttle to increase the basicity of His115 (55Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7649-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Consequently, even the most conserved mutation of His (H115Q) reduced PON1 lactonase and arylesterase activities by 45-500-fold in terms of kcat/Km and by 30-110-fold at substrate concentrations â¥Km (Table 1). The H134Q mutation had a milder effect (6-20-fold decrease), consistent with its auxiliary role. The double mutant H115Q/H134Q exhibited almost no lactonase or arylesterase activity (100-fold lower compared with WT PON1). In contrast, the phosphotriesterase activity of all three mutants was barely affected (2-fold decrease for H115Q and â¼2-fold increase for H134Q and the double mutant) (Table 1).TABLE 1Catalytic activities of PON1 and its His dyad mutants in the lipid-poor form, in micellar detergent solution, or in apoA-I-containing HDL particlesParaoxonPenyl acetateTBBLÎ³-Nonanoic lactonePON1Lipid-poorTergitolApoA-I-containing HDLLipid-poorTergitolApoA-I-containing HDLLipid-poorTergitolApoA-I-containing HDLLipid-poorTergitolApoA-I-containing HDLWT2.0 Â± 0.6 (100%)1.8 Â± 0.1 (100%)4.1 Â± 0.1 (100%)338 Â± 17 (100%)521 Â± 7.7 (100%)172"

Upon ligand binding, Notch receptors undergo proteolytic cleavage leading to the release of their intracellular domain (NICD). Overexpression of NICD impairs osteoblastogenesis, but the mechanisms are not understood. We examined consequences of the constitutive activation of Notch 1 in ST-2 cells. Notch opposed the effects of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and Wnt 3a on alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). BMP-2 induced the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 and the transactivation of a BMP/Smad-responsive construct (12ÃSBE-Oc-pGL3), but the effect was not modified by Notch. BMP-2 had minimal effects on the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK, p38, and JNK, in the absence or presence of NICD. Notch overexpression decreased the transactivating effect of Wnt 3a, cytoplasmic Î²-catenin levels, and Wnt-dependent gene expression. Transfection of a mutant Î²-catenin expression construct, or the use of a glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² inhibitor to stabilize Î²-catenin, partially blocked the inhibitory effect of NICD on Wnt signaling and on APA. HES-1 or Groucho1/TLE1 RNA interference enhanced basal and induced Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling opposing NICD effects, but only HES-1 silencing enhanced Wnt 3a effects on APA.

Wnt can activate four distinct signaling pathways, but in osteoblasts the Wnt/Î²-catenin canonical pathway is utilized (29Chen A.E. Ginty D.D. Fan C.M.

In the absence of Wnt, axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, Î²-catenin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK3Î²) form a complex in which Î²-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3Î² leading to Î²-catenin degradation after ubiquitination. The binding of Wnt proteins to their specific Frizzled transmembrane receptors and to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 co-receptors leads to the inhibition of GSK3Î² and the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin. In the nucleus, Î²-catenin associates with members of the lymphoid enhancer binding factor/T cell-specific factor (LEF/TCF) family of transcription factors and regulates gene transcription (31Dale T.C.

The purpose of this study was to investigate mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effect of NICD overexpression on osteoblastogenesis and examine interactions between Notch and BMP and Wnt signaling in cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Vectors and Packaging Cell LinesâA 2389-bp DNA fragment containing the murine NICD cDNA, with a Myc epitope tag on the amino-terminal end (kindly provided by J. Nye, Chicago, IL) was cloned into either pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) for use in acute transfection experiments or cloned into the retroviral vector pLPCX (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for the creation of transduced cell lines. In both vectors, a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter directs the constitutive expression of NICD (48Nye J.S. Kopan R. Axel R. Development. 1994; 120: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pLPCX contains a packaging signal under the control of a Moloney murine leukemia virus 5â² long terminal repeat and a puromycin resistance gene under the control of the CMV promoter. pLPCX and pLPCX NICD were transfected into Phoenix packaging cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) by calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation and glycerol shock, and cells were selected for puromycin resistance, as described (9Sciaudone M. Gazzerro E. Priest L. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5631-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Retrovirus-containing conditioned medium was harvested, filtered through a 0.45-Î¼m membrane, and used to transduce ST-2 cells. Cell CultureâST-2 cells, cloned stromal cells isolated from bone marrow of BC8 mice (Dr. S. Harris, San Antonio, TX), were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 Â°C in minimum essential medium (Î±-MEM, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). ST-2 cells were selected because of previously characterized osteogenic properties and responsiveness to Notch (9Sciaudone M. Gazzerro E. Priest L. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5631-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 49Pereira R.C. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Bone. 2002; 30: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For the creation of cell lines, ST-2 cells were transduced with pLPCX vector or with pLPCX NICD by replacing the culture medium with retroviral conditioned medium from Phoenix packaging cells, in the presence of 8 Î¼g/ml Polybrene (Sigma) followed by incubation for 16â18 h at 37 Â°C. The culture medium was replaced with fresh Î±-MEM, and cells were grown, trypsinized, replated, and selected for puromycin resistance. Cells transduced with pLPCX vector or pLPCX NICD were plated at a density of 104 cells/cm2 and cultured in Î±-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until reaching confluence (2â4 days). To study the effect of NICD on alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), confluent ST-2 cells were transferred to Î±-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 Î¼g/ml ascorbic acid, and 5 mm Î²-glycerophosphate (Sigma), and cultured for 3 days in the presence or absence of recombinant human BMP-2 (Wyeth Research, Collegeville, PA), Wnt 3a (R and D, Minneapolis, MN), or a glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3Î² inhibitor (CHIR 99021, Chiron, Emeryville, CA), as indicated in the text and legends. To study the effects on Smad or MAP kinase phosphorylation, confluent cells were serum-deprived overnight and treated with BMP-2 for 15 min to 6 h. To study effects on Î²-catenin levels, confluent cells were treated with or without GSK3Î² inhibitor CHIR 99021 for 4 h. Transient TransfectionsâTo determine changes in BMP-2 signaling, a construct containing twelve copies of a Smad 1/5 response element, linked to the osteocalcin basal promoter, and cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (12ÃSBE-OC-pGL3, M. Zhao, San Antonio, TX) was tested in transient transfection experiments. To determine changes in Î²-catenin transactivating activity, a pTOPFLASH reporter construct containing three copies of the LEF-1/TCF-4 binding sequences upstream of a minimal c-fos promoter and a luciferase reporter gene (J. Kitajewski, New York, NY) or a construct containing sixteen copies of the LEF-1/TCF-4 recognition sequence, cloned upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and a luciferase reporter gene (16ÃTCF-luc, J. Billiard, Wyeth Research) were tested in transient transfection experiments. The activity of pTOPFLASH and 16ÃTCF-luc was tested in the absence or presence of the GSK3Î² inhibitor CHIR 99021 or in the absence or presence of a co-transfected Î²-catenin expression construct, mutated at Ser-37, and cloned into pCiNeo (pCiNeo-S37-FLAG, P. J. Morin, Baltimore, MD) or control vector. Transient transfections were conducted in transduced cell lines cultured to 70% confluence and transiently transfected with the indicated constructs using FuGene6 (3 Î¼l of FuGene/2 Î¼g of DNA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). In one experiment, wild-type ST-2 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA 3.1 or pcDNA NICD and 12ÃSBE-Oc-pGL3, as stated in the text. Co-transfections with a Î²-galactosidase expression construct (Clontech, San Jose, CA) were used to control for transfection efficiency. For 12ÃSBE-Oc-pGL3, cells were exposed to the FuGene-DNA mix for 16 h and transferred to serum-containing medium for 8 h. Cells were then cultured in medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 20 h, treated with or without BMP-2, and harvested. For pTOP-FLASH or 16ÃTCF-luc activity, cells were exposed to the FuGene-DNA mix for 16 h, transferred to serum containing test or control medium for 48 h, and harvested. Luciferase and Î²-galactosidase activities were measured using an Optocomp luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). Luciferase activity was corrected for Î²-galactosidase activity. RNAiâTo down-regulate hes-1 and Groucho1/TLE1 and -2 gene expression, a 21-mer double-stranded RNA composed of sense CGGCCAAUUUGCCUUUCUCtt and antisense GAGAAAGGCAAAUUGGCCGtc sequences for HES-1, of sense GGCUCUUACACUAUAUUUUtt and antisense AAAAUAUAGUGUAAGAGCCtg sequences for Groucho1/TLE1, and of sense GGGAUUUACACUCACUCCUtt and antisense AGGAGUGAGUGUAAAUCCCtg sequences for Groucho2/TLE2 were obtained commercially (Ambion, Austin, TX). A 19-bp silencing (si) scrambled RNA composed of sequences with no homology to known mouse or rat sequences was used as a control. HES-1, Groucho1/TLE1, or scrambled siRNA, all at 20 nm, were transfected into 50% confluent ST-2 cells, transduced with pLPCX or pLPCX NICD, using siLentFect lipid reagent, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Following a 24-h recovery period, transduced cells were treated with BMP-2 or Wnt 3a and analyzed for APA 72 h later. In selected experiments, wild-type ST-2 cells were transfected with HES-1, Groucho1/TLE1 or -2, or scrambled siRNA, allowed to recover for 6 h following RNAi, and transfected with pcDNA NICD or pcDNA 3.1, with a Wnt 3 expression vector (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY) or pCiNeo-S37-FLAG or control constructs, and with 16ÃTCF-luc. Alternatively, silenced transfected cells were tested with GSK3Î² inhibitor, CHIR 99021, as stated in text and legends. To ensure adequate RNAi, total RNA was extracted and HES-1, Groucho1/TLE1, and Groucho2/TLE2 mRNA levels determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (50Nazarenko I. Lowe B. Darfler M. Ikonomi P. Schuster D. Rashtchian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e37Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 51Nazarenko I. Pires R. Lowe B. Obaidy M. Rashtchian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2089-2195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, 1â5 Î¼g of RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of 5â²-ATTCTTGCCCTTCGGCCTCTT-3â² primer for HES-1, 5â²-CGGCTTGAGGGTGTTGATCTGC[FAM]G-3â² for Groucho1/TLE1 and 5â²-CGCCACCTACAATCAGGCTCT-3â² for Groucho2/TLE2 and murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and amplified in the presence of 5â²-GACTTTCACGGCCTCTGAGCACAGAAAG [FAM]C-3â² primer for HES-1, 5â²-GCCAAATGCAGCCTGTTCCTTT-3â² for Groucho1/TLE1 and 5â²-CGGATTGAACCGAGACAACTACATA[FAM]G-3â² for Groucho2/TLE2 and Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) at 54 Â°C for 45 cycles. Gene copy number was estimated by comparison with a standard curve constructed using HES-1 cDNA (R. Kagayama, Kyoto, Japan), Groucho1/TLE1 cDNA (R. Shivdascini, Boston, MA), or Groucho2/TLE2 cDNA (J. Downing, Memphis, TN), and corrected for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase copy number. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was reverse-transcribed using 5â²-AGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTCTGG-3â² primer and amplified in the presence of 5â²-CACGCTCTGGAAAGCTGTGGCG[FAM]G-3â², and copy number was estimated by comparison with a standard curve. Reactions were conducted in a 96-well spectrofluorometric thermal iCycler (Bio-Rad), and fluorescence was monitored during every PCR cycle at the annealing step. Alkaline Phosphatase ActivityâTransduced ST-2 cells cultured to confluence were treated with BMP-2, Wnt 3a, or GSK3Î² inhibitor CHIR 99021 for 72 h and harvested. APA was determined in 0.5% Triton X-100 cell extracts by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol and measured by spectroscopy at 405 nm after 10 min of incubation at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Data are expressed as nanomoles of p-nitrophenol released per minute per microgram of protein. Total protein content was determined in cell extracts by the DC protein assay in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Northern Blot AnalysisâTotal cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Equal amounts of RNA were loaded on a formaldehyde-agarose gel following denaturation. The RNA was blotted onto GeneScreen Plus-charged nylon (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 1.6-kb Wnt-induced secreted protein (WISP) 1 cDNA and a 0.7-kb 18 S ribosomal RNA cDNA (both from ATCC) were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNAs were labeled with [Î±-32P]dCTP (50 Î¼Ci at a specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (-dCTP kit, Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridizations were carried out at 42 Â°C for 16 h, followed by two post-hybridization washes at room temperature for 15 min in 1 Ã SSC, and a wash at 65 Â°C for 20â30 min in 1 Ã SSC. The bound radioactive material was visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), employing Cronex Lightning Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) intensifying screens. Northern analyses are representative of three samples. Western Blot AnalysisâTo determine the level of phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8, and of the MAP kinases p44 ERK1, p42 ERK2, JNK 1, and 2/3, and p38, the cell layer of ST-2 cells transduced with pLPCX NICD or pLPCX was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in TNE lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% P40, and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors, as described (52Gazzerro E. Pereira R.C. Jorgetti V. Olson S. Economides A.N. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by DC protein assay, and 70 Î¼g of total cellular protein was fractionated by gel electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, transferred to Immobilon P membranes, which were blocked with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. For Smad 1/5/8, membranes were exposed to a rabbit polyclonal antibody, which recognizes Smad 1, 5, and 8 phosphorylated at the last two serine residues (C. H. Heldin, Uppsala, Sweden) or exposed to a monoclonal antibody to unphosphorylated Smad 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution. To estimate MAP kinase activation, membranes were exposed to rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated p44 ERK1 (Thr-183/185) and p42 ERK2 (Thr-202/204), JNK 1 and 2/3 (Thr-183/Tyr-185), or p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), or to rabbit polyclonal antibodies to corresponding unphosphorylated proteins (all at 1:1000 dilution; all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). To determine Î²-catenin levels, the cell layer was extracted in 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol buffer at pH 7.6, in the presence of protease inhibitors, and the cytoplasmic fraction was separated by ultracentrifugation, as described (53Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 100 Î¼g of total cytoplasmic protein were fractionated by gel electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to a 1:500 dilution of a monoclonal antibody to unphosphorylated Î²-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All blots were exposed to anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed with a chemiluminescence detection reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Statistical AnalysisâData are expressed as means Â± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by analysis of variance or t test. In accordance with our previous observations, BMP-2 and Wnt 3a increased alkaline phosphatase, an earlier marker of osteoblastic differentiation in ST-2 cells (54Pereira R.M. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Bone. 2001; 28: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As the culture progresses, ST-2 cells exposed to BMP-2 express additional osteoblastic gene markers, and form mineralized nodules, and these are suppressed by Notch overexpression (9Sciaudone M. Gazzerro E. Priest L. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5631-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 49Pereira R.C. Delany A.M. Canalis E. Bone. 2002; 30: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In accordance, NICD overexpression opposed the dose-dependent effect of BMP-2 and Wnt 3a on APA in ST-2 cells (Fig. 1). To elucidate the mechanism of Notch action in ST-2 cells, we analyzed the effect of NICD overexpression on downstream events of BMP-2 signaling. The signaling pathway used by BMPs is cell line-dependent, and in differentiated osteoblasts BMP-2 signals by activating Smad 1/5/8, or the MAP kinases, ERK1/2, JNK1â2/3, or p38 (27Lai C.F.

To determine whether Notch altered BMP signaling, control vector cells and NICD-overexpressing cells were treated with BMP-2, and examined for effects on Smad and MAP kinase activation. In an initial experiment, we documented that BMP-2 induced the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8, and the effect was maximal after 15 min and was sustained for 6 h (data not shown). BMP-2 at 0.3â3.3 nm for 20 min caused an equal increase in phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8, but BMP-2 caused a dose-related increase on the transactivation of the BMP/Smad-dependent 12ÃSBE-Oc-pGL3 construct (Fig. 2, A and B). The lack of dose dependence on Smad phosphorylation is possibly due to the lesser sensitivity of Western blot analysis in the detection of modest changes. NICD overexpression did not modify either the level of phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8 or the transactivation of the BMP/Smad-dependent 12ÃSBE-Oc-pGL3 construct in the presence or absence of BMP-2 (Fig. 2, A and B). NICD overexpression did not modify the effect of BMP-2 on Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation from a 15-min to a 6-h period of study (data not shown). The results were analogous in permanently NICD-transduced c"
https://openalex.org/W2065625914,"Specific cell type differentiation is driven by programmed regulation of gene expression, which is the result of coordinated modulation of the transcription machinery and chromatin-remodeling factors. We present evidence here that the down-regulation of histone deacetylases is an important process during adipocyte differentiation. In 3T3-L1 cells, histone hyperacetylation was selectively induced at the promoter regions of adipogenic genes during adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, this was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the expression level of several histone deacetylases including HDAC1, -2, and -5 and a reduction in overall histone deacetylase enzyme activity. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity using sodium butyrate resulted in stimulation of adipogenic gene expression and adipocyte differentiation. Consistently, HDAC1 knock-down promoted adipogenesis whereas HDAC1 overexpression attenuated adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Together, these results suggest that the regulation of not only adipogenic transcription factors, but also chromatin-modifying enzymes is crucial for the execution of bona fide adipogenesis. Specific cell type differentiation is driven by programmed regulation of gene expression, which is the result of coordinated modulation of the transcription machinery and chromatin-remodeling factors. We present evidence here that the down-regulation of histone deacetylases is an important process during adipocyte differentiation. In 3T3-L1 cells, histone hyperacetylation was selectively induced at the promoter regions of adipogenic genes during adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, this was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the expression level of several histone deacetylases including HDAC1, -2, and -5 and a reduction in overall histone deacetylase enzyme activity. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity using sodium butyrate resulted in stimulation of adipogenic gene expression and adipocyte differentiation. Consistently, HDAC1 knock-down promoted adipogenesis whereas HDAC1 overexpression attenuated adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Together, these results suggest that the regulation of not only adipogenic transcription factors, but also chromatin-modifying enzymes is crucial for the execution of bona fide adipogenesis. The architecture of the eukaryotic chromatin is dynamically modulated by post-translational modifications of the histones, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7468) Google Scholar). The changes in nucleosome structure influence gene expression by modulating the accessibility of the promoter regions to specific transcription factors. In particular, acetylation of histones H3 (Lys9 and Lys14) and H4 (Lys8 and Lys12), mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 4The abbreviations used are: HATs, histone acetyltransferases; HDAC, histone deacetylase; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPARÎ³, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³; ADD1/SREBP1c, adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1/sterol response element-binding protein 1c; NaB, sodium butyrate; siRNA, small interference RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Pref-1, preadipocyte factor 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells.4The abbreviations used are: HATs, histone acetyltransferases; HDAC, histone deacetylase; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPARÎ³, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³; ADD1/SREBP1c, adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1/sterol response element-binding protein 1c; NaB, sodium butyrate; siRNA, small interference RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Pref-1, preadipocyte factor 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells. such as p300, CBP, and P/CAF, is associated with transcriptional activation (2Ogryzko V.V.

Until now, five yeast and eleven human HDACs have been identified, which are classified into three classes (12de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem.

Class I HDACs are expressed ubiquitously, whereas class II HDACs are abundantly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain (12de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). The major function of HDACs is to remove acetyl groups from histones, which results in condensation of the chromatin structure. This, in turn, diminishes the access of transcription factors to the target DNA and ultimately leads to transcriptional repression. Chromatin modifications, notably histone acetylation and deacetylation, are crucial for the regulation of gene expression and development in eukaryotes (19Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 20Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). During tissue differentiation, early inductive processes that determine cell fate leave traces at particular genes in the form of histone modifications. HATs and HDACs have been shown to respond to signals that regulate cell differentiation and directly modulate tissue-specific gene expression. For example, studies of myogenesis have suggested a role for histone-modifying enzymes in coordinating the activation and repression of genes involved in differentiation process (21Puri P.L.

In vitro studies using 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells have elucidated the complex transcriptional cascades that are essential for the execution of adipocyte differentiation (28Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 29Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3116S-3121SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³), and adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1/sterol response element-binding protein 1c (ADD1/SREBP1c) have been identified as the key transcription factors involved in adipogenesis (30Wu Z.

When preadipocytes are exposed to differentiation conditions, a complex signaling cascade induces the expression of previously silent adipogenic genes. Although it is not clear how these genes are maintained quiescent in preadipocytes, it is possible to speculate that HDACs are involved. Past research on tissue differentiation has been mainly focused on understanding the regulatory roles of specific transcription factors. On the contrary, little is known about the functional roles of coregulators such as HATs and HDACs during differentiation processes. In this study we have discovered a novel role of HDACs during adipogenesis. Our results suggest that the down-regulation of HDACs at the early stages adipogenesis is a rate-limiting step during adipogenesis. These findings add to the list of the functional roles of coregulators in regulating cell differentiation and may provide a new target for discovering novel therapies for the treatment of fat-related disorders. Cell Cultureâ3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (BCS, Invitrogen), with a change of medium every 2-3 days. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes as previously described (32Seo J.B. Moon H.M. Kim W.S. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.W. Yoo E.J. Ham J. Kang H. Park M.G. Steffensen K.R. Stulnig T.M. Gustafsson J.A. Park S.D. Kim J.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3430-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). 3T3-F442A cells were differentiated into adipocytes by replacing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 5 Î¼g/ml insulin upon reaching confluence. BOSC and H29D retrovirus packaging cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssaysâChromatin was immunoprecipitated as described previously (33Seo J.B. Noh M.J. Yoo E.J. Park S.Y. Park J. Lee I.K. Park S.D. Kim J.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Conditions for PCR reactions were as follows: 0.25 Î¼m of each primer, 0.1 mm of each dNTP, 1Ã PCR buffer, 1 unit Nova Taq polymerase (Genenmed), and 0.06 mCi/ml [Î±-32P]dCTP in 20 Î¼l of reaction volume.

Acid Extraction of Histones and Western BlottingâHistone proteins were isolated from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes by acid extraction according to the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Following transfer, the membranes were blocked with milk and probed with antibodies against HDAC1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, PPARÎ³, C/EBPÎ±, CBP, p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), acetylated histone H3 (Lys9), dimethylated histone H3 (Lys9), histone H3, acetylated histone H4 (Lys8 and Lys12), and histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology). Results were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma Aldrich) and enhanced chemiluminescence. HDAC Enzyme Activity AssaysâTotal cellular HDAC enzymatic activity was measured using an HDAC assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 40 Î¼g of total cell extracts from 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes and adipocytes were incubated with a fluorometric substrate in HDAC assay buffer for 45 min at 30 Â°C. An activator solution was then added to release the fluorophore from the deacetylated substrates, and the fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence plate reader. mRNA AnalysisâTotal RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blotting, 20 Î¼g of RNA was denatured in formamide and formaldehyde, and separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. RNA was transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and the membranes were cross-linked, hybridized, and washed as described by the manufacturers. Probes were labeled by the random priming method using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega) and [Î±-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). PPARÎ³, aP2, C/EBPÎ±, and FAS cDNAs were used as probes. For real-time PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using oligodT and subjected to PCR amplification with gene-specific primers in the presence of Cybergreen (Bio-Rad). Relative abundance of mRNA was calculated after normalization to 18 S ribosomal RNA. Primer sequences for real-time PCR analyses are available upon request. Retroviral InfectionâBOSC or H29D cells were transfected with either pBABE, pBABE-HDAC1, pSUPERretro (Oligoengine), or pSUPER-retro-HDAC1 RNAi (5â²-GCA GCG TCT CTT TGA GAA C-3â²) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the medium containing retroviruses was harvested, filtered, and transferred to 3T3-L1 target cells with polybrene (1 Î¼g/ml). Infected cells were selected with 5 Î¼g/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 7 days. Transient Transfections and Luciferase AssaysâHEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. A luciferase reporter driven by multiple PPREs (DR1-luc) was cotransfected with PPARÎ³ and HDAC1 expression vectors using the calcium phosphate method (32Seo J.B. Moon H.M. Kim W.S. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.W. Yoo E.J. Ham J. Kang H. Park M.G. Steffensen K.R. Stulnig T.M. Gustafsson J.A. Park S.D. Kim J.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3430-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Protein Interaction AnalysesâGST-pulldown assays were performed as previously described (34Lee Y.S. Lee H.H. Park J. Yoo E.J. Glackin C.A.

Briefly, GST and GST-PPARÎ³ fusion proteins were bound to glutathione beads and incubated with 35S-labeled HDAC1 protein. The beads were washed with TBS and analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. Protein-protein interaction in cells was also analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HDAC1 and PPARÎ³ expression vectors were transfected in HEK293 cells using the calcium phosphate method. After transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared and incubated with HDAC1 antibody overnight at 4 Â°C. The immunocomplexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times with TBS. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antibodies against PPARÎ³. Histone Modification at the Promoters of Adipogenic Genes during Adipocyte DifferentiationâThe dramatic changes in gene expression profiles during adipocyte differentiation have been previously described (35Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 36Sadowski H.B. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the expression of adipogenic genes such as PPARÎ³, C/EBPÎ±, and ADD1/SREBP1c is increased (28Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar), whereas that of preadipocyte marker genes including preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) and GATA2 is conversely decreased (37Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 38Tong Q. Dalgin G. Xu H. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although many transcription factors that participate in adipocyte differentiation have been identified, the roles of histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin-remodeling factors during this process have not been thoroughly investigated. To determine if histone modification is involved in adipogenesis, we examined the level of histone acetylation and methylation at the promoter regions of adipocyte marker genes. The degree of histone H3 Lys9 acetylation at the promoters of ADD1/SREBP1c, adiponectin, aP2, C/EBPÎ±, and PPARÎ³ was increased upon differentiation (Fig. 1A). Similarly, histone H4 Lys8 acetylation was increased at the promoters of ADD1/SREBP1c and adiponectin (Fig. 1B). In contrast, histone acetylation gradually decreased at the promoter of Pref-1, consistent with the fact that it is down-regulated during adipogenesis (37Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the level of histone H3 Lys9 methylation displayed opposite patterns, decreasing at the promoters of ADD1/SREBP1c and C/EBPÎ± and marginally increasing at the Pref-1 promoter (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the up-regulation of adipogenic genes during adipogenesis is tightly associated with the selective induction of histone hyperacetylation at the promoter regions of these genes. Changes of Histone Modification and Expression of HDACs during AdipogenesisâBecause the steady state of histone acetylation is determined by the balance between HATs and HDACs, we next examined the protein levels of several histone-modifying enzymes before and after differentiation. In 3T3-L1 cells, the expression levels of several HDACs including HDAC1, -2, -5, and -6 were drastically reduced during differentiation (Fig. 2A) whereas HDAC3, -4, -7, and -8 were either slightly increased or unchanged (supplemental Fig. S1). The protein levels of HATs, such as CBP or p300, were shown to be unchanged or slightly increased, respectively (Fig. 2A). A similar reduction in HDAC1, -2, -3, -5, -7, and -8 was observed in 3T3-F442A cells, another adipogenic cell line (Fig. 2B). C/EBPÎ± and PPARÎ³ were used as control to confirm proper differentiation. The finding that the expression of several HDACs is severely decreased prompted us to examine whether the overall balance would be shifted in favor of histone acetylation. Indeed, the degree of overall histone acetylation was increased in adipocytes compared with undifferentiated preadipocytes (Fig. 3A). Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9, which usually displays an opposite pattern to acetylation, was decreased in adipocytes. To determine whether histone deacetylase activity is actually regulated during differentiation, we directly measured HDAC enzyme activity using the same total cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 3B, total cellular HDAC activity was reduced to â¼50â¼60% in both 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells upon differentiation (Fig. 3B). On the contrary, total cellular HAT activity was slightly increased in differentiated adipocytes (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the increase of histone acetylation during adipogenesis is the result of a combination of decreased HDAC activity, and to some extent, increased HAT activity. Such modification of histone tails would probably contribute to the overall increase of gene expression in adipocytes, which have been reported to express a larger number of genes than preadipocytes (36Sadowski H.B. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of HDAC Inhibition on Adipocyte DifferentiationâNext, to determine whether the down-regulation of HDAC activity indeed affects adipogenesis, we treated 3T3-L1 cells with an inhibitor of HDACs, sodium butyrate (NaB). Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid that noncompetitively inhibits the activity of most HDAC isoforms (39Candido E.P. Reeves R. Davie J.R. Cell. 1978; 14: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 40Sealy L. Chalkley R. Cell. 1978; 14: 115-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A chronic treatment of NaB accelerated differentiation and increased lipid accumulation assessed by Oil Red-O staining. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of adipogenic genes was induced at an earlier time point (Fig. 4B). A similar effect was observed in C3H10T1/2 cells, a murine mesenchymal fibroblast cell line that can also be induced to differentiate into adipocytes (supplemental Fig. S2). To investigate the time periods at which HDAC inhibition exhibits the most critical effect on adipogenesis, we treated the cells with NaB for different periods during adipocyte differentiation. Cells treated with NaB throughout the entire differentiation period clearly exhibited stimulated adipocyte differentiation compared with control cells (Fig. 4C, panels II and VIII). Notably, inhibition of the HDACs at the early stage of adipogenesis (the first 1 or 2 days) seemed to be sufficient to stimulate adipogenesis (Fig. 4C, panels IV and V), while treatment of NaB at later periods had little or no effect (Fig. 4C, panels VI and VII). Taken together, these results indicate that suppression of HDAC activity at the early stage of adipogenesis may be crucial for adipocyte differentiation. The Role of HDAC1 during AdipogenesisâAmong many HDAC isoforms, HDAC1 was most consistently and dramatically down-regulated during adipogenesis (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine if HDAC1 plays an important role in adipogenic gene expression, we determined the recruitment of HDAC1 to the promoter regions of adipogenic genes using ChIP assays. As expected, recruitment of HDAC1 decreased upon differentiation in most adipogenic genes including adiponectin, ADD1/SREBP1c, aP2, C/EBPÎ±, and PPARÎ³, indicating that HDAC1 may be involved in regulating the expression of these genes (Fig. 5A). To directly determine whether HDAC1 is specifically involved in adipocyte differentiation, we generated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes retrovirally overexpressing HDAC1. These cells expressed higher amounts of HDAC1 (â¼2-fold) compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 5B). Under differentiation conditions, the HDAC1-overexpressing cells exhibited substantially attenuated adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5C). In addition, the expression of several adipogenic genes is also decreased in HDAC1-overexpressing cells, suggesting that HDAC1 suppresses adipogenesis by down-regulating the expression of adipogenic genes (Fig. 5D). In a reciprocal experiment, we examined the effect of HDAC1 down-regulation via siRNA. To test whether the HDAC1-siRNA effectively reduced HDAC1 expression, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged HDAC1 and HDAC1-siRNA vectors. As expected, overexpression of HDAC1-siRNA efficiently repressed HDAC1 expression (Fig. 6A). Next, 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing the retroviral HDAC1-siRNA were tested for their ability to differentiate into adipocytes. Consistent with the above observations, HDAC1 knock-down 3T3-L1 cells clearly displayed accelerated differentiation (Fig. 6B) and stimulated expression of ADD1/SREBP1c, aP2, and PPARÎ³ (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, HDAC1 knockdown led to the increase of histone acetylation at H3 Lys9, H4 Lys8, and H4 Lys12 residues. Conversely, the extent of histone H3 Lys9 methylation decreased (Fig. 6D). These results provide strong evidence that HDAC1 controls adipocyte differentiation by regulating the acetylation of histones and implicate that a threshold level of HDAC activity is probably required to maintain preadipocytes by silencing adipogenic genes in the undifferentiated state. Regulation of PPARÎ³ Activity by HDAC1âTo understand how HDAC1 affects adipocyte differentiation, we examined whether HDAC1 could directly regulate the transcriptional activity of PPARÎ³, a master adipogenic transcription factor. In transient transfection assays, HDAC1 repressed the transcriptional activity PPARÎ³ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, the activity of ADD1/SREBP1c was not altered by HDAC1 (data not shown). To see if HDAC1 physically associates with PPARÎ³, we performed GST-pulldown assays using recombinant GST-PPARÎ³ fusion proteins and in vitro translated HDAC1. HDAC1 bound specifically with purified GST-PPARÎ³ but not GST, suggesting that HDAC1 may directly interact with PPARÎ³ (Fig. 7B). To investigate whether this interaction occurs in cells, we isolated whole cell lysates of HEK293 cells after transfection with plasmids encoding PPARÎ³ and HDAC1. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HDAC1 antibody followed by Western blot assays using anti-PPARÎ³ antibody demonstrates that HDAC1 indeed interacts with PPARÎ³ in vivo (Fig. 7C). It is therefore possible to speculate that HDAC1 could modulate adipocyte differentiation by repressing PPARÎ³ activity. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of chromatin remodeling factors in the differentiation of specific cell types including muscle, neurons, and T cells (41de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 42Machida Y. Murai K. Miyake K. Iijima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 43Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is well known that certain transcription factors or cofactors interact with HATs or HDACs to regulate their target gene expression, there are few reports that the overall level of histone modifications or expression of histone-modifying enzymes such as HDACs is changed during bona fide differentiation. Furthermore, little is known about the regulatory role of chromatin remodeling such as histone modifications in adipocyte differentiation. In the present study, we sought to identify the regulatory function of histone modifications in adipocyte differentiation. ChIP assays revealed that histones are dynamically modified at the promoter regions of adipocyte marker genes indicating its involvement in adipogenesis. More importantly, we discovered that the protein level of class I and class II HDACs significantly decreased upon differentiation (Fig. 2, A and B). Indeed, the endogenous HDAC enzyme activity measured in adipocytes was shown to be only half that of preadipocytes (Fig. 3B). Inversely, total HAT activity of adipocytes was slightly elevated upon differentiation (data not shown). Therefore, it seems that histone hyperacetylation in adipocytes, as a result of decreased HDAC activity and increased HAT activity, leads to enhanced adipogenic gene expression. This increase of histone acetylation is most likely preferentially targeted to adipogenic genes by tissue-specific transcription factors and cofactors. This idea is strongly supported by the fact that PPARÎ³, a master adipogenic transcription factor, interacts with several coactivators such as p300, CBP, TRAP, p160, and PGC1Î± and corepressors like HDAC3 to selectively regulate the expression of its target genes during adipogenesis (44Puigserver P.

Cell. 2002; 3: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Because these cofactors are able to interact with specific transcription factors in a highly specific manner, decondensation of chromatin is tightly controlled so that it only takes place in a subset of genes in the appropriate tissues and at the appropriate times. Stimulation of adipogenesis and adipogenic gene expression by NaB suggests that the down-regulation of histone deacetylases might be one of the rate-limiting steps during adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, cells treated with NaB for the first 2 or 3 days, but not at later stages of differentiation, showed a remarkable stimulation of adipogenesis (Fig. 3C). These results implicate that a critical determination step for adipogenesis occurs through histone modification at an early phase of the differentiation process. This crucial event is probably associated with tissue- or developmentally specific transcription factors and/or cofactors responsible for triggering tissue-specific gene expression with down-regulation of HDAC activity. Similar results have been obtained with Swiss 3T3 cells (49Toscani A. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5722-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was also observed in C3H 10T1/2 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). These cell lines are less determined to the adipogenic lineage, suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to a specific cell line. A remarkable drop in the expression of HDAC1 suggested that this specific isoform may play a major role in adipogenesis. This idea was supported by the observation that the amounts of HDAC1 localized to the promoters of adipogenic genes were clearly decreased after differentiation (Fig. 5A). Gain-of-function and loss-of function studies in 3T3-L1 cells also confirmed the critical role of HDAC1 in adipogenesis. While we were preparing this article, Wiper-Bergeron et al. (50Wiper-Bergeron N. Wu D. Pope L. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HDAC1, which forms a complex with mSin3A and C/EBPÎ², is able to attenuate differentiation by repressing C/EBPÎ± expression. In another recent report, Fajas et al. (48Fajas L. Egler V. Reiter R. Hansen J. Kristiansen K. Debril M.B. Miard S. Auwerx J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HDAC3 can suppress PPARÎ³ by forming a PPARÎ³Â·RbÂ·HD3 complex. It is also known that HD3 is a component of a corepressor complex with NCoR/SMRT that represses PPARÎ³. Interestingly, HDAC1 interacted with PPARÎ³ and repressed its transcriptional activity (Fig. 7). Even though many HDACs are known to bind to transcription factors as part of a corepressor complex, results from GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays suggest that HDAC1 may bind directly to PPARÎ³. In addition, it should be noted that PPARÎ³ and HDAC1 display reciprocal expression patterns during adipogenesis (Fig. 2A). Thus, it appears that activation of PPARÎ³ might be regulated by two steps during adipocyte differentiation. First, PPARÎ³ activity is stimulated by increases in protein levels and its endogenous ligands. Second, the down-regulation of HDAC1 would further promote PPARÎ³ activity by relieving it from repression. Therefore, in addition to the previously described role as a modulator of C/EBPÎ², HDAC1 would also regulate adipocyte differentiation by controlling PPARÎ³. In addition to these findings, which suggest that HDACs interact with several adipogenic transcription factors to modulate their activities, our results implicate the importance of the regulation of HDAC expression during adipocyte differentiation. Although the exact mechanism by which adipogenic stimuli decrease the level of HDACs is yet to be determined, it appears that the lowering of HDAC expression results in decondensation of the chromatin structure around the promoter regions of adipogenic genes, thereby facilitating the binding of transcription factors to their binding sites (supplemental Fig. S3). Our group has also discovered that a very similar phenomenon occurs during osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that the modulation of HDAC expression and activity may be a general means of regulating cell differentiation. 5H. W. Lee, J. H. Suh, Y. S. Lee, S. Y. Park, and J. B. Kim, manuscript in preparation. The fact that NaB accelerated the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells into both adipocytes (supplemental Fig. S1) and osteoblasts 5H. W. Lee, J. H. Suh, Y. S. Lee, S. Y. Park, and J. B. Kim, manuscript in preparation. depending on the differentiation condition implies that the down-regulation of HDACs is a prerequisite process to convert the cells into a state susceptible to induction of differentiation. However, it does not seem that the down-regulation of HDAC1 specifies the cell-type into which the precursor cells will differentiate. Instead, this event seems be a part of a transition of the undifferentiated cells into a state in which cell type-specific transcription factors can bind to the chromatin and activate the expression of cell type-specific marker genes. Further studies will reveal whether this event is common during the differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells. The effects of HDAC inhibitors appear to be selective since the expression of only 2â¼5% of mammalian genes is affected when HDAC activity is inhibited (51Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar, 52Mariadason J.M. Corner G.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4561-4572PubMed Google Scholar). As an HDAC inhibitor, NaB has many effects on cultured mammalian cells including inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation and gene expression. For example, HDAC inhibition with NaB has been shown to inhibit the development of colon cancer by altering gene expression and arresting cell division or to induce apoptosis in human leukemic lymphoblasts (53Rahmani M. Yu C. Dai Y. Reese E. Ahmed W. Dent P. Grant S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8420-8427PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDAC inhibitors induce the expression of cell cycle kinase inhibitor p21, causing growth arrest in transformed cells (54Richon V.M. Webb Y. Merger R. Sheppard T. Jursic B. Ngo L. Civoli F. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5705-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 55Vrana J.A. Decker R.H. Johnson C.R. Wang Z. Jarvis W.D. Richon V.M. Ehinger M. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7016-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that expression of p21 is induced by HDAC inhibitors since p21 is induced at a very early stage of adipocyte differentiation to modulate clonal expansion (56Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest via p21 expression during adipogenesis remain to be elucidated, it might shed light in understanding how histone acetylation and deacetylation are possibly linked to adipocyte differentiation. In summary, our results show that the down-regulation of HDAC expression and the resulting increase of histone acetylation are important for adipogenesis. The substantial decrease in HDAC activity results in preferential histone hyperacetylation at the promoter regions of adipocyte marker genes. It is therefore likely that regulation of HDAC expression would be an essential process in adipocyte differentiation and that preadipocytes could initiate the differentiation process only when cellular level of HDACs falls below a certain threshold level and also that HDACs are involved in maintaining the preadipocyte phenotype. This is a novel viewpoint concerning the regulation of adipogenesis since previous studies have mainly focused on adipogenic transcription factors, such as PPARÎ³ and C/EBPÎ± and their ability to recruit coregulators to adipogenic gene promoters. Our findings could also provide a novel means of treating obesity-related diseases. Further studies will reveal whether this is a general mechanism controlling the differentiation of diverse cell types. We thank Dr. W-M. Yang for providing the pcDNA-HDAC1-FLAG vector.

However, the lactonase mechanism of mammalian PON1, a high density lipoprotein-associated enzyme that is the most studied family member, remains unclear, and other family members have not been examined at all. We present a kinetic and site-directed mutagenesis study aimed at deciphering the lactonase mechanism of PON1 and PON3. The pH-rate profile determined for the lactonase activity of PON1 indicated an apparent pKa of â¼7.4. We thus explored the role of all amino acids in the PON1 active site that are not directly ligated to the catalytic calcium and that possess an imidazolyl or carboxyl side chain (His115, His134, His184, His285, Asp183, and Asp269). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies in which each amino acid candidate was replaced with all other 19 amino acids were conducted to identify the residue(s) that mediate the lactonase activity of PONs. The results indicate that the lactonase activity of PON1 and PON3 and the esterase activity of PON1 are mediated by the His115-His134 dyad. Notably, the phosphotriesterase activity of PON1, which is a promiscuous activity of this enzyme, is mediated by other residues. To our knowledge, this is one of few examples of a histidine dyad in enzyme active sites and the first example of a hydrolytic enzyme with such a dyad.

PON1 is the best studied member of the family, with other members being PON2 and PON3 (1Draganov D.I. La Du B.N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

PON1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of multiple substrates: lactones, thiolactones, carbonates, esters, and phosphotriesters, including paraoxon, from which its name is derived. However, only after a few decades of research, it became apparent that PON1 and the other PONs are in fact lactonases (3Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Khersonsky O. Gould S.M. Roodveldt C. Tawfik D.S. Nat.

Genet. 2005; 37: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) indicate that the native activity of PON1 is lactonase. The other activities, e.g. arylesterase and phosphotriesterase (paraoxonase), are merely promiscuous and are not shared by other family members, e.g. PON2 and PON3. PON1 activation by binding to high density lipoprotein particles carrying apoA-I also indicates high specificity toward lactone substrates and, in particular, lipophilic lactones that display kcat/Km values of 106-107 m-1 s-1 (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The physiological substrates of PONs are still unknown, but they are likely to include lactones consumed as food ingredients (8Adams T.B. Greer D.B. Doull J. Munro I.C. Newberne P. Portoghese P.S. Smith R.L. Wagner B.M. Weil C.S. Woods L.A. Ford R.A. Food Chem.

The enzyme has two calcium-binding sites: the higher affinity calcium is required for the structural integrity, whereas the lower affinity calcium is involved in catalysis (9Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 653-660PubMed Google Scholar). Early mechanistic studies using chemical labeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified several residues that are involved in the phosphotriesterase and esterase activities of human PON1 (10Josse D. Xie W. Renault F. Rochu D. Schopfer L.M. Masson P. Lockridge O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2816-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Josse D. Lockridge O. Xie W. Bartels C.F. Schopfer L.M. Masson P. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2001; 21: S7-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, because these studies were conducted before the three-dimensional structure of PON1 was known, it was largely unclear whether these amino acids are indeed in the PON1 active site or whether they are involved in substrate binding, Ca2+ binding, or catalysis. Recently, a crystal structure of a recombinant PON1 (rePON1) variant (G2E6) was solved at a resolution of 2.2AÌ, providing the first structure of a PON family member (12Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This variant was directly evolved from rabbit PON1. It is expressed in a soluble and active form in Escherichia coli and exhibits enzymatic properties that are essentially identical to those reported for PON1 purified from sera. PON1 was found to be a six-bladed Î²-propeller, with the two calcium ions located in the central tunnel. The structural calcium (Ca2) is buried, whereas the catalytic calcium (Ca1) is solvent-exposed and located at the bottom of a deep hydrophobic active site. The active-site residues of PON1 were also defined by amino acids whose alteration during directed evolution shifted the activity and substrate selectivity of PON1. The structure of PON1 allowed us to postulate its mechanism of catalysis (12Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). On the basis of pH-rate profiles constructed for paraoxon and 2-naphthyl acetate hydrolysis, an unprotonated histidine was supposed to be involved in the base-catalyzed rate-determining step of catalysis by PON1. A histidine dyad composed of His115 and His134 was suggested to be directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of PON1 for both ester and phosphotriester hydrolysis. Mutagenesis experiments supported the suggested mechanism, although it was later found that these mutants were probably misfolded and therefore inactive (13Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1253Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, Yeung et al. (14Yeung D.T. Josse D. Nicholson J.D. Khanal A. McAndrew C.W. Bahnson B.J. Lenz D.E. Cerasoli D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1702: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) recently reported that the H115W mutant of human PON1 retains activity with paraoxon. They therefore postulated that His115 is important for substrate binding and specificity, but does not directly participate in catalysis (15Yeung D.T. Lenz D.E. Cerasoli D.M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most important, all previous mechanistic studies of PON1 addressed the phosphotriesterase and esterase activities, but the mechanism of lactone hydrolysis, which now appears to be the primary function of PON1, was not explored. The mechanism of other mammalian PON family members, most notably PON3, which exhibits weak esterase activity and almost no paraoxonase activity, has not been studied either. This study aimed to decipher the lactonase mechanism of PON1 and PON3. We determined the pH-rate profile for lactone hydrolysis and conducted extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies to identify the residues that mediate this activity. We show that the lactonase and esterase activities of PON1 are mediated by the His115-His134 dyad and rule out other active-site residues, including His285. Finally, the accompanying article (16Rosenblat M. Gaidukov L. Khersonsky O. Vaya J. Oren R. Tawfik D.S. Aviram M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7657-7665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) shows that the PON1 mutants with reduced lactonase activity studied here (H115Q, H134Q, and the double mutant H115Q/H134Q) exhibit reduced or no biological function in ex vivo assay. We also show that the paraoxonase activity is promiscuous in terms of substrate binding, but is also mediated by residues other than those that mediate the native activity.

Site-directed MutagenesisâThe pET32b(+) plasmid containing the gene for rePON1-G2E6 (12Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L.

The mutants were constructed by the âinverse PCRâ method using two neighboring non-overlapping primers, one of which bears the mutation at its 5â²-end (17Ling M.M. Robinson B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Pfu Turbo polymerase was applied for 25 cycles of polymerization at 72 Â°C. After digestion of the template plasmid with DpnI, the amplified DNA was blunt-ligated with T4 ligase, and the ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli DH5Î± cells. The mutated genes were verified by DNA sequencing. The histidine replacement libraries were generated by replacing His codons with DNS codons (where D is an equimolar mixture of A, G, and T; N is a mixture of all four nucleotides; and S is a mixture of C and G) encoding all amino acids except His, Gln, and Pro. The Gln replacement libraries were generated separately by replacing the His codon with a Gln codon (CAG). The aspartate replacement libraries were produced by introducing a combination of NNR and HNS degeneracy codons (where R is an equimolar mixture of A and G, and H is an equimolar mixture of A, C, and T) encoding all amino acids except Asp.

The purity of wild-type rePON1 and its mutants was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were essentially pure (>90%). The expression levels of wild-type rePON1 and the purified mutants were 20-50 mg/liter of culture. pH-rate Profileâkcat and Km values were determined for rePON1-G2E6 with TBBL (18Khersonsky O. Tawfik D. ChemBioChem. 2005; 7: 49-53Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) at pH 5.8-9.4. Initial velocities (v0) were determined at eight different concentrations for each substrate. The buffers used were MES (pH 5.8-6.5) and bis-tris propane (pH 6.5-9.4) at 0.1 m plus 1 mm CaCl2. The ionic strength was adjusted to a total of 0.2 m with NaCl. The enzyme stocks were kept in 50 mm Tris containing 0.1% Tergitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. TBBL (18Khersonsky O. Tawfik D. ChemBioChem. 2005; 7: 49-53Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was used from a 0.2 m stock in acetonitrile, and the co-solvent percentage was equalized to 1% in all reaction mixtures. Product formation was monitored spectro-photometrically in 200-Î¼l reaction volumes using 96-well plates by coupling to 5,5â²-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) as described (18Khersonsky O. Tawfik D. ChemBioChem. 2005; 7: 49-53Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For assays at pH â¤7.0 (below the pKa of 5,5â²-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)), 100-Î¼l aliquots taken from 1-ml reactions were transferred at 20-s intervals into 100 Î¼l of buffer containing 5,5â²-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and the PON1 inhibitor 2-hydroxyquinoline (2 mm) to quench the enzymatic reaction. The product concentration was subsequently determined by absorbance at 412 nm. Initial velocities were determined by plotting these end point measurements against time (five or more points) and extrapolating a slope for the linear phase. The reported results are the average of at least three independent measurements. Kinetic Measurements with rePON1 MutantsâThe kinetic measurements were performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mm CaCl2, and aliphatic lactone hydrolysis was monitored as described previously (6Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A range of enzyme concentrations was used depending on the reactivity of the substrate and the mutant. The activities of the mutants and wild type-like rePON1-G2E6 were examined with substrates of PON1 of three subgroups: phosphotriesters (paraoxon, 0.85 mm; and 7-diethylphosphoro-3-cyanocoumarin (DEP-coumarin, 47.5 Î¼m), esters (phenyl acetate, 1 mm; and 2-naphthyl acetate, 0.2 mm), and lactones (dihydrocoumarin, 0.25 mm; Î´-valerolactone, 1 mm; and Î³-nonalactone, 1 mm). The substrate concentrations were varied according to the solubility, reactivity, and extinction coefficients of each substrate. The reported results are the average of at least two independent measurements. For kinetic parameters determinations, the substrate concentrations were varied in the range of 0.3 Ã Km up to 2-3 Ã Km, except for those cases in which substrate solubility was limiting (phenyl acetate in the case of all mutants, Î´-valerolactone in the case of H115Q and the double mutant, and Î³-caprolactone in the case of H115Q and H134Q). The percentage of co-solvent (MeOH in case of phenyl acetate and paraoxon, Me2SO in case of lactones, and acetonitrile in the case of TBBL) was equalized to 1-1.6% in all reactions. Data AnalysisâKinetic parameters (kcat, Km, and kcat/Km) were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (v0 = kcat[E]0[S]0/([S]0 + Km)) using the program KaleidaGraph 5.0. In cases in which solubility limited the initial substrate concentrations, the data were fitted to the linear regime of the Michaelis-Menten model (v0 = [S]0[E]0kcat/Km), and kcat/Km was deduced from the slope. All data presented are the means Â± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. The pH-rate data (kcat ((kcat)H) and kcat/Km ((kcat/Km)H) values for each pH value) were fitted to a âbell-shapedâ model using the equations (kcat)H = (kcat)max/((10-pH/10-pKa1) + (10-pKa2/10-pH) + 1) and (k/Km)H = (kcat/Km)max/((10-pH/10-pKa1) + (10-pKa2/10-pH) + 1), where (kcat)max and (kcat/Km)max are the plateau values of kcat and kcat/Km, respectively, and pKa1 and pKa2 are the apparent pKa values for the acidic and basic groups, respectively. Rabbit PON3âWild-type rabbit PON3 and its mutants were cloned, expressed, and purified analogously to rePON1 variants, except that the elution buffer did not contain glycerol. The expression of PON3 variants was comparatively low (â¼2 mg/liter of culture) and was entirely dependent on the fusion protein thioredoxin (19Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Yagur S. Toker L. Silman I. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although SDS-PAGE indicated that the resulting protein was only 30% pure, the kinetic analysis was performed without any further purification because no contaminating lactonase activity was observed. The ratios between the activities of PON1 and PON3 with several aliphatic lactones were similar to those reported by Draganov et al. (4Draganov D.I. Teiber J.F. Speelman A. Osawa Y. Sunahara R. La Du B.N. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1239-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and Billecke et al. (20Billecke S. Draganov D. Counsell R. Stetson P. Watson C. Hsu C. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 1335-1342PubMed Google Scholar). However, the esterase activities of rabbit PON3 with phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate were found to be much lower than reported previously (4Draganov D.I. Teiber J.F. Speelman A. Osawa Y. Sunahara R. La Du B.N. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1239-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The activities of PON3 and its mutants were determined with 5-(thioethyl)butyrolactone (TEBL, 0.22 mm), TBBL (0.27 mm), Î´-valerolactone (1 mm), Î³-nonalactone (1 mm), and Î³-undecanoic lactone (0.5 mm). The hydrolysis of aliphatic lactones is usually measured by the pH indicator assay (5Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 7Teiber J.F. Draganov D.I. La Du B.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which does not allow wide variations of pH. Thus, the pH-rate profile of rePON1 was determined with TBBL (18Khersonsky O. Tawfik D. ChemBioChem. 2005; 7: 49-53Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a lactone substrate that is analogous to Î³-nonanoic lactone, yet releases, upon hydrolysis of the Î³-butyrolactone ring, a thiol moiety that can be detected with Ellman's reagent (5,5â²-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)). An overlay of the pH-rate profile of TBBL with the previously published pH-rate profiles of an ester (2-naphthyl acetate) and a phosphotriester (paraoxon) (12Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Overall, the pH-rate profiles of all three substrates are similar, with a fully pronounced acidic shoulder and a minor basic shoulder that is most apparent in the case of 2-naphthyl acetate. With the exception of TBBL, for which Km values obtained at pH <6.5 were higher than those obtained at pH >6.5, the Km values did not vary much with pH, as indicated by the similarity of the pH-rate profiles obtained for kcat and kcat/Km. The difference between the pKa values obtained for kcat versus kcat/Km can be explained by the fact that the kcat/Km data provide the pKa of the free enzyme, whereas the kcat data provide the pKa of the enzyme-substrate complex. The small differences between the pKa values obtained with same substrate for kcat versus kcat/Km may therefore reflect a change in the active-site environment upon formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Notably, the pKa1 derived from kcat/Km is essentially identical for all substrates, thus reflecting the same free enzyme form. The larger differences observed with the pKa2 derived from kcat/Km, especially for paraoxon, may indicate that this substrate might be binding a different conformer of PON1. It should also be noted that pKa2 values were largely extrapolated from the data obtained around or even below pKa2; thus, the accuracy of pKa2 values is inevitably low. As in the case of 2-naphthyl acetate and paraoxon (12Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), the major acidic shoulder (pKa1) of the lactone substrate may be ascribed to a group that directly participates in catalysis and is active in its basic deprotonated form. The observed pKa values (6.3-7.4) are most consistent with the imidazole group of histidine, the pKa of which in aqueous solution is â¼6.8 (21Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd. Wiley-VCH, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). However, because the pKa values of side chains in proteins and particularly in active sites can vary greatly from their values in solution, other residues could not be excluded on the basis of the pH-rate profiles. The observed pKa can also correspond to an aspartic or glutamic acid side chain, the pKa of which is generally â¼4, but can be raised in enzyme active sites up to and possibly beyond 6.5 (21Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd. Wiley-VCH, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). The differences in the acidic pKa values of the different substrates, specifically those obtained with kcat, may reflect variations in the catalytic mechanism. Most notable is the difference between the pKa1 of paraoxon (6.3) and that of TBBL (7.4). Indeed, as shown below, the hydrolysis of paraoxon is not mediated by the same active-site residues that mediate the lactonase activity. The minor basic shoulder (pKa2) probably reflects a deprotonation of a basic side chain that affects the active site, but is not directly involved in catalysis. Among other possibilities, this basic pKa might reflect a general deprotonation of lysine side chains (e.g. Lys192) that causes a mild deactivation of the enzyme. Although at this stage we cannot completely rule out a nucleophilic mechanism, we have not observed any kinetic indications for the existence of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, not even in substrates with very good leaving groups (6Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, we assume the simplest mechanism in which an active-site general base deprotonates a water molecule to generate a hydroxide ion that attacks the phosphoryl/carbonyl of the various substrates. The active site of PON1 (Fig. 2) contains not one but several reasonable candidates for the role of a general base, including four histidines (His115, His134, His285, and His184), two aspartates (Asp183 and Asp269), and one glutamic acid (Glu53). All these residues are conserved in all mammalian PONs. Asp269 and Glu53 participate in the ligation of catalytic Ca2+; and although they are not likely to act as a general base (let alone as a nucleophile), their titration could, in principle, disrupt the active site and give rise to pKa1. Thus, a mechanism in which Asp269 or Glu53 is involved in both Ca2+ ligation and water deprotonation cannot be totally ruled out at this stage. His115, being only â¼4 AÌ from the catalytic calcium, is the most obvious candidate for the general base role. As proposed previously (12Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), it can form a His-His dyad with His134, in which His115 is activated by His134 via a proton shuttle mechanism. His134 itself is far less likely to act directly as a general base because of its distance from the catalytic calcium (8.7 AÌ). His285 is also not far from the catalytic calcium (â¼7 AÌ) and was indeed suggested to be involved in catalysis (14Yeung D.T. Josse D. Nicholson J.D. Khanal A. McAndrew C.W. Bahnson B.J. Lenz D.E. Cerasoli D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1702: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another possible candidate for the general base role is His184, although its distance from the catalytic calcium is quite long (â¼11 AÌ). Asp183, which neighbors His184, could either act itself as a general base or form a dyad with His184, in which His184 acts as a general base and Asp183 as a proton shuttle. Similar arrangements are observed in other calcium-dependent hydrolases such as secreted phospholipase A2 and diisopropyl-fluorophosphatase (22Scharff E.I. Koepke J. Fritzsch G. Lucke C. Ruterjans H. Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Sekar K. Yu B.Z. Rogers J. Lutton J. Liu X. Chen X. Tsai M.D. Jain M.K. Sundaralingam M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Given this variety of putative catalytic residues, we applied site-directed mutagenesis to identify those side chains that mediate the lactonase activity of mammalian PONs and possibly the other promiscuous activities of PON1. Although an extremely powerful tool, site-directed mutagenesis has its own limitations (24Peracchi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 497-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Plapp B.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis in the context of mechanistic studies generally involves substitutions of side chains with side chains that are similar in terms of size and polarity but that are unable to perform the same catalytic function, thu"

The concept of hemoglobin as solely a carrier protein of O2 and CO2 in erythroid cells has undergone revision in recent years. Heme-binding proteins with the globin structural motif are found throughout the natural world, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vertebrate hemoglobin itself has been clearly shown to not only scavenge NO and its metabolic derivatives, but also to transport and generate NO, releasing the gas in tissues to dilate blood vessels (3Cosby K.

In fact, an emerging concept on the primordial function of hemoglobin-like proteins is that they protect cells against oxidative and nitrosative stress (5Crawford M.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12543-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Gross S.S. Lane P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9967-9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite this widespread distribution of hemoglobin-like proteins (including myoglobin, neuroglobin, and cytoglobin), it has long been thought that hemoglobin itself is expressed only in cells of erythroid lineage in adult vertebrates. This notion may also be revised in the coming years, as the expression of non-erythroid hemoglobins has now been reported in activated macrophages from adult mice and cells of the lens (7Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6643-6647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Wride M.A. Mansergh F.C. Adams S. Everitt R. Minnema S.E. Rancourt D.E.

Here we demonstrate that some types of respiratory epithelial cells of human, rat, or mouse origin, including alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells (also called type II pneumocytes) and Clara cells, also express hemoglobin. In vivo, these cells are the primary producers of pulmonary surfactant, essential for normal lung function as well as innate immunity (9Mallory Jr., G.B. Pediatr. Respir. Rev. 2001; 2: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wright J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1453-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Poynter S.E. LeVine A.M. Crit. Care Clin. 2003; 19: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also, ATII are stem cells that undergo significant phenotypic changes to terminally differentiate into alveolar type I (ATI) cells, which comprise much of the surface area of the alveolar epithelium and function in gas exchange (12Bishop A.E.

Interestingly, although the exact details have yet to be elucidated, there is recent evidence that both ATI and ATII cells can be derived from hematopoietic stem cells, an intriguing discovery that may corroborate with our observation concerning hemoglobin expression (12Bishop A.E.

The hemoglobin genes found in mammals arose by duplication before mammalian divergence and are similarly arranged in both primates and rodents (16Hardison R.

Î± and Î² genetic loci are found on separate chromosomes and each includes numerous genes that are active at various stages of development. In erythroid cells, the expression of these genes is tightly coordinated to produce functional hemoglobin heterotetramers consisting of two Î±-globin-like and two Î²-globin-like chains. The genes of the Î± globin cluster in human (with rodent orthologs) include: Î± HBA-1 and -2 (Hba-1 and -2), Î¶ HBZ (Hba-x), and Î¸ HBQ (Hbq). The Î²-globin cluster includes: Î² HBB (Hbb-b1 and b2 major/minor), Î´ HBD (rodent pseudogene), Î³ HBG-1 and -2 (Hbb-bh1/z), and â HBE (Hbb-y). Each locus also includes several pseudogenes (17Hardison R.C. Chui D.H. Riemer C. Giardine B. Lehvaslaiho H. Wajcman H. Miller W. Hemoglobin. 2001; 25: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Adult hemoglobin protein found in erythrocytes primarily consists of HbA, an Î±2Î²2 tetramer with four bound heme prosthetic groups. Here we demonstrate that adult forms of hemoglobin mRNAs and polypeptides are indeed expressed by human and rodent pulmonary epithelial cells. Our novel finding may have enormous implications in the physiology and pathology of the lung because of the many defined roles inherent to the structures of the hemoglobin molecule and its derived peptides, including gas exchange, NO metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and protection against oxidative and nitrosative stress.

PCR and Quantitative PCRâRNA was purified from all cell types using a QuickPrep Total RNA kit, and cDNA was generated from 3 Î¼g of purified total RNA and an oligo(dT) primer using a First Strand Synthesis kit (both kits from Amersham Biosciences). Conventional RT-PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) for 35 cycles (60 Â°C annealing temperature). Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4-12% polyacrylamide Tris borate-EDTA buffer gels (Novex, Invitrogen) followed by ethidium bromide staining. Results of experiments were verified by repetition of RT-PCR with RNA extracted from different aliquots of cells (at least three independent reactions performed per template/primer combination). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and data analyses were performed using the MyiQ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) (50 cycles, 62 Â°C annealing/extension). Sequence-specific internal probes dual-labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein/carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TaqMan probes) were employed to measure fluorescence because of accumulating amplicons (Table 1). For relative quantification in qPCR, a mathematical model was used that incorporated the effects of the efficiency of amplification for each primer pair over a 104 range of template dilutions (26Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25597) Google Scholar). qPCR were run in triplicate for each sample, and three independent experiments were performed. The results were expressed as mean Â± S.D. To verify the synthesis of predicted amplicons, qPCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels followed by ethidium bromide staining.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers and probes used for PCR in these studiesPrimer pair or probeOligonucleotide sequenceaF, forward/sense; or R, reverse/antisense primers.GenBankâ¢HBA, humanF: 5â²-ATGTTCCTGTCCTTCCCCACCACCAAG-3â²BC050661R: 5â²-GCTTAACGGTATTTGGAGGTCAGCACG-3â²HBB, humanF: 5â²-GTGAACGTGGATGAAGTTGGTGGTGAG-3â²NM_000518R: 5â²-TTGGACAGCAAGAAAGCGAGCTTAGTG-3â²HBQ, humanF: 5â²-TACACGACAGAGGCCCTGGAAAGGACC-3â²BC056686R: 5â²-AGTTCAGCGGTACTCGGAAACCAGCGC-3â²HBA, mouse/ratF: 5â²-CTCTCTGGGGAAGACAAAAGCAAC-3â²BC043020R: 5â²-GGTGGCTAGCCAAGGTCACCAGCA-3â²HBB, mouseF: 5â²-CACAACCCCAGAAACAGACA-3â²NM_008220R: 5â²-CTGACAGATGCTCTCTTGGG-3â²HBB, ratF: 5â²-TGAACCCTGATGATGTTGGTGGCGAGG-3â²NM_033234R: 5â²-AAGACAAGAGCAGGAAAAGAGGTTTAG-3â²HBQ, mouse/ratF: 5â²-TACACGACCGAGGCCTTGGAGAGGAC-3â²XM_220266R: 5â²-AGTTCAGCGATCCTTGGAGACCAGTGC-3â²AE1, humanF: 5â²-TGGACCTGCTGCTGGTAGTAG-3â²NM_000342R: 5â²-ATCTGGATGCCCGTGAATAAG-3â²AE1, mouse/ratF: 5â²-TGGCTGCTGTCATCTTCATCTAC-3â²NM_011403R: 5â²-TTTGGGCTTCATCACAACAGG-3â²SPB, humanF: 5â²-GGACATCGTCCACATCCTTAACAAGATG-3â²BC032785R: 5â²-ATTGCTGCTCGGAGAGATCCTGTGTGTG-3â²SPB, mouse/ratF: 5â²-GTGCCAAGAGTGTGAGGATATTGTCCACCTCC-3â²NM_147779R: 5â²-GGACACAGCCACAGCCAGCACACCCTTG-3â²ARF, human/mouse/ratF: 5â²-GCCAGTGTCCTTCCACCTGTC-3â²M36340R: 5â²-GCCTCGTTCACACGCTCTCTG-3â²HBB, human qPCRF: 5â²-ACTCCTGAGGAGAAGTCTGCCGTTAC-3â²NM_000518R: 5â²-TTGTCACAGTGCAGCTCACTCAGTGTG-3â²HBA, mouse qPCRF: 5â²-ATGTTTGCTAGCTTCCCCACCACCAAG-3â²BC043020R: 5â²-GGTGGCTAGCCAAGGTCACCAGCA-3â²HBB, mouse qPCRF: 5â²-TGATGCTGAGAAGGCTGCTGTCTCTG-3â²NM_008220R: 5â²-GTGCCCTTGAGGCTGTCCAAGTGA-3â²ACTB, human qPCRF: 5â²-GGGAAATCGTGCGTGACATTAAG-3â²X00351R: 5â²-TGTGTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG-3â²ACTB, mouse qPCRF: 5â²-GGGAAATCGTGCGTGACATCAAAG-3â²NM_007393R: 5â²-TGTGTTGGCATAGAGGTCTTTAC-3â²HBA probe qPCR5â²-CAACTTCAAGCTCCTGAGCCACTGCCTGCTGGTG-3â²BC043020HBB probe qPCR5â²-CCCTGGGCAGGCTGCTGGTTGTCTACCCTTG-3â²NM_008220ACTB probe qPCR5â²-CCAGCCTTCCTTCTTGGGTATGGAATCCTGTGGCA-3â²NM_007393a F, forward/sense; or R, reverse/antisense primers. Open table in a new tab Oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for hemoglobin gene transcripts from the Î±- and Î²-globin clusters and are shown in Table 1. Some primer pairs were later redesigned for compatibility with qPCR analysis. All oligonucleotide primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). DNA SequencingâSelect PCR amplicons were gel purified and subjected to DNA sequencing by the Medical University of South Carolina Biotechnology Facility using the same primer pairs used for amplification. Resulting sequences were analyzed using the NCBI BLAST engine. Western BlottingâCells were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2% SDS. Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE gels, Invitrogen), blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal antibodies to Î±- or Î²-globin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or pan hemoglobin (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) according to the manufacturers instructions. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescence kit (both from Pierce Biotechnology) were used for visual detection with a FluorChem 8900 Imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Purified human hemoglobin tetramer (HbA, Sigma) and Î±-globin purified from bovine pulmonary surfactant (27Baatz J.E. Zou Y. Cox J.T. Wang Z. Notter R.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 23: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (identity confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing) were used as standards. Protein SequencingâWhole cell lysate from rat ATII primary cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE, silver-stained (28Acierno P.M. Newton D.A. Brown E.A. Maes L.A. Baatz J.E. Gattoni-Celli S. J. Transl. Med. 2003; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and excised gel slices in the 16-20-kDa range were submitted to the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Peptides were generated by trypsin digestion before tandem mass spectrometry sequencing. Hemoglobin mRNA Is Expressed by Pulmonary Epithelial CellsâConventional RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of genes from the Î±- and Î²-globin clusters in several human and rodent cell lines and primary cell cultures. Oligonucleotide primer pairs specific for various globin gene transcripts were meticulously designed to amplify individual sequences among the closely homologous globin genes while distinguishing between cDNA and genomic DNA amplicons and avoiding common allelic variations (Table 1). The expression of several globin genes was easily detectable by RT-PCR analyses of several types of pulmonary epithelial cells (Fig. 1). Specifically, PCR products corresponding to Î±-globin (HBA) and Î²-globin (HBB), the primary globin mRNAs expressed by erythroid precursor cells in adult mammals, were found in human cell lines A549 (ATII-like adenocarcinoma) and H441 (Clara cell-like adenocarcinoma), mouse cell line MLE-15 (transformed ATII cells), and ATII primary cells isolated from normal rat and mouse lungs (day 3 cultures). Interestingly, the human A549 and H441 cell lines also express the mRNA of Î¸-globin (HBQ), an Î± homolog that is the least-characterized globin gene (thought to be a pseudogene in rodents until recently) (29Hsu S.L. Marks J. Shaw J.P. Tam M. Higgs D.R. Shen C.C. Shen C.K. Nature. 1988; 331: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The usage of ATII primary cells from normal rat and mouse lungs, although difficult to maintain in culture, was important because it has been reported that transformation with herpes or Rous sarcoma viruses can activate Î±-globin transcription in some cell lines (30Cheung P. Panning B. Smiley J.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1784-1793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Groudine M. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4464-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and certain patterns of aberrant gene expression are hallmarks of most tumor cell lines. As controls for cell phenotype and purity (especially for the primary cultures), Fig. 1 also shows that these cells expressed genes characteristic of pulmonary epithelial cells (e.g. surfactant protein B), but not other erythroid-specific genes, such as erythrocyte anion exchanger (AE1, band 3 protein) (32Passow H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 103: 61-203PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to microscopic examination of ATII preparations, the absence of a PCR product generated by using primers specific for the AE1 gene transcript (very abundant in erythroid precursors) strongly suggests that globin gene expression in these ATII primary cultures was not the result of erythroid cell contamination. All tested cell lines expressed the ubiquitous housekeeping gene ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (33Bobak D.A. Nightingale M.S. Murtagh J.J. Price S.R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6101-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because of these findings, additional control reactions for RT-PCR analyses were also performed (Fig. 2). The human melanoma cell line FO-1 and mouse fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 did not express transcripts from globin genes, surfactant protein B, or AE1. Amplification of cDNA prepared from human blood and the mouse erythroid cell line MEL (induced to differentiate in cell culture) clearly demonstrated the presence of HBA, HBB, HBQ, and AE1 transcripts. The unlikely contamination of cell culture medium (including 10% FBS) with globin gene nucleic acid template was analyzed by adding to the PCR both complete medium and medium âcDNAâ (cDNA synthesis reaction was performed with undetectable product of RNA extraction of culture medium; no nucleic acid was actually detected spectrophotometrically). No PCR products were detected in cell culture medium (further confirmed by combining A549 template cDNA with the medium preparation to eliminate the possibility of false negatives because of PCR polymerase inhibition). All tested cells expressed ADP-ribosylation factor 1 transcript, demonstrating the integrity of the RNA preparations. Hemoglobin Gene Expression Was Verified by DNA SequencingâSelect PCR products, including those from mouse ATII primary cells, were subjected to DNA sequencing to verify that they were indeed the result of specific amplification of globin gene transcripts. The sequences obtained were compared with those in GenBank using the NCBI BLAST engine and shown to be essentially perfect matches with the corresponding globin mRNA (Table 2).TABLE 2DNA sequencing of RT-PCR productsSequenced PCR productGenBankâ¢ matchA549, HBA primersHomo sapiens hemoglobin, Î± 1 and 2 (HBA), mRNAaHuman HBA1 and HBA2 mRNAs share identical coding region sequences as flanked by these primers.

Open table in a new tab Along with the absence of RT-PCR products obtained with tissuespecific primers like surfactant protein B and AE1, the species specificity of these globin amplicons confirmed by DNA sequencing further eliminates the unlikely possibility of PCR cross-contamination (e.g. from mouse MEL cells or bovine serum in culture medium). In addition, because of the design of the oligonucleotide primers, every PCR product shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 2 would contain intron sequences if derived from amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. It is also worth noting that the results in Fig. 2 and Table 2 clearly demonstrate that the mouse erythroid cell line MEL expresses Î¸-globin, a poorly defined globin homolog, especially in rodents. Relative Levels of Globin Gene Expression Are Different Among Cell TypesâUsing real time qPCR, the relative levels of HBA and HBB gene expression were compared between mouse pulmonary epithelial cells and induced MEL erythroid cells (Table 3). For this analysis, quality control was performed by determining amplification efficiency for each primer pair and by normalizing globin expression to Î²-actin expression to correct for differences in starting cDNA template concentrations (26Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25597) Google Scholar). As expected, the erythroid cells clearly expressed much higher levels of both HBA and HBB mRNAs than did MLE-15 and ATII primary cells. In fact, HBA expression in MEL cells was slightly greater than Î²-actin expression, certainly making it one of the most abundant cellular mRNAs. Still, globin gene expression was easily detected in both mouse ATII cell types, and the amplification detection thresholds decreased in a dose-dependent manner over a 105-fold template dilution curve (data not shown). All three cells types expressed more HBA than HBB mRNA, with ratios of â¼9:1, 10:1, and 27:1 for MEL, primary ATII, and MLE-15 cells, respectively.TABLE 3Quantitative analysis of globin gene expressionRatiosNormalized globin mRNA expression-foldComparison of globin gene expression in different mouse cellsMEL HBA:ATII HBA35.8 Â± 4.4MEL HBA:MLE-15 HBA147 Â± 9.3MEL HBB:ATII HBB40 Â± 4.7MEL HBB:MLE-15 HBB440 Â± 16.3ATII HBA:MLE-15 HBA4.1 Â± 1.1ATII HBB:MLE-15 HBB11.0 Â± 2.2Relative expression of different globin genesMEL HBA:HBB9.0 Â± 2.8ATII HBA:HBB10.1 Â± 2.6MLE-15 HBA:HBB26.9 Â± 3.9 Open table in a new tab qPCR was also performed with human A549 and H441 cells, and although not precisely compared with mouse cells because of the necessity for making even greater assumptions for reference gene normalization and internal probe efficiency, it was clear that globin gene expression in these human cell lines was closer to that of the mouse pulmonary epithelial cells rather than erythroid cells. Again, amplification detection thresholds for globin genes in A549 and H441 decreased in a dose-dependent manner over a template dilution curve, and more HBA than HBB was expressed in each cell line (data not shown). Hemoglobin Protein Is Expressed by Pulmonary Epithelial CellsâImmunoblotting was performed to determine whether hemoglobin polypeptide subunits are expressed by lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3). Using polyclonal antibodies that demonstrated species cross-reactivity, Î±- and Î²-globin were detected in lysates from human A549 and H441 cells, mouse MLE-15 cells, and rat primary ATII cells (mouse primary ATII cells not available for testing). Interestingly, the hemoglobin from pulmonary epithelial cells migrated more slowly than that from erythroid sources, including that from MEL cells. This observation is yet to be explained, but is consistent with that seen in previously reported non-erythroid hemoglobin expression (7Liu L. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6643-6647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, much higher levels of globin subunits were detected in induced MEL cells compared with that in pulmonary epithelial cells (â¼25-fold less total MEL protein was loaded to obtain roughly comparable levels of detection). Most likely because of the extremely stable conformation of the hemoglobin molecule, multiple forms of the protein, including aggregates larger than the heterotetramer, were commonly detected by immunostaining even after detergent and heat denaturation. For example, the Î±-globin dimers shown in Fig. 3 were consistently the most abundant forms seen in SDS-PAGE analyses of A549 and H441 cell lysates (in fact, monomers were occasionally difficult to detect even with MEL lysates). Because of this variability, the use of purified hemoglobin tetramer for comparison in immunoblotting greatly assisted in the interpretation of the protein expression data. Although all cells were thoroughly washed before lysis, culture medium containing 10% FBS was also tested to eliminate the possibility of contamination with bovine hemoglobin. No immunostaining was detected with these antibodies, which clearly would recognize bovine Î±-globin as demonstrated with a purified standard. When the staining intensities of these antibodies were normalized (assuming the HbA heterotetramer standard contained equimolar amounts of Î±-"
https://openalex.org/W1975372386,"Epithelia are positioned at a critical interface to prevent invasion by microorganisms from the environment. Pattern recognition receptors are important components of innate immunity because of their ability to interact with specific microbe-associated structures and initiate immune responses. Several distinct groups of receptors have been recognized. One of these, the scavenger receptors, has been classified into at least eight separate classes. The class A scavenger receptors are characterized by the presence of a collagen-like domain and include macrophage scavenger receptor type A (SR-A1 I/II, SCARA1) and MARCO (SCARA2). These receptors are known to make important contributions to host defense. Here, we identify a novel murine scavenger receptor, SCARA5, which has a structure typical of this class. The cDNA encodes 491 amino acids, which predict a type II protein that contains C-terminal intracellular, transmembrane, extracellular spacer, collagenous, and N-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine rich domains. Expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells confirmed that the receptor assembles as a homotrimer and is expressed at the plasma membrane. SCARA5-transfected cells bound Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but not zymosan, in a polyanionic-inhibitable manner. Unlike other class A scavenger receptors, the receptor was unable to endocytose acetylated or oxidized low density lipoprotein. Quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization demonstrate SCARA5 has a tissue and cellular distribution unique among class A scavenger receptors. Because of the restriction of SCARA5 transcripts to populations of epithelial cells, we propose that this receptor may play important roles in the innate immune activities of these cells."

We set out to study the pharmacogenetics of human arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT, previously CYT19). After cloning the human AS3MT cDNA, we annotated the human gene and resequenced its 5â²-flanking region, exons, and splice junctions using 60 DNA samples from African-American (AA) and 60 samples from Caucasian-American (CA) subjects. We observed 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 3 non-synonymous cSNPs, as well as a variable number of tandem repeats in exon 1 within an area encoding the cDNA 5â²-untranslated region. The nonsynonymous cSNPs included T860C (M287T) with frequencies of 10.8 and 10% in AA and CA subjects, respectively, as well as C517T (A173W) in one AA and C917T (T306I) in one CA sample. Haplotype analysis showed that Ile306 was linked to Thr287, so this double variant allozyme was also studied functionally. After expression in COS-1 cells and correction for transfection efficiency, the Trp173 allozyme displayed 31%, Thr287 350%, Ile306 4.8%, and Thr287/Ile306 6.2% of the activity of the wild type (WT) allozyme, with 20, 190, 4.4, and 7.9% of the level of WT immunoreactive protein, respectively. Apparent Km values for S-adenosyl-l-methionine were 4.6, 3.1, and 11 Î¼m for WT, Trp173, and Thr287 allozymes, with Km values for sodium arsenite with the same allozymes of 11.8, 8.9, and 4.5Î¼m. The Ile306 and Thr287/Ile306 allozymes expressed too little activity for inclusion in the substrate kinetic studies. Expression of reporter gene constructs for the 5â²-flanking region and the variable number of tandem repeats in the 5â²-untranslated region demonstrated cell line-dependent variation in reporter gene expression, with shorter repeats associated with increased transcription in HepG2 cells. These results raise the possibility that inherited variation in AS3MT may contribute to variation in arsenic metabolism and, perhaps, arsenic-dependent carcinogenesis in humans.

An arsenic methyltransferase activity was recently described in the rat that catalyzes the methylation of arsenite, with S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphisms; VNTR, variable number of tandem repeats; UTR, untranslated region; CA, Caucasian-American; AA, African-American; WT, wild type; ORF, open reading frame; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; TPMT*3A, thiopurine S-methyltransferase *3A. as the methyl donor (20Lin S.

In rats, that activity is expressed in a variety of organs, and a similar activity is expressed in the human liver, kidney, and brain (21Zakharyan R.A. Ayala-Fierro F. Cullen W.R. Carter D.M. Aposhian H.V. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The cloning of a rat cDNA, encoded by a gene that was originally annotated as âCyt19,â and the subsequent demonstration that the encoded protein was an âarsenic methyltransferaseâ (20Lin S. Shi Q. Nix F.B. Styblo M. Beck M.A. Herbin-Davis K.M. Hall L.L. Simeonsson J.B. Thomas D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10795-10803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), opened the way for studies of the possible contribution of variation in this gene (subsequently annotated as As3mt) to individual differences in arsenic methylation. In the present study, we set out to characterize the human ortholog for the rat Cyt19-As3mt gene to make it possible to resequence the human gene using DNA from subjects of two different ethnic groups. During gene resequencing, we observed a series of genetic polymorphisms and haplotypes in the human AS3MT gene. Functional genomic studies of all variant allozymes encoded by AS3MT alleles that contained nonsynonymous cSNPs, as well as a VNTR located in the 5â²-UTR of the cDNA, were then performed. These experiments represent a step toward studies of individual variation in arsenic methylation, arsenic pharmacogenetics, and arsenic toxicogenetics in humans. DNA SamplesâDNA samples from 60 CA and 60 AA subjects, as well as a panel of 10 primate DNA samples (sample sets HD100CAU, HD100AA, and PRP00001), were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). The human DNA samples had been collected and anonymized by the NIGMS, National Institutes of Health. All subjects had provided written informed consent for the use of their DNA for research purposes, and the present studies were reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. cDNA CloningâThe human AS3MT cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification based on an assumption of homology between the sequences of the rat As3mt cDNA and its human ortholog, using human liver cDNA as template. 5â²- and 3â²-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed with Marathon-Ready human liver and prostate cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using nested PCR amplifications with AS3MT-specific primers paired with the AP1 and AP2 primers supplied by the manufacturer. The sequences of primers used to perform these and subsequent amplifications are listed in supplementary materials Table 1. Gene ResequencingâAnnotation of the human AS3MT gene (originally designated CYT19, GenBankÂ® accession number NT_008804.8) was performed using the human cDNA sequence obtained by performing cDNA cloning. The PCR was then used to amplify each of the 11 AS3MT exons. We also attempted to amplify one exon using the primate DNA samples obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository as template. Primers were designed to amplify each of the human gene exons, plus portions of the introns flanking that exon. The primers used for the gene resequencing studies included M13 tags at their 5â²-ends to make it possible to use dye primer sequencing chemistry (see supplementary materials Table 1). Dye primer sequencing was used to enhance our ability to identify heterozygous bases (22Chadwick R.B. Conrad M.P. McGinnis M.D. Johnston-Dow L. Spurgeon S.L. Kronick M.N. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 676-683PubMed Google Scholar). Amplicons from these reactions were sequenced in the Mayo Molecular Biology Sequencing Core Facility with an ABI 3700 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Big DyeÂ® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) dye primer chemistry. All samples were sequenced on both strands, and those with ambiguous chromatograms, as well as samples that contained SNPs that were observed in only a single sample, were subjected to a second, independent round of amplification, followed by DNA sequencing. Samples resulting from amplifications of the initial exon that contained the VNTR were also subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to determine VNTR length. Samples homozygous for the VNTR were sequenced directly, and selected heterozygous samples were subcloned into pCR2.1, followed by sequencing of each of the alleles present in that sample. Transient ExpressionâThe âwild typeâ (WT) open reading frame (ORF) of the human AS3MT cDNA was amplified, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create a synonymous cSNP that removed an EcoRI site. That ORF sequence was then cloned into pCR2.1 (Promega). The insert was excised with EcoRI and was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B), and âcircular PCRâ was used to perform site-directed mutagenesis to create constructs encoding variant allozymes (see supplementary materials Table 1 for sequences of these primers). Insert sequences after circular PCR were verified by sequencing the entire ORF. These expression constructs were then used to transfect COS-1 cells in serum-free Dulbeccos's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) using the TransFast reagent (Promega) at a charge ratio of 1:1, with a 1-h transfection time. âEmptyâ p91023(B), vector that did not contain insert, was used as a control to make it possible to correct for possible endogenous AS3MT in COS-1 cells. However, endogenous activity was found to be negligible, averaging less than 1% of the activity present after transfection with the WT construct. During transfection, 15 Î¼g of AS3MT construct DNA was cotransfected with 1 Î¼g of pSV-Î²-galactosidase DNA (Promega) to make it possible to correct for transfection efficiency. Six separate plates were transfected with each construct studied. The transfected COS-1 cells were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 2 ml of homogenization buffer. They were then lysed with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments), and the homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The resulting supernatant cytosol preparations were stored at -80 Â°C prior to assay. AS3MT Enzyme AssayâRecombinant allozymes were assayed for AS3MT activity using a modification of the method described by Zakharyan et al. (23Zakharyan R. Wu Y. Bogdan G.M. Aposhian H.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.10 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 4 mm glutathione, 1 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm sodium arsenite (the methyl acceptor substrate), [methyl-3H]AdoMet, the methyl donor, (11.8 Ci/mmol, 0.55 mCi/ml, 10 Î¼m final concentration), and recombinant enzyme were combined in a final volume of 250 Î¼l. Blanks were samples that contained no methyl acceptor substrate. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 Â°C for 60 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 750 Î¼lof12 m HCl. Methylated arsenic compounds were isolated using the organic solvent extraction procedure described by Zakharyan et al. (23Zakharyan R. Wu Y. Bogdan G.M. Aposhian H.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring Î²-galactosidase activity spectrophotometrically with the Î²-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay system (Promega). The same AS3MT activity assay was used to determine apparent Km values for the two cosubstrates for the reaction. Specifically, five concentrations of sodium arsenite that varied from 2.5 to 100 Î¼m were tested in the presence of 10 Î¼m [methyl-3H]AdoMet. Activity was also measured in the presence of 12.5 Î¼m sodium arsenite with five concentrations of AdoMet that varied from 1.25 to 20 Î¼m. Quantitative Western Blot AnalysesâLevels of immunoreactive AS3MT protein were determined for each recombinant allozyme by performing quantitative Western blot analysis. A rabbit polyclonal anti-body directed against AS3MT amino acids 341-360 was used to perform these studies. This peptide, linked to keyhole limpit hemocyanin, was used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cocalico, Reamstown, PA). The antibody had been tested for specificity by performing Western blot analyses with recombinant AS3MT as well as human liver, kidney, and prostate cytosol preparations. During the Western blot analyses, COS-1 cell cytosol was loaded on 12% SDS mini-gels (Bio-Rad) in quantities that resulted in equal Î²-galactosidase activity to correct for possible variation in transfection efficiency. Electrophoresis was then performed for 1 h at 150V,andthe proteins were transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST). The following day, the membranes were incubated for 0.5 h with primary antibody diluted 1:2000 with 5% milk in TBST, followed by three washes. The secondary antibody was a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) that was applied for 1 h in 5% milk in TBST, followed by three washes. Bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence performed with the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). The Western blot data were analyzed with the AMBIS radioanalytic Imaging System, Quant Probe version 4.31 (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). Multiple blots were performed for each allozyme, and immunoreactive protein levels were expressed as a percentage of the intensity of the band for the WT construct on the same gel. Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (RRL) Protein Synthesis and DegradationâTranscription and translation of WT AS3MT and allozymes encoded by the variant alleles (Trp173, Thr287, and Ile306) were performed using the TnTÂ® coupled RRL System (Promega) with constructs that had been cloned into pCR3.1 (Promega). Specifically, 25 Î¼l of âtreatedâ RRL, plus 2 Î¼l of T7 buffer, 1 Î¼l of T7 polymerase, 1 Î¼l of RNasin, and 2 Î¼l of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, 0.4 Î¼m final concentration) were used to perform these experiments. With the exception of the RNasin (Promega) and the [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), all reagents were included in the Promega kit. One Î¼g of the pCR3.1 expression construct DNA was added to the mixture, the reaction volume was increased to 50 Î¼l with nuclease-free water (Promega), and the mixture was incubated at 30 Â°C for 90 min. A 5-Î¼l aliquot was then used to perform electrophoresis with a 12% SDS-PAGE gel that was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). To perform the protein degradation experiments, 60 Î¼l of an ATP generating system, 60 Î¼l of âuntreatedâ RRL and 12 Î¼l of radioactively labeled protein were combined. The ATP generating system consisted of 100 Î¼l each of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 160 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm ATP, 200 mm creatine phosphate, and 2 mg/ml ATP kinase (all from Sigma), plus 300 Î¼l of nuclease-free water. This mixture was incubated at 37 or 40 Â°C. Aliquots were removed at various times and were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. A variant allozyme for a genetically polymorphic drug metabolizing enzyme that has been shown to be degraded rapidly by a proteasome-dependent process, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)*3A (24Wang L. Sullivan W. Toft D. Weinshilboum R. Pharmacogenetics. 2003; 13: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control for these experiments. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film, and levels of [35S]methionine radioactively labeled proteins were determined by using the AMBIS system. Reporter Gene ConstructsâFirefly luciferase reporter gene constructs in pGL3-Basic were created for the four different length AS3MT 5â²-flanking region and 5â²-UTR VNTR sequences. Inserts in these constructs were then sequenced, and the constructs were used to transfect HepG2 and HEK293 cells using the TransFast reagent at a charge ratio of 1:1, with a 1-h transfection time. During transfection, 2 Î¼g of construct DNA was cotransfected with 0.2 Î¼g of pRL-TK DNA to make it possible to correct for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Cell lysates were then used to measure firefly luciferase activity with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). Data AnalysisâThe DNA sequence from the resequencing studies was analyzed using the PolyPhred 4.0 (25Nickerson D.A. Tobe V.O. Taylor S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and Consed 8.0 (26Gordon D. Abajian C. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar) programs. The Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) package, version 10, was also used to analyze nucleotide sequence. Human SNP data bases, including dbSNP and the HapMap, build 18, were searched to determine whether the polymorphisms that we observed had been reported previously. The RepeatMasker (University of Washington) program was used to screen for repeat sequences. Values for Ï, Î¸, and D values were calculated as described by Tajima (27Tajima F. Genetics. 1989; 123: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Linkage disequilibrium was analyzed by calculating Dâ² values for all polymorphism pairs as described by Hartl and Clark (28Hartl D.L. Clark A.G. Principles of Population Genetics. Third. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2000: 95-107Google Scholar) and Hendrick (29Hendrick P.W. Genetics of Populations. 2nd. Jones and Bartlett, Sudbury, MA2000: 396-405Google Scholar), and those data were displayed graphically. Haplotype analysis was performed as described by Schaid et al. (30Schaid D.J. Rowland C.M. Tines D.E. Jacobson R.M. Poland G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 425-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Apparent Km values were calculated with the method of Wilkinson (31Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar) using a computer program developed by Cleland (32Cleland W.W. Nature. 1963; 198: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Differences between mean values were evaluated by use of the Student's t test calculated with the Statview 4.5 program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Human AS3MT ResequencingâThe human AS3MT cDNA sequence, as well as that of the encoded protein, are shown in Fig. 1. The cDNA had a 1125-bp ORF that encoded a 375-amino acid protein. The ORF nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences were 81 and 76% identical with those of rat As3mt, respectively. The human AS3MT gene mapped to chromosome 10q24, contained 11 exons, and was â¼32 kb in length (Fig. 2). The location of the human gene was syntenic with the rat ortholog that maps to rat chromosome 1q54, and with the location of the mouse ortholog on chromosome 19D1. It should be pointed out that the sequences of the cDNA and, as a result, the gene that we have shown in Figs. 1 and 2 differ from the current NCBI annotation for the cDNA (NM_020682.2), an annotation that is based on the application of exon prediction software to an early version of the human chromosome 10 sequence. Specifically, ORF nucleotide 1057 in our sequence is missing from the NCBI cDNA annotation, resulting in a frameshift and truncation of the protein within exon 10, with exon 11 converted entirely to 3â²-UTR. Furthermore, there are 4 variant nucleotides in exon 5 of the present NCBI cDNA annotation, one synonymous and three resulting in the following alterations in encoded amino acids: I132F, Y135N, and G140A (33Li J. Waters S.B. Drobna Z. Devesa V. Styblo M. Thomas D.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Those nucleotides were not polymorphic in any of our resequencing studies of 240 alleles, and the deletion at nucleotide 1057 was also not present in any of our 120 DNA samples. As a result, we concluded that the current NCBI annotation, which is labeled âprovisional,â is almost certainly in error at those locations. Of note is the fact that the current NCBI genomic sequence for AS3MT matches our WT sequence and that the encoded protein in SwissProt is that which we have shown in Fig. 1.FIGURE 2Human AS3MT polymorphisms. Shaded rectangles represent coding exons, and open rectangles represent portions of exons that encode the UTR sequence. Exon and introns lengths are also indicated. Arrows show the locations of polymorphisms, with polymorphism frequencies indicated by the colors of the arrows. Amino acids altered as a result of nonsynonymous cSNPs are also indicated. âVNTRâ refers to a variable number of tandem repeats located in the 5â²-UTR (see Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AS3MT was resequenced using DNA samples from 60 AA and 60 CA subjects. Eleven PCR amplifications were performed for each sample and, as a result, a total of over 1,300,000 bp of DNA sequence was analyzed on both strands. Those experiments resulted in the identification of 26 SNPs, 22 in DNA samples from AA and 21 in DNA from CA subjects. The locations of the polymorphisms that we observed are listed in Table 1 and are depicted graphically in Fig. 2. All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Three of the SNPs were nonsynonymous and altered encoded amino acids in the following codons: R173W, M287T, and T306I. The frequency of the polymorphism resulting in the M287T alteration in sequence was 10% or greater in both populations studied. This polymorphism was located in exon 9 of human AS3MT. Therefore, exon 9 was also amplified in the 10 primate DNA samples that we had obtained (rhesus monkey, pigtailed macaque, bonobo, gorilla, chimpanzee, Sumatian orangutan, red-chested mustached tamarin, black-handed spider monkey, common woolly monkey, and ring-tailed lemur). This codon encoded Thr in all 10 of these primate DNA samples, Ile in the rat, mouse, and dog orthologs, and Glu in the chicken gene. Twenty-one of the 26 human AS3MT SNPs had frequencies of greater than 1% in at least one of the two ethnic groups and, as a result, would be considered âcommonâ in these populations. An additional polymorphism involved a VNTR in exon 1 within an area encoding the 5â²-UTR. This VNTR consisted of repeat elements that were either 35 or 36 bp in length, differing only in the loss of the 3â²-terminal âa,â with 2 to 4 repeats in each allele (Fig. 3). The repeat consisted of 1 to 3 copies of the 36-bp âAâ sequence, plus one copy of the 35-bp âBâ sequence, with the B repeat at the 3â²-terminus of the VNTR (Fig. 3). Four repeat elements (three A and one B sequence) were observed only in AA subjects. Allele and genotype frequencies for the VNTR in both populations are listed in Table 2. When public data bases, including dbSNP, were searched, 7 of the AS3MT polymorphisms that we observed were already in data bases. The HapMap, build 18, included only 3 of the polymorphisms that we observed. Our AS3MT resequencing data have been deposited in the NIH data base PharmGKB, with accession number PA128747780.TABLE 1Human AS3MT polymorphisms Locations and frequencies of the 26 SNPs and one VNTR observed in the human AS3MT gene are listed. Nucleotide locations, except those in introns, have been numbered on the basis of the A in the translation initiation codon, with that nucleotide designated (+1), and with positive numbers 3â² and negative numbers 5â² to that location. Intron (IVS) nucleotides have been numbered relative to splice junctions, with the initial 5â² nucleotide in an intron designated (+1) and the final 3â² nucleotide designated (-1). Polymorphisms in exons have been âboxed.â The numbers at the right are those used to designate polymorphisms for the linkage disequilibrium analysis.

https://openalex.org/W1987207916,"Vinculin regulates both cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions and anchors adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton through its interactions with the vinculin binding sites of Î±-actinin or talin. Activation of vinculin requires a severing of the intramolecular interactions between its N- and C-terminal domains, which is necessary for vinculin to bind to F-actin; yet how this occurs in cells is not resolved. We tested the hypothesis that talin and Î±-actinin activate vinculin through their vinculin binding sites. Indeed, we show that these vinculin binding sites have a high affinity for full-length vinculin, are sufficient to sever the head-tail interactions of vinculin, and they induce conformational changes that allow vinculin to bind to F-actin. Finally, microinjection of these vinculin binding sites specifically targets vinculin in cells, disrupting its interactions with talin and Î±-actinin and disassembling focal adhesions. In their native (inactive) states the vinculin binding sites of talin and Î±-actinin are buried within helical bundles present in their central rod domains. Collectively, these results support a model where the engagement of adhesion receptors first activates talin or Î±-actinin, by provoking structural changes that allow their vinculin binding sites to swing out, which are then sufficient to bind to and activate vinculin.

Adhesion complexes form on the cell membrane when cells come in contact with each other or with components of the extracellular matrix and trigger elaborate signaling networks that direct dynamic and rapid rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (1Sastry S.K. Burridge K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2Jamora C. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Vinculin is a highly conserved and critical regulator of both cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, as it anchors these junctions to the actin cytoskeleton by binding to talin and Î±-actinin, which directly interact with integrin and/or cadherin transmembrane receptors in focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively (3Zamir E.

Overall, vinculin appears to stabilize these junctions, as vinculin overexpression augments the formation of adhesion complexes and prevents cell migration (5Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Geiger B. Salomon D. Ben-Ze'ev A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas vinculin loss leads to marked defects in adhesion with the extracellular matrix, cell spreading, and concomitant increases in the rates of (chaotic) cell migration (6Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L.

Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, vinculin appears to play an important role in cancer, where it functions as a tumor suppressor that inhibits cell invasion and metastasis (8Rudiger M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and in other pathophysiological scenarios, including wound healing, ischemia, and apoptosis (9Steenbergen C. Hill M.L.

This intramolecular interaction has also been suggested to mask cryptic binding sites for other partners of vinculin, including those that mediate the binding of talin and Î±-actinin to the Vh1 domain (15Bakolitsa C.

Acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphophate (PIP2) 2The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; VBS, vinculin binding site; VH, vinculin head (residues 1-840); Vh1, N-terminal seven-helical bundle domain of vinculin (residues 1-258); Vt, C-terminal (tail) five-helical bundle domain of vinculin (residues 879-1,066); Vt2, the four-helical bundle domain of vinculin (residues 719-835), which is structurally similar to Vt.2The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; VBS, vinculin binding site; VH, vinculin head (residues 1-840); Vh1, N-terminal seven-helical bundle domain of vinculin (residues 1-258); Vt, C-terminal (tail) five-helical bundle domain of vinculin (residues 879-1,066); Vt2, the four-helical bundle domain of vinculin (residues 719-835), which is structurally similar to Vt. have been thought to serve as the triggers that activate vinculin (21Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 25Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and indeed PIP2 can bind to and alter the conformation of the Vt domain (26Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, PIP2 interactions with vinculin are disrupted at physiological salt concentrations, and its binding to vinculin requires high levels of PIP2 in lipid micelles (27Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10211-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Chandrasekar I. Stradal T.E.B. Holt M.R. Entschladen F. Jockusch B.M. Ziegler W.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1461-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PIP2 competes with F-actin for binding to vinculin (29Steimle P.A. Hoffest J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the PIP2 binding site is occluded in the full-length structure of inactive vinculin (15Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Finally, vinculin mutants selectively defective in PIP2 binding still recruit to sites of focal adhesions (28Chandrasekar I. Stradal T.E.B. Holt M.R. Entschladen F. Jockusch B.M. Ziegler W.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1461-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, although PIP2 may play some role in regulating vinculin, other triggers likely activate vinculin. Mounting evidence suggests that talin and Î±-actinin may directly activate vinculin. During outside-in integrin signaling, the first event detected is PIP2-mediated changes in the conformation of the head domain of talin (30Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which then rapidly associates with the cytoplasmic tails of Î²-integrin receptors (31Calderwood D.A.

Talin then interacts with vinculin through several high-affinity vinculin binding sites (VBS) present in its central rod domain (16Bass M.D. Smith B.J. Prigent S.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem.

Vonrhein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27667-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These interactions are likely essential, as targeted deletion of talin abolishes the formation of focal adhesions (37Priddle H. Hemmings L. Monkley S. Woods A. Patel B. Sutton D. Dunn G.A. Zicha D. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similarly, Î±-actinin plays an important role in the maturation of adhesion complexes (38Von Wichert G. Haimovich B. Feng G.S. Sheetz M.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5023-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 39Zaidel-Bar R. Ballestrem C. Kam Z. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4605-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and binds to vinculin through a single high affinity VBS (Î±VBS) present in the R4 spectrin repeat at the end of its rod domain (19Kroemker M. Rudiger A.H. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20McGregor A. Blanchard A.D. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Biochem.

Notably, the Î±VBS and VBSs of talin efficiently disrupt the Vt domain from pre-existing Vh1Â·Vt complexes (24Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6112-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that the binding site for talin or Î±-actinin in vinculin is not masked by the head-tail interactions of vinculin; rather, it is readily accessible to the VBSs of talin or Î±-actinin (12Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Izard T. Structure. 2004; 12: 1189-1197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, the structures of talin-VBS- and Î±VBS-bound to Vh1 have demonstrated that these amphipathic Î±-helices disrupt the Vh1-Vt interaction from a distance, by provoking conformational changes in the N-terminal helical bundle of vinculin, by a process coined helical bundle conversion (24Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6112-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structures of native, inactive talin and Î±-actinin have revealed that their VBSs are normally buried within helical bundles that comprise their rod domains (40Bois P.R.J. Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C. Izard T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6112-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Fillingham I. Gingras A.R. Papagrigoriou E. Patel B. Emsley J. Critchley D.R. Roberts G.C.K. Barsukov I.L.

Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, in their resting state, the rod domains of talin or Î±-actinin have a rather low affinity for vinculin (15Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20McGregor A. Blanchard A.D. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and this has suggested a combinatorial model for vinculin activation, where simultaneous binding of two of more ligands are required to provide the free energy necessary to break the head-tail interactions of vinculin (15Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 18Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudury B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 169: 459-470Google Scholar). However, this model only considers talin or Î±-actinin in their inactive states and the structure of the helical bundle domains of talin or Î±-actinin may also be dynamic as, for example, atomic force microscopy has shown that helical bundle domains that comprise spectrin repeats (also found in Î±-actinin) can form stable, unfolded intermediates when exposed to mechanical stress (44Altmann S.M. Grunberg R.G. Lenne P.F. Ylanne J. Raae A. Herbert K. Saraste M. Nilges M. Horber J.K. Structure. 2002; 10: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, when exposed to tension forces from within or from outside the cell, such as occurs during the formation of adhesion complexes (45Balaban N.Q. Schwarz U.S. Riveline D. Goichberg P. Tsur G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12001-12004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), the VBSs present in the helical bundle domains of talin and Î±-actinin might become exposed to bind to and activate vinculin, without the need for co-stimulatory signals. Because talin and Î±-actinin do associate with vinculin at adhesion sites in cells (49Mangeat P. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50Belkin A.M. Koteliansky V.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 17: 291-294Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 51Critchley D.R. Holt M.R. Barry S.T. Priddle H. Hemmings L. Norman L. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 79-99PubMed Google Scholar), and Î±VBS has a comparably high affinity for full-length vinculin versus the isolated Vh1 domain (Kd of â¼2 nm; Ref. 40Bois P.R.J. Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C. Izard T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6112-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we predicted that physiological levels of the VBSs of talin and Î±-actinin might be sufficient to activate vinculin. Indeed, here we present biochemical and biological tests of this hypothesis, which support the notion that the VBSs of talin and Î±-actinin function as physiological triggers of vinculin activation in adhesion complexes. Protein Expression and PurificationâThe octahistidine-tagged human full-length vinculin (residues 1-1,066), Vh1 (residues 1-258), VH (residues 1-840), and Vt (residues 879-1,066) proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (24Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 40Bois P.R.J. Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C. Izard T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6112-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Human Î±-actinin VBS (residues 731-760; Î±VBS) and VBSs of human talin (VBS1, residues 607-636; VBS2, residues 852-875; VBS3, residues 1,945-1,970) were synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified in our in-house facility. Surface Plasmon Resonance AssaysâBinding studies were performed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a Biacore 2000 biosensor equipped with a carboxymethyldextran-coated gold surface (CM-5) sensor. The carboxymethyl groups on the chip were activated with EDC and N-hydroxysuccinimide to form the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of carboxymethyldextran. Vinculin protein was attached to this activated surface by reaction of the carboxyl groups of dextran with the primary amines of vinculin to form an amide linkage. Any remaining reactive sites on the surface were blocked by a reaction with ethanolamine. Reference cells were prepared similarly except that no vinculin protein was added. The interaction of vinculin with the VBSs of talin was analyzed at 25 Â°C in HPBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% P-20). Talin-VBS1, -VBS2, and -VBS3 peptides were solubilized in water and then diluted in HPBS-P buffer. Binding was measured by flowing the individual talin-VBS peptides at a flow rate of 15 Î¼l/min through the reference and vinculin-containing flow cells in sequence. Blanks were also run consisting of only buffer. Association was measured for 10 min, and dissociation was measured for 15 min. Data reported are the difference in SPR signals between the flow cells containing vinculin and the reference cells. Any contribution to the signal was removed by subtraction of the blank (buffer) injection from the reference-subtracted signals. Responses at equilibrium were then plotted as a function of the peptide concentration to calculate the affinities of the interactions of the VBSs of talin for full-length vinculin using Scrubber software. Vinculin-VBS Binding AssaysâRecombinant protein comprising the entire vinculin head domain (VH, residues 1-840), which includes residues in the Vt2 domain that have been suggested to contribute to the head-tail interactions of vinculin (18Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudury B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 169: 459-470Google Scholar), was incubated with Vt (residues 879-1,066) for 20 min. To ensure that all VH was driven into a complex with Vt, the VHÂ·Vt complex was formed using a 1:2 molar ratio of VH:Vt. An analysis on native polyacrylamide gels confirmed the rapid and complete formation of the VHÂ·Vt complex under these conditions, which was distinguishable from free VH protein. Î±VBS or talin-VBS3 peptides were then added to the VHÂ·Vt complex at the indicated molar ratios (from 1:1 to 20:1, VBS:vinculin) and allowed to incubate for 20 min. Complexes formed were then resolved on 8-25% gradient native polyacrylamide gels. The identity of components of the complexes in native gels was confirmed by cutting out the bands and analyzing on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by immunoblotting with antibody specific for the histidine tag on vinculin (data not shown). Vinculin-Actin Binding AssaysâVinculin was first incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature with talin-VBS3 or Î±VBS peptide (in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl) at the indicated molar ratios (from 1:1 up to 20:1, VBS: vinculin) in a final volume of 580.8 Î¼l. F-actin was polymerized as described (29Steimle P.A. Hoffest J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in a 100-Î¼l total volume of the same solution, supplemented with 5% (w/v) sucrose and 1% (w/v) dextran. 19.2 Î¼l of polymerized F-actin (final concentration of 7.5 Î¼m) was then added. These complexes were then incubated for 1 h (at ambient temperature, a final total reaction volume of 600 Î¼l), and the samples were then sedimented at 100,000 Ã g at 25 Â°C in a Beckman ultracentrifuge for 15 min. Equal volumes of reaction pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. NMR SpectroscopyâAll NMR experiments were carried out at 25 Â°C on a Bruker DRX800 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm HCN/z probe. Each 1H,15N TROSY experiment was recorded for 24 h. Product ion (MS2) spectra were subjected to search using the SEQUEST program of Eng and Yates (ThermoQuest). 98% 1H,15N-labeled, octahistidine-tagged, full-length human vinculin (residues 1-1,066) protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 in a culture of M9 minimal medium (D2O) supplemented with 1 g of 15N-labeled ammonium chloride and 4 g/liter glucose. 2H,15N-labeled vinculin was purified as previously described (12Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Izard T. Structure. 2004; 12: 1189-1197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) and was concentrated to 0.2 mm. NMR spectroscopy of the vinculinÂ·Î±VBS and the vinculinÂ·talin-VBS3 complexes were obtained following mixing of a 1.4:1 molar ratio of these VBSs to vinculin. Cell CultureâSwiss-3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine in 9% CO2. Vinculin-/- and vinculin+/- cells were the generous gift of Eileen Adamson (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and were cultured as previously described (7Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection, Immunofluorescence, and Video MicroscopyâFor microinjection, cells were plated onto poly(d-lysine)-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) the day before injection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were incubated at 37 Â°C, 9% CO2. Because of their rather poor adhesive properties (7Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), vinculin-/- cells were plated onto poly(d-lysine)-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes that were also coated with gelatin. For direct comparison vinculin+/- cells were similarly plated on glass dishes coated with gelatin. All microinjections were performed using 1Ã injection buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 40 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.2)). Cells were then microinjected with the indicated VBS peptides, injecting â¼1,000 or â¼10,000 molecules/cell using an Eppendorf microinjection system (Brinkmann, NY), mounted on an Axiovert 135 TV microscope (Carl Zeiss), with a 32Ã Achrostigmat phase-contrast objective (NA 0.4). This microinjection system was calibrated to deliver, on average, 1.2 Â± 0.3 picoliters/pulse. Using the given peptide concentrations, we calculated the approximate number of molecules delivered per injection. The microscope heated stage was kept at 37 Â°C, and the injection parameters were Pi: 20-40 hPa, Ti: 0.5 s, and Pc: 20 hPa. As a control, cells were injected with 1Ã injection buffer alone. An image of each cell about to be injected was taken prior to its injection with the needle pointing at the cell. To indeed confirm correct delivery of the peptides into the cells, they were co-injected with Alexa Fluor 568 (55 ng/ml, from Molecular Probes). After all the cells were injected, images were taken every 5 or 10 s, for the next 10-15 min. The acquisition time was stamped on each image, and all the images were combined in an AVI animated file. To visualize the actin cytoskeleton and the localization of cytoskeletal proteins, Swiss-3T3 cells were plated and microinjected on Permanox lab-tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc Corp., Napeville, IL).

Cytosolic phospholipase A(2) is activated during phagocytosis, releasing arachidonic acid for production of eicosanoids, which initiate acute inflammation. Our objective was to identify pattern recognition receptors that stimulate arachidonic acid release and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression in macrophages by pathogenic yeast and yeast cell walls. Zymosan- and Candida albicans-stimulated arachidonic acid release from resident mouse peritoneal macrophages was blocked by soluble glucan phosphate. In RAW264.7 cells arachidonic acid release, COX2 expression, and prostaglandin production were enhanced by overexpressing the beta-glucan receptor, dectin-1, but not dectin-1 lacking the cytoplasmic tail. Pure particulate (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan stimulated arachidonic acid release and COX2 expression, which were augmented in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent manner by macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2. However, arachidonic acid release and leukotriene C(4) production stimulated by zymosan and C. albicans were TLR2-independent, whereas COX2 expression and prostaglandin production were partially blunted in TLR2(-/-) macrophages. Inhibition of Syk tyrosine kinase blocked arachidonic acid release and COX2 expression in response to zymosan, C. albicans, and particulate (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan. The results suggest that cytosolic phospholipase A(2) activation triggered by the beta-glucan component of yeast is dependent on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-like domain of dectin-1 and activation of Syk kinase, whereas both TLR2 and Syk kinase regulate COX2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2033016999,"Functional characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana GAT1 in heterologous expression systems, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes, revealed that AtGAT1 (At1g08230) codes for an H+-driven, high affinity Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter. In addition to GABA, other Ï-aminofatty acids and butylamine are recognized. In contrast to the most closely related proteins of the proline transporter family, proline and glycine betaine are not transported by AtGAT1. AtGAT1 does not share sequence similarity with any of the non-plant GABA transporters described so far, and analyses of substrate selectivity and kinetic properties showed that AtGAT1-mediated transport is similar but distinct from that of mammalian, bacterial, and S. cerevisiae GABA transporters. Consistent with a role in GABA uptake into cells, transient expression of AtGAT1/green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts revealed localization at the plasma membrane.

Although GABA was discovered in 1949 as a constituent of potato tubers, research on GABA metabolism and transport advanced much faster in the animal system as GABA turned out to be the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1Steward F.C. Thompson J.F. Dent C.E. Science. 1949; 110: 439-440Google Scholar). Uptake of GABA into neurons and glia has been investigated in detail and shown to be mediated by Na+-dependent and Cl--facilitated GABA transporters (GATs), thus regulating concentration and duration of the neurotransmitter GABA in the synapse (2Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 3Chen N.-H. Reith M.A. Quick M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In addition to its function as a neurotransmitter, GABA plays a role in the development of the nervous system, influencing proliferation, migration, and differentiation (4Owens D.F. Kriegstein A.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). With the exception of the general amino acid permease BraRI from Rhizobium leguminosarum, which belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, GABA uptake in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by members of the APC (amino acid/polyamine/organocation) superfamily of transporters (5Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 6Hosie A.H.F. Allaway D. Galloway C.S. Dunsby H.A. Poole P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4071-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In both bacteria and yeast, GABA uptake and biosynthesis are mainly involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism (7Shaibe E. Metzer E. Halpern Y.S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 933-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kumar S. Punekar N.S. Mycol. Res. 1997; 101: 403-409Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Solomon P.S. Oliver R.P. Planta. 2002; 214: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although other functions such as GABA synthesis for pH regulation in Escherichia coli and for normal oxidative stress tolerance in S. cerevisiae have also been postulated (10Coleman S.T.

J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the role of GABA and its transport across the plasma membrane in plants. GABA rapidly accumulates under various stress conditions such as low temperature, mechanical stimulation, and oxygen deficiency (12Shelp B.J. Bown A.W. McLean M.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 446-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 13BoucheÌ N. Fromm H. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). As in other organisms, GABA is synthesized in plants primarily by decarboxylation of glutamate and degraded via succinic semialdehyde to succinate, a pathway that is also called the GABA shunt (12Shelp B.J. Bown A.W. McLean M.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 446-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Alternatively, succinic semialdehyde can be further catabolized to Î³-hydroxybutyrate (14Breitkreuz K.E. Allan W.L. Van Cauwenberghe O.R. Jakobs C. Talibi D. AndreÌ B. Shelp B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41552-41556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In plants GABA and the GABA shunt have been discussed as important for regulation of cytosolic pH, nitrogen storage and metabolism, protection against oxidative stress, development, and deterrence of insects (12Shelp B.J. Bown A.W. McLean M.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 446-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 13BoucheÌ N. Fromm H.

A. 2003; 100: 6843-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). GABA might also act as a compatible solute, and more recently its involvement in pollen tube guidance has been demonstrated, suggesting a role in intercellular signaling in plants (13BoucheÌ N. Fromm H. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 16BoucheÌ N. Lacombe B. Fromm H.

Cell. 2003; 114: 47-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Such functions require both intra- and intercellular transport of GABA. Indeed, both cellular and vascular transport of GABA have been documented in physiological experiments (18Servaites J.C. Schrader L.E. Jung D.M. Plant Physiol. 1979; 64: 546-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chung I. Bown A.W. Shelp B.J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20van Dongen J.T. Schurr U.

So far, only transporters mediating low affinity uptake of GABA (Km in the millimolar range) have been identified in plants. These GABA transporters (AtAAP3, ProTs), which belong to the amino acid/auxin transporter (AAAP) or amino acid transporter (ATF) superfamily (21Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier Jr., M.H.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), respectively, are considerably higher than for GABA. In this study we have reported the identification and characterization of the first high affinity GABA transporter from Arabidopsis, designated AtGAT1. Characterization in heterologous expression systems showed that kinetic properties and substrate selectivity of AtGAT1 are similar but distinct from mammalian, bacterial, and S. cerevisiae GABA transporters described so far. Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Stress TreatmentâArabidopsis thaliana L. ecotype Col-0 was grown in soil in a growth chamber at 22 Â°C/18 Â°C, 65% humidity, and 16 h of light. For induction of wounding response, rosette leaves of 4â5-week-old plants were wounded by scratching them with tweezers. Two 1â1.5-cm-long scratches parallel to the midrib were made, and wounded leaves were harvested 2, 4, and 24 h after wounding. Low and high temperature treatments were performed by keeping plants in the dark at 4 and 37 Â°C, respectively; anoxic stress was applied by submerging whole Arabidopsis plants in water. Leaves were harvested 2, 4, and 24 h after onset of the treatment. For dark induction of senescence, green leaves were excised and incubated on moistened filter paper for 3 or 6 days in the dark. Alternatively, senescence of attached leaves was assayed by harvesting two batches of yellowing leaves of different stages of senescence from the same plants. â¼20% of the leaf area was yellowing in stage I senescent leaves, whereas â¼50% of the leaf area was yellowing in stage II leaves. Chlorophyll ExtractionâPlant material was extracted three times with 80% acetone containing 1 Î¼m KOH, and the chlorophyll content of the extract was measured spectrophotometrically (26Strain H.H. Cope B.T. Svec W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 452-476Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Determination of GABA Concentrationâ150â200 mg of plant material was extracted with 500 Î¼l of a mixture of methanol:chloroform: water (12:5:3). After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered and 188 Î¼l of water and 125 Î¼l of chloroform were added. The upper phase of the mixture was dried at room temperature using a speed vacuum apparatus. The pellet was dissolved in 200 Î¼l of water and 300 Î¼l of acetonitrile, and phases were separated by centrifugation. The supernatant was dried, dissolved in 200 Î¼l of water, and purified using a Sep-Pak Vac 1cc C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The eluate was dried, and GABA content was measured by high performance liquid chromatography using a modified protocol according to Bidlingmeyer et al. (27Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). DNA and RNA WorkâThe AtGAT1-cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR using primers 5â²-ACTTATAAAAGTGAGTAGCACC-3â², 5â²-CTCACTTTGCTTTGCATGTTC-3â² and RNA extracted from flowers of A. thaliana L. ecotype Col-0 as template. The AtGAT1-cDNA was cloned in the EcoRV site of pSK and verified by sequencing. For S. cerevisiae complementation assays the AtGAT1-cDNA was transferred into pDR196 using PstI and XhoI (28Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The cDNA of At5g41800 was isolated by RT-PCR using primers 5â²-TATATAAATCATTCACTTGTAG-3â², 5â²-TTTATGTTTTTATCACACTATC-3â² and RNA extracted from flowers of A. thaliana L. ecotype Col-0 as template. The At5g41800-cDNA was cloned in the SmaI site of pDR196 and verified by sequencing. For translational fusions with GFP, the open reading frame of the AtGAT1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned in pUC18-spGFP6 and pUC18-GFP5Tsp. 4M. Suter Grotemeyer and D. Rentsch, unpublished information. AtGAT1-GFP fusion: 5â²-CTAGCTAGCATGGGTGGAGAAGAGAGATC-3â², 5â²-GAAGATCTACATCCGCAAACAACTTATAC-3â² (open reading frame cloned into SpeI/BglII site). GFP-AtGAT1 fusion: 5â²-CTAGCTAGCATGGGTGGAGAAGAGAGATC-3â²,5â²-CCGCTCGAGTTATACATCCGCAAACAAC-3â² (open reading frame cloned into NheI/SalI site). Sequence identity of all PCR-amplified fragments was verified by sequencing. For electrophysiological studies AtGAT1 was transferred from pDR196 to pBF1 (29Baukrowitz T. Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using BamHI and ClaI. AtGAT1-GFP and GFP-AtGAT1 were transferred from pUC18-vectors to pBF1 using XmaI and PstI. cRNA was synthesized using the AMBION SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. For quantification of expression, RNA was extracted using a method based on phenol extraction (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.10-7.11Google Scholar) including an additional DNase I treatment. Reverse transcription was performed using the RETROscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions with oligo(dT) primers and 2 Î¼g of total RNA as template. Relative quantification using real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics). The FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with MgCl2 at a final concentration of 4 mm and 10 pmol of each primer (AtGAT1: 5â²-ATACCTGAAATTCAGGCAACAA-3â², 5â²-TAGGTTGTAGGTATACCACAG-3â²). Actin (AtAct2) was used as a reference gene (5â²-ATTCAGATGCCCAGAAGTCTTGTT-3â², 5â²-GAAACATTTTCTGTGAACGATTCCT-3â²). AtSag12 was used as a marker for senescence (5â²-CGAAGGCGGTTTAATGGATA-3â², 5â²-CACCTCCTTCAATTCCAACG-3â²). Yeast Growth, Transformation, and SelectionâS. cerevisiae strain 22574d (MATÎ± ura3â1, gap1â1, put4â1, uga4â1) (31Jauniaux J.C. Vandenbol M. Vissers S. Broman K. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was transformed according to Dohmen et al. (32Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W.M. HoÌner C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on synthetic dextrose minimal medium (33Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 172Google Scholar). To test for substrate specificity, transformants were selected on minimal medium supplemented with 20 g/liter of glucose and 1 g/liter of proline, GABA, or citrulline as sole nitrogen source. Transport AssaysâTransport assays using S. cerevisiae were done essentially as described previously (34Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar) using a final concentration of â¼2 Ã 108 cells/ml, 1.85â55.5 kBq 3H-GABA (Amersham Biosciences) and appropriate amounts of the respective unlabeled GABA. Expression in Xenopus OocytesâStage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 50 ng (50 nl) of AtGAT1 cRNA and were maintained in Barth's medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 Î¼g/ml of gentamicin, 100 Î¼g/ml of streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin) at 18 Â°C for 1â3 days until used in experiments. All of the experiments were performed at 21 Â± 1 Â°C. Experiments were performed in a NaCl buffer containing (in mm): 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 PIPES, and 10 HOMOPIPES, pH 7.4. Substrates were added to the buffer solutions as indicated, and the necessary pH adjustments were made. All reagents were purchased from Sigma. Oocytes were voltage clamped by using the Warner Oocyte Clamp (OC-725C; Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). In the recording experimental chamber, oocytes were initially stabilized in the NaCl buffer, and the composition of the bath was changed as indicated. In all of the experiments, the reference electrodes were connected to the experimental oocyte chamber via agar bridges (3% agar in 3 m KCl). For continuous holding current measurements, the oocyte membrane potential (Vm) was clamped at -50 mV unless otherwise indicated. Currents were low pass filtered at 100 Hz (LPF 8; Warner Instrument Corp.), sampled at 10 Hz (pCLAMP 8.1; Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Substrate-induced currents were determined by subtracting the base-line current present in NaCl buffer from the evoked current observed after addition of the substrate. The effects of substrate concentration on the steady-state kinetics were determined by non-linear curve fitting of the induced currents (I) to the Michaelis-Menten equation as shown in Equation 1,I=ImaxSÃ[S]K0.5S+[S](Eq. 1) where S is the substrate, ImaxS is the maximal substrate-induced current, and K0.5S is the substrate concentration at half ImaxS (half-maximal concentration). Curve fittings were performed by using SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Transient Expression in ProtoplastsâTransient expression of GFP fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts was done as described previously (35Dietrich D. Hammes U. Thor K. Suter-Grotemeyer M. Fluckiger R. Slusarenko A.J. Ward J.M. Rentsch D. Plant J. 2004; 40: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the samples were examined by using a SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Filter settings were 500â520 nm for GFP and 628â768 nm for chlorophyll epifluorescence detection. The Arabidopsis genome contains two members of the ATF amino acid transporter gene family, At1g08230 (AtGAT1) and At5g41800, which exhibit a higher degree of homology to the proline/compatible solute transporters (ProTs) than to members of other subfamilies (Fig. 1) (22Wipf D. Ludewig U. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Koch W. Frommer W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Fischer W.-N. Andre B. Rentsch D. Krolkiewicz S. Tegeder M. Breitkreuz K. Frommer W.B. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 188-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AtGAT1 showed higher homology to a rice protein (OJ1402_H07.15; 62.3% amino acid identity) than to its closest Arabidopsis homolog, At5g41800 (45.8% amino acid identity). Similarly, At5g41800 showed highest homology to a partial mRNA from chickpea (Cicer arietinum AJ004959) and to two rice proteins (OJ1007_H05.2 and P0407B12.25). This is in contrast to members of the ProT subfamily, where proteins from tomato, mangrove, rice, and Arabidopsis display a higher degree of homology within a species than between species. Similar to predictions for other ATF family members, AtGAT1 and At5g41800 encode proteins with a molecular mass of 49.69 and 49.86 kDa, respectively, and 9â12 predicted transmembrane domains (37Schwacke R. Schneider A. Van Der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flugge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Based on the relatively low sequence identity of AtGAT1 and At5g41800 to ProTs (26â27.2% identity), we wondered whether the newly identified genes code for compatible solute transporters or represent a separate group of amino acid transporters. AtGAT1 Transports GABA with High AffinityâTo determine whether AtGAT1 differs in its substrate specificity from members of the ProT gene family, the cDNAs of AtGAT1 (At1g08230) and At5g41800 were isolated by RT-PCR. Subsequently, AtGAT1 and At5g41800 were expressed under the control of the strong PMA1 promoter (vector pDR196) in the S. cerevisiae strain 22574d (28Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Jauniaux J.C. Vandenbol M. Vissers S. Broman K. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae mutant 22574d carries mutations in the general amino acid (gap1), proline (put4), and GABA (uga4) permeases and therefore is unable to grow on citrulline, proline, or GABA as the sole nitrogen source. As control, strain 22574d was transformed with the expression vector pDR196 and pDR195 harboring the cDNAs of the proline/compatible solute transporter AtProT2 or of the amino acid permease AtAAP2 (38Kwart M. Hirner B. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 1993; 4: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 39Rentsch D. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Growth under selective conditions showed that, like AtProT2, AtGAT1 was able to mediate growth on GABA. However, AtGAT1 could not mediate growth on proline or citrulline (Fig. 2 and data not shown) and histidine was not a substrate for AtGAT1 (data not shown; strain JT16) (40Tanaka J. Fink G.R. Gene. 1985; 38: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This behavior distinguished AtGAT1 from all transporters of the ATF family characterized so far. In contrast, At5g41800 could not mediate growth on any of the tested substrates. Therefore, At5g41800 was not included in further functional studies. Previous studies described the ProTs as low affinity GABA transporters (Km, 1.7â5 mm) (23Breitkreuz K.E. Shelp B.J. Fischer W.N. Schwacke R. Rentsch D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Grallath S. Weimar T. Meyer A. Gumy C. Suter-Grotemeyer M. Neuhaus J.M. Rentsch D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To examine whether AtGAT1 differed in its kinetic properties, 3H-GABA uptake experiments were performed in 22574d cells expressing AtGAT1. Transport assays showed that AtGAT1 has a much higher affinity for GABA (Km 10 Â± 3 Î¼m) than any of the plant transporters characterized before (Fig. 3A). As shown for other transporters of the ATF family, transport rates increased with decreasing pH (Fig. 3B) (39Rentsch D. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 41Fischer W.N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16315-16320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Competition experiments for 3H-GABA uptake in the presence of a 5-fold excess of competitors showed that the GABA-related compounds Î²-aminobutyric acid and Î²-alanine reduced GABA transport rates by â¼30%, whereas Î±-aminobutyric acid did not compete for GABA transport (Fig. 3C). In addition, compounds involved in GABA metabolism (i.e. glutamate, succinic semialdehyde, and succinate) were not competitors for AtGAT1-mediated GABA uptake. Alanine slightly reduced GABA transport rates, whereas histidine as well as compounds that were good competitors for ProT-mediated GABA transport (i.e. d- and l-proline, glycine betaine, and choline) did not reduce GABA uptake activity (23Breitkreuz K.E. Shelp B.J. Fischer W.N. Schwacke R. Rentsch D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). That none of the substrates tested efficiently competed for GABA uptake suggested that AtGAT1 is a highly selective, high affinity GABA transporter. Electrophysiological Assay of AtGAT1 GABA Transport KineticsâTo determine whether weakly competing compounds were substrates of AtGAT1 and to examine the kinetic properties of AtGAT1 in more detail, substrate-induced currents were analyzed in X. laevis oocytes injected with AtGAT1 cRNA. At a membrane potential of -50 mV and a pH of 5.0, addition of 1 mm GABA to the bathing medium of AtGAT1-expressing oocytes induced inward currents ranging from 96 to 191 nA (Fig. 4B). Current amplitude was dependent on the batch of oocytes and incubation time after cRNA injection. As is commonly observed with many other electrogenic transporters expressed in X. laevis oocytes, the AtGAT1 substrate-evoked current reached a peak followed by slow decay in the presence of the substrate (Fig. 4B) (e.g. Refs. 42Forster I.C. Loo D.D. Eskandari S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F644-F649PubMed Google Scholar and 43Whitlow R.D. Sacher A. Loo D.D.F. Nelson N. Eskandari S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17716-17726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). No GABA-evoked currents were observed in control oocytes (Fig. 4A). Fig. 5A shows the GABA activation curve at a holding potential of -50 mV and an external proton concentration ([H+]out) of 10 Î¼m (pH 5). The apparent affinity of AtGAT1 for GABA was 43 Â± 7 Î¼m (n = 3). Likewise, the H+ activation curve at -50 mV and 1 mm GABA was hyperbolic with a K0.5 of 440 Â± 40 nm (Fig. 5D). The apparent affinity for GABA (K0.5GABA) appeared not to be voltage dependent in the range from -90 to -10 mV (Fig. 5B), whereas the maximum transport rate (ImaxGABA) increased slightly at depolarized membrane potentials (Fig. 5C). Substrate Selectivity of AtGAT1âUptake studies such as those shown in Fig. 3C demonstrate whether a compound can alter AtGAT1-mediated GABA transport, presumably by competing for the GABA binding site of AtGAT1. However, these competition studies do not reveal whether a tested compound is in fact a transported substrate of AtGAT1. Thus, to further examine the substrate selectivity of AtGAT1, electrophysiological assays were performed (Fig. 6). GABA, GABA analogs, and other substrates were applied at a concentration of 1 mm, whereas [H+]out was 10 Î¼m and Vm was -50 mV (Fig. 6). An inward current evoked by a substrate was taken as H+-driven, AtGAT1-mediated substrate translocation into the cell. l-Alanine, Î²-aminobutyric acid, and Î²-alanine, which only weakly competed for GABA uptake in S. cerevisiae (see Fig. 3C), induced inward currents comparable in magnitude with that induced by GABA. Other GABA-related compounds with longer carbon chains, such as 5-aminovaleric acid, 6-aminocaproic acid, and 8-aminocaprylic acid, were also good substrates. Interestingly, the current induced by butylamine, which lacks the carboxyl group, was similar to that induced by GABA. None of these substrates induced currents in control oocytes. Similar to competition experiments using S. cerevisiae, d- and l-proline as well as glycine betaine and choline were not recognized as substrates (see Figs. 3C and 6). In addition, substrates of the GABA shunt (succinate and glutamate) did not induce currents in AtGAT1-expressing oocytes. Moreover, trigonelline, a betaine present at high concentrations in many legume seeds (44Zheng X.-Q. Hayashibe E. Ashihara H. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the amino acids histidine, glutamine, and norvaline were not transported. The rigid GABA analog nipecotic acid and the amino sulfonate taurine, both substrates of neuronal GABA transporters in mouse (mGAT3 and mGAT4) (2Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 45Liu Q.R. Lopez-Corcuera B. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2005; 519: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), did not induce currents in AtGAT1-expressing oocytes. We reasoned that the compounds that did not compete for GABA uptake in S. cerevisiae but induced currents in AtGAT1-expressing oocytes were low affinity substrates of AtGAT1. Thus, we determined the affinity of AtGAT1 for various substrates. Substrate-induced currents were measured during applications of substrates at concentrations between 5 Î¼m and 100 mm. Currents were plotted against the substrate concentration, and curves were fitted to Equation 1. The apparent affinity of AtGAT1 for individual substrates varied by a factor of 1000 (Table 1). AtGAT1 showed the highest affinity for butylamine with a K0.5 2-fold lower than that for GABA. Moving the amino group closer to the carboxyl group (such as in Î²-aminobutyric acid and Î±-aminobutyric acid) progressively reduced the apparent affinity (see Table 1). Increasing the carbon chain backbone from GABA to 8-aminocaprylic acid only marginally affected the K0.5 values (30â80 Î¼m). In addition, 5-aminolevulinic acid was transported with an affinity comparable with that of GABA. Reducing the carbon chain length (e.g. Î²-alanine) resulted in a much lower substrate affinity (K0.5 200 Î¼m). A similar affinity was"

We have reported previously that in myoblasts FHL3 binds skeletal Î±-actin and inhibits Î±-actinin-mediated actin cross-linking, suggesting that FHL proteins may also play an important role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics (21Coghill I.D. Brown S. Cottle D.L. McGrath M.J. Robinson P.A. Nandurkar H.H. Dyson J.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24139-24152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). FHL1 is the least characterized of the FHL proteins and is the focus of this study. To date, the role of FHL1 in striated muscle is unknown, and binding partners have not been characterized. In this study, to investigate the function of FHL1 in skeletal muscle, yeast two-hybrid screening of a human skeletal muscle library was undertaken and identified myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) as an FHL1-binding partner. MyBP-C constitutes â¼1-2% of the total myofibrillar protein and is proposed to function as one of the major myosin-thick filament regulatory proteins (22Winegrad S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1117-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of MyBP-C, each encoded by separate genes, have been identified as follows: slow and fast type skeletal muscle and cardiac MyBP-C (23Weber F.E. Vaughan K.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Carrier L. Bonne G. Bahrend E. Yu B. Richard P. Niel F. Hainque B. Cruaud C. Gary F. Labeit S. Bouhour J.B. Dubourg O.

Res. 2004; 94: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The domain organization is conserved throughout all MyBP-C isoforms, comprising seven immunoglobulin-C2 domains (Ig-C2) (C1-C5, C8, and C10) and three fibronectin type III motifs (C6, C7, and C9). In addition, cardiac MyBP-C also contains a unique N-terminal Ig-C2 domain (C0). In mature striated muscle MyBP-C localizes to the cross-bridge (C-zone) of the A-band, where multiple domains bind myosin and titin (26Craig R. Offer G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 192: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In all MyBP-C isoforms, the primary myosin-binding site resides in the C-terminal IgC2 domain C10 (27Moos C. Offer G. Starr R. Bennett P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Okagaki T. Weber F.E. Fischman D.A. Vaughan K.T. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20866-20872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More specifically, this C10 domain binds the light meromyosin (LMM) or rod region of myosin, which forms the backbone of the thick filament (27Moos C. Offer G. Starr R. Bennett P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Miyamoto C.A. Fischman D.A. Reinach F.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal Ig-C2 domains C1-C2 of MyBP-C bind subfragment 2 (S2) of myosin, which includes the junction between the myosin head and thick filament backbone (31Gruen M. Gautel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 933-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Starr R. Offer G. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The N-and C-terminal binding of MyBP-C to myosin is proposed to form a dynamic, interconnected network with myosin to tether and regulate myosin flexibility and hence interaction with actin. The role of MyBP-C in striated muscle is contentious; however, MyBP-C may be required for the formation and stabilization of normal myosin thick filaments and for the regulation of myosin cross-bridge kinetics (22Winegrad S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1117-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Flashman E. Redwood C. Moolman-Smook J. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In vitro MyBP-C is required for the efficient formation of long, uniform, and compact thick filaments (27Moos C. Offer G. Starr R. Bennett P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Koretz J.F. Biophys. J. 1979; 27: 433-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The C10 myosin binding domain is essential for the ability of MyBP-C to polymerize myosin (34Sebillon P. Bonne G. Flavigny J. Venin S. Rouche A. Fiszman M. Vikstrom K. Leinwand L. Carrier L.

MyBP-C is also predicted to play an important role in sarcomere formation during myofibrillogenesis. Expression of MyBP-C lacking the C10 domain, in skeletal myotubes and cardiomyocytes, potently inhibits sarcomere formation (37Gilbert R. Kelly M.G. Mikawa T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 101-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sato N. Kawakami T. Nakayama A. Suzuki H. Kasahara H. Obinata T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3180-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cardiac MyBP-C(+) is a recently identified splice variant, which contains a 10-amino acid insert within the C-terminal domain C9 (38Sato N. Kawakami T. Nakayama A. Suzuki H. Kasahara H. Obinata T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3180-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cardiac MyBP-C(+) exhibits reduced binding affinity for myosin and titin in vitro and disrupts sarcomere formation when expressed in cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of the C10 myosin-binding domain to MyBP-C activity. Most interestingly, mutations in cardiac MyBP-C, which commonly result in loss of the C-terminal titin and/or myosin binding domains, are the second leading cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (24Carrier L. Bonne G. Bahrend E. Yu B. Richard P. Niel F. Hainque B. Cruaud C. Gary F. Labeit S. Bouhour J.B. Dubourg O. Desnos M. Hagege A.A. Trent R.J. Komajda M. Fiszman M. Schwartz K. Circ.

FHL1 localized predominantly to the I-band of mature skeletal muscle sections and isolated myofibrils. Furthermore, a pool of FHL1 was detected at the M-line that extended into the C-zone of the A-band, co-localizing with MyBP-C. In an in vitro assay FHL1 impaired the co-sedimentation of MyBP-C with myosin filaments, suggesting FHL1 and myosin compete for binding to domain C10 of MyBP-C. Overexpression of FHL1 and RNAi-mediated knockdown of FHL1 in differentiating C2C12 cells indicate FHL1 is a novel regulator of MyBP-C activity and thereby sarcomeric assembly.

Synthetic myosin filaments were generated by incubating 0.5 Î¼m of myosin purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (Sigma) in binding buffer (20 mm imidazole, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h and then rocking at 4 Â°C. To a final volume of 150 Î¼l, 0.2 Î¼m His-cMyBP-C (C6-C10) and 0.5 Î¼m of either GST alone or GST-FHL1 were added to myosin filaments and incubated overnight with rocking at 4 Â°C. In control studies, binding buffer was used in lieu of recombinant protein. Myosin filaments were recovered by centrifugation at 106,000 Ã g (50,000 rpm TLA 100.3 rotor, Beckman) for 30 min at 4 Â°C, followed by removal of the supernatant and reconstitution of filaments (pellet) in 150 Î¼l of SDS-PAGE reducing buffer. 30 Î¼l of pellet fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with MyHC (MF20, 1:100), GST (1:1000), or polyhistidine (1:3000) antibodies.

Consistently, and as previously shown for calnexin, calreticulin, and UGT1 deletions, cells lacking ERp57 show normal viability and proliferation rates and unperturbed maturation and transport of several surface glycoproteins containing disulfide bonds (8Garbi N. Tanaka S. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Conditional deletion of ERp57 in B lymphocytes/plasma cells revealed no defect in the production of immunoglobulin chains, the most abundant N-glycosylated/disulfide-bonded products of these cells (8Garbi N. Tanaka S. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The thorough analysis by Garbi et al. showed that ERp57 deletion specifically affected assembly and stability of the major histocompatibility class I peptide-loading complex. These results are consistent with the important role of calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 in the biogenesis of this multimeric complex (reviewed in Refs. 13Elliott T. Williams A. Immunol.

To better understand the differences between obligate and facultative clients of the calnexin chaperone system and to specifically assess the intervention of ERp57 in the co- and post-translational phases of oxidative folding for these two classes of glycoproteins, we compared in cells with (wt) or without ERp57 (57â/â) (Fig. 1A) the maturation of one obligate (influenza virus HA) and two facultative (Semliki forest virus (SFV) E1 and p62) clients of the calnexin chaperone system. HA was selected for its exquisite dependence on calnexin for efficient maturation (11Molinari M. Eriksson K.K. Calanca V. Galli C. Cresswell P. Michalak M. Helenius A. Mol.

Their role in protein homeostasis is not fully understood. We present here the first analysis of oxidative protein folding in cells lacking one ER-resident oxidoreductase. We show that ERp57 activity is dispensable for co-translational oxidation of cysteines in the nascent model glycoproteins. As a clear distinction between the facultative and the obligate N-glycosylated clients of the calnexin chaperone system, ERp57 was required only for the latter, for the post-translational reshuffling of intramolecular disulfides leading to acquisition of the native conformation. We show that members of the PDI superfamily may have overlapping and interchangeable activities in the living cell. Accordingly, for glycoproteins that successfully completed the oxidative folding process in cells lacking the dedicated oxidoreductase ERp57, at least one surrogate PDI family member, namely ERp72, proficiently replaced ERp57 upon deletion and upon complete inactivation of the calnexin cycle in cells exposed to the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine.

A cloned line immortalized with SV40 large T antigen (referred to as wt) was then transfected with a plasmid coding for Cre recombinase to obtain stable ERp57 knock-out fibroblasts (referred to as 57â/â). Levels of ERp57 protein were reduced by stably co-transfecting cells with plasmids coding for small interfering RNA specific for three different ERp57 mRNA regions.

Eriksson K.K. Calanca V. Galli C. Cresswell P. Michalak M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), also in cells deleted of ERp57 there was no sign of ER stress (Fig. 1, B and C) (8Garbi N. Tanaka S. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the ER stress marker sXbp1 was not expressed unless cells were exposed to tunicamycin, a compound that elicits ER stress by blocking N-glycosylation of newly synthesized secretory proteins (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the luminal level of several stress-responsive chaperones was comparable in 57â/â and wt MF (Fig. 1C). The lack of UPR-induction shows that ERp57 is dispensable for maturation of most cellular glycoproteins and that its deletion must be proficiently compensated by the redox activity of surrogate ER oxidoreductases. ERp57 Deletion Does Not Affect Co-translational Formation of HA DisulfidesâWe first determined consequences of ERp57 deletion on the oxidative folding of a glycoprotein strictly dependent on calnexin association for efficient maturation, the influenza virus HA. 4 h after infection, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine. To analyze co-translational events, cells were flooded on ice immediately after the 2-min pulse with a membrane-permeable alkylating agent to prevent postlysis oxidation of free cysteines (18Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Labeled influenza virus proteins were immunoisolated from cell lysates with a specific antibody and were analyzed using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technique (diagonal gel electrophoresis (21Molinari M. Helenius A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)), in which the first dimension is run under nonreducing conditions in a glass capillary tube. For the second dimension, the gel is extruded from the tube, boiled in reducing sample buffer, and placed on a conventional slab gel. In diagonal gels, nascent polypeptides are seen as a stripe of radioactivity from the lower left corner (shorter chains) to the upper right corner (longer chains) (Fig. 2B). Polypeptides without disulfide bonds have the same mobility under nonreducing and reducing conditions; they therefore migrate on the gel diagonal. Polypeptides with intramolecular disulfides migrate faster in the nonreducing gel and move below the diagonal. In wt MF, HA acquires intra-molecular disulfide bonds co-translationally (17Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Consistently, labeled HA growing nascent chains ran below the gel diagonal (Fig. 2, B and C, panel 1). Some nascent chains acquired small loop disulfides and diverged below the gel diagonal (arrow 1); they were completed into the IT1 form of full-length HA. Others, starting from a length of about 50 kDa (arrow 2), acquired one big loop disulfide and terminated in the IT2 form characterized by a larger distance from the gel diagonal. Formation of the second big loop disulfide originating a fully oxidized NT form with an even faster mobility in the second dimension occurred just before or after chain termination (arrow 3 in Fig. 2C, panel 1; for nomenclature of the HA folding intermediates expressed in wt cells, see Ref. 18Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Co-translational formation of intramolecular disulfides did not require ERp57. Comparison of co-translational HA oxidation in cells with and without ERp57 showed that a comparable amount of nascent HA was below the gel diagonal and thus had acquired intramolecular disulfides in the two cell lines. Oxidation actually started on shorter HA chains in cells lacking ERp57 (compare the position of arrow 2 in Fig. 2C, panel 1 versus panel 2). Thus, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the intramolecular HA disulfides formed with and without ERp57 are different (for that reason, the latter were named po (for partially oxidized) and eo (for extensively oxidized) in Fig. 2C, panel 2), the data clearly show that ERp57 is dispensable for co-translational oxidation of HA cysteines. ERp57 Deletion Affects Post-translational Reshuffling of HA DisulfidesâAfter a 3-min chase (Fig. 2C, panels 3 and 4), most HA nascent chains had been completed, and radioactivity was mainly condensed in the cytosolic influenza virus nuclear protein (NP) and in full-length HA in the IT1, IT2, or NT forms. In 57â/â MF, about 20% of the labeled HA was extensively oxidized after a 3-min chase (Fig. 2C, panel 4) versus the 40% in wt MF (Fig. 2C, panel 3). In 57â/â MF, part of the newly synthesized HA had entered intermolecular disulfide-bonded complexes after chain termination. These are shown above the diagonal of the gel (disulfide-bonded HA (DB HA) in Fig. 2C, panel 4). DB HA only contained full-length disulfide-bonded HA as labeled component (Fig. 2C, panel 4) and did not co-precipitate with the oxidoreductases PDI and ERp72. A fraction of DB HA did co-precipitate with BiP, confirming the involvement of this abundant ER chaperone in ER retention of aggregated HA (data not shown) (11Molinari M. Eriksson K.K. Calanca V. Galli C. Cresswell P. Michalak M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Formation of DB HA is a symptom of inefficient HA folding upon deletion of ERp57, because these complexes were not formed in wt cells (panel 3). DB HA gradually increased in amount during the chase (Fig. 3A, panel 57â/â). Thus, deletion of the glycoprotein-specific oxidoreductase ERp57 resulted in formation of non-native intermolecular complexes containing HA after chain termination. More detailed analysis of post-translational HA folding was performed by chasing cells for up to 40 min before lysis (Fig. 3). In wt MF, oxidative folding of HA was as rapid as in other cell lines (18Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). After a 2-min chase, 50% of the labeled HA was in the partially oxidized IT1 or IT2 forms, and 50% had completed the oxidation process and was in the NT form (Fig. 3A, wt). Consistent with efficient maturation, HA was released from calnexin (tÂ½ of less than 10 min) (Fig. 3, C and D, wt) and from the ER. ER exit was confirmed by the acquisition of Endo H-resistant N-glycans (tÂ½ of about 20 min, Fig. 3, E and F, wt) that occurs when native glycopolypeptides transit the Golgi compartment (23Rothman J.E. Urbani L.J. Brands R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Oxidative folding of HA was significantly less efficient without ERp57, because 40â50% of the labeled HA was trapped in DB HA after a 40-min chase (DB HA in Fig. 3, A (57â/â) and B). Moreover, the oxidation of the HA protected from covalent aggregation was slower without ERp57 (Fig. 2C, compare panel 3 with 4; Fig. 3A, compare wt with 57â/â). An inverse correlation between the intraluminal content of ERp57 and the gravity of the HA folding defect was confirmed in a stable cell line subjected to specific RNA interference and expressing only 20% of the wt level of ERp57 (si57; Fig. 1A). These cells had an intermediate phenotype characterized by an HA oxidation rate closer to that of wt MF (Fig. 3A, si57) and a partial recovery of HA folding efficiency, as shown by the substantial reduction of DB HA compared with 57â/â MF (Fig. 3B). After a 40-min chase, virtually no HA was aggregated in wt cells (Fig. 3B, lane 1), versus the 10â20% in si57 MF and the 40â50% in 57â/â MF (lanes 3 and 2, respectively). The extensively oxidized HA (eo in Fig. 3A, 57â/â) generated without ERp57 and the extensively oxidized HA generated in wt MF (NT in Fig. 3A, wt) had similar mobility in the nonreducing gels, but at least part of the former contained nonnative intramolecular disulfides. Consistent with the persistence of a folding defect despite extensive oxidation, the release of HA from calnexin (Fig. 3, C, D, and G) and from calreticulin (Fig. 3G) was delayed in cells lacking ERp57, and, notably, less labeled HA acquired the native epitopes exposed by trimeric HA in 57â/â MF (Figs. 3H (lower panel) and 4B). Thus, fine structural defects caused by inappropriate cysteine pairing in cells lacking ERp57 delayed HA release from calnexin/calreticulin and inhibited the formation of HA homotrimers, which is required for forward transport of HA (24Copeland C.S. Zimmer K.P. Wagner K.R. Healey G.A. Mellman I. Helenius A. Cell. 1988; 53: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As a consequence, only about 30% of the labeled HA acquired Endo H-resistant N-glycans after a 40-min chase in cells lacking ERp57 versus the 70â80% in wt MF (Fig. 3, E, F, and H, upper panel). For HA, we were unable to identify surrogate oxidoreductases assisting the slower and less efficient HA maturation or catalyzing the formation of the aberrant intermolecular disulfides causing HA aggregation in 57â/â MF (see below for identification of surrogate oxidoreductases for other model glycoproteins). Defective Recovery of Native HA Conformation in Cells Lacking ERp57âTo confirm that ERp57 deletion impaired disulfide reshuffling occurring during HA maturation, we artificially induced formation of nonnative disulfides in newly synthesized HA. To this end, infected cells were flooded, after the pulse with radioactivity, with diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N-dimethylamide) (diamide), a powerful cell-permeable thiol oxidant (25Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). 5 min later, diamide was washed out. Conversion from the nonnative to the native set of HA disulfides in wt and in 57â/â MF was monitored by determining acquisition of trimer-specific epitopes and of Endo H-resistant N-glycans. In both cell lines, incubation with diamide caused rapid formation of nonnative intra- and intermolecular disulfides in newly synthesized polypeptides. In cells lysed immediately after the chase with diamide, immunoisolation of the labeled nuclear protein and HA was very inefficient (compare the amount of labeled protein in lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 13 and 14 versus lanes 3â12 and lanes 15â24 in Fig. 4A). Evidently, the epitopes recognized by the antibodies were inaccessible in the diamide-induced aggregates. Moreover, the solubilization of the diamide-induced HA-containing aggregates was suboptimal. At longer times after diamide wash-out (5â60 min in Fig. 4A), more HA and nuclear protein were immunoisolated from the detergent extracts, showing reversibility of the aggregation process and reappearance of the epitopes of the antibody in both cell lines. In wt MF chased for 5 min after the diamide wash-out, most of the immunoisolated HA entered the nonreducing gel (Fig. 4A, lane 3). With progression of the chase, HA gradually acquired faster mobility and therefore more compact conformation (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 5, and 7, respectively). This showed a slow progression of disulfide isomerization that eventually converted part of the HA from large aggregates into a partially oxidized (po in Fig. 4A) and then into a more extensively oxidized form (eo in Fig. 4A). 40 and 60 min after diamide wash-out, a significant fraction of labeled HA was native and was, accordingly, immunoisolated from cell lysates with a trimer-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4B). Confirming acquisition of the native conformation, 30 and 50% of the labeled HA had acquired Endo H-resistant N-glycans after 40 and 60 min of chase, respectively (Fig. 4C). Thus, in wt cells artificially misfolded, disulfide-bonded HA was slowly converted into native, trimeric, and transport-competent HA upon diamide wash-out. Deletion of ERp57 had three consequences. First, a significant fraction of detergent-soluble, labeled HA remained in disulfide-bonded complexes after diamide wash-out (DA in the nonreducing gel; Fig. 4A, lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). This showed that disassembly of covalent aggregates formed upon diamide treatment was defective in cells lacking ERp57. Second, the disulfide reshuffling to the extensively oxidized HA (eo in Fig. 4A) after diamide wash-out was significantly delayed without ERp57 (tÂ½ of 10 min versus 5 min in wt MF). Third, a lower fraction of HA acquired a native, trimerization-competent structure, confirming the incorrect pairing of HA cysteines without ERp57. Consistently, significantly less labeled HA reacted with trimer-specific antibodies in 57â/â MF (Fig. 4B), and acquisition of Endo H-resistant N-glycans was not observed (Fig. 4C). To summarize, ERp57 deletion did not prevent co- and post-translational oxidation of the cysteines of HA. However, the several oxidoreductases in the ER lumen did not replace with due efficiency the deleted ERp57 in assisting the post-translational phases of HA maturation. In fact, shortly after chain termination, half of the newly synthesized HA formed covalent aggregates, and even the fraction of HA protected from aggregation only hardly acquired native architecture despite extensive oxidation. Moreover, aberrant diamide-induced disulfides were slowly reshuffled into the native set of disulfides of intramolecular HA in the wt ER. Reshuffling was substantially delayed upon ERp57 deletion. Taken together, the data showing accumulation of HA aggregates in 57â/â MF (Figs. 2 and 3) and the defect in disassembly of disulfide-bonded HA upon diamide wash-out in 57â/â MF (Fig. 4) hint at ERp57 chaperone and/or redox activity involved in reducing the kinetic partitioning of the off pathway during HA folding. ERp57 Deletion Does Not Affect Co-translational Formation and Post-translational Reshuffling of E1 and p62 DisulfidesâWe next determined the consequences of ERp57 deletion on the maturation of calnexin substrates that remain folding-competent upon inactivation of the calnexin chaperone system. We selected the E1 and p62 glycoproteins of SFV because of their propensity to abundantly engage ER oxidoreductases in transient mixed disulfides (MD) during maturation (26Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). E1/p62-containing MD can be immunoisolated with oxidoreductase-specific antibodies for analysis in conventional and in diagonal gels. We reasoned that these model glycoproteins could in principle be exploited to assess consequences of ERp57 deletion and, more importantly, to identify the ER-resident oxidoreductases intervening to replace the missing, inactive, or busy ERp57. We first compared co-translational oxidation of E1 and p62 cysteines in cells with and without ERp57. Infected cells were pulsed for 2 min with radioactivity (as described above). At the end of the pulse, they were flooded with ice-cold NEM to alkylate free sulfhydryl groups of nascent chains. The virus-encoded glycoproteins were immunoisolated wit"
https://openalex.org/W2078443143,"We reported that RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products), a multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed in myoblasts, when activated by its ligand amphoterin (HMGB1), stimulates rat L6 myoblast differentiation via a Cdc42-Rac-MKK6-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and that RAGE expression in skeletal muscle tissue is developmentally regulated. We show here that inhibition of RAGE function via overexpression of a signaling deficient RAGE mutant (RAGEÎcyto) results in increased myoblast proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, and decreased apoptosis and adhesiveness, whereas myoblasts overexpressing RAGE behave the opposite, compared with mocktransfected myoblasts.

Neutralization of culture medium amphoterin negates effects of RAGE activation, suggesting that amphoterin is the RAGE ligand involved in RAGE-dependent effects in myoblasts. Finally, mice injected with L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts develop tumors as opposed to mice injected with L6/RAGE or L6/mock myoblasts that do not.

Myogenesis is a multistep process in which the precursors of myofibers, the myoblasts, first proliferate and then differentiate into fusioncompetent cells that finally fuse with each other to form myotubes (1Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 2Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). A similar process occurs in mature skeletal muscles in case of damage; quiescent, mononucleated cells, the satellite cells, that coexist with myofibers, can be activated by a number of extracellular factors to proliferate and then to differentiate as above to repair the damaged myofibers (3Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). In both cases, proliferation and differentiation are separate and mutually exclusive events that must occur sequentially in that order. Proliferation arrest is one critical step in the process of embryonic myogenesis and muscle regeneration/repair (3Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Either excessive or defective myoblast and satellite cell proliferation can result in altered skeletal muscle formation because myoblasts cannot activate promyogenic signaling pathways in the former case, and because of the low density and insufficient cell-cell contacts that hamper myoblast fusion into myotubes in the second case. Thus, embryonic myogenesis and the closely related muscle regeneration appear to be the net result of the action of a cohort of factors that balance each others activities in a timely and highly coordinated manner so as to assure a sized extent of muscle tissue formation. These factors will assure an appropriate extent of myoblast and satellite cell proliferation at sites of skeletal muscle formation during embryogenesis and in damaged muscles, respectively, and/or will trigger the myogenic differentiation program in proliferation-arrested myoblasts and satellite cells. Thus, some of these factors stimulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation (e.g. insulin and insulin-like growth factors and their receptors), other factors promote myoblast fusion into myotubes (e.g. BOC, CDO, neogenin and its ligand, netrin), whereas other factors inhibit myoblast proliferation and differentiation (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-Î±, transforming growth factor-Î², and myostatin), and still other factors (e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and, as recently shown, S100B) stimulate myoblast proliferation and/or modulate myoblast differentiation (3Charge S.B.

Riuzzi F. Arcuri C. Giambanco I. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). RAGE is a multiligand receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily that has been implicated in the regulation of several activities/processes such as protection of neurons against stress and stress-induced neuronal death depending on the nature of the ligand and the duration and intensity of its activation, the inflammatory response, tumorigenesis and, as mentioned above, myoblast terminal differentiation (16Sorci G.

Amphoterin (HMGB1), a low molecular weight protein with both intracellular and extracellular regulatory activities (18Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), is one established RAGE ligand that is normally found in serum and extracellular fluids (17Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D.

Besides stimulating myogenesis in vitro via RAGE activation, amphoterin has been shown to promote skeletal muscle repair when administered to dystrophic mice, via stimulation of measoangioblast homing into the diseased muscle tissue (20Palumbo R. Sampaolesi M. De Marchis F. Tonlorenzi R. Colombetti S. Mondino A. Cossu G. Bianchi M.E. J.

Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of RAGE in L6 myoblasts resulted in a significant extent of myoblast differentiation and fusion into myotube even in growth medium (GM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) and in an acceleration of differentiation of myoblasts in differentiation medium (DM, 2% FBS), whereas overexpression of a RAGE mutant lacking the cytoplasmic and transducing domain (RAGEÎcyto) resulted in a reduced tendency of myoblasts in DM to differentiate, compared with wild type and mock-transfected myoblasts (16Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Arcuri C. Giambanco I. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Overall, the activation of the MKK6-p38 MAPK signaling pathway for the amphoterin/RAGE pair to promote myoblast differentiation is in line with the notion that p38 MAPK needs to be activated for terminal differentiation to take place (21Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 22Li Y. Jiang B. Ensign W.Y. Vogt P.K. Han J. Cell.

Specifically, the amphoterin/RAGE pair might be one trigger of the signaling cascade leading to p38 MAPK activation in differentiating myoblasts. In the present study we addressed the question whether RAGE engagement in myoblasts and the resulting p38 MAPK activation might determine changes in myoblast proliferation as well as other processes such as apoptosis, adhesiveness, migration, and invasiveness, which characterize myoblast terminal differentiation and fusion into myotubes (3Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). We show here that RAGE activation and signaling in myoblasts result in reduced proliferation, migration, invasiveness, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 2 activity, and increased apoptosis and adhesiveness, and that these effects rely on amphoterin/RAGE-dependent activation of p38 MAPK. We also show that inoculation into immunocompromised mice of myoblasts overexpressing a signaling-deficient RAGE mutant, but not mock-transfected myoblasts or myoblasts overexpressing full-length RAGE results in tumor formation. Cell Culture Conditions, [3H]Thymidine Incorporation, Transfections, and Apoptosis and Luciferase AssaysâRat L6 myoblasts (clone L6C31) were cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, in a H2O-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 Â°C before decreasing FBS to 2% to induce myoblast differentiation. L6 myoblast clones stably overexpressing RAGE or RAGEÎcyto were selected and characterized as described (15Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Riuzzi F. Marchetti C. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4870-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using mock-transfected, L6/RAGE and L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts in 10 or 2% FBS as indicated in the legends to figures. The anti-amphoterin antibody (BD Pharmingen) used in some experiments was shown to neutralize culture medium amphoterin (16Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Arcuri C. Giambanco I. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, myoblasts (25 Ã 103 cells/well) were cultivated in 10% FBS for 24 h in 24-multiwell plates, washed with DMEM, serum-starved for 24 h, washed with DMEM, and cultivated in DMEM in the presence of either 10 or 2% FBS for another 24 h in the presence of 1 Î¼Ci of [3H]thymidine/ml. Parallel myoblasts treated in the same manner in the absence of [3H]thymidine were incubated with HOECHST 33258 (bisbenzimidazole) as described (25Rao J. Otto W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) to normalize incorporated [3H]thymidine to DNA content. For cell number measurements, myoblasts were cultivated in 10% FBS for 24 h in 96-multiwell plates at a density of 4 Ã 103 cells/well and then in DMEM in the presence of either 10 or 2% FBS for 1-7 days. Cell density was measured by a tetrazolium-based (MTT) colorimetric assay. To analyze the cell cycle and measure apoptosis, myoblasts were seeded onto 35-mm plastic dishes (18 Ã 104 cells/dish) in 10% FBS for 24 h, washed with DMEM, and cultivated for 24 or 48 h in DMEM in the presence of either 10 or 2% FBS. Cells were stained with propidium iodide in hypotonic buffer and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis as described (26Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). This procedure allows the determination of the percentage of apoptotic (hypodiploid) nuclei as well as that of normal (diploid) nuclei in the same cell population irrespective of the cell volume. In experiments performed in the presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (Calbiochem) (2 Î¼m, final concentration), control cells received an equal volume of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide). FACS analysis was also employed to measure the mean cell volume as described (27Ahmadzadeh M. Hussain S.F. Faber D.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3053-3063PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, myoblasts cultured in 10% FBS without antibiotics were transfected with the reporter gene p21Waf1-luc, reporter gene cyclin D1-luc, or empty vector. After 6 h, cells were cultivated in 10 or 2% FBS, as indicated in the figure legends. After another 24 h cells were harvested to measure luciferase activity. p21Waf1 and cyclin D1 promoter transcriptional activities were normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting cells with a cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein. The percentage of green fluorescent protein-positive cells (20 to 25%) was determined by FACS analysis. Western Blot AnalysesâTo detect phosphorylated and total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, phosphorylated and total c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK), phosphorylated and total retinoblastoma suppressor protein Rb, tubulin, caspase-3, Bcl-2, integrin Î²1, VCAM, NCAM, and caveolin-3 in myoblast extracts by Western blotting, myoblasts were cultivated as detailed in the legend of pertinent figures, washed twice with PBS, and solubilized with 2.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm tosylsulfonyl polyclonal chloromethyl ketone protease inhibitor (Roche). The following antibodies were used: polyclonal antibody specific to phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204) ERK1/2 (1:1,000, New England BioLabs), polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:5,000, Sigma), polyclonal anti-phosphorylated (Ser807/Ser811) Rb antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-Rb antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal anti-Î±-tubulin antibody (1:10,000; Sigma), polyclonal anticaspase-3 antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody (1:1,000; BD Pharmingen), monoclonal anti-integrin Î²1 antibody (1:2,000; BD Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-VCAM antibody (1:2,000; BD Pharmingen), monoclonal anti-NCAM antibody (1:2,000; Sigma), and monoclonal anti-caveolin-3 antibody (1:2,000; BD Transduction Laboratories). The immune reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). Adhesion, Migration, and Invasiveness Assays, and F-actin StainingâFor adhesion experiments, mock-transfected, L6/RAGE, and L6/RAGEÎ cyto myoblasts (50 Ã 103 cells in 0.1 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS) were seeded into each well, incubated for 3 h, and further processed as described (28Tietze L. Borntraeger J. Klosterhalfen B. Amo-Takyi B. Handt S. Gunther K. Merkelbach-Bruse S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 66: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Aumailley M. Mann K. von der Mark H. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The supernatant with non-adherent cells was removed by two washes with warmed culture medium. Attached cells were fixed with 30% methanol/ethanol for 15 min at room temperature, stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) in PBS, extensively washed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature. The dye was resuspended with 50 Î¼l of 0.2% Triton X-100/well, and color yield was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 590 nm. For migration assay, we used Boyden chambers (pore size, 8 Î¼m) (BD Biosciences). Individual myoblast clones (5 Ã 104 cells in 0.5 ml of DMEM) were placed in the upper chamber, and 0.75 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber. After 20 h in culture, cells on the upper side of the filters were removed with cottontipped swabs, and the filters were fixed in methanol for 2 min and stained with 0.05% crystal violet in PBS for 15 min. Cells on the underside of the filters were viewed and counted under a microscope. Each clone was plated in triplicate in each experiment. For the invasiveness assay, conditions were as described for migration assay except that biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers (pore size, 8 Î¼m) (BD Biosciences) were used. For F-actin staining, myoblasts were seeded onto 13-mm glass coverslips in plastic multiwell dishes (7.5 Ã 104 cells/dish) in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h and washed in PBS. Cells were then fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, extensively washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min, washed again, and incubated with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) (1:250 in PBS) for 1 h in a humid chamber at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the cells were mounted in 80% glycerol, containing 0.02% NaN3 and p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml) in PBS to prevent fluorescence fading and viewed on a Leica DM Rb fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera. Gelatin ZymographyâMock-transfected, L6/RAGE, and L6/RAGEÎ cyto myoblasts were cultivated in a 150-cm2 flask in DMEM containing 10% FBS, after which the supernatant was collected, centrifuged to remove detached cells, and concentrated. The protein concentration of the supernatants was determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay system with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were stored at -70 Â°C until use. Aliquots (10 Î¼g of total protein per sample) were electrophoresed at constant voltage on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 2 mg/ml of gelatin. The gels was rinsed three times for 15 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS and renature the proteins and then incubated in MMP activation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 5 mm CaCl2) for 24 h at 37 Â°C with constant shaking. Gels were stained overnight in 0.5% Coomassie Blue R-250 and destained for 1 h in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Proteinase activity was quantified by densitometric scanning. In Vivo Tumor GrowthâFor tumor growth in vivo, female (NOD/SCID) mice weighing â¼ 20 g were inoculated subcutaneously with 5 Ã 106 L6/wt, L6/RAGEÎcyto, or L6/RAGE myoblasts and monitored for â¼3.5 months. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Consent was obtained by the Ethics Committee of the University of Perugia. Tumor masses were excised and weighed, and tumor volume was calculated by the equation: tumor volume = x2y/2, where x and y correspond to the width and thickness of the tissue, respectively. Tumors were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (2 days at 4 Â°C), extensively washed in PBS, and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and histopathology was performed by an independent pathologist. Statistical AnalysisâThe data were subjected to analysis of variance with SNK post-hoc analysis using a statistical software package (GraphPad Prism version 4.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was assumed when p < 0.05. RAGE Activation in Myoblasts Reduces Proliferation and Stimulates Apoptosis: Role of Amphoterin and p38 MAPKâL6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts incorporated more [3H]thymidine and L6/RAGE myoblasts incorporated less [3H]thymidine than did L6/mock myoblasts in both GM and DM (Fig. 1A). By MTT assay, a larger number of L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts and a smaller number of L6/RAGE myoblasts were obtained at any day of cultivation in both GM (Fig. 1B) and DM (Fig. 1C) between days 1 and 7, compared with L6/mock myoblasts. Moreover, after 1 and 2 days of cultivation in both GM (Fig. 1D) and DM (Fig. 1E) by FACS analysis a larger fraction of L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts and a smaller fraction of L6/RAGE myoblasts were in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (with a low percentage of L6/RAGE myoblasts in G2/M phase at 48 h, pointing to the inability of these cells to complete cell division), and a smaller fraction of L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts and a larger fraction of L6/RAGE myoblasts were in the G0/G1 phase, compared with L6/mock myoblasts. Collectively, these data suggested that RAGE might transduce an antiproliferative signal in myoblasts. Neutralization of culture medium amphoterin with an anti-amphoterin antibody (16Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Arcuri C. Giambanco I. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) resulted in an increased [3H]thymidine incorporation by L6/RAGE and L6/mock myoblasts compared with their respective controls, and no effects in the case of L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts (Fig. 1A). Notably, on administration of anti-amphoterin antibody the levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation were similar in the three L6 clones under study. Neutralization of the culture medium amphoterin with an anti-amphoterin antibody also reduced the fractions of L6/mock and L6/RAGE myoblasts in the G0/G1 phase and increased those in S and G2/M phases, whereas without an effect on L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts (Fig. 1F). Thus, amphoterin appeared to exert a regulatory role on myoblast proliferation, promoting proliferation arrest via RAGE engagement and stimulation of RAGE transducing activity. This effect of amphoterin would add to the reported promyogenic activity of the protein via activation of a RAGE-Cdc42-Rac-MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway (16Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Arcuri C. Giambanco I. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to reduced proliferation, L6/RAGE myoblasts exhibited a larger extent of apoptosis than did L6/mock myoblasts which in turn showed a larger extent of apoptosis than did L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts in both GM and DM, with larger percentages in DM than in GM as expected, after 1 day of cultivation (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained after 2 days of cultivation (Fig. 2A). Also, neutralization of culture medium amphoterin reduced apoptosis in both L6/mock and L6/RAGE myoblasts, whereas without effect in the case of L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts (Fig. 2B), suggesting that amphoterin was the RAGE ligand involved in RAGE-dependent stimulation of myoblast apoptosis. RAGE-dependent activation of p38 MAPK (16Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Arcuri C. Giambanco I. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was responsible for RAGE-mediated effects on myoblast proliferation and apoptosis. In fact, treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, reduced the fraction of L6/RAGE and L6/mock myoblasts in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and decreased the fraction of these cells in the G0/G1 phase, without affecting L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts (Fig. 2C), and decreased apoptosis in L6/RAGE, L6/RAGEÎcyto, and L6/mock myoblasts (Fig. 2D), probably because of lack of inhibition of Raf activity under these conditions (30Lee J. Hong F. Kwon S. Kim S.S. Kim D.O. Kang H.S. Lee S.J. Ha J. Kim S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RAGE-dependent regulation of myoblast apoptosis was further investigated by analyzing the levels of activated caspase-3 and the antiapoptotic factor, Bcl-2. We found that L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts in GM and DM exhibited a smaller extent and L6/RAGE myoblasts exhibited a larger extent of caspase-3 activation, compared with L6/mock myoblasts (Fig. 2E). Also, L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts exhibited higher levels and L6/RAGE myoblasts exhibited lower levels of Bcl-2, compared with L6/mock myoblasts (Fig. 2E), suggesting that RAGE signaling might negatively regulate Bcl-2 expression in myoblasts. Collectively, these data suggested that, besides promoting myoblast differentiation (16Sorci G. Riuzzi F. Arcuri C. Giambanco I. Donato R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4880-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), RAGE activation by amphoterin might cause proliferation arrest and promote apoptosis in myoblasts via stimulation of p38 MAPK. RAGE Activation in Myoblasts Increases p21Waf1 Induction and Reduces Cyclin D1 Induction and Rb PhosphorylationâBecause increased levels of the proliferation inhibitor p21Waf1 and decreased levels of cyclin D1 and extents of Rb phosphorylation accompany myoblast proliferation arrest and differentiation (24Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 31Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we next analyzed the role of the amphoterin/RAGE pair in p21Waf1 and cyclin D1 induction and extent of Rb phosphorylation. In both GM and DM, L6/RAGEÎ cyto myoblasts exhibited a smaller induction of p21Waf1, a larger induction of cyclin D1, and higher levels of phosphorylated Rb, whereas the opposite was observed in L6/RAGE myoblasts, compared with L6/mock myoblasts (Fig. 3, A-C). Neutralization of culture medium amphoterin reduced the levels of p21Waf1 induction in L6/RAGE and L6/mock myoblasts to nearly those detected in L6/RAGEÎcyto myoblasts (Fig. 3A). Similarly, neutralization of culture medium amphoterin resulted in an increase in cyclin D1 induction (Fig. 3B) and the extent of Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 3D) in L6/RAGE and L6/mock myoblasts to the levels observed in L6/RAGEÎ cyto myoblasts. These data suggested that induction of p21Waf1 and cyclin D1 and the extent of Rb phosphorylation in myoblasts is under the control of the amphoterin/RAGE pair signaling. Thus, we concluded that the amphoterin/RAGE pair might transduce antiproliferative signals in myoblasts via up-regulation of p21Waf1 induction, down-regulation of cyclin D1 induction, and reduction of Rb phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W1980358069,"We have previously reported that group V secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) amplifies the action of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) Î± in regulating eicosanoid biosynthesis by mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with zymosan (Satake, Y., Diaz, B. L., Balestrieri, B., Lam, B. K., Kanaoka, Y., Grusby, M. J., and Arm, J. P. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 16488-16494). To further understand the role of group V sPLA2, we studied its localization in resting mouse peritoneal macrophages before and after stimulation with zymosan and the effect of deletion of the gene encoding group V sPLA2 on phagocytosis of zymosan. We report that group V sPLA2 is present in the Golgi apparatus and recycling endosome in the juxtanuclear region of resting peritoneal macrophages. Upon ingestion of zymosan by mouse peritoneal macrophages, group V sPLA2 is recruited to the phagosome. There it co-localizes with cPLA 2 Î±, 5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, and leukotriene C4 synthase. Using immunostaining for the cysteinyl leukotrienes in carbodiimide-fixed cells, we show, for the first time, that the phagosome is a site of cysteinyl leukotriene formation. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages from group V sPLA2-null mice demonstrated a >50% attenuation in phagocytosis of zymosan particles, which was restored by adenoviral expression of group V sPLA2 but IIA not group sPLA2. These data demonstrate that group V sPLA2 contributes to the innate immune response both through regulation of eicosanoid generation in response to a phagocytic stimulus and also as a component of the phagocytic machinery."

The binding of ubiquitin (Ub) and the ubiquitination of target proteins are also critical events in endocytosis, endosomal sorting, and endosome fusion (7Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

For instance, the activity of yeast Vps9p is regulated by Ub binding and covalent monoubiquitination of this protein, both of which depend on a C-terminal CUE1p homologous (CUE) domain (10Donaldson K.M.

On the basis of sequence homology, mammalian Rabex-5 was proposed to contain a domain analogous to CUE at its C terminus (10Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 258-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the Ub binding activity of this domain was not examined. Despite the critical requirement of the Rabaptin-5 interaction for Rabex-5 GEF activity and endosome fusion, the structural determinants responsible for this interaction have not been identified. Likewise, the possible interaction of Rabex-5 with Ub and its ubiquitination have not been studied. In this study, we identify two coiled-coils comprising residues 401-462 and 551-661 in Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5, respectively, as the elements that mediate the interaction between these two proteins. We also demonstrate that Rabex-5 undergoes ubiquitination and binds directly to Ub though not via its proposed CUE-like domain. Instead the N-terminal region of Rabex-5 (residues 1-76, comprising the A20-like ZnF domain and the adjacent Î±-helix) binds Ub in vitro and is also important for the in vivo ubiquitination of this protein. Importantly, we demonstrate that the A20-like ZnF domain displays Ub ligase (E3) activity. These observations identify the structural determinants responsible for the regulation of Rabex-5 by Rabaptin-5. Moreover, the demonstration that Rabex-5 is an Ub ligase (E3) that binds Ub and undergoes ubiquitination indicates that this key GEF in endosome fusion may be subject to regulation, not only by Rabaptin-5, but also through Ub-dependent interactions. pGAD and pGBT9 ConstructsâSacII-SpeI and NotI-SpeI fragments encoding full-length Rabex-5 excised from pGEM T-bovine Rabex-5 plasmid (Ref. 2LippeÌ R.

Coiled-coil Interactions Mediate the Assembly of Rabex-5 with Rabaptin-5âThe domain organization of Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5, used as the basis for mutational analyses, is shown in Fig. 1. The structural determinants of the Rabex-5-Rabaptin-5 interaction were analyzed using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results shown in Fig. 2A demonstrate that the Rabaptin-5 C2-1 coiled-coil domain (551-661 fragment) is the minimal fragment that binds to full-length Rabex-5. Interestingly, the GGA1-GAT domain interacts with the N-terminal region of a parallel coiled-coil Rabaptin-5-(551-661) homodimer, whereas residues in the central to C-terminal region of this fragment are involved in the stabilization of a Rabaptin-5-(551-661) tetramer (6Zhu G. Zhai P. He X. Wakeham N. Rodgers K. Li G. Tang J. Zhang X.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Given these facts, we analyzed a series of Rabaptin-5-(551-661) mutants to determine whether the same residues that are involved in the binding to GGA1-GAT and/or in the stabilization of the Rabaptin-5-(551-661) tetramer also play a role in the assembly with Rabex-5. The substitutions introduced in Rabaptin-5-(551-661) included Q561A, L564A, Q566A (residues contacting GGA1-GAT) as well as L610A/L613A, L610W/L613W, and L617A (residues that presumably stabilize the homotetramer) (6Zhu G. Zhai P. He X. Wakeham N. Rodgers K. Li G. Tang J. Zhang X.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2B show that although the Rabaptin-5-(551-661) mutants Q561A and L564A are indeed unable to bind GGA1-GAT, they interact with Rabex-5 in a manner similar to that of the wild-type construct. In contrast, the Rabaptin-5-(551-661) L610W/L613W mutant exhibited severely reduced interaction with Rabex-5, whereas the L610A/L613A mutant showed a partial decrease and the L617A mutant displayed a normal interaction (Fig. 2B). Removal of a relatively mobile region at the C terminus of Rabaptin-5-(551-661) (6Zhu G. Zhai P. He X. Wakeham N. Rodgers K. Li G. Tang J. Zhang X.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), generating the Rabaptin-5-(551-643) and Rabaptin-5-(551-648) fragments, did not affect the interaction with Rabex-5 (Fig. 2B). Finally, we also analyzed the Rabex-5 domains that are responsible for the interaction with Rabaptin-5-(551-661). The different Rabex-5 constructs used in this analysis, and also elsewhere in this study, are schematized in Fig. 1A. We found that the Rabex-5 coiled-coil (fragment 401-462) is both necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Rabaptin-5 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results identify the 401-462 and 551-661 coiled-coils in Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5, respectively, as the regions that drive the formation of the Rabex-5Â·Rabaptin-5 complex. Rabex-5 Interacts with Ubiquitin Independently of Its Putative CUE DomainâWe recently reported the binding of GGA1, Rabaptin-5, and Rabex-5 from a cell extract to Ub-agarose (13Mattera R.

Because GGA1 directly binds Ub via its GAT domain (13Mattera R. Puertollano R. Smith W.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol.

Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the interaction of the Rabex-5Â·Rabaptin-5 complex with Ub could be direct or indirect. The nature of these interactions was analyzed with the yeast two-hybrid system. The analysis showed that Rabaptin-5 does not interact with Ub, whereas Rabex-5 does so with an avidity that is intermediate between those of the VHS+GAT constructs of GGA1 and GGA3 (Fig. 3A). Recent reports indicate that Vps9p, the yeast ortholog of Rabex-5, binds Ub through its C-terminal Cue1p-homologous (CUE) domain, a tri-helical region that is structurally related to the Ub-associated domain (UBA) (10Donaldson K.M.

Substitution of residues in two sequences that are conserved in other CUE domains, MFP and LL corresponding to residues 419-421 and 446-447 in Vps9p, significantly reduced the interaction of this protein with Ub (10Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 258-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H.

Cell. 2003; 113: 609-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment revealed a weak similarity between the Vps9p CUE domain and the corresponding C-terminal region in Rabex-5 where the MFP and LL sequences are replaced by KYP and PL (residues 456-458 and 484-485, respectively) (10Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 258-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, replacement of Rabex-5 Tyr457, the residue equivalent to the critical Phe420 in Vps9p, had no effect on the yeast two-hybrid interaction with Ub (Fig. 3B), suggesting a mode of Ub recognition unrelated to the putative CUE region of Rabex-5. This conclusion was also supported by the lack of interaction between Ub and Rabex-5-(401-492), a construct that contains the region with weak similarity to the Vps9p CUE domain (Fig. 3B). Given that Rabex-5 did not interact with Ub through its putative CUE domain, we prepared a set of Rabex-5 constructs to identify the region involved in this interaction (see Fig. 1A for scheme of constructs). The results of the initial analysis showed that the fragments 1-399 and 1-460 exhibited an interaction similar to and significantly higher than, respectively, full-length Rabex-5 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that residues in the coiled-coil region (included in the 1-460 fragment) augmented and in the C-terminal proline-rich domain (included in the full-length construct) diminished the interaction of Rabex-5 with Ub. Additional constructs showed that the Rabex-5 coiled-coil region (construct 401-462) was not sufficient for the interaction with Ub, and that other internal sequences (125-460, 258-460, and 401-492) were also ineffective per se (Fig. 3B). A possible interpretation of these results is that both the N-terminal (residues 1-124) and the coiled-coil regions of Rabex-5 are necessary for the interaction with Ub detected in the yeast two-hybrid system. This hypothesis was tested by generating and assaying internal deletion constructs (Fig. 3C). The results of this analysis showed that a minimal construct containing both the N-terminal 1-76 fragment (including the ZnF domain and residues immediately downstream) and the coiled-coil region (Rabex-5-(1-76^400-460) in Fig. 3C) displayed an interaction with Ub similar to that of Rabex-5-(1-460). Other internal deletion constructs including most of the Vps9 domain or both the HB and the Vps9 domains in addition to the N-terminal 1-76 fragment and the coiled-coil (Rabex-5-(1-76^251-460) and -(1-76^126-460), respectively in Fig. 3C) did not display stronger interactions with Ub when compared with the 1-76^400-460 fragment. Yeast Two-hybrid Analyses Indicate That Rabex-5 Interactions with Ubiquitin Involve Both Non-covalent Binding and Covalent ModificationâIt has been recently reported that one of the ZnF domains present in the C-terminal region of A20, an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor signaling, displays Ub ligase (E3) activity and catalyzes Lys48-linked polyubiquitination (23Wertz I.E.

To dissect these two protective mechanisms, hsp70 deletion mutants lacking either the chaperone function (hsp70-ÎEEVD) or ATPase function (hsp70-ÎATPase) were selectively overexpressed before exposing cells to a metabolic inhibitor, an insult sufficient to cause mitochondrial AIF release, nuclear AIF accumulation, and apoptosis. Compared with empty vector, overexpression of wild type human hsp70 inhibited bax activation and reduced mitochondrial AIF release after injury. In contrast, mutants lacking either the chaperone function (hsp70-ÎEEVD) or the ATP hydrolytic domain (hsp70-ÎATPase) failed to prevent mitochondrial AIF release. Although hsp70-ÎEEVD did not inhibit bax activation or mitochondrial membrane injury after cell stress, this hsp70 mutant co-immunoprecipitated with leaked AIF in injured cells and decreased nuclear AIF accumulation. In contrast, hsp70-ÎATPase did not interact with AIF either in intact cells or in a cell-free system and furthermore, failed to prevent nuclear AIF accumulation. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial protection against bax-mediated injury requires both intact chaperone and ATPase functions, whereas the ATPase domain is critical for sequestering AIF in the cytosol.

In contrast, mutants lacking either the chaperone function (hsp70-ÎEEVD) or the ATP hydrolytic domain (hsp70-ÎATPase) failed to prevent mitochondrial AIF release. Although hsp70-ÎEEVD did not inhibit bax activation or mitochondrial membrane injury after cell stress, this hsp70 mutant co-immunoprecipitated with leaked AIF in injured cells and decreased nuclear AIF accumulation. In contrast, hsp70-ÎATPase did not interact with AIF either in intact cells or in a cell-free system and furthermore, failed to prevent nuclear AIF accumulation. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial protection against bax-mediated injury requires both intact chaperone and ATPase functions, whereas the ATPase domain is critical for sequestering AIF in the cytosol. Disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane releases toxic proteins, including cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) 3The abbreviations used are: AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AdV, adenovirus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. that activate caspase-dependent and -independent pathways responsible for apoptotic cell death. In a prior study in our laboratory, neither a pancaspase inhibitor nor a specific caspase 3 inhibitor completely prevented apoptosis in renal cells exposed to metabolic inhibitors (1Wang Y.

Oltvai Z.N. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 327-332PubMed Google Scholar). The present study examines the hypothesis that two distinct hsp70 domains (each with independent functions) inhibit nuclear accumulation of AIF. Both the hsp70 protein refolding and ATPase domains are required to prevent bax activation and mitochondrial AIF release. In contrast, deletion of the ATPase domain disrupts hsp70-AIF interaction and permits leaked AIF to accumulate in nuclei. These results show that hsp70 exerts domain-specific effects that collectively antagonize AIF-mediated injury and identify potential therapeutic targets in the apoptotic pathway. MaterialsâAll reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cell CultureâProximal tubule opossum kidney (OK) cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1840) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum.

Overexpression of Inducible hsp70 (hsp72kDa) and baxâWild type or well characterized hsp70 deletion mutants were individually overexpressed (Fig. 1).

Infection efficiency was >90â99% as determined by direct visualization of GFP in cells infected with increasing doses of adenovirus with an m.o.i. that varied between 40 and 100. Cells were co-infected with hsp70-containing adenovirus for 24 h at 37 Â°C followed by removal of the virus and a 24-h recovery period.

Cells were exposed to an equivalent m.o.i. of adenovirus containing empty vector or human bax plus Cre for 16 h at 37 Â°C. The viruses were then removed, and the cells were permitted to incubate for an additional 24 h. In preliminary studies, this maneuver increased steady state bax content as assessed by immunoblot analysis and caused morphologic evidence of apoptosis. Immunoblot Analysis and Co-ImmunoprecipitationâCells grown in 60-mm2 dishes were harvested using a rubber policeman and then resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing the 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors (as described above), and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.40; Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Commercially available antibodies were used to detect hsp72 (1:1000 dilution, catalog number SPA-810 StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria BC, Canada), hsp70-ATPase (Stressgen, catalog number SPA-811; 1:1000 dilution), apoptosis-inducing factor (1:250 dilution, Santa Cruz catalog number sc-13116), activated bax (6A7; 1:1,000 dilution; Trevingen, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD, catalog number 2281-MC-100), total bax (5B7; 1:500 dilution; BioSciences/Pharmingen, catalog number 556467), Î²-actin (1:750 dilution, Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA, catalog number ab6276-100), bag-1 (Santa Cruz, catalog number sc-8348) as well as hip and hop (both supplied by Vladimir Gabai). Specific protein bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-based enzyme-linked chemiluminescence system (Lumigolow, Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). After digitizing the immunoblot image (Hewlett-Packard, Desk Scan II), band densities were quantified using NIH ImageQuant Software. To assess AIF-hsp70 interaction in the cytosol, immunoprecipitation was performed in digitonin-treated samples using a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against AIF (Exalpha Biologicals, Watertown, MA, catalog number X1108P; 2 Î¼g/mg protein/ml of immunoprecipitation buffer) as recently described by our laboratory for cytochrome c (7Li F.

Apyrase (10 units/ml), a compound that causes ATP hydrolysis, was used to prevent the ATP-mediated release of AIF from hsp70 (1Wang Y. Knowlton A.A. Christensen T.G. Shih T. Borkan S.C. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2224-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein interaction was assessed by probing the membranes with monoclonal antibodies directed against the inducible member of the hsp70 family (hsp72kDa; StressGen) and AIF (Santa Cruz, catalog number sc-13116). To validate direct assessment of active bax by immunoblot analysis, bax was also immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using the 6A7 antibody specific for active bax under non-denaturing conditions in the presence of 2% CHAPS as previously described (23Stankiewicz A.R.

After SDS-PAGE and transfer, total bax content was assessed using the 5B7 antibody as described above. To minimize basal activation of bax, cells were incubated for 14 h in 2% fetal bovine serum before exposure to metabolic inhibitors. Nuclear IsolationâIntact nuclei were separated from ânon-nuclearâ cell components (cytosol, other organelles, and membrane fragments) using a commercial kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA; catalog number K266-100) as previously reported by our laboratory (48Price V.R. Reed C.A. Lieberthal W. Schwartz J.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1152-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Adequacy of the nuclear purification was assessed by measuring the content of fibrillarin, a nucleolar protein (1:1000 dilution, Abcam catalog number ab4566; Cambridge, MA), and the non-nuclear protein tubulin (1:10,000 dilution, catalog number T6199) in representative samples using immunoblot analysis. Purified hsp7âhsp70 was purchased from StressGen (catalog number SPP755). Purified hsp70-ATPase (54Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was provided as a gift from Rick Morimoto (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Greater than 95% purity of both hsp70 proteins was confirmed by 10% SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Interaction between hsp70 and AIFâAIF was isolated from whole cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal rabbit anti-AIF antibody using a protocol recently described by our laboratory (20Mao H.

The bead-bound AIF was incubated with equimolar concentrations of purified hsp70 (10â75 ng; StressGen catalog number NSP-555) or purified hsp70-ÎATPase (5â37.5 ng) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.40, at 37 Â°C for 60 min with a total reaction volume of 90 Î¼l. The solution was washed 1 time with high stringency buffer (HS-B) (0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.0 mm sodium vanadate (pH 7.5)) under-layered with 1 m sucrose/HS-B, then washed once each with a high salt wash buffer (containing 1 m NaCl in HS-B) and a low salt wash buffer (containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.5) before separation on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

One of the key global redox regulators of the cell's metabolic physiology is the sensor kinase RegB that controls the synthesis of numerous energy generation and utilization processes. In this study, we have succeeded in purifying full-length RegB containing six transmembrane-spanning elements.

Mutation of the phenylalanine in this heptapeptide renders RegB constitutively active in vivo, indicating that this domain is responsible for sensing the redox state of the ubiquinone pool and subsequently controlling RegB autophosphorylation. Rhodobacter capsulatus is a purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium that exhibits remarkable metabolic diversity. Aerobically, R. capsulatus is capable of using an electron transport chain with oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor that drives the generation of a proton membrane potential (1Madigan M.T. Gest H. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 117: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If oxygen is not present, R. capsulatus can also perform anaerobic respiration by reducing other compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide (1Madigan M.T. Gest H. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 117: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to respiratory functions, R. capsulatus is capable of converting light energy to chemical energy via synthesis of a bacterial photosystem (1Madigan M.T. Gest H. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 117: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the photosystem is under redox control, such that it is only synthesized under oxygen limiting conditions. R. capsulatus also demonstrates redox control of additional components needed for cellular processes such as carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, and hydrogen utilization (2Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Elsen S. Dischert W. Colbeau A. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2831-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the redox-responding two-component signal transduction cascade, RegB/RegA, is responsible for the transcriptional control of all of the above components (4Elsen S. Swem L.R. Swem D.L. Bauer C.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Disruptive mutations in either the sensor kinase, RegB, or in the cognate response regulator, RegA, results in cells that are altered in their ability to respire, photosynthesize, and fix carbon and nitrogen (4Elsen S. Swem L.R. Swem D.L. Bauer C.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Nearly all of the metabolic events that are part of the RegB/RegA regulon affect cellular redox chemistry with most of these processes obtaining their reducing power from the ubiquinol pool. Carbon and nitrogen fixation are also very effective electron sinks that utilize large amounts of reducing power to drive their metabolic processes. Given that redox chemistry is a common thread to the majority of RegB/RegA-regulated processes, it has been proposed that RegB may interact with, and monitor, the redox state of a component of the electron transport chain. Specifically, ubiquinones and cytochrome cbb3 oxidase have been suggested components that may interact with RegB and modulate its kinase activity (4Elsen S. Swem L.R. Swem D.L. Bauer C.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 5Oh J.I. Ko I.J. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7915-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that RegB contains a redox active cysteine residue that when oxidized inhibits kinase activity (6Swem L.R. Kraft B.J. Swem D.L. Setterdahl A.T. Masuda S. Knaff D.B. Zaleski J.M. Bauer C.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Neither of these modes of regulation are mutually exclusive. For example, the widely studied global sensor kinase ArcB from Escherichia coli controls a number of cellular processes in response to changes in oxygen tension. It has been proposed that activity of ArcB is regulated by two redox active cysteines that form intermolecular disulfide bonds when oxidized by ubiquinone (7Malpica R. Franco B. Rodriguez C. Kwon O. Georgellis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13318-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Because the oxidation-reduction state of the ubiquinone pool fluctuates greatly based on oxygen tension, it has been proposed that an interaction of ArcB with the ubiquinone pool ultimately regulates the activity of this kinase (7Malpica R. Franco B. Rodriguez C. Kwon O. Georgellis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13318-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).Given that RegB is a membrane-bound sensor kinase, one can presume that it is in close contact with the ubiquinone pool and thus could potentially monitor the oxidation/reduction state of this membrane soluble electron carrier. In purple bacteria, the oxidation state of the ubiquinone pool is known to dramatically fluctuate, becoming predominantly oxidized under aerobic respiratory growth and predominantly reduced under anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions (9Parson W. Clayton R.K. Sistrom W.R. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 455-469Google Scholar). Given that purple bacteria have a large ubiquinone pool (10Bolton J.R. Clayton R.K. Sistrom W.R. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 419-429Google Scholar) that undergoes significant changes in redox potential (9Parson W. Clayton R.K. Sistrom W.R. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 455-469Google Scholar), it is apparent that this molecule would be an excellent indicator of changes in environmental oxygen tension.In this study, we describe the isolation and biochemical characterization of a full-length membrane-spanning version of RegB. We provide in vitro evidence that oxidized ubiquinone is a potent inhibitor of RegB. A ubiquinone-binding site was identified by performing photo affinity cross-linking with a ubiquinone analog that binds to a universally conserved heptapeptide sequence GGXXNPF in the membrane-spanning input domain of RegB. Mutational analysis of this heptapeptide sequence results in dramatic derepression of RegB autophosphorylation in vivo, resulting in elevated expression of photosynthesis genes even in the presence of oxygen.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrain, Media and Growth ConditionsâR. capsulatus strain, SB1003 was used as the parent strain for all of the mutants generated for this study. All of the R. capsulatus strains were grown at 34 Â°C in either RCV or PY, with spectinomycin and gentamycin concentrations of 10 and 1.5 Î¼g/ml, respectively. E. coli strain DH5Î± was grown at 37 Â°C in Luria broth for all cloning procedures, and strain BL21 (Î»de3) was grown in Terrific broth for protein overexpression, with kanamycin, spectinomycin, and ampicillin concentrations of 50, 50, and 150 Î¼g/ml, respectively.Plasmid ConstructionâAn expression plasmid for full-length RegB was constructed by PCR of the regB gene using primers; RegBFullNcoI (5â²-TACCATGGTGAGGGCTGTCGACC) and RegBFullXhoI (5â²-ATCTCGAGGGCGGTGATCGGAACATTC) with genomic template DNA obtained from wild type cells. The PCR product was cloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET28.A chromosomal in-frame deletion of regB was constructed by first PCR amplifying the entire regB gene plus 500 bp upstream and downstream of the regB open reading frame using primers RegBdbSacF (5â²-TAGAGCTCCATCAGATCGGTGAATTC) and RegBdbXbaR (5â²-TATCTAGACCGCATCAGATCCAGTTC). The amplified fragment was cloned into pCRScript SK+ (Stratagene) forming plasmid pCRScriptRegB+ and sequenced to ensure correct amplification. Plasmid pCRScriptRegB+ was then used as a PCR template for construction of the in-frame deletion of regB and as a template to generate regB point mutations.The in-frame regB deletion was constructed by PCR amplifying 500-bp segments of DNA flanking the regB gene using primers RegBdbSacF (5â²-TAGAGCTCCATCAGATCGGTGAATTC) and RegBdelUp (5â²-ATGATATCCATATCTGCCATCGTCG) for the upstream region and RegBdbXbaR (5â²-TATCTAGACCGCATCAGATCCAGTTC) and RegBdelDown (5â²-ATGATATCGCCTGATGATCACAATCG) for the downstream region with plasmid pCRScriptRegB+ as a template. EcoRV sites were engineered into the RegBdelUP and RegBdelDown primers, such that when the two PCR products were ligated together they generated an in-frame deletion of regB that extended from the first to last codon of RegB. The deletion product was then cloned into the corresponding sites of the suicide vector pZJD29a. 2Z. Jiang and C. Bauer, unpublished data. Single recombinants were first selected by gentamycin resistance followed by plating on PY plates containing 5% sucrose to select for double recombinant cells that had lost the suicide vector.Point mutations in the ubiquinone-binding domain of RegB were generated using a PCR technique as described previously (11Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). The N110A mutation was generating using primer N-AForsew (5â²-GCTGAACGCCCCCTTCGCGC) and a reverse complement of this primer, N-ARevsew. The F112A mutation was generated using primer F-AForsew (5â²-AACCCCGCCGCGCTTTTGATC) and a reverse complement of this primer, F-ARevsew. The mutant PCR products were then cloned into the suicide vector, pZJD1, using primer encoded XbaI, SacI restriction sites. 2Z. Jiang and C. Bauer, unpublished data. The clones were transformed into SM10 Î»pir and sequenced to ensure the presence of the mutation and absence of secondary mutations in regB. These mutant plasmids were then conjugated into the regB deletion strain with single recombinants selected by spectinomycin resistance. A control strain that recombined a wild type copy of regB into the regB deletion strain was also generated using the same technique.Purification of Full-length RegBâThe cell cultures were grown at 37 Â°C in Terrific broth with moderate shaking until they reached an A600 of 0.4-0.6, at which time isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 75 Î¼m. Protein overexpression proceeded for 4 h at 37 Â°C before the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl until no visible debris remained. The cells were lysed by two passages through the M-110L Micro Fluidizer Processor at 2000 p.s.i. (Microfluidics) with the cell lysate clarified by centrifugation at 11,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 Ã g for 1 h at 4 Â°C to pellet inner membranes that contained full-length RegB as based on Western blot analysis (data not shown). The inner membrane pellet was solubilized by addition of 2 ml of solubilization buffer composed of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 1% n-dodecyl Î²-d-maltoside/liter of lysed E. coli cells. The membrane solubilization solution was shaken in a 50-ml conical tube attached to an orbital shaker rotating at 100 rpm for 1 h at 24Â°C. The solubilized membranes were then centrifuged at 150,000 Ã g for 1 h at 4Â°C to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant containing full-length RegB was then diluted 20-fold in wash buffer comprised of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and allowed to incubate with 1 ml of settled charged nickel resin (Novagen) for 1 h at room temperature shaking at 40 rpm on an orbital shaker. The nickel resin was then pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the resin was applied to a disposable column and washed with 50 column volumes of wash buffer comprised of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol at 24 Â°C. When purifying full-length RegB for use with azido-Q 3The abbreviations used are: azido-Q, azidoquinone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TM, transmembrane domain; PAS, Per Arnt Sim. binding experiments, the wash buffer step was modified by the addition of a second wash step of 50 column volumes of wash buffer containing 1% sodium cholate to remove and replace protein-bound n-dodecyl Î²-d-maltoside that interferes with azido-Q binding. Full-length RegB was then eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer comprised of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol at 24 Â°C with 1-ml fractions collected and analyzed for protein content using the Bio-Rad assay. Fractions containing protein were separated by SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of RegB. Appropriate fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol at 4 Â°C and then stored at -20 Â°C until the kinase assays were completed.Kinase AssaysâThe kinase assays were completed as described by Bird et al. (12Bird T.H. Du S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16343-16348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For ubiquinone addition experiments, benzoquinone (Sigma catalog number D9150) or coenzyme Q1 (Sigma catalog number C7956) was solubilized in 95% ethanol at a concentration of 167 Î¼m and added to replicate kinase with one assay containing only the solvent (<1% ethanol) and the other reaction containing solvent plus either benzoquinone or coenzyme Q1. In cases where ubiquinone was reduced to ubiquinol, 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the ubiquinone prior to addition to the kinase assays.Affinity Binding of [3H]AzidoquinoneâTritium-labeled azidoquinone ([3H]azido-Q) was synthesized as described previously (13Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity cross-linking of [3H]azido-Q to sodium cholate-purified full-length RegB was performed by mixing 42 mm of [3H]azido-Q that was solubilized in 95% ethanol with 42 Î¼m of full-length RegB in a buffer comprised of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 30% glycerol. The final concentration of ethanol in the mixture was kept lower than 5% to prevent denaturation of the protein. After incubation for 60 min at 4 Â°C in the dark, the protein and [3H]azido-Q was placed in a 2-mm light path quartz cuvette and exposed to long wavelength UV light (Spectro-line EN-14, 365-nm-long wavelength, 23 watts) at 0 Â°C for 20 min at a distance of 4 cm from the light source. Unbound [3H]azido-Q was then separated from UV cross-linked [3H]azido-Q-RegB by paper chromatography using chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) as a solvent system. [3H]azido-Q-RegB remained at the paper origin, whereas unbound [3H]azido-Q migrated at the solvent front. Chromatographically purified [3H]azido-Q-RegB was then solubilized from the paper matrix by the addition of elution buffer comprised of 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS, 1 m urea and then subjected to protease K digestion at 37 Â°C for 6 h using a protease K:RegB ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The protease K-digested sample was then subjected to HPLC separation on a Supelcosilâ¢ LC-308 (C8, 5-Î¼m particles, 300-AÌ pores, 4.6-mm inner diameter, 25-cm length) using a gradient formed from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with 0.4-ml fractions collected. The fractions recovered from the HPLC chromatograms were analyzed for peptide patterns by UV absorbance recorded with a Waters 996 diode array detector and the presence of [3H] by scintillation counting in a Packard Tri-Carb 1900CA scintillation analyzer. Fractions from several independent HPLC chromatograms that contained 3H protein profiles were then subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of the Saint Francis Hospital of Tulsa Medical Research Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, under the supervision of Dr. Ken Jackson.Spectroscopy and Northern Blot AnalysisâSpectral analysis of R. capsulatus cell membranes were performed as previously published (6Swem L.R. Kraft B.J. Swem D.L. Setterdahl A.T. Masuda S. Knaff D.B. Zaleski J.M. Bauer C.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, cellular RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA content was assayed by absorbance at 280 nm and then normalized for ribosomal RNA content after electrophoretic separation and visualization of 16 S rRNA on a formamide gel. The Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (14Buggy J.J. Sganga M.W. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6936-6943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA blot was probed with a digoxigenin-labeled (Roche Applied Science catalog number 1-636-090) puf or puc probe for 16 h at 65 Â°C. The digoxigenin-labeled puf and puc probes were generated by PCR from genomic template using primers PufQup (5â²-TGGGTAGCGTCTACCTGCTG), PufAdown (5â²-CCCGCAACGCTCAGTAACGC), PucUP (5â²-CTCCCATAGTGCGTCTCACG), and PucDown (5â²-TTACTGAGCCGGCGCAACAGC), respectively. Detection of the digoxigenin-labeled probe was carried out as recommenced by the manufacturer of the Dig luminescent detection kit (Roche Applied Science catalog number 1-636-514) with hybridization levels visualized using radiographic film and quantitated using a Fluorchem 5500 imaging system from Alpha Innotech. The 16 S ribosomal RNA was also quantitated and used to normalize Northern blot hybridization levels.RESULTSPurification of Full-length Membrane-spanning RegBâA specific involvement of the membrane-spanning domain of RegB in redox sensing has not been extensively explored beyond the construction of a few mutations in the membrane-spanning region, several of which affect phosphorylation (15Oh J.I. Ko I.J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6807-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To biochemically explore whether the membrane-spanning domain controls RegB activity, we expressed His6-tagged full-length RegB in E. coli and isolated full-length protein from crude membrane fractions after solubilization with the detergent n-dodecyl Î²-d-maltoside (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Detergent solubilized full-length RegB was then purified by nickel ion chromatography and visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The most prominent band on the gel corresponds to a RegB monomer at 47 kDa and a RegB dimer at 98 kDa, which is close to the calculated monomer and dimer size for RegB at 50.1 and 100.2 kDa. Western blot analysis using an anti-His tag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number SC803) verified the identity of these bands as His-tagged RegB (data not shown).Autophosphorylation assays were performed on full-length RegB in the presence of [Î³-32P]ATP with aliquots being removed at intervals ranging from 0.25 to 15 min (Fig. 1B). The autoradiograph in Fig. 1B demonstrates that purified full-length RegB exhibits excellent autophosphorylation with activity detected as early as 0.25 min, linear within the first 2 min, and reaching a plateau in â¼10 min. Similar phosphorylation was observed with a soluble truncated form of RegB (RegBs), which does not contain the membrane-spanning domain (6Swem L.R. Kraft B.J. Swem D.L. Setterdahl A.T. Masuda S. Knaff D.B. Zaleski J.M. Bauer C.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as well as the full-length RegB homolog from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (16Potter C.A. Ward A. Laguri C. Williamson M.P. Henderson P.J. Phillips-Jones M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This indicates that the mild detergent, n-dodecyl Î²-d-maltoside does not compromise the structural integrity of RegB nor significantly impact the level of activity of the protein.RegB Autophosphorylation Is Regulated By The Redox State of UbiquinoneâTo address the role of ubiquinone in controlling kinase activity, we added a 50-fold molar excess of coenzyme Q1, which is a close analog of ubiquinone containing only one isoprenoid side chain unit. When an oxidized form of this soluble quinone analog was allowed to incubate with RegB for 20 min prior to the initiation of autophosphorylation, there was a 5.4-fold decrease in autophosphorylation levels after the reactions reached plateau (Fig. 2A). Half-maximal kinase inhibition was achieved at a 20-fold molar excess of ubiquinone to RegB (data not shown). Note that there is a vast excess of quinones over that of the molar amount of RegB/cell (10Bolton J.R. Clayton R.K. Sistrom W.R. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Press, New York1978: 419-429Google Scholar), so it is not surprising that a 20-fold excess of coenzyme Q1 is needed to observe half-maximal inhibition. A similar inhibitory affect on RegB activity was observed with the addition of oxidized benzoquinone, which contains only the polar head group of coenzyme Q1, suggesting that the redox active head group of ubiquinone possesses the inhibitory signal (data not shown). Finally, kinase assays in the presence of a 50-fold excess of reduced coenzyme Q1 (ubiquinol) does not affect the autophosphorylation activity of full-length RegB (Fig. 2B). Thus, only the presence of oxidized quinone has an inhibitory affect on RegB kinase activity.FIGURE 2RegB autophosphorylation assays in the presence of ubiquinone. A, autophosphorylation assays of RegB in the presence and absence of ubiquinone (Q1) at a 50-fold molar excess to RegB. Ethanol was added to the RegB sample lacking ubiquinone to account for the ethanol concentration of the ubiquinone treated sample. The two reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 Â°C before the addition of [Î³-32P]ATP. Aliquots were removed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 10 min and quenched with SDS-PAGE loading buffer before being separated by SDS-PAGE. B, autophosphorylation assays of RegB in the presence of either oxidized ubiquinone or reduced ubiquinol (Q1). RegB was incubated in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of ubiquinone or ubiquinol at 37 Â°C for 20 min prior to the addition of [Î³-32P]ATP. Aliquots were removed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 min and quenched with SDS-PAGE loading buffer before being separated by SDS-PAGE. C, autophosphorylation assays of C265SA mutant RegB in the presence and absence of ubiquinone (Q1) at a 50-fold molar excess to RegB. Ethanol was added to the RegB sample lacking ubiquinone to account for the ethanol concentration of the ubiquinone treated sample. The two reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 Â°C before the addition of [Î³-32P]ATP. Aliquots were removed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 10 min and quenched with SDS-PAGE loading buffer before being separated by SDS-PAGE. All of the autophosphorylation assays were visualized and quantitated using the Typhoon phosphorimaging system (Amersham Biosciences).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Involvement of Cys265âWe previously demonstrated that RegB contains a fully conserved redox active cysteine (Cys265), located in the cytoplasmic domain between the H-box site of phosphorylation and the ATP-binding cassette (6Swem L.R. Kraft B.J. Swem D.L. Setterdahl A.T. Masuda S. Knaff D.B. Zaleski J.M. Bauer C.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vitro evidence indicated that oxidation of Cys265 leads to significant inhibition of kinase activity of the truncated cytosolic form of RegB (RegBs) (6Swem L.R. Kraft B.J. Swem D.L. Setterdahl A.T. Masuda S. Knaff D.B. Zaleski J.M. Bauer C.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, mutational analysis of Cys265 in full-length RegB only partially abrogated redox control in vivo, suggesting that additional factors beyond that of Cys265 were involved in controlling RegB kinase activity (6Swem L.R. Kraft B.J. Swem D.L. Setterdahl A.T. Masuda S. Knaff D.B. Zaleski J.M. Bauer C.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, redox regulation of full-length RegB autophosphorylation could be a result of altering the oxidation state of a bound ubiquinone, the redox state of Cys265, or both.To differentiate these possibilities, we isolated a full-length version of RegB that contained a cysteine to alanine mutation at amino acid 265 (C265A) and then assayed this mutant form of full-length RegB for redox-mediated changes in autophosphorylation in vitro. The results of these assays demonstrate that the addition of oxidized coenzyme Q1 to full-length C265A RegB still results in inhibition of autophosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Thus, oxidized coenzyme Q1 is not simply affecting the redox state of Cys265. This indicates that redox control of wild type full-length RegB most likely involves both an alteration of the redox state of Cys265 as well as direct inhibition of activity by oxidized ubiquinone.Identification of the Ubiquinone-binding SiteâA tritium-labeled photo affinity analog of ubiquinone, 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-[3H]6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (azido-Q) was used to identify a ubiquinone-binding site in RegB. This azidoubiquinone derivative and related analogs have been widely used to identify Q-binding domains present in NADH-Q oxidoreductase (17Gong X. Xie T. Yu L. Hesterberg M. Scheide D. Friedrich T.

The binding of this quinone analog was performed by equilibrating purified full-length RegB with 20-fold molar excess of azido-Q for 1 h at 0 Â°C in the dark. The RegB-quinone analog complex was then illuminated with long wavelength UV light (365 nm) for 20 min to initiate photoaffinity cross-linking. Electrophoretically and chromatographically separated azido-Q-treated RegB demonstrates good incorporation of tritium, indicating that azido-Q undergoes efficient cross-linking to RegB (data not shown).Kinase assays indicate that the activity of RegB is decreased >95% after photoaffinity cross-linking in the presence of azido-Q (Fig. 3A). Inactivation is not due to the inhibition of RegB by photolyzed products of azido-Q, because no inhibition of activity is observed when azido-Q is first photolyzed in the absence of RegB and then mixed with the enzyme. Inactivation is also not due to protein damage by UV radiation because illumination of"

J. 2002; 362: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Like phospholipases of this type from other sources (3Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial enzyme is inactivated by bromoenol lactone (BEL), which acts through an activity-dependent mechanism, leading to a covalent modification within the active site (5Daniels S.B. Cooney E. Sofia M.J. Chakravarty P.K. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15046-15053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No physiological function of the iPLA2 in mitochondria has been established, but it has been shown that pretreatment with BEL attenuates the loss of phospholipids that accompanies ischemia/reperfusion injury and reduces the size of infarcts by â¼50% (2Williams S.A. Gottlieb R.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The relationship between mitochondrial energetic status and iPLA2 activity is an important factor to consider when contemplating potential physiological and pathophysiological roles of the enzyme. More specifically, activity is not seen in mitochondria that are respiring under state 4 conditions but is manifest upon the addition of uncoupler and is fully manifest following the development of inner membrane pores (1Broekemeier K.M. Iben J.R. LeVan E.G. Crouser E.D. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7771-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The former property suggests that transient periods of deenergization might cause a transient activation of the iPLA2 in vivo, with a resulting accumulation of free fatty acids in mitochondria. Such an accumulation could be of interest in many regards, including opening of the permeability transition pore, which is favored by low levels of these compounds (6Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg.

Chem. 2002; 276: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Occurrence of the permeability transition leads to apoptosis in many cell types (9Bernardi P. Petronilli V.

J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar), so scenarios arise in which the iPLA2 contributes to the control of apoptosis by influencing the permeability transition and wherein the facilitative effects of depolarization on the transition (12Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Petronilli V. Cola C. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might occur through activity of this enzyme. As further regards the potential roles of the iPLA2, another factor to consider is its relatively high specific activity, compared with what might be expected from early reports. In media of high ionic strength, the activity level is sufficient to hydrolyze â¼5 mol % of mitochondrial phospholipids/h, which could be sufficient to initiate and enforce the turnover of poorly functioning mitochondria (1Broekemeier K.M. Iben J.R. LeVan E.G. Crouser E.D. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7771-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, on the time scale of apoptosis (several h), this level of activity is expected to alter mitochondrial ultrastructure and might thereby change the poorly understood relationships between extents of swelling, membrane rupture, and the release of mitochondrial factors that control apoptosis. The present study was undertaken as an initial test of potential mitochondrial iPLA2 functions along the lines of those described above and has identified three points of interest. It first of all shows that the iPLA2 is largely responsible for the accumulation of free fatty acids that occurs when mitochondria accumulate Ca2+. Second, it shows that on a relatively short time frame of several minutes, activity of the enzyme is indeed an important factor regulating the permeability transition and may, in part, constitute the link between mitochondrial energetic status and the ease with which the transition occurs. Finally, this study shows that on a longer time frame of hours, mitochondrial iPLA2 activity does indeed change the relationships between swelling and the release of an apoptogenic factor (cytochrome c), both in terms of the time course involved and the fraction released at a given extent of swelling. Aspects of these findings have been described in abstract form (14Gadd M.E. Julian M.W. Crouser E.D. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 111Google Scholar). Preparation and Incubation of MitochondriaâRat liver mitochondria were prepared by a standard procedure in which bovine serum albumin and EGTA were present in the homogenization medium but were absent from the medium used for washing (15Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were incubated in media containing 0.23 m mannitol, 0.07 sucrose, 3 mm Hepes (Na+) (pH 7.4), plus further additions described in the figure legends. Alternatively, media were also employed in which 0.15 m KCl or 0.15 m KMes was used in place of mannitol/sucrose as further described under âResults.â When succinate (Na+) was present as an oxidizable substrate, its concentration was 1.0, or 10 mm, and rotenone was present at 1 nmol/mg protein. In addition, the concentrations mannitol/sucrose, KCl, or KMes were reduced proportionally to maintain the osmotic pressure at 300 mosm when succinate was employed. Small incubations were conducted in a cuvette to allow the continuous monitoring of mitochondrial swelling as apparent absorbance changes at 540 nm. An Aminco DW2c spectrophotometer was employed for this purpose. Larger incubations were conducted in water-jacked beakers that were open to the atmosphere, with stirring maintained to provide an availability of O2 throughout the time course (16Broekemeier K.M. Klocek C.K. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13059-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When the experiments were conducted over long time frames (hours), all incubations were conducted simultaneously to prevent variations arising from aging of the preparation. During experiments in these vessels, swelling was monitored continuously using a Brinkman probe colorimeter that was interfaced to a computer. Alternatively, swelling was sometimes monitored discontinuously using the same instrument, by moving the probe from vessel to vessel and manually recording the reading. Changes in membrane potential were also of interest and were monitored simultaneously with swelling, using a TPP+ electrode as previously described (16Broekemeier K.M. Klocek C.K. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13059-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Determination of PLA2 ActivityâPhospholipase activity was determined by monitoring the accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) derived from the endogenous phospholipids (15Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To extract these products, a 3-ml aliquot of the incubation was added to 4 ml of cold methanol to which 5.00 Î¼g of heptadecanoic acid (17:0) had previously been added as an internal standard. The aqueous methanol solution was mixed before the addition of 8 ml of CHCl3, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged to separate the organic and the aqueous phases. The aqueous phase (upper phase) was removed by aspiration, after which the lower organic phase was transferred to a 10-ml conical screw cap tube. This phase was brought to dryness under N2, and the free fatty acids were converted to methyl esters (FAME) by reaction with diazomethane (17Schlenk H. Gellerman J. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1412-1414Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar). During this procedure, the dried lipid phase was taken up in 1.1 ml of ether/methanol (10:1) to which 0.2 ml of the diazomethane solution was added. Reaction was allowed to continue for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were then brought to dryness and taken up in 1 ml of CHCl3. Typically, they were thereafter stored overnight, at 4 Â°C and under argon, prior to analysis by gas chromatography. To begin the analysis, the stored samples were dried, and the lipids were taken up in 0.2 ml of hexane. These solutions were applied to silica gel minicolumns for the separation of FAME from other mitochondrial lipids (15Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The columns were washed successively with 1.0 ml of hexane, 1.8 ml of CHCl3, and finally 2.0 ml of hexane/ether (1:1). FAME are obtained in the hexane/ether wash. The hexane/ether solvent mixture was removed under N2, and the FAME were taken up in 12 Î¼l of hexane. They were then separated and quantitated using a gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column and a computing integrator. Peak areas representing the original level of individual FFA were converted to units of nmol/mg mitochondrial protein. To convert the areas to units of mass, they were compared with the area of the internal standard peak, which represented the 5.00 Î¼g of heptadecanoic acid that was added to the original extract. Changes in FFA levels can usually be related to activity of a PLA2 by considering the composition of compounds, because positional analysis data have shown which fatty acids are normally located at sn-1 and sn-2 positions of mitochondrial phospholipids (1Broekemeier K.M. Iben J.R. LeVan E.G. Crouser E.D. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7771-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Pfeiffer D.R. Schmid P.C. Beatrice M.C. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11485-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, activity of the mitochondrial iPLA2 is apparently followed by that of a lysophospholipase, because FFA originally esterified at the two positions appear in approximately equal proportions (1Broekemeier K.M. Iben J.R. LeVan E.G. Crouser E.D. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7771-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mitochondrial functional parameters considered here depend more upon the total FFA present than upon the exact composition. Accordingly, the results of FFA analysis are reported as totals of all those detected and are in units of nmol/mg mitochondrial protein. Repetitive analysis of single samples has shown that the S.D. value for individual values is approximately Â±4% (15Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4Work in progress indicates that rat liver mitochondria do indeed contain a lysophospholipase activity, which exceeds the activity of the iPLA2. Nevertheless, it remains possible that low levels of lysophospholipids are present as a result of iPLA2 activity and contribute to the consequences of activating that enzyme. Determination of Cytochrome c Release by HPLCâThe preparation of samples for the determination of cytochrome c in mitochondrial stock suspensions or in samples arising from incubations has been described (19Crouser E.D. Gadd M.E. Julian M.W. Huff J.E. Broekemeier K.M. Robbins K.A. Pfeiffer D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 317: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, for stock suspensions, an aliquot containing 1.0 mg of mitochondrial protein was dispersed in 100 Î¼l of 1% Lubrol WX to which 1 Î¼l of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride had previously been added. The dispersion was diluted to 1.0 ml with 100 mm KCl, and the resulting sample was centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge. For samples obtained from incubations, the initial volume was 1.0 ml, which also contained 1.0 mg of mitochondrial protein, and this was added to a microcentrifuge tube that already contained 1 Î¼l of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation for 2 min in the microcentrifuge, 25 Î¼m bovine serum albumin was added to the supernatants, which were saved for subsequent analysis. The pellets were immediately resuspended in 100 Î¼l of incubation medium, dispersed with Lubrol WX, and then diluted to a total volume of 1.0 ml as described for the samples arising from mitochondrial stock suspensions. For all samples, 100-Î¼l aliquots representing 0.10 mg of mitochondrial protein were injected into the HPLC. A C4 reverse phase column preceded by a guard column and a linear gradient ranging from 20 to 60% acetonitrile in water were employed. Both solvents A and B contained 100 mm KCl and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The gradient was developed over a 15-min period, which was followed by a 5-min wash with the 60% solution and a subsequent 5-min wash with the 20% solution before injection of the next sample. The eluted cytochrome was detected at 393 nm to take advantage of an improved extinction coefficient at that wavelength, which results from the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (20Picklo M.J. Zhang J. Nguyen V.Q. Graham D.G. Montine T.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 276: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release was expressed as a percentage of the total, as determined from the stock suspension samples. The sum of cytochrome c found in supernatants and pellets was furthermore compared with the total to verify that all of that protein was accounted for. Other MethodsâRates of O2 consumption were determined using a Clark-type electrode. Adenylate kinase and malate dehydrogenase activities were determined as described (21Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 486Google Scholar, 22Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 485Google Scholar), using the same samples that were generated for the determination of cytochrome c release (22Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 485Google Scholar). Initial rates were extracted from the progress curves by fitting an early portion to a linear model, using standard techniques. Incubations were conducted at 25 or 37 Â°C, as specified in the figure legends, and at a mitochondrial protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. The concentration of protein in mitochondrial stock suspensions was determined by the Biuret reaction after dispersing the organelles in deoxycholate (Na+) (1% final concentration). iPLA2 Activity Produces the FFA Accumulation That Accompanies Ca2+ UptakeâIt has long been known that energy-dependent Ca2+ accumulation provokes a limited hydrolysis of phospholipids and an accumulation of FFA (18Pfeiffer D.R. Schmid P.C. Beatrice M.C. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11485-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon was originally attributed to the action of a mitochondrial secretory PLA2, because such an activity had been identified in mitochondria and found to require high Ca2+ concentrations for activity (23Waite M. Sisson P. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Lenting H.B.M. Neys F.W. Van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 961: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the mitochondrial iPLA2 is activated when deenergization occurs (1Broekemeier K.M. Iben J.R. LeVan E.G. Crouser E.D. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7771-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and it is well known that Ca2+ accumulation can markedly depress membrane potential, depending upon conditions (25Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we considered the possibility that it is actually the iPLA2 that is responsible the FFA accumulation that accompanies Ca2+ uptake. Figs. 1 and 2 show the data that were obtained. During these experiments, swelling was monitored together with membrane potential (TPP+ accumulation) and FFA accumulation, so that development of the permeability transition and the extent of depolarization could be ascertained simultaneously.

Swelling does not occur unless pores are formed by the permeability transition or the antibiotic, as is well known, and membrane potential behaves as would be expected (Fig. 1, AâD).FIGURE 2Relationships between Ca2+ accumulation, membrane potential, and the accumulation of FFA in mitochondria. Mitochondria were incubated as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ and the legend to Fig. 1. Swelling (upper traces, solid line) and membrane potential (lower traces, dashed line) were monitored as also described. A, no further additions; B, CaCl2 was added where shown at 60 nmol/mg protein; C, same as B except that 0.5 Î¼m CsA was present from the beginning of the incubation; D, same as B except that 10 Î¼m BEL was present from the beginning of the incubation; E, same as B except that CsA and BEL were present from the beginning; F, same as B except that 2.0 mm inorganic phosphate (Na+) was present; G, same as B except that 1 nmol/mg protein of ruthenium red was added before CaCl2; H, same as B except that SrCl2 was added instead of CaCl2. For all panels, at end of the incubations, ÎFFA was determined as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ and in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ at 60 nmol/mg protein, a marked depolarization occurs, which is maintained and intensifies during subsequent incubation (Fig. 2, compare A and B). Some of the mitochondria belatedly undergo the permeability transition following Ca2+ accumulation, as indicated by modest swelling, and at the end of the experiment, 1.40 nmol/mg protein of FFA had been accumulated. This accumulation was in addition to the â¼1.2 nmol/mg protein that was found as an endogenous content in this preparation. The inclusion of CsA eliminates the partial swelling occurring toward the end of the experiment and promotes some recovery of membrane potential following Ca2+ accumulation but has no effect on FFA accumulation (Fig. 2C). BEL has the same effects on swelling and the recovery of membrane potential following Ca2+ accumulation but substantially reduces the accumulation of FFA (Fig. 2D). In addition, CsA plus BEL gives the same results as BEL alone (Fig. 2E). From the results just described, it appears that FFA accumulation correlates with a depressed membrane potential caused by Ca2+ accumulation (Fig. 2B), and not with a partial occurrence of the permeability transition/swelling that Ca2+ accumulation may cause (Fig. 2, compare B and C). Since BEL reduces the accumulation of FFA (Fig. 2, compare D and E), it further appears that the iPLA2 is responsible. To test this interpretation in a different way, Pi was included in medium while CsA was present to prevent the permeability transition. Under these conditions, the depression of membrane potential produced by Ca2+ accumulation is short lived, and FFA do not accumulate (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, the addition of Ca2+ in the presence of ruthenium red (which inhibits Ca2+ accumulation) results in no loss of potential and no accumulation of FFA (Fig. 2G). In addition, Sr2+ accumulation (which depresses membrane potential but does not induce the transition) is fully as effective as Ca2+ accumulation in promoting the appearance of FFA (Fig. 2H). All of these findings are as expected if Ca2+ (Sr2+) accumulation activates the iPLA2 by depressing membrane potential and FFA thereafter accumulate. Conversely, they are collectively not consistent with interpretations whereby mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation promotes the accumulation of FFA by activating an internal Ca2+-dependent activity, as was once thought to be the case (25Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BEL Inhibits the Mitochondrial Permeability TransitionâTo determine if FFA arising from iPLA2 activity are truly a factor in promoting the permeability transition, we compared the effects of BEL with those of known inhibitors when the phenomenon is induced by Ca2+ plus Pi. Confirming the indication from Fig. 2D, BEL is effective as a transition inhibitor under these conditions (Fig. 3). Indeed, the effectiveness of BEL is similar to that of ruthenium red and approaches that of CsA during these relatively short time frame experiments. Importantly, the inhibitory action of BEL is overcome when exogenous FFA have been added to the incubation (Fig. 3), whereas earlier results showed that FFA do not overcome the inhibition produced by ruthenium red or CsA (15Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5Not pertinent to Fig. 3, but consistent with interpretations presented later in this work, exogenous FFA retain a capacity to promote the transition when Ca2+ accumulation has occurred before ruthenium red is added (data not shown). When considered together with Fig. 2, the inference then is that BEL inhibits the transition because the phenomenon is stimulated by FFA (6Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), that the FFA of interest normally arise from iPLA2 activity, and that the enzyme becomes active when the mitochondrial membrane potential is depressed upon the addition and accumulation of Ca2+. iPLA2 Activity Promotes the Spontaneous Release of Cytochrome câTo examine potential relationships between the mitochondrial iPLA2 and apoptosis, apart from its effects on the permeability transition, we monitored the spontaneous release of cytochrome c and related parameters during extended incubations. The time frame of these experiments was selected to mimic that of cellular apoptosis (several hours) rather than the time frame of minutes, which is often employed in related studies using isolated mitochondria. An uncoupled condition was employed to promote activity, which was also favored by use of a physiological temperature and high ionic strength medium (KCl-based medium). In addition, CsA and EGTA were present to inhibit the permeability transition. Under these conditions, mitochondria swell spontaneously, within â¼45 min, to an extent that is similar to the swelling produced by alamethicin or the permeability transition (Fig. 4). This swelling is accompanied by an early release of cytochrome c equaling about 50% of the total, by the release of a similar fraction of adenylate kinase activity (intermembrane space marker), and of a slightly smaller fraction of malate dehydrogenase activity (matrix space marker). These findings suggest that the initial phase of relatively rapid swelling caused the outer membrane to rupture in about 50% of mitochondria and that the inner membrane was subsequently ruptured after a further period of â¼30â60 min. Accordingly, we sought to identify the cause of this swelling and to minimize it, so that effects of iPLA2 activity on the release of cytochrome c could be better observed. Because the mitochondria were uncoupled and conditions were in place to inhibit the permeability transition when Fig. 4 was obtained, it seemed apparent that the early large amplitude swelling reflected an accumulation of KCl and that the driving force was neither colloid osmotic in nature nor derived from the ion pumping activities of mitochondria. Thus, solute concentration gradients were seen to be responsible. Furthermore, since the matrix space K+ concentration is similar to that of the external medium, it appeared that the Clâ concentration gradient was the one of greatest interest. A scheme involving the mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) and the K+/H+ antiporter can account for the swelling, as further described under âDiscussion,â which led us to substitute zwitterions for Clâ (poor substrates for IMAC (26Ng L.T. Selwyn M.J. Choo H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 27Powers M.F. Smith L.L. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10614-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) as a way to diminish the initial swelling seen in Fig. 4. The sulfonic acid buffer ion Mes proved useful in this regard, so that further experiments were conducted in media containing 150 mm KMes. In a KMes-based medium analogous to the KCl-based medium used to obtain Fig. 4, the initial swelling is greatly diminished, and fractional rupture of the outer and inner membranes is effectively curtailed (Fig. 5A). A second phase of swelling becomes apparent at about 2 h, and the release of cytochrome c begins. This is accompanied by an equal fractional release of adenylate kinase activity, showing that outer membrane rupture is responsible, and by a much smaller fractional release of malate dehydrogenase activity (inner membrane rupture). When BEL is present to inhibit the iPLA2 (Fig. 5B), the period preceding the second swelling phase is longer, as is the time required to begin outer membrane rupture and release of cytochrome c.

Since histones are known to be cross-linked by TG2, we investigated whether histones are also substrates for TG2 kinase activity. TG2 was able to phosphorylate H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones <i>in vitro</i>. Using peptide substrates and phosphospecific antibodies we demonstrated that TG2 phosphorylated Ser<sup>10</sup> in H3 and that this phosphorylation was reduced by acetylation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser<sup>10</sup> by TG2 enhanced acetylation. Furthermore we demonstrated that exogenous TG2 phosphorylated H1 and H3 in nucleosome preparations. We examined the abundance of TG2 in DNA-associated proteins from MCF-7 cells treated with phorbol ester (TPA) and 17Î²-estradiol (E2). TG2 abundance was significantly reduced in E2-treated cells and enhanced in TPA-treated cells. In summary we have demonstrated that TG2 is able to phosphorylate purified histone proteins, and H3 and H1 in chromatin preparations, and it is associated with chromatin in breast cancer cells. These studies suggest a novel role for TG2 in the regulation of chromatin structure and function."

TGF-Î² is involved both in liver regeneration and in the fibrotic and cirrhotic transformation with hepatitis viral infection. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection often leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein is a multifunctional protein that modulates cytokine-mediated signal transduction pathways. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of HCV pathogenesis, we examined the effect of NS5A protein on TGF-Î²-stimulated signaling cascades. We show that NS5A protein inhibited the TGF-Î²-mediated signaling pathway in hepatoma cell lines as determined by reporter gene assay. To further investigate the role of NS5A, we examined the protein/protein interaction between NS5A and TGF-Î² signal transducers. Both in vitro and in vivo binding data showed that NS5A protein directly interacted with TGF-Î² receptor I (TÎ²R-I) in hepatoma cell lines. This interaction was mapped to amino acids 148-238 of NS5A. We also found that NS5A protein co-localized with TÎ²R-I in the cytoplasm of Huh7 cells and inhibited TGF-Î²-mediated nuclear translocation of Smad2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NS5A protein abrogated the phosphorylation of Smad2 and the heterodimerization of Smad3 and Smad4.

The viral genome is â¼9.6 kb in length and encodes a single polyprotein precursor of a little more than 3000 amino acid residues. This polyprotein is processed by a combination of host and viral proteases into 10 individual mature proteins (6Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

The three N-terminal structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) are required for nucleocapsid formation and assembly of viral particles. The remainders are the nonstructural proteins with various enzymatic activities, including serine protease, RNA helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein is a multifunctional phosphoprotein consisting of 447 amino acid residues. NS5A protein exists in two different sizes of polypeptide (p56 and p58), which is phosphorylated mainly at serine residues by cellular kinase (7Ide Y. Tanimoto A. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R.

For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, COS-7 cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 expressing T7 RNA polymerase (32Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). At 2 h after infection, cells were transfected with 5 Î¼g of the corresponding plasmids. Following incubation at 37 Â°C for 12 h, cells were harvested and lysed in buffer A (50 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were triturated by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated at 4 Â°C for 2 h with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody or rabbit anti-NS5A polyclonal antibody. The samples were further incubated with 30 Î¼l of protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with cell lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by Western blot analysis using either rabbit anti-NS5A polyclonal antibody or anti-HA monoclonal antibody. For the in vivo binding assay between NS5A and endogenous TÎ²R-I, Huh7 cells were transfected with the NS5A-Myc expression plasmid. At 36 h after transfection, Huh7 cells were either untreated or treated with human TGF-Î² (5 ng/ml) for 1 h. The cell supernatant was prepared as described above and incubated with anti-TÎ²R-I polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at 4Â°C. The samples were further incubated with 30 Î¼l of protein A beads for 1 h. These bound proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Confocal MicroscopyâEither Huh7 or COS-7 cells grown on chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) were cotransfected with either the NS5A-Myc and HA-TÎ²R-I(T204D) expression plasmids or the FLAG-Smad2 and green fluorescent protein-NS5A expression plasmids. At 36 h after transfection, slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 37 Â°C. Cells were incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 37 Â°C and then incubated with anti-HA, anti-Myc, or anti-FLAG (Sigma) monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 37Â°C. After being washed three times with PBS, cells were further incubated with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA) for 1 h at 37Â°C. After two washes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and three washes with PBS, cells were analyzed using the LSM 510 laser confocal microscopy system (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Co-immunoprecipitation of the Smad3-Smad4 ComplexâApproximately 5 Ã 105 cells plated on 60-mm dishes were transfected with the FLAG-Smad3, Smad4-Myc, and HA-TÎ²R-I(T204D) expression plasmids using Lipofectamine. At 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed in buffer A and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Bound Smad4 protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. Cytoplasmic and Nuclear FractionationâHuh7 cells plated on 60-mm dishes were transfected with the corresponding plasmids. At 36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in buffer B (10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 min on ice. Cells were harvested, vortexed for 5 s, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was saved as a cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed twice with buffer C (20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 420 mmol/liter KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in buffer C. The samples were vortexed for 10 s, incubated with agitation for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was collected as a nuclear extract. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, anti-Î²-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-B23 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or rabbit anti-NS5A polyclonal antibody. Western Blot AnalysisâHepG2 and Huh7 cells were transfected with the corresponding expression plasmids. At 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with human TGF-Î² (5 ng/ml) for the indicated times and incubated in buffer A. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with anti-phospho-Smad2 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, and anti-NS5A polyclonal antibody in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mmol/liter NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Following two washes in Tris-buffered saline/Tween, the membrane was incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody or goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween for 90 min at room temperature. Proteins were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)âHuh7 cells stably expressing NS5A, the HCV subgenomic replicon, and empty vector were plated at a density of â¼3 Ã 105 in 6-well dishes. Following incubation overnight at 37 Â°C, cells were treated with human TGF-Î² (5 ng/ml) for 24 h, and then nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (33Park K.-J. Choi S.-H. Choi D.-H.

Briefly, cells were harvested by scraping in PBS and incubated in 200 Î¼l of buffer B for 3 min on ice. Crude nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 Â°C. The pellets were rinsed once with buffer B and resuspended in 100 Î¼l of buffer C. The sample was further incubated with agitation in a cold room for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The protein concentration in nuclear extract was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extract (20 Î¼g) was incubated with an oligonucleotide probe (34Lee D.K. Kim B.-C. Kim I.Y.

The Smad-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel using 0.25Ã Tris borate/EDTA buffer and detected by autoradiography. For the competition assay, unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extract in binding buffer for 20 min before the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. HCV NS5A Protein Inhibits TGF-Î²-induced Transcriptional Activation and Cell DeathâTGF-Î² has a pivotal role in pathogenic hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver disease (22Castilla A. Prieto J. Fausto N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Because we found that TGF-Î² was differentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma of NS5A transgenic mice (data not shown) and because NS5A regulates several cell signaling events, we investigated the role of NS5A in TGF-Î²-dependent transcriptional activation using a luciferase reporter gene assay. Human hepatoma cell lines were transiently cotransfected with the NS5A expression plasmid and either the TGF-Î²-responsive 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid (31Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) or the SBE4-Luc reporter plasmid (containing four Smad-binding elements) (30Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with human TGF-Î² (5 ng/ml) for 24 h, and the luciferase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, TGF-Î² induced a 40-60-fold transactivation of the reporters in Huh7 cells. Endogenous luciferase activity was maintained at a basal level, and this activity was not affected by NS5A. Overexpression of NS5A protein inhibited TGF-Î²-induced transcriptional activation by â¼40-60% compared with the vector control in both reporter plasmids. It is noteworthy that HepG2 cells are less responsive to reporter plasmids compared with Huh7 cells. We found that overexpression of NS5A protein inhibited TGF-Î²-induced transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). However, overexpression of green fluorescent protein showed no effect on TGF-Î²-induced transcriptional activation (data not shown). These results suggest that NS5A protein inhibits the TGF-Î²-induced signal transduction pathway at the transcriptional level in hepatoma cell lines. In most cell types, TGF-Î² is a potent activator of p21 and induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase (17Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar, 35MassagueÌ J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S.

Virol. 2001; 75: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) have shown that HCV NS5A protein represses p21 expression in a p53-dependent manner. To investigate the direct effect of NS5A protein on p21 transcriptional activity, we performed a luciferase reporter gene assay using the p21-Luc plasmid. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with the NS5A expression plasmid, the TÎ²R-I(T204D) expression plasmid, and the p21-Luc reporter plasmid. At 36 h after transfection, TGF-Î²-induced p21 promoter activity was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1C, overexpression of NS5A protein inhibited TGF-Î²-induced p21 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that the expression level of exogenous TÎ²R-I(T204D) was not affected by NS5A protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Next, we investigated the effect of NS5A protein on TGF-Î²-induced cell death. Huh7 cells stably expressing either empty vector or NS5A were treated with human TGF-Î² for 48 h, and then a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed. Upon TGF-Î² treatment, only 40% of the cells stably transfected with empty vector remained viable (Fig. 1D). However, the majority of Huh7 cells stably expressing NS5A were viable (Fig. 1D), indicating that these cells are significantly less sensitive to TGF-Î²-induced cell death compared with vector control cells. These results suggest that HCV NS5A protein inhibits TGF-Î²-induced cell death through down-regulation of p21 activity.FIGURE 1HCV NS5A protein suppresses TGF-Î²-mediated transcriptional activation. A, HCV NS5A protein suppresses TGF-Î²-stimulated transcriptional activation. Both Huh7 (upper panels) and HepG2 (lower panels) cells were transfected with either the SBE4-Luc (left panels) or 3TP-Lux (right panels) reporter plasmid together with empty vector or the NS5A expression plasmid. At 1 day after transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with human TGF-Î² (5 ng/ml) for 24 h. Luciferase activities were then measured, and values were normalized based on Î²-galactosidase activities. The data shown represent triplicate experiments. B, NS5A suppresses TGF-Î²-mediated transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2072902191,"The RND family transporter TtgABC and its cognate repressor TtgR from Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E were both shown to possess multidrug recognition properties. Structurally unrelated molecules such as chloramphenicol, butyl paraben, 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, and several flavonoids are substrates of TtgABC and activate pump expression by binding to the TtgR-operator complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to determine the thermodynamic parameters for the binding of these molecules to TtgR. Dissociation constants were in the range from 1 to 150 Î¼m, the binding stoichiometry was one effector molecule per dimer of TtgR, and the process was driven by favorable enthalpy changes. Although TtgR exhibits a large multidrug binding profile, the plant-derived compounds phloretin and quercetin were shown to bind with the highest affinity (KD of around 1 Î¼m), in contrast to other effectors (chloramphenicol and aromatic solvents) for which exhibited a more reduced affinity. Structure-function studies of effectors indicate that the presence of aromatic rings as well as hydroxyl groups are determinants for TtgR binding. The binding of TtgR to its operator DNA does not alter the protein effector profile nor the effector binding stoichiometry. Moreover, we demonstrate here for the first time that the binding of a single effector molecule to the DNA-bound TtgR homodimer induces the dissociation of the repressor-operator complex.

The active efflux of toxic compounds is a common mechanism employed by bacteria to protect themselves against the deleterious effects of toxic molecules they encounter in the environment. The extrusion of toxic compounds is mainly mediated by transmembrane multiple drug resistance (MDR) 3The abbreviations used are: MDR, multiple drug resistance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; Km, kanamycin; LB, Luria-Bertani culture medium; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; RND, resistance nodulation cell-division; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol.3The abbreviations used are: MDR, multiple drug resistance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; Km, kanamycin; LB, Luria-Bertani culture medium; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; RND, resistance nodulation cell-division; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. efflux pumps that are broadly specific and able to accommodate a variety of structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents (1Nikaido H.

In Gram-negative bacteria, the majority of MDR efflux pumps belong to the RND family, which includes transporters able to expel clinically relevant antibiotics, dyes, biocides, detergents, fatty acids, heavy metals, or organic solvents (5Nikaido H.

These MDR efflux pumps have recently become the object of special interest, not only because they are a cause of concern in the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8Poole K.

Besides the clinical and ecological relevance, the particular ability of these proteins to interact with a wide range of structurally different molecules is of fundamental interest in understanding protein-ligand specificity (13Ambudkar S.V.

In that sense, the recent determination of the three-dimensional structures of QacR and BmrR in complex with several ligands has provided important insight into the molecular mechanism of multiple drug recognition (22Zheleznova E.E.

However, one of the most intriguing issues concerning bacterial MDR systems is the physiological function they exert in their natural habitat (14Neyfakh A.A.

Some MDR efflux pumps present in soil-living or plant-associated bacteria have been shown to confer resistance to plant defense molecules and seem to play an important role in the efficient colonization of plant-influenced microenvironments by these microorganisms and/or in their virulence, in the case of plant pathogens (27Burse A.

P. putida is a non-pathogenic bacterium present in water and soil and able to colonize plant roots and seeds (31Molina L. Ramos C. Duque E. Ronchel M.C. GarciÌa J.M. Wyke L. Ramos J.L. Soil Biol.

Huertas M.J. HaiÌdour A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3911-3916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and three RND efflux pumps, TtgABC, TtgDEF, and TtgGHI, were found to be essential for this resistance (35Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G. Hurtado A. Ramos J.L. Segura A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This study will focus on the TtgABC efflux pump and its cognate regulator TtgR. TtgABC has been shown to play an important role in the intrinsic tolerance of P. putida DOT-T1E to organic solvents (35Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G. Hurtado A. Ramos J.L. Segura A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 36Ramos J.L. Duque E. Godoy P. Segura A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3323-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TtgABC is able to extrude several structurally different antimicrobial compounds, such as antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, streptomycin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime), biocides (triclosan), and dyes (ethidium bromide) (35Rojas A.

Molecular Characterization of Its Regulator TtgR.. Universidad de Granada, Granada2005Google Scholar), and hence confers an MDR phenotype to P. putida DOT-T1E. TtgR is a member of the TetR family of transcriptional repressors. Typically, these repressors have two functional domains, a highly conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain, and a less conserved C-terminal domain involved in both dimerization and effector binding (39Ramos J.L. MartiÌnez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. TeraÌn W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). TtgR is a multidrug binding repressor that negatively controls the transcription of the ttgABC operon as well as its own expression. TtgR operates by an effector-mediated derepression mechanism (21TeraÌn W. Felipe A. Segura A. Rojas A. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which implies that effector binding to DNA-bound TtgR causes protein dissociation and subsequently transcriptional activation of ttgABC and ttgR. As mentioned above, a number of structure-based studies on this type of multidrug binding regulators have provided important insights into ligand-induced conformational changes and protein-ligand contacts. However, only a few studies were aimed at identifying possible natural effectors for these regulators, which would help to ascribe a physiological function to a given MDR system. As P. putida is a very abundant soil bacterium found in close association with plant roots, we hypothesized that the TtgABC/TtgR system might be involved in the resistance to plant defense metabolites. To address this issue, two complementary approaches were used. Initial in vivo studies aimed at exploring the TtgABC-mediated resistance to plant defense metabolites, as well as the role of TtgR in the expression of the ttgABC operon in response to these compounds. Subsequently, an extensive in vitro characterization of TtgR binding to different plant secondary metabolites is carried out using ITC. Most importantly, the binding of different effectors to DNA-bound TtgR is also explored, which is an innovative approach we judge of general relevance for the study of transcriptional repressors. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table 1. Bacterial strains were grown in LB medium at 30 Â°C as described before (21TeraÌn W. Felipe A. Segura A. Rojas A.

When required, antibiotics were added to the culture medium to reach the following final concentrations: rifampicin, 20 Î¼g/ml, and tetracycline, 20 Î¼g/ml. pED14 is a low-copy number plasmid (2â4 copies per cell) derived from pMP220 (41Spaink H.P.

Open table in a new tab Bacterial cells were inoculated from fresh LB agar plates in LB liquid medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and grown overnight at 30 Â°C with shaking (200 rpm). Cultures were diluted 100-fold in 15 ml of fresh LB or in the same medium supplemented with 1 mm of the inducing compounds, then incubated at 30 Â°C with shaking until the culture reached an A660 of 1.0 when Î²-galactosidase activity was determined according to Miller (42Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). All the chemicals were used at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), therefore they did not affect growth. Results presented are the mean of four different experiments. The MIC of the tested compounds was determined in LB medium by the microtiter broth dilution method (43Amsterdam D. Lorian V. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1991: 53-119Google Scholar). Microtiter plate wells containing each 100 Î¼l of LB were inoculated with 105 colony-forming units/ml and incubated for 16 h. The growth was then analyzed and the MIC corresponded to the minimal concentration at which growth was inhibited by at least by 90%. A 651-bp fragment containing the ttgR gene was amplified by PCR from P. putida DOT-T1E chromosomal DNA using the primers TtgR5â²NdeI (5â²-NNNNNNCATATGGTCCGTCGAACCAAAG-3â²) and TtgR3â²HindIII (5â²-NNNNNNAAGCTTCTACTATTTCGCCAGAGCCGGGCTC-3â²), which contained NdeI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively (underlined), and the latest included also the ttgR stop codon (in bold). The PCR products were restricted with the above enzymes and subsequently ligated into the pET29a(+) vector (Novagen) previously digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was termed pWilR2. For the purification of native TtgR, pWilR2 was transformed into E. coli B834(DE3). The cells were grown at 30 Â°C in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 1 liter of 2ÃYT culture medium (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 Î¼g/ml Km. For TtgR production, protein expression was induced at an A660 of 0.5â0.6 by adding 1 mm isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were grown for another 3 h at 20Â°C and subsequently harvested by centrifugation. The pellet resulting from a 1-liter culture was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.4, 20 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteÂ®, Roche)) and broken by treatment with 20 Î¼g/ml of lysozyme and French press. Following centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g for 40 min, the TtgR protein was predominantly present (more than 80%) in the soluble fraction. The supernatant was loaded onto a Hitrap Heparin HP column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a gradient of 0.02â0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing TtgR were pooled, concentrated to 4 ml by ultrafiltration using an Amicon 8050 apparatus (Amicon-Millipore), and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, NaCl 250 mm, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The sample was then submitted to size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl HR-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted fractions of TtgR were pooled, concentrated using the above equipment, and dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT) for protein storage at â70 Â°C (long term storage) or â20 Â°C (short term storage). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (21TeraÌn W. Felipe A. Segura A. Rojas A. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The DNA probe was a 189-bp fragment containing the ttgABC-ttgR intergenic region obtained from P. putida DOT-T1E chromosomal DNA by PCR. 1 nm of the radiolabeled probe (â¼10,000 cpm) was incubated with 0.75 Î¼m purified TtgR in 10 Î¼l of DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm Mg acetate, 10 mm KCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 20 Î¼g/ml poly(dI-dC) and 200 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin. Effectors (prepared in Me2SO) were added to the binding reaction at a final concentration of 1 mm. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 Â°C and samples were run on 4.5% (w/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II) for 2 h at 50 V at room temperature in Tris glycine buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 mm glycine). The resulting gels were analyzed using a Personal FX equipment and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Effector Binding to TtgRâMeasurements were performed on a VP-microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 30 Â°C. This instrument is equipped with a 1.437-ml sample cell and a 300-Î¼l syringe. The protein was thoroughly dialyzed against effector binding buffer (25 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Mg acetate, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Stock solutions of 1-naphthol, 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, butyl paraben, naringenin, quercetin, phloretin, apigenin, luteolin, coumestrol, and chloramphenicol were freshly prepared at 0.5 m in Me2SO, and subsequently diluted in dialysis buffer. The appropriate amount of Me2SO (0.1â0.3% (v/v)) was added to the protein sample in each assay. When indicated, analyses were carried out using 5% (v/v) Me2SO to facilitate the effector solubilization. All chemicals were manipulated in glass vessels and effector samples were neither degassed nor filtered, to avoid evaporation or nonspecific binding. Typically, an experiment involved a single 2 Î¼l and a series of 4-Î¼l injections of effector molecules into the protein solution. Effector Binding to TtgR-DNA ComplexâA 40-bp DNA fragment containing the TtgR operator was used for these assays. It was obtained by assembling two complementary oligonucleotides (5â²-CAGCAGTATTTACAAACAACCATGAATGTAAGTATATTCC-3â² and its complementary oligonucleotide). Annealing was carried out by mixing equimolar amounts (60 Î¼m) of each oligonucleotide in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm MgCl2). The mixture was incubated at 95 Â°C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Both, DNA and TtgR protein were subsequently dialyzed in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Mg acetate, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). TtgR (typically 15â20 Î¼m) was placed into the ITC cell and titrated by the addition of the 40-bp DNA fragment. When protein saturation was reached, i.e. when measured heat changes corresponded to those observed in the titration of buffer with DNA, the experiment was stopped and the cell content adjusted to a volume of 1.437 ml. The completeness of protein saturation with DNA was verified by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the DNA-TtgR complex was titrated with effector molecules as described above. The titration of unbound TtgR with effector molecules was carried out on the same day using the same chemicals, exactly the same ligand concentrations and injection volumes, which guarantees that the absence/presence of DNA is the only difference between both assays. In all cases, the mean enthalpies measured from the injection of the ligand into the buffer were subtracted from raw titration data before data analysis with ORIGIN software (MicroCal). Titration curves were fitted by a non-linear least squares method to a function for the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule (44Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). From the curve thus fitted, the parameters ÎH (reaction enthalpy), KA (binding constant, KA = 1/KD), and n (reaction stoichiometry) were determined. From the values of KA and ÎH, the changes in free energy (ÎG) and in entropy (ÎS) were calculated with the equation: ÎG =âRT lnKA =ÎH â TÎS, where R is the universal molar gas constant, and T the absolute temperature. In Vivo Susceptibility of P. putida DOT-T1E to Plant AntimicrobialsâAs mentioned above, the implication of the TtgABC/TtgR system in the organic solvent tolerance and multidrug resistance of DOT-T1E was previously reported (21TeraÌn W. Felipe A. Segura A. Rojas A. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G.

Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the particularly broad substrate specificity of this efflux system and the multidrug binding capacity of its cognate repressor TtgR raised the question concerning their physiological role(s). Based on the fact that the plant rhizosphere is one of the natural habitats of P. putida, and considering that the AcrB transporter from the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora, involved in the resistance of this strain to various plant defense metabolites (27Burse A. Weingart H. Ullrich M.S. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), is 60% identical to the TtgB transporter from P. putida DOT-T1E, we investigated the potential role of TtgABC in the resistance to plant-derived antimicrobials. To verify this hypothesis, the MICs of five plant secondary metabolites known to have antibacterial activities (45Rauha J.P. Remes S. Heinonen M. Hopia A. Kahkonen M. Kujala T. Pihlaja K. Vuorela H. Vuorela P. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 56: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 46Dastidar S.G. Mahapatra S.K. Ganguly K. Chakrabarty A.N. Shirataki Y. Motohashi N. In Vivo. 2001; 15: 519-523PubMed Google Scholar, 47Tegos G. Stermitz F.R. Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3133-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) were determined for both, P. putida DOT-T1E and its derivative mutant strain DOT-T1E18, deficient in the TtgABC efflux pump (Table 2). To different extents, the wild type strain was susceptible to all of the compounds tested. The susceptibility of DOT-T1E18 to phloretin, quercetin, and naringenin was significantly increased, suggesting that the TtgABC efflux pump confers resistance to these compounds. In contrast, no differences in the susceptibilities to coumestrol and berberine were detected, indicating that these compounds are probably not substrates of this pump. To corroborate this fact and given that antimicrobial activity of plant secondary metabolites is often masked by the concerted action of multiple MDR efflux pumps with similar substrate profiles (47Tegos G. Stermitz F.R. Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3133-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), the MICs were determined in the presence of the MC207110 inhibitor, known to inhibit certain RND efflux pumps (48Renau T.E. Leger R. Flamme E.M. Sangalang J. She M.W. Yen R. Gannon C.L. Griffith D. Chamberland S. Lomovskaya O. Hecker S.J. Lee V.J. Ohta T. Nakayama K. J. Med.

Watkins W. Hoshino K. Ishida H. Lee V.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In the presence of this inhibitor, the susceptibilities of both strains to phloretin, quercetin, naringenin, and even coumestrol dramatically increased. Interestingly, the DOT-T1E18 mutant still showed increased susceptibilities to these compounds as compared with its parental strain. This indicates, first, that coumestrol is, in addition to phloretin, quercetin, and naringenin, also a substrate of the TtgABC pump and, second, that the TtgABC efflux pump is not (or not completely) inhibited by MC207110. This hence suggests the existence of other pump(s) that are impaired by MC207110 and expel the same compounds, accounting for the high level of resistance of P. putida DOT-T1E to these natural antimicrobials. Furthermore, the low MIC values obtained for coumestrol (0.78 Î¼g/ml) or quercetin (4.2 Î¼g/ml) are comparable with those found for clinically relevant antibiotics (35Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G. Hurtado A. Ramos J.L. Segura A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 37Duque E. Segura A. Mosqueda G. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which points to the antibacterial potential of these natural compounds against Pseudomonas sp. strains when used in combination with MDR inhibitors. No MIC variation was detected for berberine, indicating that this plant alkaloid is not a TtgABC substrate. Taken together, these data confirm the role of this MDR pump in the high resistance of P. putida DOT-T1E to several plant antimicrobials present in the rhizosphere.TABLE 2Susceptibilities of P. putida DOT-T1E and derivative mutant strain to different plant antimicrobialsStrainMC207110MICPhloretinQuercetinCoumestrolBerberineNaringenin10 Î¼g/mlmmDOT"

The effects that Trigger Factor exerts on nascent polypeptides, however, remain unclear. Here we analyzed the potential of the Trigger Factor to shield nascent polypeptides at the ribosome. A set of arrested nascent polypeptides differing in origin, size, and folding status were synthesized in an Escherichia coli-based in vitro transcription/translation system and tested for sensitivity to degradation by the unspecific protease proteinase K. In the absence of Trigger Factor, nascent polypeptides exposed outside the ribosomal exit tunnel were rapidly degraded unless they were folded into a compact domain. The presence of Trigger Factor, as well as a Trigger Factor fragment lacking its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain, counteracted degradation of all unfolded nascent polypeptides tested. This protective function was specific for ribosome-tethered Trigger Factor, since neither non-ribosomal Trigger Factor nor the DnaK system, which cooperates with Trigger Factor in the folding process in vivo, revealed a comparable efficiency in protection. Furthermore, shielding by Trigger Factor was not restricted to short stretches of nascent chains but was evident for large, non-native nascent polypeptides exposing up to 41 kDa outside the ribosome. We suggest that Trigger Factor supports productive de novo folding by shielding nascent polypeptides on the ribosome thereby preventing untimely degradation or aggregation processes.

Downstream of TF, the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE (referred to as KJE) and GroEL-GroES chaperone systems assist further folding steps to the native state (2Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A.

Together these chaperones form a folding network of considerable robustness. Thus, the lack of TF can be compensated by activity of the KJE system, while simultaneous deletion of dnaK and the TF encoding tig gene results in synthetic lethality at â¥30 Â°C and massive protein aggregation (11Deuerling E.

Recently, three different crystal structures of 50 S ribosomes in complex with the N-terminal ribosome-binding domain of TF were solved allowing for the modeling of the entire chaperone bound to the large ribosomal subunit (5Ferbitz L.

On one hand, these structural models consistently suggest that TF hunches over the ribosomal exit site (Fig. 1B) thereby orienting its hydrophobic inner surface toward emerging nascent polypeptides. On the other hand, the models predict different volumes for the space formed by the ribosomal surface and the N-terminal tail and C-terminal arms of TF.

These contradictory models of the conformation of TF on the ribosome make it difficult to define a mechanism of action for TF and do not further clarify what effects TF exerts on nascent polypeptides. However, they imply that part of the intrinsic chaperone function of TF at the ribosome is to form a protective shield restricting the accessibility of nascent chains to the crowded cellular environment. Here we assign this basic shielding function to TF. Applying protease protection assays in an in vitro transcription/translation system we (i) probed for the proteolytic sensitivity of nascent polypeptides, (ii) examined the potential of TF to provide a protected environment for diverse nascent polypeptides differing in size and folding status, and (iii) analyzed whether the cooperating KJE chaperone system acting downstream of TF can substitute for TF in protecting nascent polypeptides from proteolytic degradation. Cloning of Src Homology 3 (SH3) and m10 ConstructsâTo arrest SH3 and m10 domains at the ribosome, SH3 and m10 coding sequences lacking stop codons were fused at their 3â² ends to a nucleotide sequence encoding a 41-aa linker that contained a flexible serine/glycine-rich region (GSGGGSG) and the SecM arrest sequence. SH3 and m10 domains were amplified from pBAT4 plasmids (17Blanco F.J. Angrand I. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by PCR using the primer NcoI-f (5â²-GATATATCCATGGTTGATGAAACTGGAAAAGAGC-3â²), which introduced an additional gtt codon following the start codon, and the primer BamHI-r (5â²-GCCAGAGCCACCGCCGGATCCATCTAGTTTTTTCACATAGGC-3â²). The linker was amplified using pUC19StrepFtsQSecM (18Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Jenni S. Brooks III, C.L. Ban N. Frank J. Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as template and primers BamHI-f (5â²-GGATCCGGCGGTGGCTCTGGCTCTGAAAAGGGTTATCGCATTG-3â²) and HindIII-r (5â²-CGCCAAGCTTATCAATGCATCATCATCATC-3â²). Resultant PCR products were utilized in two different fusion PCR reactions (either SH3 and linker or m10 and linker) with NcoI-f and HindIII-r as primers. Fusion products were digested with NcoI and HindIII and ligated into pBAT4, which had been cut with NcoI and HindIII to excise the SH3 insert, giving rise to the plasmids pBAT4-SH3-SecM and pBAT4-m10-SecM. Plasmid pBAT4-m10-SecM was used to construct vectors coding for two to five m10 domains (with individual m10 domains separated by either a short GASS or a GSGS linker dependent on the restriction site introduced for cloning). Plasmid pBAT4-m10-SecM served as template in two different PCR reactions amplifying the m10 sequence (primers BamHI-f2 (5â²-GCGGATCCGGCTCTATGGTTGATGAAACTGG-3â²) and SacII-r (5â²-GCCACCGCCCGCGGAATCTAGTTTTTTCAC-3â²)) or the SecM linker (primers SacII-f (5â²-CTGGGTTCCGCGGGCGGTGGCTCTGGCTCTG-3â²) and HindIII-r). PCR products were digested with BamHI and SacII or SacII and HindIII, respectively, and ligated together into pBAT4-m10-SecM digested with BamHI and HindIII resulting in pBAT4-2m10-SecM encoding for an m10 dimer. Similarly, plasmid pBAT4-m10-SecM was used as template to amplify the m10 sequence using the primers BamHI-f2 and XhoI-r (5â²-CGCTCGAGGCTCCATCTAGTTTTTTCAC-3â²) or the primers XhoI-f (5â²-GCCTCGAGCATGGTTGATGAAACTGG-3â²) and SacII-r. PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI or XhoI and SacII, respectively, and both products were ligated into pBAT4-2m10-SecM digested with BamHI and SacII giving rise to the pBAT4-3m10-SecM plasmid containing three consecutive m10 sequences. To generate plasmid pBAT4-4m10-SecM, a sequence encoding two m10 domains was amplified using pBAT4-2m10-SecM as template and XhoI-f and SacII-r as primers. The amplified product was digested with XhoI and SacII and ligated into the pBAT4-3m10-SecM vector digested with XhoI and SacII. The final plasmid pBAT4-5m10-SecM encoding for a stalled m10 pentamer was constructed by cloning an additional m10 domain (amplified by PCR from pBAT4-m10-SecM with primers XhoI-f and XhoI-r and digested with XhoI) into the pBAT4-4m10-SecM plasmid linearized with XhoI.

SH3 and m10 constructs were expressed from the plasmids depicted above. Wild type (wt) and mutant L23 VSE/AAA ribosomes were purified as described below and added to the t/t system in a final concentration of 400 nm. Ribosome Purificationâwt ribosomes were purified from strain MC4100 Îtig (11Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B.

Strains were grown at 37 Â°C to an A600 nm of 1.0 in LB medium (wt) or LB medium supplemented with 250 Î¼m isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside (VSE/AAA mutant), harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1.5 ml/g wet pellet S30 buffer (50 mm triethanolamine (pH 8.0), 50 mm KOAc, 15 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After cell lysis by French press and removal of cell debris by centrifugation (2 times 30,000 Ã g, 30 min, 4 Â°C), cleared supernatants (concentration of KOAc adjusted to 1 m in a final volume of 15 ml) were loaded onto 45-ml high salt sucrose cushions (25% sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine (pH 8.0), 1 m KOAc, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 4 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol). Ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation (44,000 rpm, 4 h, 4 Â°C) in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman), rinsed with S30 buffer and resuspended overnight on ice in S30 buffer. The high salt sucrose cushion centrifugation was repeated, and pelleted ribosomes were resuspended overnight on ice in storage buffer (50 mm triethanolamine (pH 8.0), 50 mm KOAc, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 4 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol), aliquotted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 Â°C. Proteinase K DigestsâSynthesis of [35S]Methionine-labeled constructs in the in vitro t/t system was performed in the presence of chaperones or bovine serum albumin (BSA) added in concentrations of 5 Î¼m (BSA, TF, NC, TF-FRK/AAA, DnaK) and 1 Î¼m (DnaJ, GrpE). 15-20 min after initiation, translation was stopped with 2 mm chloramphenicol (arrested polypeptides) or 2 mm puromycin (released polypeptides), and subsequently proteinase K (PK) was added in a final concentration of 5 Î¼g/ml. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 5C, BSA and TF were not present during synthesis but added posttranslationally 5 min before PK. In co-translational PK digests, arrested ICDH or m10 dimer (2m10) were synthesized in the presence of 1 Î¼m TF, TF-FRK/AAA, or BSA, and PK was added during ongoing translation (8 min (ICDH) or 5 min (2m10) after initiation of expression) in final concentrations of 0.7 Î¼g/ml (ICDH) or 1 Î¼g/ml (2m10). Posttranslational digests were carried out on ice, co-translational digests at 37 Â°C. Before (0 min), 2 min, and 4 min after the addition of PK, aliquots were taken, treated with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inhibit PK, and loaded onto sucrose cushions (20% sucrose, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm KOAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 4 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm chloramphenicol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2.5 volumes cushion per 1 volume of sample). Ribosome-nascent chain complexes were pelleted by centrifugation in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman) at 74,000 rpm for 70 min at 4 Â°C. Ribosomal pellets (arrested constructs) or supernatants (released constructs) were separated on Tricine gels, and 35S-labeled polypeptides were visualized by autoradiography. Trigger Factor Shields Nascent Polypeptides from DegradationâWe investigated the potential of TF to shield nascent polypeptide chains by protease protection experiments in an in vitro transcription/translation system (t/t system) derived from Escherichia coli Îtig cells, which allows the controlled co- or posttranslational addition of TF and its mutant variants. [35S]Methionine-radiolabeled nascent chains derived from different model proteins were generated. One model protein was E. coli ICDH (417 aa, 46 kDa), a previously identified in vivo substrate of TF (12Deuerling E. Patzelt H. VorderwuÌlbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), of which we synthesized a truncated construct (177 aa, 19 kDa). The conformation of this truncated ICDH version cannot be deduced from the known atomic structure of full-length ICDH (25Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9317-9322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To investigate substrates with defined structures, we generated nascent polypeptides derived from the SH3 domain of Î±-spectrin and its mutant variant m10. While wt SH3 folds into a small (62 aa, 7 kDa) globular Î²-sheet structure (26Musacchio A. Noble M. Pauptit R. Wierenga R. Saraste M. Nature. 1992; 359: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), m10 harbors two point mutations (W41G and W42V) that prevent native folding and instead generate a random coil structure (17Blanco F.J. Angrand I. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To produce arrested SH3 and m10 polypeptides exposing the entire SH3 or m10 domains outside the ribosomal exit tunnel, we introduced a C-terminal 41-aa linker. This linker carried the SecM stalling sequence known to arrest translation and was long enough to extend through the entire length of the ribosomal peptide tunnel (27Evans M.S. Ugrinov K.G. Frese M.A. Clark P.L. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To probe for degradation of nascent chains, the model substrates were synthesized in the presence of TF or an equal concentration of BSA as control and the unspecific protease proteinase K was added after translation. In the absence of TF, the arrested SH3 domain showed significant resistance to proteinase K indicating that ribosome-tethered SH3 reaches a protease-resistant, folded state (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 9). In contrast, proteinase K treatment resulted in almost complete degradation of the arrested chains of m10 (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 10) and ICDH (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5) in the absence of TF, which suggests that truncated ICDH is not compactly folded. Thus our experimental setup allows to discriminate between folded and unfolded states of ribosome-associated nascent chains. The presence of TF, which was added prior to the start of protein synthesis in a concentration (5 Î¼m) sufficient to saturate ribosomes (400 nm), strongly reduced degradation of m10 and ICDH nascent chains by proteinase K (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 12; Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 6). This protection was not due to competition between TF and nascent chains for degradation by proteinase K, since (i) addition of BSA in the control reaction did not prevent degradation of nascent chains (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 10; Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5), and (ii) TF remained stable during proteinase K treatment (data not shown). Protection by TF was not dependent on the type of protease employed in our system, since TF also shielded ICDH (19 kDa) and m10 from proteolytic attack by trypsin (data not shown). These results show that nascent chains exposed outside the ribosomal tunnel are highly sensitive to proteolysis unless they have a compact fold. Furthermore, they demonstrate that TF is capable of restricting the accessibility of non-native m10 (11 kDa) and ICDH (19 kDa) constructs. Assuming that 35 aa (4 kDa) of nascent chains are buried inside the ribosomal tunnel, TF protected polypeptides of 7 and 15 kDa, respectively. Ribosome Attachment Is Prerequisite for the Shielding Function of TFâTo determine whether the protective activity of TF requires its association with the ribosome, we employed a t/t system with ribosomes mutated in the L23-docking site of TF (L23-VSE/AAA) (4Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. VorderwuÌlbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and added the TF-FRK/AAA mutant protein, which is selectively defective in ribosome association (4Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. VorderwuÌlbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the protective effect of TF was abolished for the arrested m10 and ICDH polypeptides as both constructs were efficiently degraded by proteinase K in the presence and absence of TF-FRK/AAA (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we tested whether TF protects newly synthesized proteins after their release from the ribosome. When non-arrested ICDH (19 kDa) and m10 domain (7 kDa, lacking the linker with the SecM-arrest sequence) were produced in the presence of wt ribosomes and wt TF, TF failed to prevent the degradation of these soluble polypeptides by proteinase K (Fig. 3B). We conclude that TF displayed its shielding effect solely for nascent chains still attached to ribosomes and that ribosome binding of TF was prerequisite for this protective function. Trigger Factor Protects Large Nascent PolypeptidesâWe evaluated the size limits of the nascent polypeptides, which can be protected by TF. Of interest was to compare the functionality of full-length TF with a TF fragment (NC, Fig. 1A) that lacks the PPIase domain, which is located distant to the ribosomal peptide tunnel exit (5Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 19Kramer G. Rutkowska A. Wegrzyn R.D. Patzelt H. Kurz T.A. Merz F. Rauch T. VorderwuÌlbecke S. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3777-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To generate nascent chains of varying length but unaltered folding status, we constructed genes encoding an m10 dimer (2m10, 19 kDa), trimer (3m10, 26 kDa), tetramer (4m10, 34 kDa), or pentamer (5m10, 41 kDa), each with the C-terminal SecM-arrest sequence and short linkers connecting the m10 domains (Fig. 1C). The m10 variants were synthesized in the t/t system in the presence of BSA, TF, or the NC fragment of TF lacking the PPIase domain. Upon subsequent addition of proteinase K all m10 constructs synthesized in the presence of BSA were highly susceptible to degradation revealing faster degradation kinetics with increasing size (Fig. 4A, compare for example lanes 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28). The presence of TF or NC retarded proteolysis of all m10 constructs tested. While TF and the NC fragment similarly left the majority of monomeric and dimeric m10 undigested after 2 min of proteinase K treatment (Fig. 4A, lanes 17, 18, 20, and 21), full-length TF was slightly more efficient in protecting larger nascent chains exposing more than 15 kDa outside the ribosomal tunnel (Fig. 4A, compare for example lanes 23 and 24). In similar experiments with arrested ICDH polypeptides of 19, 32, 39, and 45 kDa, TF and NC shielded all tested polypeptides from degradation by proteinase K as compared with the BSA control (Fig. 4B). In the case of the ICDH constructs, degradation kinetics did not correlate with size suggesting different folds in the different truncations (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 13, 16, 19, and 22). In this set of experiments, a contribution of the PPIase to the shielding activity of TF was detectable for the 32- and 39-kDa truncations but not for the 19- and 45-kDa constructs (Fig. 4B, e.g. compare lanes 17 and 18 and 20 and 21 with lanes 14 and 15 and 23 and 24). These findings show that NC provides the major contribution to the shielding activity of TF, which is evident for large non-native nascent polypeptides exposing up to 41 kDa outside the ribosomal tunnel. TF Is Able to Protect Arrested Nascent Chains Co- and PosttranslationallyâIn all experiments described above, proteinase K was added after translation. To confirm that TF shields nascent polypeptides during ongoing translation, we added proteinase K to our t/t system immediately after initiation of translation. In the absence of TF, proteinase K addition resulted in the rapid degradation of nascent m10 dimer and 19-kDa ICDH construct, since no accumulation of these products was observed in contrast to the control reactions lacking proteinase K (Fig. 5, A and B, compare lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11 with lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). The presence of TF at a 2.5-fold molar excess over ribosomes, which closely resembles the molar ratio found in vivo, reduced proteolysis of both constructs as demonstrated by the accumulation of the arrested nascent chains over time (Fig. 5A, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Indirect chaperone effects of TF, such as a putative stabilization of translation factors, can be excluded as the protective effect was not observed when the binding of TF to ribosomes was impaired (Fig. 5B, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12).

In human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), extracellular TNFR1 (type I TNF receptor, TNFRSF1A) is generated by two mechanisms, proteolytic cleavage of soluble TNFR1 ectodomains and the release of full-length 55-kDa TNFR1 in the membranes of exosome-like vesicles. TNFR1 release from HUVEC is known to involve the association between ARTS-1 (aminopeptidase regulator of TNFR1 shedding), an integral membrane aminopeptidase, and TNFR1. The goal of this study was to identify ARTS-1 binding partners that modulate TNFR1 release to the extracellular space. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library showed that NUCB2 (nucleobindin 2), via its helix-loop-helix domains, binds the ARTS-1 extracellular domain. The association between endogenous ARTS-1 and NUCB2 in HUVEC was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which showed the formation of a calcium-dependent NUCB2Â·ARTS-1 complex that associated with a subset of total cellular TNFR1. Confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that this association involved a distinct population of NUCB2-containing intracytoplasmic vesicles. RNA interference was utilized to specifically knock down NUCB2 and ARTS-1 expression, which demonstrated that both are required for the constitutive release of a full-length 55-kDa TNFR1 within exosome-like vesicles as well as the inducible proteolytic cleavage of soluble TNFR1 ectodomains. We propose that calcium-dependent NUCB2Â·ARTS-1 complexes, which associate with TNFR1 prior to its commitment to pathways that result in either the constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles or the inducible proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains, play an important role in mediating TNFR1 release to the extracellular compartment.

TNF signals through two distinct cell surface receptors, the 55-kDa, type I (TNFR1, TNFRSF1A, CD120a) and the 75-kDa, type II (TNFR2, TNFRSF1B, CD120b) TNF receptor (3Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). TNFR1, which contains a death domain motif within its intracytoplasmic region, is thought to be the key receptor for TNF signaling (2Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Binding of TNF to TNFR1 results in the translocation of TNFR1 to lipid rafts, where it associates with the adaptor proteins, TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and TNFR-associated factor 2, with resultant NF-ÎºB activation (3Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 8Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

TNFR1 and RIP within the lipid rafts are then ubiquitinated, which leads to their degradation via the proteasome pathway (12Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed by which TNFR1 can initiate apoptosis. One model proposes two sequential signaling complexes, with the initial formation of a TNFR1, TRADD, RIP1, and TNFR-associated factor 2 signaling complex I at the plasma membrane, followed by an intracytoplasmic complex II comprising TRADD, RIP1, FADD, and caspase-8 that mediates cell death in the absence of NF-ÎºB activation (13Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). A recent study described the ligand-dependent formation of a TNFR1-associated death-inducing signaling complex that was dependent upon receptor internalization within endocytic vesicles, termed TNF receptosomes (14Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schutze S. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In this model, receptor internalization allows the recruitment of TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 to form a TNFR1-associated death-inducing signaling complex within TNF receptosomes. TNF receptosomes then fuse with trans-Golgi vesicles to form multivesicular endosomes with resultant activation of acid sphingomyelinase and cathepsin D. TNF activity can be regulated by the generation of extracellular TNF receptors that function as TNF-binding proteins. TNFR1 can be released from cells to the extracellular compartment by two distinct pathways. The first pathway involves the proteolytic cleavage of soluble receptor ectodomains. The major TNFR1 cleavage site is the spacer region adjacent to the transmembrane domain between Asn-172 and Val-173, with a minor site located between Lys-174 and Gly-175 (15Wallach D. Aderka D.

TNF-Î±-converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM17) has been implicated in the proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1, based on the finding that TACE-deficient cells had lower ratios of shed to cell surface TNFR1 than cells reconstituted with TACE (18Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The receptor sheddase(s) responsible for TNFR1 cleavage, however, remain incompletely defined (2Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

The second pathway by which TNFR1 can be released to the extracellular compartment is in the membranes of exosome-like vesicles. Exosomes are small membrane-enclosed vesicles, 30-200 nm in diameter, that correspond to the internal vesicles of endolysosome-related multivesicular bodies and are released from the cell via exocytic fusion with the plasma membrane (20Gould S.J.

A full-length, 55-kDa TNFR1 is constitutively released from human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) within exosome-like vesicles of 20-50 nm in diameter that can be pelleted by high speed centrifugation and sedimented to a density of 1.1 g/ml and are capable of binding TNF (24Hawari F.I.

These HUVEC-derived TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles contained silencer of death domains but did not contain TRADD, RIP, or TNFR-associated factor 2, which suggests that these vesicles do not possess intrinsic signaling capabilities. In contrast to exosomes derived from reticulocytes and B lymphocytes, the HUVEC-derived TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles did not contain lipid raft microdomains (25de Gassart A. Geminard C. Fevrier B.

The goal of this study was to characterize the mechanisms regulating the release of TNFR1 from human vascular endothelial cells into the extracellular compartment. ARTS-1 (aminopeptidase regulator of TNFR1 Shedding) has been identified as a type II integral membrane protein that associates with full-length, 55-kDa TNFR1 and promotes TNFR1 release from human vascular endothelial cells (27Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F.N. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that additional regulatory proteins may interact with ARTS-1 and promote TNFR1 release. Here, we identify NUCB2 (nucleobindin 2)/NEFA(DNAbinding,EF-hand, acidic amino acid region) as a calcium-dependent, ARTS-1-binding protein that regulates the constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles to the extracellular compartment as well as the inducible proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains to generate soluble TNFR1.

Transformed yeast colonies were grown on selective medium (SD/Gal/Raf/-His/-Leu/-Trp/-Ura), and colonies that activated both the LEU2 and lacZ reporter genes were selected by growth and development of blue color. The identity of positive clones was determined by automated fluorescent sequencing. AntibodiesâA chicken anti-NUCB2 antibody was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that corresponded to the NUCB2 C-terminal leucine zipper domain amino acids 326-420 (Sigma).

The mouse anti-human monoclonal transferrin receptor antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). ImmunoblottingâHUVEC were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% n-octyl-Î²-d-glucopyranoside, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl (Sigma), supplemented with Completeâ¢ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined utilizing the BCA kit (Pierce). For immunoblots of HUVEC conditioned supernatants, cells were grown in medium that contained fetal bovine serum that had been depleted of exosomes by centrifugation at 175,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C for 16 h. Prior to immunoblotting, the conditioned supernatants were cleared of cells and debris by sequential centrifugation at 200 Ã g for 10 min, 500 Ã g for 10 min, 1,200 Ã g for 20 min, and 10,000 Ã g for 30 min. Cellular proteins (50 Î¼g/lane) or conditioned supernatants (26 Î¼l/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-12% Bis-Tris Nupage gels (Invitrogen), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 at 4 Â°C, and incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Pico (Pierce)) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For repeated blotting, membranes were stripped using the Re-blot Western blot recycling kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and reacted with antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometry was performed using NIH Image software (version 1.63). Immunoprecipitation of NUCB2, ARTS-1, and TNFR1âHUVEC were lysed in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl (Sigma) supplemented with Completeâ¢ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and protein concentrations were determined utilizing the BCA kit (Pierce). Samples (200 Î¼g) of HUVEC lysates were incubated for 2 h with either 10 Î¼g of the chicken anti-NUCB2 antibody, 1 Î¼l of the rabbit anti-ARTS-1 antibody, or 25 Î¼g of the murine TNFR1 antibody bound to 100 Î¼l of immobilized protein A/G beads (Pierce), which had been blocked with 1% ovalbumin. Preimmune serum and protein A/G beads without bound antibodies were used as controls. Beads were washed six times with cold lysis buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibodies that react with NUCB2, ARTS-1, or TNFR1. Remaining proteins in lysates were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence utilizing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies as described above. RNA Interference and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCRâThe NUCB2 short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex (GUGCGAAGAUAGAACCACCUU and GGUGGUUCUAUCUUCGCAUU) was obtained from Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD). Control siRNA duplexes that target chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as a nonsense, nonsilencing sequence were also purchased from Qiagen-Xeragon. Pools of four individual siG-ENOME ARTS-1 RNA duplexes and a pool of siCONTROL nontargeting RNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). HUVEC were transfected with 25 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Assays were performed 4 days post-transfection for NUCB2 knockdown experiments and 3 days post-transfection for ARTS-1 knockdown experiments. RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit and QIAshredder (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA templates were prepared with the Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase-directed ProSTAR Ultra-HF RT-PCR system (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). The following primers were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) and utilized for real time RT-PCR: NUCB2 (5â²-TAGGAGCCAAGACCCATCTC-3â² and 5â²-GCAATACTGTAGCAGGATGGTC-3â²), ARTS-1 (5â²-TCTACTTTCCTCACTGTTGGCTCTC-3â² and 5â²-TTTCGTGGTTCCCCAGAAGGTC-3â²), TNFR1 (5â²-CTGCCAGGAGAAACAGAACACC-3â² and 5â²-GACCAAAGAAAATGACCAGGGG-3â²), TACE (5â²-AGAGCAGATTCGCATTCTCAAGTC-3â² and 5â²-TGAAAAGGTGTGCCAAGCAAAC-3â²), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5â²-TGACAACTTTGGTATCGTGGAAGG-3â² and 5â²-AGGGATGATGTTCTGGAGAGCC-3â²). Real time RT-PCR was performed for 40 cycles using the Bio-Rad iCycler iQ real time PCR thermocycler and iQ SYBR green PCR supermix (Hercules, CA). Quantification of the RT-PCR products normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was performed using iCycler iQ data analysis software. Immunofluorescence Confocal Laser-scanning MicroscopyâHUVEC were grown on collagen I-coated, 2-well slides (BD Biosciences) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with PBS containing 10% donkey and 10% goat serum for 1 h. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with primary antibodies, diluted in PBS containing 1% donkey and 1% goat serum, at the following concentrations: goat anti-TNFR1 (C20) polyclonal antibody (2 Î¼g/ml), rabbit polyclonal anti-ARTS-1 antibody (diluted 1:2000), chicken polyclonal anti-NUCB2 antibody (diluted 1:1000), mouse anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody (5 Î¼g/ml), and mouse anti-GM130 monoclonal antibody (8 Î¼g/ml). Cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa FluorÂ® 488 or Alexa FluorÂ® 568 at a 1:200 dilution (Molecular Probes). Cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized utilizing a Leica SP laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Quantification of Extracellular TNFR1 Release by ELISAâFor constitutive TNFR1 release, cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting NUCB2 for 4 days or ARTS-1 for 3 days, and fresh, exosome-depleted medium was added for an additional 24 h. For IL-1Î² experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes, as described above, and stimulated with IL-1Î² for 2 h. Conditioned supernatants were collected and cleared of cells and debris as described for immunoblotting. The quantity of TNFR1 that accumulated in culture supernatants was determined using a Quantikine sandwich ELISA kit with a sensitivity of 7.8 pg/ml (R & D Systems). Quantification of Cell Surface TNFR1âCells were transfected with siRNA duplexes as described above, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and harvested by incubation for 10 min with Versene (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.02% EDTA without calcium, magnesium, or trypsin) and reacted with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies against TNFR1 or an IgG1 isotype control (R & D Systems). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using an EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL). Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide uptake, and 10,000 events were recorded for each sample. Results are presented as mean fluorescence intensity corrected for background fluorescence, as determined with the IgG1 isotype control. Isolation of Exosome-like Vesicles from Conditioned Medium by Sequential CentrifugationâExosome-like vesicles were isolated from HUVEC supernatants as previously described (24Hawari F.I. Rouhani F.N. Cui X. Yu Z.X. Buckley C. Kaler M. Levine S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HUVEC were grown in exosome-depleted medium, and conditioned supernatants were cleared of cells and debris as described for immunoblotting. Conditioned supernatants were then centrifuged for 16 h at 175,000 Ã g in a S70Ti rotor to sediment small, secreted vesicles (Beckman-Coulter). Proteins in the resultant pellet were analyzed by Western blotting. Statistical AnalysesâData sets were analyzed by a paired Student's t test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A p value of â¤0.05 was considered significant. Identification of NUCB2 as an ARTS-1-binding ProteinâA yeast two-hybrid screen of a placenta cDNA library was performed to identify ARTS-1-interacting proteins. Twelve positive clones were identified from 106 transformants, screened with a bait fusion protein composed of the ARTS-1 extracellular domain (27Cui X. Hawari F. Alsaaty S. Lawrence M. Combs C.A. Geng W. Rouhani F.N. Miskinis D. Levine S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Three clones contained a cDNA that corresponded to nucleotides 1011-1188 of NUCB2 (NEFA), which encodes the second, third, and fourth helix-loop-helix domains, as well as the acidic amino acid-rich region between the EF-hand sequences. The interaction between the NUCB2 calcium-binding, helix-loop-helix, EF-hand domain and the ARTS-1 extracellular domain in the yeast two-hybrid system is shown in Fig. 1A. Nonspecific interactions were not detected with either the ARTS-1 bait protein or the NUCB2 prey protein. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that endogenous ARTS-1 and NUCB2 were associated in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, both the 100-kDa ARTS-1 and 55-kDa TNFR1 co-immunoprecipitated with NUCB2 from HUVEC lysates. Reciprocally, both NUCB2 and the 55-kDa TNFR1 co-immunoprecipitated with ARTS-1 (Fig. 1C), whereas both NUCB2 and the 100-kDa ARTS-1 co-immunoprecipitated with TNFR1 (Fig. 1D). Additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to quantify the interaction among NUCB2, ARTS-1, and TNFR1. As shown in Fig. 1, E-G, 91-100% of the 100-kDa ARTS-1 co-immunoprecipitated with NUCB2, whereas 54-60% of TNFR1 co-immunoprecipitated with NUCB2 or ARTS-1. Taken together, these data are consistent with the formation of a NUCB2Â·ARTS-1 complex that is associated with a subset of total cellular TNFR1. Since NUCB2 shares significant homology with NUCB1, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to assess whether ARTS-1 also binds NUCB1. Immunoprecipitation of NUCB1 did not pull down either ARTS-1 or TNFR1 from HUVEC lysates, whereas immunoprecipitation of ARTS-1 pulled down TNFR1 but not NUCB1 (data not shown). Thus, NUCB1 does not appear to function as an ARTS-1 binding partner in HUVEC. Immunofluorescence confocal laser-scanning microscopy experiments were performed to assess further the interactions among ARTS-1, NUCB2, and TNFR1 in HUVEC cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, ARTS-1 and NUCB2 co-localized in diffusely distributed vesicles, as well as in a perinuclear circumferential pattern. NUCB2 and TNFR1 co-localized in a similar distribution, as did ARTS-1 and TNFR1 (Fig. 2, B and C). Additional experiments were performed to characterize the subcellular localization of NUCB2, ARTS-1, and TNFR1. Both NUCB2 and ARTS-1 showed partial co-localization in a perinuclear distribution with the endoplasmic reticulum marker KDEL but did not co-localize with the cis-Golgi marker, GM130 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the vesicular pattern of NUCB2 expression did not co-localize with trans-Golgi markers (TGN 38, p47A, Vti1b) or the medial Golgi marker, mannosidase II. NUCB2 also did not co-localize with markers of early endosomes (EEA1), late endosomes (Rab7), recycling endosomes (Rab8), lysosomes (LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LAMP-3, cathepsin D), or mitochondria (Mitotracker) (data not shown). In contrast to NUCB2 and ARTS-1, TNFR1 did not co-localize with either endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi markers. Taken together, these data suggest that in HUVEC, the association between NUCB2, ARTS-1, and TNFR1 involves a distinct population of NUCB2-containing vesicles.FIGURE 3Subcellular localization of NUCB2 by immunofluorescence confocal laser-scanning microscopy. HUVEC were reacted with primary antibodies that recognize NUCB2 (A), ARTS-1 (B), or TNFR1 (C) as well as antibodies that recognize KDEL or GM130. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or Alexa Fluor 568 (red). Nuclei (blue) were stained with DAPI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NUCB2 Promotes the Constitutive Release of TNFR1 Exosome-like VesiclesâRNA interference was utilized to specifically knock down NUCB2 levels in HUVEC. Exogenously administered siRNA duplexes corresponding to NUCB2 nucleotides 342-362 down-regulated NUCB2 mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B) levels after 4 days, as compared with cells transfected with control siRNAs targeting chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, GFP, or a nonsense, nonsilencing sequence. The down-regulation of NUCB2 was specific, since levels of ARTS-1, TNFR1, or TACE mRNA and protein were not altered (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, siRNA duplexes did not induce an interferon response, since there was no increase in STAT1 protein expression above base-line levels as demonstrated by Western blotting (data not shown) (28Sledz C.A.

https://openalex.org/W2079021353,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates nutrient-dependent cell growth and proliferation through cytoplasmic targets, such as S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). Consistent with its main function in the cytoplasm, mTOR is predominantly cytoplasmic. However, previously we have found that mTOR shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and we have proposed that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of mTOR is required for the maximal activation of S6K1. The intrinsic signals directing mTOR nuclear transport and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study we initially set out to identify nuclear export signals in mTOR. A systematic scan of the mTOR sequence revealed 16 peptides conforming to the canonical leucine-rich nuclear export signal, of which 3 were found by reporter assays to contain leptomycin B-sensitive and leucine-dependent nuclear export activity. Unexpectedly, mTOR proteins with those conserved leucines mutated to alanines were unable to enter the nucleus. Further investigation revealed that the L982A/L984A and L1287A/L1289A mutations likely induced a global structural change in mTOR, whereas the L545A/L547A mutation directly impaired the nuclear import of the protein, potentially regulated by a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling signal. The loss of nuclear import was accompanied by the significantly reduced ability of the L545A/L547A mutant to activate S6K1 in cells. Most importantly, when nuclear import was restored in the L545A/L547A mutant by the addition of an exogenous nuclear import signal, signaling to S6K1 was rescued. Taken together, our observations suggest the existence of a nuclear shuttling signal in mTOR and provide definitive evidence for the requirement of mTOR nuclear import in its cytoplasmic signaling to S6K1.

Most importantly, when nuclear import was restored in the L545A/L547A mutant by the addition of an exogenous nuclear import signal, signaling to S6K1 was rescued. Taken together, our observations suggest the existence of a nuclear shuttling signal in mTOR and provide definitive evidence for the requirement of mTOR nuclear import in its cytoplasmic signaling to S6K1.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), primarily mediated by the ribosomal subunit S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), both regulators of mitogen-stimulated translation initiation (4Fumagalli S.

In conjunction with other signaling pathways, notably the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, mTOR regulates S6K1 and 4E-BP1 by directly phosphorylating both proteins (6Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C.

Furthermore, the rictor-mTOR complex has turned out to be the long-sought kinase for Ser-473 of Akt (15Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar), critical for the activation of Akt. Consistent with its primary target being the translational machinery, mTOR is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, associated with a variety of intracellular membrane structures (16Sabatini D.M.

However, a small fraction of mTOR is found in the nucleus at steady state (21Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Drenan R.M. Liu X. Bertram P.G. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 772-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and mTOR shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, as evidenced by its nuclear accumulation in cells treated with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the export receptor Crm1 (21Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we have found that the nuclear shuttling of mTOR is critical for the signaling to its cytoplasmic targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1. This conclusion is based on the following observations (21Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23Park I.H. Bachmann R. Shirazi H. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31423-31429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar): (a) LMB treatment inhibited S6K activation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation; (b) mTOR with increased nuclear export activity (via tagging with an exogenous nuclear export sequence (NES)) had diminished capacity to activate S6K/4E-BP1; (c) mTOR with increased nuclear import activity (via tagging with an exogenous nuclear import signal (NLS)) had enhanced signaling capacity toward S6K/4E-BP1; and (d) when mTOR was supplemented by an increasing number of NLSs (one, two, and four copies), its ability to signal to S6K in the cell first increased and then decreased, suggesting that an optimal rate of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, but not nuclear import or export per se, leads to maximal signaling. This has led us to postulate that mTOR may have distinct functions in the nucleus and that it undergoes shuttling to coordinate its roles in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Such counterintuitive behavior of a cytoplasmic signaling protein has also been observed in Ste5, a scaffold protein in the yeast mating pathway (24Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the collective evidence for the role of mTOR nuclear shuttling is compelling, the studies so far have largely relied on engineered mTOR proteins with exogenous NLS and NES. Identification of the intrinsic nuclear transport signals and characterization of their role in mTOR function will be pivotal for the validation of the functional significance of mTOR nuclear shuttling and the dissection of the transport mechanism. At 289 kDa, mTOR must depend on active import and export mechanisms to traverse the nuclear pore. However, no classic NLS defined by clusters of basic residues is found in the primary sequence of mTOR. It is possible that mTOR may piggyback on another protein that undergoes standard importin-dependent nuclear import, or alternatively, mTOR may employ an unconventional mechanism to enter the nucleus. A growing number of proteins, predominantly signal transducers, have been found to travel through the nuclear pore by directly interacting with the nuclear pore complex (25Xu L. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of mTOR, on the other hand, appears to be more conventional; inhibition by LMB suggests a Crm1-dependent export mechanism. In this study, we set out to characterize NES-like sequences in mTOR. Our investigation led to the identification of a site required for the nuclear import of mTOR and provided definitive evidence for the functional link between mTOR nuclear shuttling and its signaling to cytoplasmic targets. Cell CultureâBoth monkey kidney epithelial CV-1 cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2. Transient transfection was performed at â¼60% cell density using PolyFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The detailed transfection conditions are described below. Antibodies and Other ReagentsâAnti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and anti-HA polyclonal antibody were obtained from Sigma and Clontech, respectively. Anti-Myc 9E10.2 ascites were generated by Covance. All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Rapamycin and LMB were purchased from Calbiochem and Biomol, respectively. Reporter Assays for Nuclear Export ActivityâpBJ5-FRB-HA and pBJ5-Gal4BD-3xFKBP12-FLAG (26Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Prof. Gerald Crabtree (Stanford University School of Medicine). pBJ5-FRB-HA was modified by the insertion of an oligonucleotide linker into the SalI site to introduce a KpnI site between FRB and HA. Double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding putative NES sequences with KpnI and SalI overhangs were ligated into the modified pBJ5-FRB-HA at KpnI and SalI sites. CV-1 cells cultured on glass coverslips in 12-well plates were co-transfected with pBJ5-FRB-NES-HA and pBJ5-Gal4BD-3xFKBP12-FLAG at 1 Î¼g of each DNA/well using PolyFect (Qiagen). 24 h after transfection the cells were replenished with fresh medium and treated by 100 nm rapamycin with or without 20 ng/ml of LMB for 5 h. The cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, respectively. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with FluoroSave (Calbiochem) and examined with a Leica inverted fluorescence microscope. Fluorescent images were recorded with a CCD camera using the SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Construction of Full-length mTOR MutantsâSite-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). To construct the full-length mTOR L545A/L547A, L982A/L984A, and L1287A/L1289A mutants, the EcoRV-SmaI, SmaI-EcoRI, and EcoRI-EcoRI fragments of mTOR cDNA were cloned into pGEX-2T, pUC19, and pCR2.1-TOPO, respectively, where mutagenesis was carried out. The entire fragments subjected to mutagenesis were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of random mutations. The EcoRI-EcoRI fragment carrying the L1287A/L1289A mutations then replaced the wild-type fragment in pcDNA3-FLAG-mTOR/S2035T (27Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For the L545A/L547A and L982A/L984A mutants, the EcoRV-EcoRI fragment was first reconstituted in the mutagenesis plasmids by inserting SmaI-EcoRI and EcoRV-SmaI fragments, respectively. The mutated EcoRV-EcoRI fragments then replaced the wild-type fragment in pcDNA3-FLAG-mTOR/S2035T without the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment. Finally, the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of mTOR was inserted to yield full-length cDNA. Subcellular Localization of mTORâFull-length mTOR constructs containing various mutations were transfected into CV-1 cells plated on glass coverslips in 12-well plates at 1 Î¼g/well using PolyFect. 24 h after transfection, some of the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml of LMB for 8 h. The cells were immunostained with the anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by microscopy as described earlier. mTOR Kinase AssayâVarious mTOR constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells cultured in 60-mm plates at 5 Î¼g/plate. After 24 h, the cells were lysed and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed. Autophosphorylation assays were carried out with the immunocomplex as previously described (27Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). S6K1 Kinase AssayâVarious mTOR constructs and Myc-S6K1 (28Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells cultured in 6-well plates at 2 Î¼g of mTOR and 0.5 Î¼g of S6K1 using PolyFect. 24 h after transfection, the cells were switched to serum-free medium. After serum starvation for 24 h, the cells were treated with 100 nm rapamycin for 30 min, followed by stimulation with 20% fetal bovine serum for 30 min. The cells were then lysed, Myc-S6K1 was immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc ascites, and the immunocomplex was subjected to in vitro S6 kinase assay as described previously (21Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Identification of Potential Nuclear Export Signals in mTORâBecause the nuclear export of mTOR is inhibited by LMB, the specific inhibitor of Crm1, we reasoned that mTOR might contain one or more leucine-rich NESs. These classic NESs are characterized by several conserved leucines with defined spacing between them, initially identified in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) Rev (29Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) and protein kinase A inhibitor (30Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). A survey of NESs identified to date suggested that other hydrophobic residues could substitute for some of the leucines (26Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell.

Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), allowing us to generate a more encompassing motif (see Fig. 1A). A thorough scan of the mTOR primary sequence using the pattern identification program Pattinprot (34Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) revealed 16 sequences (9-13 amino acids in length) as potential NESs in mTOR (Fig. 1A). To test whether any of these NES-like sequences in mTOR could function as a nuclear export signal, we utilized a reporter system developed by Klemm et al. (26Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), depicted in Fig. 1B. This reporter system is composed of two main elements: the first is a fusion protein containing the putative NES and the FKBP12-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of mTOR (amino acids 2015-2114) (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), which diffuses freely through the nuclear pore because of its small size (â¤13 kDa); the second is a fusion protein of GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1-147) and three tandem copies of FKBP12, which localizes to the nucleus due to the presence of a strong NLS in GAL4. The two fusion proteins are co-expressed in cells, and they form a complex in the presence of rapamycin, the small molecule that simultaneously binds FRB and FKBP12. If the putative NES indeed functions as a nuclear export signal and is strong enough to counter the NLS of the GAL4 fusion, the complex, and thus the GAL4 fusion, will be translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Thus, the GAL4 fusion protein serves as a reporter for nuclear export activity conferred by the putative NES. The epitope tags HA and FLAG are present on the FRB-NES and the reporter, respectively, to allow immunostaining for visualizing protein localization in the cells. We fused FRB to each of the 16 putative NESs and introduced the fusions into CV-1 cells together with the reporter by transient transfection. Subsequently, the transfected cells were treated with rapamycin for 2-5 h, and the reporter localization was examined. As a positive control, in >90% of the doubly transfected cells Rev-NES induced a significant nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation of the reporter protein upon the addition of rapamycin (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, 3 of the 16 candidate sequences displayed nuclear export activity comparable with that of Rev-NES in the reporter assays: peptides number 5 (amino acids 535-547), 10 (amino acids 975-984), and 12 (amino acids 1281-1289), whereas the others had no or very low export activity; results for peptide 15 (amino acids 2115-2123) are shown as an example. Similar results were obtained in COS-7 cells (data not shown). In conclusion, three peptide sequences from mTOR can function as NESs exogenously. The Activity of Putative NESs in mTOR Requires Conserved Leucines and Is Inhibited by LMBâTo examine whether the export activity of the sequences identified above requires the conserved leucines that are essential for the export activity of Rev NES, the last two leucines in those peptide sequences (see Fig. 1) were changed to alanines (designated âAAâ), and their effects on export activity were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3A, these alanine mutations abolished export activity in all three peptides in >90% of the doubly transfected cells. Hence, these putative NESs have sequence requirements comparable with the canonical NES. The export activity of the canonical leucine-rich NES is Crm1-dependent and thus is sensitive to LMB inhibition. Previously we have found that LMB treatment leads to mTOR nuclear accumulation, suggesting a Crm1-dependent process for mTOR export. If the NES sequences identified here are responsible for mTOR export, one would expect that they are also inhibited by LMB. Indeed, LMB treatment completely eliminated the export activity of all three putative NESs (Fig. 3B). Mutations of Putative NES in mTOR Eliminate the Nuclear Import of mTORâTo investigate whether the putative mTOR NESs are responsible for the nuclear export of mTOR, we introduced the AA mutations described above into full-length mTOR separately and in all possible combinations. These mutants are designated mTOR-5/AA (L545A/L547A), mTOR-10/AA (L982A/L984A), mTOR-12/AA (L1287A/L1289A), mTOR-5/AA and -10/AA, mTOR-10/AA and -12/AA, mTOR-5/AA and -12/AA, and mTOR-3AA (the last one contains all three pairs of alanine mutations). Wild-type mTOR exhibits predominantly cytoplasmic staining, but we would expect the appropriate mutant proteins to accumulate in the nucleus if one or more of these NESs is fully responsible for mTOR nuclear export. However, when these mutant proteins were transiently expressed in CV-1 cells, none of them exhibited any visually detectable shift from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 4A). Although we considered the possibility that none of these three sequences served as a strong NES for full-length mTOR, we recognized that such a conclusion could only be drawn if these mutant mTOR proteins retained the normal nuclear import activity. To address this issue, we treated the cells expressing wild-type or various mutants of mTOR with LMB and examined the localization of the recombinant proteins. The wild-type protein displayed increased nuclear staining upon LMB treatment as previously reported, but this localization shift was completely absent in all of the mutants (Fig. 4B). Therefore, it appeared that these mutants were not able to enter the nucleus as efficiently as the wild-type, suggesting that the nuclear import activity of the mutants had been impaired. A simple explanation for this observation was that the mutations that targeted the putative NESs abolished nuclear localization signals in mTOR as well. The combined presence of NLSs and NESs in the same primary sequences have been previously labeled as nucleocytoplasmic shuttling signals and are not readily defined by known motifs (36Michael W.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 46-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Disruption of mTOR Nuclear Import Leads to Impaired Downstream SignalingâTo further characterize the full-length mTOR alanine mutants, we assessed their catalytic activity by measuring in vitro auto-phosphorylation. Previously we found that the catalytic activity of mTOR was independent of its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity (21Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, if the only defects of the alanine mutants were in nuclear transport, one would expect them to display wild-type catalytic activity. However, 10/AA and 12/AA suffered different degrees of reduction in their activity (Fig. 5A). Because both the kinase domain and the major autophosphorylation site (Ser-2481) (37Peterson R.T. Beal P.A. Comb M.J. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7416-7423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) are located in the C-terminal half of mTOR and the N-terminal half of the protein has been shown to be dispensable for autophosphorylation (27Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the 10/AA and 12/AA mutations are not likely to directly affect the kinase activity measured by autophosphorylation. Thus, global protein structural alterations in mTOR-10/AA and mTOR-12/AA cannot be ruled out, even though it seems unlikely that two leucine-to-alanine conversions would elicit such a drastic change. mTOR-5/AA, on the other hand, autophosphorylated as well as the wild-type protein (Fig. 5A), confirming the structural integrity of this mutant. We went on to examine the ability of the mTOR mutants to signal to the downstream effector S6K1 in cells. The S2035T mutation that confers rapamycin resistance to mTOR was present in all mTOR variants used here, including the wild-type, which allowed assessment of the recombinant mTOR activity upon âchemical knock-outâ of endogenous mTOR function by rapamycin (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 38Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recombinant mTOR and S6K1 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells treated with rapamycin, and the recombinant S6K1 activity was measured by in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 5B, the 5/AA and 10/AA mutations in full-length mTOR diminished serum-stimulated S6K1 activity by â¼75 and 60%, respectively, whereas mTOR-12/AA was completely inactive toward S6K1. The latter observation also confirmed that the rapamycin-insensitive rictor-mTOR activity had no impact on S6K1 activity in this assay. mTOR proteins with various combinations of these mutations displayed signaling activities as would be expected: whenever 12/AA was present the signaling activity of mTOR was abolished; the 5/AA and 10/AA mutations had additive effects on inhibiting S6K1 activation. 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation assessed by gel mobility shift was similarly affected by those mutations (data not shown), although a quantitative measurement was not feasible. The partial and complete loss of signaling capacity in 10/AA and 12/AA, respectively, did not correlate with the degree of reduction in their catalytic activity and might be partly attributable to potential changes in their nuclear transport activity and/or global structure. Of particular interest, the signaling activity of mTOR-5/AA was also significantly lower than that of wild-type even though its catalytic activity was intact. The impaired signaling ability of the 5/AA mutant may likely be a direct consequence of the singular disruption in nuclear import activity of the mutant, consistent with the notion that nuclear entry of mTOR is required for its downstream signaling. An Exogenous NLS Restores Nuclear Import of 5/AA but Not 10/AA or 12/AAâWe reasoned that if any of the mutations described above indeed resulted in ablation of both nuclear export and import, the potential loss of nuclear export might be revealed by providing the mutant protein an exogenous NLS. Four copies of NLS from SV-40 large T antigen (39Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) were engineered to express at the N terminus of the 3AA mutant, designated 4xNLS-3AA. As shown in Fig. 6A, whereas 4xNLS-mTOR displayed enhanced nuclear staining and almost exclusive nuclear staining upon LMB treatment, 4xNLS-3AA stayed in the cytoplasm even in the presence of LMB. Because it is highly unlikely that this mutant gained LMB-insensitive nuclear export activity, the best explanation for its behavior is cytoplasmic retention, due either to the impairment of a normal release mechanism or simply misfolding of the protein. To find out whether mutations of the three putative NES regions contributed equally or differentially to this behavior, we g"

Ma3 is a member of a family of six genes in humans whose protein products contain homology to retroviral Gag proteins.

Although nonoverlapping triplet reading of mRNA codons is the essence of genetic decoding, dynamic nonstandard events at specific sites can permit product diversity and provide regulatory options. One of these recoding events involves shifting to an alternative reading frame by a proportion of ribosomes, thereby changing the linearity of readout. Such utilized frameshifting commonly features both a âshifty siteâ in the mRNA and an appropriately positioned structural feature in the mRNA that acts to enhance the level of frameshifting, i.e. it is programmed. Although the shift involved can be to either alternative frame, a shift to the â1 frame often involves tRNAs in both the A and P sites detaching from their codons and re-pairing to mRNA at the two overlapping â1 frame codons (1Jacks T. Madhani H.D. Masiarz F.R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 2Baranov P.V. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. RNA. 2004; 10: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This tandem detachment and re-pairing usually occurs on a âslipperyâ heptanucleotide sequence that follows the general pattern of X XXY YYZ where the A and P site tRNAs detach from the zero frame codons XXY YYZ and re-pair after shifting 1 nucleotide to XXX YYY.

The most common 3â² recoding signals for â1 frameshifting are pseudoknots (4Brierley I. Digard P. Inglis S.C.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11315-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A less common type of pseudoknot is the kissing stem-loop found in the human coronavirus, HCV229E (8Herold J. Siddell S.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but bioinformatic studies suggest that it may be involved for transmissible gastroenteritis virus frame-shifting also (9Baranov P.V. Henderson C.M. Anderson C.B. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Howard M.T. Virol. 2005; 332: 498-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Examples of genes that require â1 frameshifting for expression are well known in viral genomes. There is only one demonstrated case of â1 frameshifting in a mammalian cellular gene (10Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Walls E. Watson C.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Reith A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Manktelow E. Shigemoto K. Brierley I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but it does not display the phylogenetic breadth of the +1 frameshifting utilized in decoding antizyme mRNA, conserved from mammals to yeasts (12Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frameshifting near the end of a coding sequence often allows a proportion of ribosomes to access an ORF that extends beyond the zero frame terminator so that the transframe (coupled ORF) protein is longer than that of standard decoding. The easiest class of â1 programmed frame-shift events to search for is one that has conserved architecture of two ORFs that partially overlap and contains a defined shift site. In these cases conservation of an independent ORF2 helps to distinguish significant candidates from a genomic background that contains sequencing errors and pseudogenes. However, cases such as the Escherichia coli dnaX gene, which utilizes a â1 frameshift to cause a proportion of ribosomes to access a stop codon in the new frame near the frameshift site, demonstrate that frameshifting can be utilized to yield an additional product that lacks a carboxyl-terminal domain of the product of standard decoding. In attempting to identify cases of this nature, searches for two long and partially overlapping ORFs will be fruitless because ORF2 will be wholly contained within the sequence encoding ORF1 and can be small or nonexistent. In addition to identifying an appropriate pair of ORFs that will support a given type of recoding, a specific frameshift site must be identified. The classic heptanucleotide â1 shift site followed by a pseudoknot, as described above, provides a straightforward target for bioinformatic searches. Other possible shift sites are less well defined and thus more complicated to identify. For example, the potential for both A and P site tRNAs to re-pair in the new frame can be difficult to discern (13Licznar P. Mejlhede N. PreÌre M.F. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Fayet O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In yet other cases, our current knowledge does not adequately predict the likelihood of frameshifting (14Atkins J.F. Herr A.J. Massiere C. O'Connor M. Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Garrett R.A. Douthwaite S.R. Liljas A. Matheson A.T. Moore P.B. Noller H.F.

Virol. 2003; 77: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A recent case in point is that reported for the generation of polyalanine runs from long CAG tracts in the MJD-1 transcript (related to a late onset neurodegenerative disorder) where there is no conventional heptanucleotide frame-shift site (16Toulouse A. Au-Yeung F. Gaspar C. Roussel J. Dion P. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2649-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Diverse approaches are needed to discern the extent to which programmed â1 frameshifting is utilized in decoding eukaryotic cellular genes. Here we report a functional â1 frameshifting site in a mammalian cellular gene, Ma3, identified by a bioinformatic analysis of mRNA sequences searching for a classic heptanucleotide shift site followed by a pseudoknot and contained in the overlap between two ORFs. A counterpart exists in the human Ma5 gene, but the 3â² stimulator was not analyzed in detail. Ma3 and Ma5 are members of a family of mammalian genes whose protein products are the target of immunity associated with paraneoplastic disorders whose symptoms, though associated with tumors elsewhere in the body, are not directly caused by the tumors or the treatment of them. These disorders are often the consequence of an autoimmune response to antigens ectopically expressed in the tumor cells that target the protein(s) normally expressed by the affected cells. Ma1 is expressed in the brain and testis, Ma2 in the brain, and Ma3 in the brain and testis and to a lesser extent in the trachea, kidney, and heart. Immunity to Ma2 and sometimes additional immunity to Ma1 and Ma3 are associated with brainstem encephalitis and cerebral degeneration (17Rosenfeld M.R. Eichen J.G. Wade D.F. Posner J.B. Dalmau J. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 339-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the human paraneoplastic antigen Ma3 gene contains a functional heptanucleotide shift sequence and a classical H-type pseudoknot that promotes â1 frameshifting at â¼20% efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic AnalysisâPrograms written in Perl were used to analyze 20,763 human mRNA sequences from the RefSeq data base at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/). The sequences were searched for ORF pairs in which ORF1 was the annotated coding sequence (CDS) and ORF2 extended at least 300 nt beyond ORF1 and was in the â1 frame relative to it. The overlapping sequences from these 5,709 ORF pairs were searched for the retrovirus-like heptanucleotide shift sites, A AAA AAC, U UUA AAC, G GGA AAC, and U UUU UUA, shown in the zero reading frame (18Hatfield D.L. Levin J.G. Rein A. Oroszlan S. Adv. Virus Res. 1992; 41: 193-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For the 1,153 sequences where such a motif was found, a 50-nt region downstream from the shift site was analyzed with the zipfold server (19Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10393) Google Scholar) to determine the minimum free energy of potential secondary structures. Sequences that had a ÎG of â8 kcal/mol or less were analyzed with mfold (19Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10393) Google Scholar, 20Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar) to generate graphical representations of all available folds. These RNA secondary structure graphics were inspected manually to search for stem-loops that could be extended to pseudoknots with similarity to known frameshift stimulators. Protein Sequence AnalysisâSearches with the Ma3 protein sequence were conducted with Psi-BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. SchaÌffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar) in the nr data base at NCBI. Supplemental Table S2 shows the species and accession number of sequences considered to be homologs to Ma3. Sequences were searched for protein coding domains with the HMMER algorithm using the Pfam data base (22Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Birney E. Bateman A. Durbin R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Protein sequences from orthologs of the Ma3 gene in human, chimp, macaque, orangutan, mouse, and rat were aligned with ClustalX (23Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35593) Google Scholar). Columns that contained any gaps were removed, and a phylogenetic tree was bootstrapped by the neighbor joining method also using ClustalX. The trees were prepared for publication with TreeView (24Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Clones for in Vitro and in Vivo Frameshifting AssaysâThe 435-nt region of Ma3 containing the shift site and potential kissing loops sequence was amplified by PCR using primers ATATTAGGTCACCAGGCTGCAGTTGAGTCGGGAAAC and ATATTAGGTACCAGGGGTGGTTGGATGAGCAGGAC (BstEII and KpnI restriction sites underlined) for the GST-Î²-globin vector, pGB01 (25Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Either a human brain cDNA library (Invitrogen) or human genomic DNA (Promega) was used as template for the PCRs. Following amplification, the products were restricted and run on an agarose gel. The correct sized fragments were isolated from a gel slice and ligated into BstEII/KpnI-digested pGB01. A series of deletions was generated using primers to the appropriate 3â² sequence and cloned as above. For the constructs containing mutations in the human Ma3 pseudoknot sequence or WT mouse Ma 3 and human Ma 5, complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized containing the overhangs for BstEII and KpnI. The polylinker region of the dual luciferase vector, p2luc (26Grentzmann G. Ingram J. Kelly P.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. RNA. 1998; 4: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was modified to introduce additional cloning sites. A region of p2luc was amplified by PCR using the following primers: ATATAAGTCGACTTGGATCCCCCGGGGAGCTCAGATCTACGGGCCCTCTCGAGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAGAAAGGC (SalI, BamHI, SmaI, SacI, BglII, ApaI, and XhoI sites underlined) and CCAGAGGAATTCCATTA TCAGTGCAATTGTTTTGTC (EcoRI site underlined). The 692-bp PCR fragment was digested with SalI and EcoRI and ligated into p2luc, also digested with SalI and EcoRI, generating the vector, p2lucj. The human Ma3 pseudoknot sequence was introduced on complementary oligonucleotides containing the overhangs for SalI and XhoI that were cloned into the SalI/XhoI-digested p2lucj. All of the sequences were verified by automated dideoxy sequencing. In Vitro Frameshifting Assaysâ100 Î·g of plasmid DNA from the GST-Î²-globin constructs was added to a 10-Î¼l TnT T7-coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Incubations were carried out at 30 Â°C for 1 h. Following treatment with 100 Î¼g/ml RNase A at room temperature for 10 min, 30 Î¼l of SDS sample buffer was added. The products were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. The data were collected on a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging instrument and analyzed by ImageQuant software. The frameshifting efficiencies were determined by normalizing for the number of methionine residues in each product and calculating the percentage of frameshifting [frameshift/(termination + frameshift)] Ã 100%. The WT human Ma3 pseudoknot sequence promotes frameshifting at â¼20%. The efficiencies of the mutant, mouse Ma3, and human Ma5 sequences are reported relative to WT Ma3 (100%). All of the constructs were assayed at least three times, and the average is reported. In Vivo Frameshifting AssaysâThe dual luciferase assays were performed as previously described (9Baranov P.V. Henderson C.M. Anderson C.B. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Howard M.T. Virol. 2005; 332: 498-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A putative â1 frameshift site was identified in the human paraneoplastic antigen Ma3 gene. The original accession for Ma3 was NM_013364.1, and this sequence was used for the bioinformatic analysis. Shortly after work began on the experimental analysis of Ma3, NM_013364.1 was updated by NCBI staff to a new version, NM_013364.2, in which the sequence was revised. An internal region of 121 nt was deleted removing the heptanucleotide shift site. To resolve the conflict between these two sequences, diagnostic PCRs of human brain cDNAs with primers flanking the reported deletion were performed to determine whether the transcript was spliced as indicated by the revised sequence. No evidence for splicing was observed (data not shown). PCR products were also generated from the same cDNA library using primers specific to the 5â² coding sequence of the initiating Ma3 reading frame and the 3â² coding sequence of the â1 reading frame. These PCR fragments were cloned, and several clones were sequenced. There were no spliced variants, although there was evidence of editing in regions distant from the frameshift site in a minority of cases (data not shown). The potential frameshift site in Ma3, G GGA AAC, is followed by a 6-nt spacer and a predicted classical H-type pseudoknot. The Ma3 sequence further 3â² of the predicted pseudoknot was inspected, and two additional potential stem-loop structures were discovered, the loops of which could interact with the first stem-loop to form kissing loops (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the region tested encompassed the potential kissing loops sequence (411 nt 3â² of the putative frameshift site) that included the potential pseudoknot. The â1 Frameshift Event Is Efficient in Reticulocyte LysatesâTo determine whether the predicted frameshift site in Ma3 is functional, the region including 15 nt 5â² and 411 nt 3â² of the G GGA AAC frameshift site was amplified by PCR. The region was cloned between two ORFs, glutathione S-transferase, and rabbit Î²-globin, such that â1 frameshifting was required for expression of the 3â² ORF. The vector, pGB01, contained a T7 promoter, and frameshifting activity was monitored in a coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The cloned region of the Ma3 sequence, +411, promoted â1 frameshifting at a level of 20% (Fig. 1B). To investigate the importance of the potential RNA structures, a series of deletions was constructed that successively removed the predicted structural elements, and the effects on â1 frameshifting were measured. Removal of the potential distal and proximal kissing loop structures, as well as sequences 3â² of the potential pseudoknot, constructs +374, +271, +198, and +122, had a small positive effect on the frameshifting (Fig. 1B and Table 1). The potential pseudoknot sequence, +53, supported frameshifting at the same level as the sequence encompassing both the potential proximal and distal kissing loops. In contrast, a construct containing only the first stem-loop of the predicted pseudoknot, +37, showed a dramatic reduction in frameshifting to 25% of the entire pseudoknot sequence (WT). Interestingly, when U34 was changed to C in the construct containing only the first stem-loop (+37 C34), allowing the formation of a G-C pair in place of a G:U wobble pair, frameshifting was observed at 54% of the wild type level (Table 1). The basal level of frameshifting with the G GGA AAC shift site and the 6-nt spacer (+6) was 4% of WT (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Mutation of the frameshift site to C GGC AAC to prevent tandem tRNA slippage further reduced frameshifting to 1% of WT (Fig. 1B and Table 1).TABLE 1The effect of mutations on â 1 frameshiftingConstructEffectWT%+411WT proximal and distal KL100+374Deletion of distal KL120+271Proximal KL126+198Deletion of proximal KL125+122Deletion of proximal KL124+53 (WT)Pseudoknot100+37Stem 1 only25+37, C34Strengthened stem 1 only54+6Frameshift site and spacer4C GGC AACMutant frameshift site1C8C9Disrupt stem 14G35G36Disrupt stem 18C15C16Disrupt stem 13G28G29Disrupt stem 12C8C9::G35G36Restore stem 162C15C16::G28G29Restore stem 142C23Disrupt stem 29G50Disrupt stem 214G24Disrupt stem 24C49Disrupt stem 219C23G24Disrupt stem 23C49G50Disrupt stem 214C23:G50Restore stem 2120G24:C49Restore stem 274C23G24::C49G50Restore stem 281G18U19Mutant loop 1120ÎA26Delete bulged A3C26Change bulged A21Human Ma5Pseudoknot54Mouse Ma3Pseudoknot75C34Stem 1150A1Spacer52G5Spacer115G18Loop 1108A40Loop 2120 Open table in a new tab Testing the Potential Pseudoknot Structure in VitroâSequences containing the presumptive pseudoknot were sufficient to stimulate a high level of â1 frameshifting. The pseudoknot structure was tested by making disruptive mutations in stems 1 and 2 as well as double mutations that restored the base pairing in the stems (Fig. 2A). The disruptive mutations in stem 1, C8C9, C15C16, G35G36, and G28G29 gave drastic reductions in â1 frameshifting, to 4, 3, 8, and 2% of WT, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 2â5, and Table 1). In constructs where the compensatory mutations would restore base pairing in stem 1, â1 frameshifting was observed at 62 (C8C9::G35G36) and 42% (C15C16::G28G29) of WT (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7, and Table 1). The disruptive mutations in stem 2 also showed a greatly reduced level of frameshifting, C23, 9%; G24, 4%; C23G24, 3%; G50, 14%; C49, 19%; and C49G50, 14% of WT (Fig. 2C, lanes 3â8, and Table 1). The restorative constructs resulted in frameshifting levels relative to WT of 120% for C23:G50, 74% for G24:C49, and 81% for C23G24::C49G50 (Fig. 2C, lanes 9â11, and Table 1). It is interesting to note that restoring stem 2 resulted in activity closer to the wild type level than for restoring stem 1, as has been observed for other recoding stimulator pseudoknots (27Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6991-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Chamorro M. Parkin N. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Other features of the pseudoknot were tested by making mutations. Changing the sequence of loop 1 from CA to GU, G18U19, had a positive effect on frameshifting (120% of WT) (Fig. 2B, lane 9, and Table 1). The presence of a presumptive unpaired A26 residue between stems 1 and 2 is reminiscent of the âbulgedâ A that induces a kink between two stems and is required for efficient frameshifting at the gag-pro junction in mouse mammary tumor virus (29Shen L.X. Tinoco Jr., I. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 963-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Chen X. Chamorro M. Lee S.I. Shen L.X. Hines J.V. Tinoco Jr., I. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 842-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When the A26 residue was changed to C, C26, frameshifting was reduced to 21% of WT (Fig. 2C, lane 13, and Table 1). More strikingly, when A26 was deleted, frame-shifting was virtually eliminated, 3% of WT (Fig. 2C, lane 12, and Table 1), indicating the importance of the A residue and raising the possibility that it is responsible for causing a required kink between the stems. Ma5 and other Ma3 genes contain a putative â1 frameshift site, G GGA AAC, followed by a potential pseudoknot (see below). The frameshift regions from human Ma5 and mouse Ma3 were tested for activity in reticulocyte lysates. The human Ma5 sequence was 54% as efficient as the human Ma3 sequence, whereas the mouse Ma3 sequence was 75% as efficient (Table 1). There are five nucleotide differences between the mouse and human Ma3 pseudoknot regions. One change, U34 â C replaces a G:U wobble pair in stem 1 in human Ma3 with a G-C pair, which should increase the thermodynamic stability of the stem. The effect of the G10-C34 base pair in the context of the human Ma3 pseudoknot is to increase frameshifting to 150% of WT (Fig. 2B, lane 8, and Table 1). Two of the other nucleotide differences between the mouse and human sequences occur in the spacer region. Replacement of G1 by A or A5 by G in the human sequence resulted in 52 and 115% of WT frameshifting (Table 1). The remaining two nucleotide differences occur in the loop regions of the pseudoknot. Replacing C18 in loop 1 with G or G40 in loop 2 with A in the human sequence increased frameshifting to 108 and 120% of WT, respectively (Table 1). Testing the Pseudoknot Sequence in VivoâThe human Ma3 pseudoknot sequence promotes efficient â1 frameshifting in vitro.To test whether frameshifting is functional in vivo, the pseudoknot region was cloned into a dual luciferase reporter where expression of the 3â² reporter, firefly luciferase, is dependent on â1 frameshifting. The plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were measured in cell lysates. The Ma3 pseudoknot promoted â1 frameshifting at a level of 18%, comparable with the in vitro level of 20% (data not shown). Orthologs in Other OrganismsâHomology searches with BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. SchaÌffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar) using human paraneoplastic Ma3 sequence revealed similar Ma3 genes in mouse, rat, chimpanzee, and macaque. The alignment of the pseudoknot sequences shows that the stem regions are highly conserved, whereas there are some differences in the spacer and loops (currently the only chimp sequence available ends at the zero frame terminator codon within the pseudoknot). In the rodents, stem 1 is strengthened by the replacement of the G-U wobble pair (in primates) with a G-C pair. Although these species are closely related, the fact that mutations in the pseudoknot region appear to be accumulating preferentially in the loop and spacer regions suggests selection for the pseudoknot. Family of Ma GenesâThere are currently six genes in the human genome annotated as being part of the paraneoplastic Ma family. These are designated Ma1, Ma2, Ma3, MAOP-1 (Ma4), Ma5, and PNMA6A. We will use Ma6 to refer to PNMA6A in this paper. Each of the sequences was analyzed for frameshifting features and protein coding domains. All of the Ma genes show homology to the same region of various retrotransposon Gag proteins (Fig. 3), although only the Ma2 and Ma3 genes have homology that are assigned e values of less than 0.001 by the HMMER algorithm (22Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Birney E. Bateman A. Durbin R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Ma3 is the only member of the family to contain a CCHC zinc finger. As noted above, Ma5 has the same G GGA AAC shift site and a pseudoknot, distinct but similar in both sequence and structure to the Ma3 pseudoknot. Although Ma6 sequence has the potential to form a strong stem-loop or pseudoknot near the end of ORF1, it is quite different in both structure and sequence from the pseudoknot in Ma3. None of the other Ma genes contain a classical retroviral shift site including the G GGA AAC motif found in Ma3. Phylogenetic analysis of the members of the Ma gene family from various mammals shows that the Ma3 genes from orangutan and crabeating macaque (NCBI GenBankâ¢ accession numbers CR861370.1 and AB062932, respectively) cluster with the Ma2 genes from the other species (Fig. 4). Closer analysis of these gene sequences reveals that they have clearly been incorrectly annotated and are, in fact, Ma2 genes. In this systematic search for new cases of recoding, the first mammalian cellular gene identified with a classic â1 programmed shift site and stimulatory pseudoknot was human Ma3. The Ma3 gene has many features similar to retroelements including conservation of a well defined zinc finger and other regions of the Gag protein from several retrotransposons. However, none of the Ma family of genes code for domains in the Pol protein, i.e. aspartyl protease, reverse transcriptase, or integrase, and thus, they are certainly not associated with any active retroelements. The only previously known mammalian gene to utilize â1 programmed frameshifting in its expression, edr (embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated) in mice (10Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Walls E. Watson C.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Reith A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Manktelow E. Shigemoto K. Brierley I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and PEG10, the homolog in humans, resembles Ma3 in having homology to retroelement gag genes. The CCHC-zinc fingers are similar in Ma3 and edr, but the other retrovirus-like feature in edr, a putative aspartyl protease catalytic site, is absent in Ma3. Interestingly, searches for homology to the Ma3 protein using Psi-BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. SchaÌffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar) reveal that the best homology hits in the sequence data bases are to retroelements from Japanese rice. In these retroelements, however, a single frame encodes the Gag-Pol polyprotein (as is the case with most retroelements in plants (31Gao X. Havecker E.R. Baranov P.V. Atkins J.F. Voytas D.F. RNA. 2003; 9: 1422-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)), whereas Ma3 clearly has a retrovirus-like â1 frameshifting mechanism. This similarity could have resulted from an artifact of the Psi-BLAST search algorithm; inferring phylogeny from homology is not always accurate. It could also suggest that the history of the Ma family of genes is more complex than straight-forward descent from a single retroelement. Proteins encoded by mobile genetic elements occasionally evolve to assume cellular roles (32Gao X. Voytas D.F.

It is perhaps not surprising that a proportion of them also utilize frameshifting, which is well known in the decoding of retroviruses and, to an increasing extent, in retroelements (31Gao X.

NFATs contain two CN binding motifs: PxIxIT and CnBP-B/CNBR2 (which we call LxVP). Here we carry out a detailed comparative analysis of the CN binding activity displayed by the PxIxIT and LxVP sites from different NFATs. Dose-response CN binding experiments with GST fusion proteins of NFATc1 and NFATc2 showed that NFATc1 binds CN in vitro more efficiently than does NFATc2. This difference in binding appears to be caused by the different CN binding potencies of the corresponding LxVP sites; thus while the LxVPc2 peptide fused to GST did not bind CN, GST-LxVPc1 bound it more efficiently than did GST-PxIxITc1 or GST-PxIxITc2. Furthermore, an NFATc2 chimera protein containing the LxVP motif from NFATc1 interacted with CN much more potently than did wild-type NFATc2. Free peptides spanning the LxVP motifs from NFATc1, c3 or c4 displaced CN from GST-NFATc1 and GST-NFATc2 more efficiently than any PxIxIT peptide. PxIxITc2 and LxVPc1 peptides were each able to cross-compete GST-LxVPc1-CN and GST-PxIxITc2-CN binding. In contrast with PxIxITc2, the LxVP peptide not only blocked CN-NFAT binding but also inhibited CN phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, exogenous LxVPc1 blocked NFATc2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in vivo. These results suggest a model in which the different CN binding characteristics of the PxIxIT and LxVP sites enable different NFAT members to influence each others activities in cells where they are co-expressed.

The calcium/calcineurin/NFAT pathway plays a pivotal role in many important biological processes, including the development and function of the immune and nervous systems, patterning of the vasculature, heart valve morphogenesis, and muscle growth and development (1Aramburu J.

This induces their translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus and DNA binding activity, and thus promotes NFAT-dependent gene expression (6Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Binding of NFATs by CN is thus a key step in the activation of this transcription factor family.Calcineurin, also known as protein phosphatase 2B, is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (CnA) tightly bound to a regulatory subunit (CnB). CnA is composed of a catalytic domain and a regulatory domain that contains a CnB binding sequence, a calmodulin (CaM) binding domain and an autoinhibitory segment (7Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity of CnA is regulated by a complex formed by Ca2+ and CnB and CaM; and both regulatory proteins are essential for activity (7Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol.

The finding that CN is the intracellular target of clinically important immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 (24Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3568) Google Scholar) further highlighted the importance of the calcium/CN/NFAT pathway and the particular importance of NFATs in the immune system (25Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 26Liu J. Immunol.

Given the side effects associated with CsA and FK506, the use of these drugs is limited to severe clinical situations such as organ transplantation. The inhibition of CN activity against substrates other than NFAT has been proposed as a cause of the deleterious effects of these drugs. For this reason, specific disruption of the CN-NFAT interaction has attracted interest as a potentially novel way to inactivate NFATs more selectively (28Kiani A. Rao A. Aramburu J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Such a profile has been reported for VIVIT, a high affinity CN-binding peptide based on the PxIxIT consensus sequence (29Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. LoÌpez-RodriÌguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and for INCA small organic molecules (30Roehrl M.H. Kang S. Aramburu J. Wagner G. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7554-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both types of molecule were described as specific NFAT inhibitors on the basis of their ability to disrupt the CN-NFAT interaction whereas having no effect on CN-mediated activation of other substrates.More recently, independent studies on NFATc3 and NFATc1 identified a second CN recognition site close to the C-terminal region of the regulatory region, named CNBR2 and CnBP-B, respectively (17Park S. Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U A. 2000; 97: 7130-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Liu J. Masuda E.S. Tsuruta L. Arai N. Arai K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4755-4761PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary sequence of this motif in CN-regulated NFAT proteins identified a conserved LxVP sequence present in all members. To be consistent with the nomenclature used for the PxIxIT CN docking site, we therefore refer to this second site as the LxVP motif (see Fig. 1A). Deletional analysis of NFATc3 followed by binding competition assays delimited the minimal LxVP motif required for direct CN binding to a 16-amino acid region: DSSGDQFLSVPSPFTW (31Liu J. Masuda E.S. Tsuruta L. Arai N. Arai K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4755-4761PubMed Google Scholar, 32Liu J. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2677-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similar deletional analysis mapped the minimal LxVP CN binding site of the NFATc1 regulatory domain to the homologous sequence DQYLAVPQHPYQWAK (17Park S. Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U A. 2000; 97: 7130-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Although these previous studies shed some light on the importance of these CN binding sites in different NFAT members, their binding characteristics have not been fully characterized. The experiments we present in this report constitute the first detailed evaluation of the relative CN binding activity of the different PxIxIT and LxVP motifs to CN-NFAT binding.

Our experiments show that NFATc1 interacts with CN more strongly than NFATc2, and that the NFATc1 LxVP motif (LxVPc1) binds CN more efficiently than do any of the PxIxIT motifs. We further found that a chimeric NFATc2 protein containing the LxVPc1 motif binds to CN more strongly than does wild-type NFATc2. Moreover, even though the NFATc2 LxVP motif makes little contribution to NFATc2 binding to CN, the peptide corresponding to the NFATc1 LxVP motif is able specifically to prevent NFATc2 activation by blocking its binding to CN and inhibiting its phosphatase activity. These results provide new insights into the CN-NFAT interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidsâThe GST-NFATc1 construct expressing the regulatory region of NFATc1 (1â418 amino acids) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was generously provided by Dr. A. Rao (12Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). GST-NFATc2 was generated by in-frame subcloning of the cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 4â385 of NFATc2 into the BamHI-SmaI-digested pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-NFATc2ÎLxVP construct was generated by fill-in of the EcoRI unique site located upstream the LxVPc2 motif, adding an in-frame stop codon. To generate GST-NFATc1ÎLxVP we first carried out site-directed mutagenesis to generate a second EcoRI site located upstream the LxVPc1 motif (hNFATc1 G381E mutant). This new construct, which contains two EcoRI sites flanking the LxVP sequence, was EcoRI-digested to excise the LxVP motif, and the remaining plasmid was re-ligated. The GST-NFATc2-LxVPc1 swap mutant was generated by in-frame cloning of an annealed double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the LxVPc1 motif into the EcoRI/SalI-digested pGEX-NFATc2 construct.The GST-peptide constructs and GFP-peptide expression vectors were generated by in-frame cloning of the annealed double-stranded overhang oligonucleotides encoding the different peptide sequences into restriction enzyme-digested pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) or pEGFP-C plasmids (Clontech).

Cells were plated on 6-well plates the day before transfection so that they reached 80% confluence on the day of transfection. Cells were transfected with 18 ng of pEF-BOS HA-NFATc2 plus 1.1 Î¼g of GFP-based expression plasmids with 4 Î¼l of Plus reagent plus 6 Î¼l of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) for 3 h in 1 ml of OPTIMEM medium (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry was used to monitor the transfection efficiencies as the percentage of GFP-expressing cells. Similar transfection efficiencies of the different constructs were found in independent experiments.Twenty-four hours after transfection, the culture medium from HeLa-transfected cells was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Two hours later, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) plus 1 Î¼m calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) and 3 mm CaCl2 for 1 h. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.6, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 Î¼m dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 Î¼m benzamidine, 1 Î¼g/ml of pepstatin, 1 Î¼g/ml of aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100). The cellular proteins from suspended cells were extracted during 15 min on a rocking platform, and centrifuged at 14,000 Ã g for 15 min. All steps were performed at 4 Â°C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and Laemmli buffer was added. Total cell extracts were boiled for 10 min, loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels (6% for NFAT or 10% for active CN or GFP), and proteins were separated by electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The protein gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then incubated in blocking solution (10%, w/v skimmed milk in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes with PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS), the membranes were incubated for 2 h with the corresponding first antibody solution: mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (0.05%, v/v) in PBS-T with 1% bovine serum albumin to detect NFATc2; or the rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP serum provided by Dr. I. Crespo (0.1%, v/v) in PBS-T with 5% skimmed milk. Membranes were then washed three times for 5 min each with PBS-T, and incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) or anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS-T and one wash with H2O, membrane-bound antibody was detected with the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences).ImmunofluorescenceâHeLa cells were transfected as described above with 1.2 Î¼g of GFP-based expression plasmid plus 40 ng of pEF-BOS HA-NFATc2. Two hours before stimulation, the culture medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. After stimulation for 30 min with calcium ionophore A23187 (1 Î¼m) and CaCl2 (3 mm), cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 10% formaldehyde PBS containing 4% saccharose. They were then washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were incubated with blocking buffer (10% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 20 min, followed by 1 h of incubation with a 1:500 dilution of 12CA5 anti-HA. The subcellular localization of NFAT proteins was detected by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert-200, Zeiss), with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibody. The percentage of cells with nuclear- or cytosolic-localized NFAT was calculated by scoring at least 130 positive cells per transfection.In Vitro Calcineurin-NFAT Binding AssaysâGST fusion proteins were expressed in the protease-deficient BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain and were purified with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Calcineurin binding assays, with these GST fusion proteins used to pull-down CN, were carried out as follows. Beads containing GST fusion proteins of NFAT regulatory domains (1â2 Î¼g) or of peptides (10â30 Î¼g) were washed twice with binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 6mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Î¼m dithiothreitol, 1 Î¼g/ml of aprotinin, 1 Î¼g/ml of pepstatin, 100 Î¼m benzamidine, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and then incubated with 20 nm calcineurin (Sigma) plus 600 nm calmodulin (Sigma) in binding buffer with or without the corresponding peptide for 30 min on a rocking platform at 4 Â°C. The experiments shown in Fig. 6C were performed using binding buffer without 1.5 mm CaCl2 and in the presence or absence of 600 nm calmodulin. After the incubation, samples were briefly centrifuged at 4 Â°C. The supernatants were saved, and Laemmli buffer was added to them for later analysis (non-bound fraction). The beads were then washed five times with freshly made ice-cold binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the samples in Laemmli buffer (bound fraction). Bound and non-bound fractions were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Calcineurin was detected by Western blotting with a mouse monoclonal anti-CnA antibody (clone G182-1847, PharMingen). All of these binding experiments have been repeated, and the results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Where indicated, the amount of CN bound to GST fusion protein was quantified densitometrically with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).FIGURE 6Effective competition of the interaction of NFATc1 and NFATc2 with activated CN with peptides spanning the LxVP motifs of NFATc1, c3, and c4. A, peptides corresponding to the LxVP motifs from NFATc1, c2, c3, or c4 (32 Î¼m) were used to compete in vitro for activated CN binding to GST-NFATc2 (left) or GST-NFATc1 (right). Because of the high amounts of CN bound to NFATc1, two different exposures are shown (top and middle panels) to show clearly the effect of the peptides on the NFATc1-CN interaction. The bottom blot shows the amount of unbound (free CN in one-third volumes of postreaction supernatants.

The amino acid sequences were: VIVIT peptide, MAGPHPVIVITGPHEE; SCRAMBLED peptide, MVGIPVAIHGTPPHEE; PxIxIT from human NFATc1, PALESPRIEITSCLGL; PxIxIT from human NFATc2, ASGLSPRIEITPSHEL; PxIxIT from human NFATc3, KPFECPSIQITSISPN; PxIxIT from human NFATc4, RVLECPSIRITSISPT; LxVP from human NFATc1, DQYLAVPQHPYQWAK; mutated LxVP from human NFATc1, DQYAAAAQHPYQWAK; LxVP from human NFATc2, ESILLVPPTWPKPLV; LxVP from human NFATc3, DQFLSVPSPFTWSKP; LxVP from human NFATc4, MDYLAVPSPLAWSKA.Calcineurin Phosphatase Activity AssayâThe effect of the indicated peptides on CN enzymatic activity was analyzed with the Biomol green calcineurin assay kit (Biomol), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A combination of CsA (Sandoz) plus cyclophilin A (CyP-A) (Sigma) was employed to inhibit the in vitro calcineurin activity.RESULTSThe CN Binding Activity of NFATc1 Is Higher Than That of NFATc2âTo analyze the ability of NFATc1 and NFATc2 to interact with CN, we conducted in vitro binding experiments. We compared the levels of CN bound to decreasing concentrations of the purified recombinant regulatory domain of NFATc1 or NFATc2 fused to GST protein (GST-NFATc1 and GST-NFATc2, respectively). Densitometric quantification of bound CN in these assays indicated that NFATc1 has a submicromolar binding affinity for CN, and that the affinity of NFATc2 appears to be much lower than that of NFATc1 (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Comparison of CN binding to NFATc1 and NFATc2 in vitro. A, dependence of NFATc1 and NFATc2 binding to CN on NFAT concentration. CN (20 nm) was reacted in pull-down assays with decreasing amounts of the regulatory domain of NFATc2 or NFATc1 fused to GST (GST-NFATc2 and GST-NFATc1). Bound CN was visualized by Western blot with a monoclonal anti-CnA antibody. Because of the high amounts of CN bound to NFATc1, two different exposures are shown (top and bottom panels) to show the NFATc1-CN interaction clearly. Bound CN was quantified densitometrically, and these data, as relative intensity units of CN bound at each NFAT concentration, are presented in the bottom graphic. B, dependence of CN-NFAT binding on CN concentration. GST-NFATc2 (left) or GST-NFATc1 (right) was reacted with decreasing concentrations of CN (20, 10, 5, and 2.5 nm CN). CN was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CnA monoclonal antibody: bound CN is shown in the upper blot; and the bottom blot shows unbound (free) CN in one-third volumes of the postreaction supernatants. Ponceau red staining of the Western blot membranes confirmed equal amounts of GST fusion proteins in reactions (middle panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In complementary experiments the concentration of CN protein was varied. In each case, the amount of CN bound to the GST-NFAT fusion proteins decreased as the concentration of CN was progressively reduced. However, in agreement with the results of varying GST-NFAT concentrations, binding to NFATc1 was stronger than to NFATc2 at each CN concentration used (Fig. 2B).The CN Binding Activity of the LxVPc1 Motif Is Higher Than That of PxIxIT MotifsâThis difference in CN binding might arise from the different CN binding potencies of the PxIxIT and LxVP sites from NFATc1 and NFATc2. The second CN-interacting sites show limited homology among NFAT members, but alignment of the corresponding sequences indicated that three conserved residues (Leu, Val, and Pro) are present in all members (Fig. 1A). To test the ability of each PxIxIT or LxVP sequence to interact with CN independently, we generated GST-peptide fusion proteins bearing the PxIxIT and LxVP motifs from NFATc1 and NFATc2 (Fig. 1A), and used them in CN binding pull-down experiments (Fig. 3A). The amount of CN bound to GST-LxVPc1 was much greater than that bound to GST-PxIxITc1 or GST-PxIxITc2, whereas GST-LxVPc2 was unable to bind CN under the same experimental conditions. The importance of the conserved Leu, Val, and Pro amino acids for the binding activity of LxVPc1 was studied with GST-mutLxVPc1, in which each conserved residue was replaced with alanine (see Fig. 1A); GST-mutLxVPc1 was unable to bind CN (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the higher CN binding capacity of the LxVP motif from NFATc1 (relative to the PxIxITc1 and PxIxITc2 motifs) could indeed account for the stronger interaction of CN with NFATc1 versus NFATc2. To analyze the contribution of each LxVP motif to the overall binding to CN, we deleted them from GST-NFATc2 and c1 constructs. We found that the CN binding activity of NFATc2 was barely affected by the deletion of its LxVP sequence (Fig. 3B). In contrast, removal of the LxVP motif from NFATc1 significantly reduced its binding to CN. To directly demonstrate the participation of the LxVPc1 motif in the binding to CN, we compared the amount of CN bound to an NFATc2-LxVPc1 swap mutant (c2/c1) to that bound to wild-type NFATc2. These experiments clearly showed that the presence of an LxVPc1 motif greatly increased the CN binding activity of NFATc2 (Fig. 3C). These results strongly support the idea that the differential CN binding between NFATc1 and NFATc2 is caused by the different CN binding capabilities of their LxVP motifs.FIGURE 3Analysis of the in vitro in"
https://openalex.org/W2080895438,"We have previously shown that inhibition of catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) and mercaptosuccinic acid (MS), respectively, in rat primary hepatocytes caused sustained endogenous oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death without caspase-3 activation. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of this apoptotic cell death in terms of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Treatment with ATZ+MS time-dependently increased the number of deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei from 12 h, resulting in clear DNA laddering at 24 h. The deoxyribonuclease (DNase) inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), completely inhibited nucleosomal DNA fragmentation but the pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk was without effects; furthermore, the cleavage of inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase was not detected, indicating the involvement of DNase(s) other than caspase-activated DNase. Considering that endonuclease G (EndoG) reportedly acts in a caspase-independent manner, we cloned rat EndoG cDNA for the first time. Recombinant EndoG alone digested plasmid DNA and induced nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in isolated hepatocyte nuclei. Recombinant EndoG activity was inhibited by ATA but not by hydrogen peroxide, even at 10 mm. ATZ+MS stimulation elicited decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and EndoG translocation from mitochondria to nuclei. By applying RNA interference, the mRNA levels of EndoG were almost completely suppressed and the amount of EndoG protein was decreased to approximately half the level of untreated cells. Under these conditions, decreases in TUNEL-positive nuclei were significantly suppressed. These results indicate that EndoG is responsible, at least in part, for nucleosomal DNA fragmentation under endogenous oxidative stress conditions induced by ATZ+MS.

The caspase family, which comprises a series of cysteine proteases, plays an important role in apoptosis and many groups have reported the involvement of caspases in apoptosis (20Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar, 21Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 22Wolf B.B.

Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder formation) is one of the hallmarks of apoptosis and is executed by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activated by apoptotic stimuli. Of the DNases that are activated by apoptotic stimuli, caspaseactivated DNase (CAD), which is induced in a caspase-dependent manner, is mainly involved in apoptotic DNA fragmentation. In normal cells, CAD exists as a heterodimer complex with an inhibitor subunit termed inhibitor of CAD (ICAD), and the DNase activity of CAD is masked by the state of the complex. ICAD has two sites cleaved by caspases. Once the caspases are activated and ICAD is cleaved, CAD is released from the complex and subsequently degrades chromosomal DNA to nucleosomal fragments (23Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 24Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Whereas cell death under conditions in which the caspase family cannot function has been reported to resemble necrosis rather than apoptosis in several studies (25Hampton M.B. Orrenius S.

In fact, cells have shown apoptosis-like morphological changes, chromatin condensation and/or DNA fragmentation without caspase activation in these papers, suggesting that these distinctive characteristics of apoptosis take place in a caspase-independent manner. An argument about the definition of apoptosis or necrosis has emerged in recent years (33Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1502-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Sloviter R.S.

However, it is agreed that nucleosomal DNA fragmentation is a hallmark of apoptosis at this time. Thus, it is generally accepted that the presence or absence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation distinguishes apoptosis from necrosis. We have previously shown that sustained oxidative stress is evoked and, subsequently, chromatin condensation and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (which are typical features of apoptosis) are observed in rat primary hepatocytes when catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities are inhibited for 24 h by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) and mercaptosuccinic acid (MS), respectively (36Shiba D. Shimamoto N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Ishihara Y. Shiba D. Shimamoto N. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, caspase-3 is not activated during this apoptotic cell death, indicating that the apoptotic morphological changes are induced in a caspase-3-independent manner (37Ishihara Y. Shiba D. Shimamoto N. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It should be noted that nucleosomal DNA fragmentation has been clearly observed in this apoptotic cell death without caspase-3 activation. However, considering that ICAD is reportedly processed by caspases other than caspase-3, we cannot exclude the possibility of the participation of CAD in nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (38Wolf B.B.

Thus, here we examined whether CAD is involved in the nucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by ATZ+MS by investigating ICAD processing and, if not so, this nucleosomal DNA fragmentation can be considered to take place caspase-independently. We focused on endonuclease G (EndoG) as an executor of DNA fragmentation, which has been shown to be caspase-independently translocated from mitochondria to nuclei in response to apoptotic stimuli, followed by the induction of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (40Li L.Y.

(Osaka, Japan). z-VAD-fmk was obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Antibodies were purchased from the following sources: anti-CAD antibody, anti-ICAD antibody, antihistone H1 antibody, and anti-Î²-actin antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Beverly, MA); anti-His antibody was from Amersham Biosciences; anti-EndoG antibody was from MoBiTec (Goettingen, Germany); anti-cytochrome c antibody was from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); and anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Wako and were of the highest quality commercially available. Preparation of Rat Primary HepatocytesâMale Wistar rats (150-200 g of body weight) were used. After the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital at a dose of 50 mg/kg, hepatocytes were isolated by an in situ collagenase perfusion method, as previously described (37Ishihara Y. Shiba D. Shimamoto N. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 6-well collagen type I-coated plates or 60-mm collagen type I-coated dishes (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in WILLIAMS E medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 300 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone. Cells were incubated in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 Â°C for 2 h, and the medium was changed before they were subjected to the experiments described below. The average cell viability was about 90% according to trypan blue extrusion. Determination of Apoptotic Morphological FeaturesâChromatin condensation was assessed using DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33342. Hepatocytes grown in 6-well collagen type I-coated plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 Î¼g/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. The nuclei were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. Data were captured by a digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu C4742-95-10, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). For the detection of DNA fragmentation, an Apoptosis DNA Ladder kit (Wako) was used. The extracted DNA was separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with SYBR Green I and then visualized under ultraviolet light. Fluorographs of the DNA ladder were stored on a computer-assisted image analyzer (Fluor-S MultiImager, Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting AnalysisâEqual amounts of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5-15% (w/v) gradient polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blocked membranes were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with the following antibodies at the stated dilutions (depending on the specific experiment): anti-CAD (1:200), anti-ICAD (1:200), anti-cytochrome c (1:500), anti-EndoG (1:500), anti-COX IV (1:1000), anti-histone H1 (1:200), or anti-Î²-actin (1:200). The membranes were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and visualized with alkaline phosphatase substrates. Band intensity was measured by Multianalyst (Bio-Rad). Cloning of Rat EndoGâRat liver QuickClone cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was amplified with Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and PCR Ã Enhancer system (Invitrogen) using the EndoG-specific primers ESP1 (TAGCGCGCTGGTCCTCCGGTA, forward primer) and ESP2 (GCTTGAGTGAGTCCTACTCCA, reverse primer). The reaction conditions recommended by the manufacturer were used with minor modifications. Briefly, 30 cycles of amplification were carried out at 95 Â°C for 30 s, at 55 Â°C for 30 s and at 68 Â°C for 1 min. One-tenth of the amplification product from the first 30 cycles was reamplified under the same conditions. The products of the second amplification were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen) in pCR 2.1-TOPO vectors. Positive clones were selected, followed by purification and sequencing of the cDNA. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Rat EndoGâRat EndoG cDNA with 6Ã His tag was subcloned into the pET 30 vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The transformed cells were cultured and then stimulated in recombinant EndoG by the addition of isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The collected cells were resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm NaHPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) including 10 mm imidazole. All subsequent procedures were conducted at 4 Â°C. Lysozyme was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After 30 min incubation on ice, the cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C to remove the cellular debris. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) column. After the column was washed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 mm KCl and then loaded onto SP-500C (TOSOH Corp., Tokyo, Japan) column. The column was washed with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl and EndoG was eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 700 mm KCl in buffer A. DNase AssayâRecombinant rat EndoG activity was determined by the method of Widlak et al. (42Widlak P. Li L.Y. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48404-48409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat EndoG (100 ng) was mixed with pUC18 plasmids (1 mg) or nuclei isolated from rat primary hepatocytes (2 Ã 105 nuclei) and the mixture was incubated in the presence or absence of ATA or hydrogen peroxide for 20 min at 37 Â°C followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by electrophoresis using 1.5% agarose gel. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane PotentialâHepatocytes were incubated with 200 nm DiOC6 (3Galli F. Piroddi M. Annetti C. Aisa C. Floridi E. Floridi A. Contrib. Nephrol. 2005; 149: 240-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for 15 min under the abovementioned culture conditions. The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and detached from the plates by trypsinization. Fluorescence was determined using FACSCaliburâ¢ (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and an emission wavelength at 530 nm. Generally, 10,000 events were monitored and data analysis was performed by Cell Quest software (BD Bioscience). Cell FractionationâTo separate the mitochondrial fraction from the cytosolic fraction, an ApoAlertÂ® Cell Fractionation kit (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hepatocytes were homogenized in fractionation buffer, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 700 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 25 min at 4 Â°C. Supernatants from the second centrifugation were designated as cytosolic fractions and pellets resuspended in fractionation buffer were used as mitochondrial fractions. Isolation of nuclei was carried out by the method described by Staal et al. (43Staal F.J. Anderson M.T. Herzenberg L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were suspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, and 20 Î¼m APMSF) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Nonident-40 at a final concentration of 0.6% was added to the cell suspension, which was immediately vortexed followed by centrifugation. A white pellet was washed with buffer B and used as a nuclear fraction. RNA Interference (RNAi)âSilencing of EndoG gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes was achieved by the siRNA technique. Duplexes of 21 nucleotides with two 3â²-overhanging TT against rat EndoG were designed and synthesized by Proligo (Kyoto, Japan). The sense strand of the siRNA against EndoG was GUA CAG CCG CAG CUU GAC UTT. Scrambled nonspecific siRNA was used as a negative control (the sense strand was CGU GCA GUC GUC UCG CAA ATT). Transfection of rat primary hepatocytes with synthesized siRNA was carried out by electroporation using the NucleofectionÂ® system (Amaxa, Koln, Germany), according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 1.3 Ã 106 cells were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of nucleofector solution (Human T Cell Nucleofector kit) containing 150 pmol of double-stranded siRNAs. After electroporation, transfected cell suspensions were transferred into 6-well collagen type I-coated plates with 1.2 ml of prewarmed cultured medium. After 2 h of incubation, the medium was changed, and the cells were further incubated for 12 h. Subsequently, the medium was changed, and the cells were further incubated with ATZ+MS in the presence or absence of inhibitors for 24 h. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) AnalysisâTotal RNA extraction from hepatocytes was performed using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 Î¼g of total RNA using a TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (AMV) Ver. 2.1 (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). For PCR analysis, cDNA was amplified by Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Î²-Actin was used as the endogenous expression standard. Each PCR program consisted of a 2-min initial denaturation step at 94 Â°C, followed by 25 cycles (for EndoG) or 20 cycles (for Î²-actin) at 94 Â°C for 30 s, at 55 Â°C for 30 s and at 72 Â°C for 1 min, on a PCR Thermal Cycler Personal (TaKaRa). The primer sequences were as follows: EndoG forward primer, CCG CGA GTC CTA CGT GCT GA; EndoG reverse primer, ATC ACA TAG GAA CGC AGC TCG AC; Î²-actin forward primer, TTC AAC ACC CCA GCC ATG TA; and Î²-actin reverse primer, TGA TCC ACA TCT GCT GGA AG. The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels. The band intensity was measured using a Multianalyst (Bio-Rad). Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated Nick End-labeling (TUNEL) AssayâThe TUNEL assay was performed using the Dead-Endâ¢ Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the hepatocytes were fixed, fluorescein-12-dUTP was catalytically incorporated into the fragmented DNA at the 3â²-OH by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The fluorescein-12-dUTP-labeled DNA was visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy using an excitation wavelength at 488 nm. TUNEL-positive cells were determined from fluorographs for at least 300 nuclei. Determination of Protein ContentâThe protein content was determined according to the method of Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Statistical AnalysisâData for each variable are expressed as the means Â± S.E. Data obtained from the two groups were compared using the Student's t test with Holm's corrections for multiple comparisons. Probability (p) values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Time Course for Increases in TUNEL-positive Cells Induced by ATZ+MS TreatmentsâTUNEL-positive nuclei were not observed for up to 24 h in untreated hepatocytes. Treatment with ATZ+MS for 9 h had no effect on DNA fragmentation. However, treatment periods longer than 12 h induced a time-dependent increase in the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei and almost all nuclei were TUNEL-positive after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 1A). The inset in Fig. 1A showed morphological features of hepatocytes treated with ATZ+MS at 12 h. By phase contrast microscopy (Eclipse TE300, Nikon), two hepatocytes in the figure were observed to be apart from interconnected hepatocytes and rounded up. However, they adhered to the surface of the culture dish. The sizes of ATZ+MS treated hepatocytes including rounded ones were smaller than those of untreated hepatocytes, showing that cellular shrinkage occurred. Nuclear condensation was noted in the rounded hepatocytes. In addition, electrophoretic analysis with extracted DNA at 24 h showed clear DNA laddering when cells were treated with ATZ+MS, confirming our previous reports (Fig. 1B) (36Shiba D. Shimamoto N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Ishihara Y. Shiba D. Shimamoto N. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with SKF (a cytochrome P450 inhibitor) or vitamin C (an antioxidant) almost completely inhibited both the increase in the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei and the appearance of DNA laddering induced by ATZ+MS (Fig. 1, A and B). The onset and time course for the increase in TUNEL-positive nuclei were similar to those for the increase in chromatin condensation (37Ishihara Y. Shiba D. Shimamoto N. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Involvement of DNases Other Than CAD in ATZ+MS-induced DNA FragmentationâAs described above, clear nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed when hepatocytes were treated with ATZ+MS. Thus, to ensure whether DNase(s) were responsible for this fragmentation, ATA, which is a DNase inhibitor, was used (45Hallick R.B. Chelm B.K. Gray P.W. Orozco Jr., E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 3055-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with 30 Î¼m ATA had no effect on DNA laddering induced by ATZ+MS. However, pretreatment with 100 Î¼m ATA completely suppressed DNA laddering, suggesting that DNase(s) were involved in DNA fragmentation induced by ATZ+MS (Fig. 2A). We next investigated the potential for CAD, which is well characterized as an apoptotic DNase, to induce nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (23Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 24Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). First, we investigated effects of a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, on DNA laddering. The addition of the z-VAD-fmk at a concentration of 10, 50, or 250 Î¼m neither affected TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 2B) nor nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2C) induced by ATZ+MS. Secondly, we examined whether ICAD was cleaved in hepatocytes treated with ATZ+MS because CAD is released and activated by the processing of ICAD. After 24 h of incubation, few ICAD-cleaved products were observed in untreated hepatocytes. Treatment with ATZ+MS showed similar quantities of ICAD-cleaved products to those in untreated cells (Fig. 2D). Stimulation by TNFÎ±+ActD is well known to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in many types of cell, including hepatocytes (46Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N. Srinivasan A.

In fact, treatment with TNFÎ±+ActD induced cell death in rat primary hepatocytes accompanied by caspase activation, chromatin condensation and nucleosomal DNA fragmentati"

Consistent with this, talin failed to compete for binding of the vinculin Vd1 domain to an immobilized talin polypeptide containing a constitutively active VBS. However, talin did bind to GST-Vd1 in pull-down assays, and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements indicate a Kd of â¼9 Î¼m. Interestingly, Vd1 binding exposed a trypsin cleavage site in the talin rod between residues 898 and 899, indicating that there are one or more active VBSs in the N-terminal part of the talin rod. This region comprises a five helix bundle (residues 482-655) followed by a seven-helix bundle (656-889) and contains five VBSs (helices 4, 6, 9, 11, and 12). The single VBS within 482-655 is cryptic at room temperature. In contrast, talin 482-889 binds Vd1 with high affinity (Kd â¼ 0.14 Î¼m), indicating that one or more of the four VBSs within 656-889 are active, and this likely represents the vinculin binding region in intact talin. In support of this, hemagglutinin-tagged talin 482-889 localized efficiently to focal adhesions, whereas 482-655 did not. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a strong negative correlation between Vd1 binding and helical bundle stability, and a 755-889 mutant with a more stable fold bound Vd1 much less well than wild type. We conclude that the stability of the helical bundles that make up the talin rod is an important factor determining the activity of the individual VBSs.

In the present study we have sought to establish whether some or all of the VBSs in the talin rod are cryptic or constitutively active. Protein Expression and PurificationâcDNAs encoding mouse talin 482-636, 482-655, 482-789, and 755-889 and the chicken vinculin Vd1 domain (residues 1-258) were cloned into the expression vector pET-15b (Novagen, Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge), whereas a cDNA encoding mouse talin 482-889 was cloned into pET-151/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (52Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J.

Lam, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). PCR products were cloned into pET30a (Novagen) between the NdeI and EagI sites such that the encoded proteins were expressed with a C-terminal His tag. Constructs were authenticated by DNA sequencing and shown to match the human talin 1 cDNA sequence in GenBankâ¢ (accession number BC042923). Human talin 1 and the talin 1 rod were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). In brief, cells (1 liter) were grown at 37 Â°C to an A600 nm 0.6 and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside at 15 Â°C overnight. The cell pellet was resuspended into 35 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.4 m NaCl) with 1 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol and lysed by passing through a French press (Thermo Electron). The soluble cell lysate was then recovered and passed through a 5-ml HiTrap affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+. Fractions containing the required protein were combined, concentrated, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) in buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The relationship of the various talin polypeptides used in this study to full-length talin is illustrated in Fig. 1. Binding of the Vinculin Vd1 Domain to TalinâThe relative affinities of talin and talin polypeptides for the vinculin Vd1 domain was measured by competitive ELISA as described previously (52Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In brief, NUNC immunoplates (F96-maxisorp) coated with a talin 482-636 polypeptide were incubated with the GST-vinculin Vd1 domain at a concentration of 5 nm (54Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A.

Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) in the presence of increasing amounts of talin or recombinant talin polypeptides. Binding of GST-vinculin or GST alone was determined using a rabbit polyclonal anti-GST coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz). Binding of talin to GST-Vd1 was also measured using a pull-down assay as described previously (47Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I.J. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration chromatography of recombinant talin polypeptides and vinculin Vd1 (1-258) was performed using Superdex-75 (10/30) (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. The column was pre-equilibrated and run in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. In each case, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed using a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and stained using the GelCode blue reagent (Pierce). CalorimetryâDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a N-DSC II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp, Provo, UT) at the scanning rate of 1000/min under 3.0 atm of pressure. Before measurement, protein samples were dialyzed against PBS. The dialysis buffer was used as the reference solution. Vd1 and talin polypeptides were used at concentrations between 18.0 and 25 Î¼m. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed on a VP-ITC calorimeter from Microcal (Northampton, MA). 8-Î¼l aliquots of solution containing 0.8-1.0 mm vinculin Vd1 (residues 1-258) were injected into the cell containing 40-100 Î¼m talin or the talin polypeptide. In each experiment 37 injections were made. The experiments were performed at 23 Â°C. Before ITC titrations, all protein samples were dialyzed against PBS buffer. Experimental data were analyzed using Microcal Origin software provided by the ITC manufacturer (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Circular Dichroism SpectroscopyâCD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco PTC-348WI temperature control unit. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 20 Â°C over the wavelength range 200-250 nm in a quartz cell of 0.1-cm path length (scan rate 50 nmÂ·min-1). Proteins were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl at concentrations of 25 Î¼m. The mean residue molar ellipticity [Î¸] (deg Ã cm2 Ã dmol-1) was calculated according to the formula [Î¸] = Î¸/(n Ã 10 Ã CM Ã l), where Î¸ is the measured ellipticity in degrees, n is the number of peptide bonds (residue), l is the path length in centimeters, and CM is the molar protein concentration. The factor 10 originates from the conversion of the molar concentration to the dmolÂ·cm-3 concentration unit. For urea denaturation studies, proteins were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl containing 0, 0.8, 1.6, 4.0, or 5.6 m urea. Expression of HA-tagged Talin Polypeptides in NIH3T3 CellsâcDNAs encoding C-terminal HA-tagged talin polypeptides 482-636, 482-655, 482-789, and 482-889 were synthesized by PCR using the mouse talin-1 cDNA (55Rees D.J.G.

PCR products were first cloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene) and then subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI sites. The authenticity of the cloned cDNAs was confirmed by sequencing. The constructs were transfected -2 Î¼g of cDNA/6 Î¼l of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) into 3 Ã 104 NIH3T3 cells grown on glass coverslips and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. After 16 h at 37 Â°C, cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100/PBS, and quenched for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl/PBS. After 1 h of incubation in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, cells were incubated for 20 min with the anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), washed 3 times with 0.02% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and then incubated for 20 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). F-actin was visualized by staining with phalloidin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes) for 20 min. After 3 washes in 0.02% bovine serum albumin/PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Prolong Antifade Reagent (Molecular Probes) and inspected using a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope and Openlab 4.0.2 software.

To investigate whether any of the VBSs in intact talin are active, we set up a competitive ELISA-type assay. Because the talin-binding site in the N-terminal region of vinculin is normally masked by an intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal vinculin tail (54Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 56Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used a GST-vinculin fusion protein containing just residues 1-258 (GST-Vd1) to assay talin binding. Similarly, because the single VBS contained within the N-terminal region the talin rod (residues 482-655, a 5-helix bundle) is cryptic (52Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we used a construct (residues 482-636) in which the VBS has been activated by deletion of the C-terminal helix. We then measured the ability of GST-Vd1 to bind to talin 482-636 deposited on plastic in the presence of increasing concentrations of talin or talin fragments. As shown previously (52Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), preincubation of GST-Vd1 with increasing concentrations of talin 482-636 in solution progressively inhibited binding to talin 482-636 on plastic, with an IC50 of â¼1 nm, whereas talin 482-655 was completely without effect (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, talin purified from turkey gizzard was also unable to inhibit GST-Vd1 binding, indicating that the VBSs in intact talin are cryptic or in a low affinity state (Fig. 2A). The integrin-binding sites in talin are also reportedly cryptic and can be activated by PIP2 (35Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) or by cleavage of the talin head from the rod (57Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Preincubation of talin with PIP2 did not activate the VBSs in talin (Fig. 2A), although the purified talin rod (but not the head) did show significantly more Vd1 binding activity than intact talin (Fig. 2A). The above assay provides a measure of the relative affinities of Vd1 for talin and talin fragments and does not necessarily indicate that intact talin cannot bind vinculin. To investigate this, we incubated purified talin with GST or GST-Vd1 and carried out a pull down assay. Talin binding was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the TD77 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the extreme C terminus of talin (8Bolton S.J. Barry S.T. Mosley H. Patel B. Jockusch B.M. Wilkinson J.M. Critchley D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 36: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results clearly establish that talin and talin rod fragments are able to bind to GST-Vd1 (Fig. 2B). To obtain a direct measure of the binding affinities, we used ITC (Table 1). At 23 Â°C, Vd1 bound talin with a Kd of â¼9 Î¼m, and PIP2 had relatively little effect on binding (Kd â¼5 Î¼m). The talin rod bound Vd1 with a slightly higher affinity (Kd = 2.4 Î¼m),"

We have shown a structurally related protein kinase PSK2, which lacks a microtubule-binding site, activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and induced apoptotic morphological changes that include cell contraction, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation. Apoptotic stimuli increased the catalytic activity of endogenous PSK2 and JNK, and dominant negative JNK or a physiological inhibitor of JNK blocked these apoptotic morphological responses to PSK2, demonstrating a requirement for JNK. PSK2 also stimulated the cleavage of Rho kinase-1 (ROCK-I), and the activity of ROCK-I was required for PSK2 to induce cell contraction and membrane blebbing. The activation of caspases was also needed for the induction of membrane blebbing by PSK2, which was itself a substrate for caspase 3. PSK2 therefore regulates apoptotic morphology associated with the execution phase of apoptosis, which involves dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, via downstream targets that include JNK and ROCK-I. Our findings suggest that PSKs form a subgroup of sterile 20 (STE20)-like kinases that regulate different cytoskeletal processes.

Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). STE20s have been divided into the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) or the germinal-center kinase (GCK)-like kinases according to their structure and function, and PSK2 belongs to the GCK-like class of STE20s that possess an N-terminal catalytic domain and a putative C-terminal regulatory domain (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Most STE20s can act upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways and regulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and/or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), although regulation of their biological responses does not always require MAPKs (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar).Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an important process for the development and maintenance of homeostasis in multicellular organisms and several STE20 kinases, and the JNK family of MAPKs has been implicated in the regulation of this process (1Dan I.

Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar). After a cell commits to the death program, it enters an active phase of apoptosis termed the âexecution phase.â In most cells, the extranuclear execution phase is characterized by the release of extracellular matrix attachments and the loss of focal adhesions to produce a more rounded cell morphology. Cell contraction correlates with the reorganization of actin into a cortical, membrane-associated ring in preparation for membrane blebbing (3Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Blebbing of the membrane begins with myosin II-dependent contraction of the actin ring followed by a period of dynamic plasma membrane protrusion and retraction until the cell condenses into apoptotic bodies, correlating with the dissolution of polymerized actin (3Mills J.C.

ROCK-I is necessary for various morphological changes that are dependent on the actinmyosin cytoskeleton and occur during the execution phase of apoptosis. In addition, ROCK-I and/or ROCK-II may play a wider role in the apoptotic process as their activity is required for the relocalization of fragmented DNA into membrane blebs and apoptotic bodies while also playing an important role in apoptotic nuclear disintegration (18Rudel T.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated previously that the GCK-like kinase PSK1, in addition to activating JNK, binds to microtubules via its C terminus and regulates their organization and stability (23Mitsopoulos C.

Here we have shown that a structurally related protein PSK2, which lacks a C-terminal microtubule-binding domain, stimulates JNK and induces apoptotic morphological alterations that involve reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The ability of PSK2 to induce cell contraction and membrane blebbing is dependent on its downstream targets JNK and ROCK-I. In addition, caspase activity is required for the induction of membrane blebbing by PSK2, which is itself a substrate for caspase 3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and ReagentsâpRK5-Myc-PSK2 was prepared by PCR using the human cDNA clone KIAA1361 (gift from Takahiro Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute) and appropriate oligonucleotides. PRK5-Myc-PSK2-(1â416) was prepared by PCR from this construct, and pRK5-Myc-PSK2 (K57A) and pRK5-PSK2 (D376N) were prepared from pRK5-Myc-PSK2 using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Colleagues donated the following plasmids: pCMV-FLAG-JNK1 (Dr. M. Karin, University of California), pGEX-c-Jun (Dr. J. Ham, Eisai London Research Laboratories), and dominant negative pCDNA3-FLAG-JNK1 (APF) (Dr R. Davis, University of Massachusetts). The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and inhibitors for ROCK-I (Y27632) and JNK (SP600125) were obtained from Calbiochem. The p38 inhibitor SB202190 was obtained from Sigma.Transient Cell ExpressionâCOS-1 cells and human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (H1299) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (10% CO2, 37 Â°C). For transfection, 4 Ã 105 or 8 Ã 105 cells were seeded onto 35- or 60-mm Petri dishes, respectively. After 16 h, the indicated plasmids (1.5 or 2.5 Î¼g of each DNA) were transfected into COS-1 cells or H1299 cells using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).ImmunoblottingâCultures were lysed in 200 Î¼l of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). 100 Î¼g of total protein were mixed with Laemmli denaturing buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (8â15%), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (24Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-ROCK-I (G6) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit anti-caspase 3 and mouse anti-PSK2/TAO1 were obtained from AbCam and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively.Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase AssaysâFor immunoprecipitation, 400 Î¼g of protein were made up to a final volume of 1 ml in binding buffer (130 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). Samples were incubated with 3 Î¼g of anti-Myc 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma), 3 Î¼g of anti-FLAG mouse M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or 2 Î¼g of anti-PSK2 mouse monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 Â°C before the addition of 100 Î¼l of 10% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma, 1 h at 4 Â°C).For in vitro kinase assays, beads were washed three times, pelleted by centrifugation, and placed in 30 Î¼l of kinase buffer (20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 20 Î¼m ATP, 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (MP Biomedicals, 3000 Ci/mmol), and 1 Î¼g of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun protein or 1 Î¼g of myelin basic protein added where indicated and incubated for 45 min at 37 Â°C. Kinase assays were terminated in gel sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for transfer to nitrocellulose and analysis by immunoblotting or phosphorimaging (Fujifilm FLA-2000). Protein normalization and expression were confirmed for each sample by immunoblotting total cell lysates.Immunofluorescence and Confocal MicroscopyâH1299 cells (2 Ã 105) were seeded onto 22-mm glass coverslips (VWR Scientific Products) in 30-mm Petri dishes and transfected with the indicated plasmids as described above. At the appropriate times, cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. To detect Myc-tagged PSKs, cells were incubated with either 1:400 anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody or 1:400 mouse 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in blocking buffer (PBS containing 20% goat serum, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature followed by 1:400 FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in blocking buffer. To detect FLAG-tagged JNK, cells were incubated with 1:200 anti-FLAG mouse M2 monoclonal antibody in blocking buffer (1 h at room temperature) followed by 1:400 Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer. To detect polymerized actin (F-actin), cells were incubated with 0.1 Î¼g/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) in PBS. Cells were imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope. The percentages of transfected cells undergoing cell contraction or membrane blebbing were determined by examining more than 100 cells in triplicate using confocal microscopy.In Vitro Caspase Cleavage AssaysâPSK2 was subcloned into pcDNA4-His (Invitrogen) and [35S]methionine-labeled PSK2 synthesized using an in vitro transcription and translation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Labeled His-tagged PSK2 in binding buffer (130 mm NaCl, 2Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) was immunoprecipitated from the reaction mixture using mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). PSK2 attached to beads was washed with binding buffer lacking protease inhibitors and incubated in 50 Î¼l of caspase reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, and 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2) for 60 min at 37 Â°C. Recombinant caspase 3 (100 ng, BD Transduction Laboratories) and Z-VAD-FMK (50 Î¼m) were added where indicated. Reactions were terminated with sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose for analysis using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji).RESULTSPSK2 Activates JNKâWe have shown previously that the GCK-like kinase PSK1 activates the JNK MAPK signaling pathway via its N-terminal catalytic domain and contains a C-terminal microtubule-binding and regulatory domain (23Mitsopoulos C. Zihni C. Garg R. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18085-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PSK2 is highly homologous to PSK1 over its N-terminal kinase domain but does not possess a microtubule-binding domain, and we therefore set out to determine whether this protein could also activate JNK (Fig. 1, A and B). An expression vector for Myc-tagged PSK2 was prepared from the human cDNA clone KIAA1361 (Kazusa DNA Research Institute) as well as an additional expression construct for its kinase-defective form PSK2 (K57A). Myc-tagged PSK2 or PSK2 (K57A) were expressed in COS-1 cells and immune complexes of each protein prepared from cell lysates. In vitro kinase assays were carried out using the immunoprecipitates and myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate, and PSK2 underwent autophosphorylation and phosphorylated MBP (Fig. 1C). In contrast, immune complexes prepared from cells that expressed its kinase-defective counterpart, PSK2 (K57A), showed that this protein was unable to phosphorylate itself or MBP due to the lack of a crucial lysine residue in the second kinase subdomain that is required for ATP binding (Fig. 1C). PSK2 is therefore a functional kinase, and so we examined the effects of these proteins on the JNK signaling pathway. Myc-tagged PSK2 or PSK2 (K57A) were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged JNK into COS-1 cells and immune complexes of JNK prepared from cell lysates for in vitro kinase assays using recombinant c-Jun as a substrate. Transfected PSK2 activated JNK and stimulated the phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas PSK2 (K57A) was unable to increase the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun above those obtained in control cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 1D). We also expressed the N-terminal kinase domain of PSK2-(1â416) in cells and found that this protein could also activate JNK (data not shown).PSK2 Induces Cell Contraction, Membrane Blebbing, and Cleavage of ROCK-IâSince JNK activation has been shown to play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis and some STE20-like kinases can regulate cytoskeletal organization, we examined whether PSK2 could stimulate changes in cell morphology that are associated with apoptosis (2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar, 24Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol.

Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (H1299) were transfected with PSK2, and the expression of this protein induced a marked reduction in the cell spread area and caused cell rounding in 70.5 Â± 10.8% of transfected cells. Cell contraction correlated with a reorganization of actin into a cortical membrane-associated ring, which we observed in contracted cells. Contraction of this ring results in blebbing, and PSK2 induced substantial blebbing of the plasma membrane in 64.3 Â± 10.1% of transfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Membrane blebbing is finally followed by dynamic protrusion and retraction of the plasma membrane, resulting in condensation of the cell into apoptotic bodies correlating with dissolution of polymerized actin. We observed apoptotic body formation in 36 Â± 10.4% of transfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, kinase-defective PSK2 (K57A) was diffusely spread throughout the cytoplasm, as was wild type PSK2, before the onset of apoptotic morphological changes (data not shown) and caused no significant reduction in spread area or membrane blebbing (Fig. 2, A and B). These results demonstrate a requirement for the catalytic activity of PSK2 to induce these apoptotic morphological alterations.FIGURE 2PSK2 induces cell contraction, membrane blebbing and cleavage of ROCK-I. A, growing H1299 lung carcinoma cells were transfected with pRK5-Myc-PSK2 or pRK5-Myc-PSK2 (K57A), and after 36 h, cultures were fixed and co-stained with anti-Myc 9E10/FITC (left column) and TRITC-phalloidin (middle column). Composite panels show staining for PSKs using anti-Myc 9E10/FITC (green) and actin using TRITC-phalloidin (red) (right column). Yellow arrowheads denote membrane bleb morphology, and green arrowheads indicate apoptotic bodies. Red arrowheads highlight cortical actin in contracted cells. Scale bar, 20 Î¼m. B, the percentages of transfected cells undergoing cell contraction (black bars) or membrane blebbing (white bars) after transfection of the indicated plasmids were determined after examining more than 100 cells in each of three independent experiments using confocal microscopy.

Cleavage and activation of the Rho effector ROCK-I by caspase 3 appears to be a crucial event in the formation of blebs in apoptotic cells (19Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To test whether PSK2 could cause cleavage of ROCK-I, we expressed PSK2 or PSK2 (K57A) in cells and examined their effects on endogenous ROCK-I. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with an antibody raised against the C terminus of ROCK-I (amino acids 755â840) detected full-length ROCK-I at 160 kDa in control cells as well as an additional N-terminal fragment of ROCK-I at 130 kDa in cells that were transfected with PSK2 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, expression of PSK2 (K57A) did not cause a significant increase in the 130-kDa form of ROCK-I, consistent with the inability of this mutated protein to induce blebbing or contraction of cells (Fig. 2C). Since the cleavage of ROCK-I has been shown to result in its activation, we also tested whether the cell-permeable ROCK-I inhibitor Y27632 could affect the apoptotic morphological response of cells to PSK2 (19Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 20Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N. Bertoglio J. Breard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). We found that Y27632 prevented blebbing and contraction of cells that expressed PSK2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, 27 Â± 10.2% of PSK2-transfected cells showed accumulation of cortical actin in the presence of Y27632.FIGURE 3ROCK-I activity is required for PSK2 to induce apoptotic morphology. A, growing H1299 cells were transfected with pRK5-Myc-PSK2 for 16 h, treated with or without Y27632 (10 Î¼m) as indicated for 24 h, and then co-stained with anti-Myc 9E10-FITC (left panel) and TRITC-phalloidin (right panel). B, the percentages of PSK2-transfected cells undergoing cell contraction (black bars) or membrane blebbing (white bars) after transfection of PSK2 and incubation in the presence or absence of Y27632 (as indicated) were determined after examining more than 100 cells in triplicate using confocal microscopy. Standard deviations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)JNK Activity Is Required for the Induction of Apoptotic Morphology by PSK2âThe results presented above demonstrated that the catalytic activity of PSK2 is important for its stimulation of cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing as well as the cleavage of ROCK-I. To determine whether the activation of JNK by PSK2 was involved in the stimulation of apoptosis, we tested the effects of dominant negative JNK. Expression of dominant negative JNK inhibited the induction of cell contraction and membrane blebbing by PSK2 (Fig. 4, A and B). We also investigated the effects of the cell-permeable and selective JNK inhibitor SP600125 on both of these apoptotic morphological responses to PSK2. H1299 cells transfected with PSK2 were incubated with SP600125, and the JNK inhibitor prevented contraction and blebbing of cells transfected with PSK2 (Fig. 4, A and B). These results demonstrate that the activation of JNK by PSK2 is required for its induction of both of these apoptotic morphological responses. In contrast, the cell-permeable and selective p38 inhibitor SB202190 was unable to block PSK2-induced contraction or blebbing of cells (data not shown).FIGURE 4JNK activity is required for PSK2 to induce apoptotic morphology. A, growing H1299 cells were transfected with pRK5-Myc-PSK2 with or without dominant negative pcDNA3-FLAG-JNK1 (APF). Additional cultures, transfected with pRK5-Myc-PSK2, were incubated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 Î¼m) 6 h after transfection as indicated. After 48 h, cultures were fixed and co-stained with the anti-Myc antibody 9E10/FITC (first column, PSK2), TRITC-phalloidin (second column, actin), and anti-FLAG antibody M2/Alexa Fluor 633 (third column, dominant negative JNK (dnJNK)). Composite panels (fourth column) show staining for PSK2 (green), actin (red), and dominant negative JNK (blue). Scale bar, 20 Î¼m. B, the percentages of cells undergoing cell contraction (black bars) or membrane blebbing (white bars) after transfection of PSK2 and incubation with or without dominant negative JNK or SP600125, as indicated, were determined by examining more than 100 cells in triplicate using confocal microscopy.

Endogenous PSK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and its autophosphorylation was examined using in vitro kinase assays. Fig. 5 shows that the catalytic activity and autophosphorylation of PSK2 were increased 3 h after the addition of NaCl or staurosporine. Sorbitol also stimulated the catalytic activity of endogenous PSK2 at 1 h, but its effect was transient and declined thereafter (Fig. 5). In addition, NaCl and staurosporine each stimulated phosphorylation and activation of JNK at 3 h, whereas sorbitol caused a transient increase in phosphorylated JNK at 1 h (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2090444383,"MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that functions upstream of the MAP kinases and IÎºB kinase. Phosphorylation is believed to be a critical component for MEKK3-dependent signal transduction, but little is known about the phosphorylation sites of this MAP3K. To address this question, point mutations were introduced in the activation loop (T-loop), substituting alanine for serine or threonine, and the mutants were transfected into HEK293 Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen cells. MEKK3-dependent activation of an NF-ÎºB reporter gene as well as ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases correlated with a requirement for serine at position 526. Constitutively active mutants of MEKK3, consisting of S526D and S526E, were capable of activating a NF-ÎºB luciferase reporter gene as well as ERK and MEK, suggesting that a negative charge at Ser526 was necessary for MEKK3 activity and implicating Ser526 as a phosphorylation site. An antibody was developed that specifically recognized phospho-Ser526 of MEKK3 but did not recognize the S526A point mutant. The catalytically inactive (K391M) mutant of MEKK3 was not phosphorylated at Ser526, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser526 occurs via autophosphorylation. Endogenous MEKK3 was phosphorylated on Ser526 in response to osmotic stress. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser526 was required for MKK6 phosphorylation in vitro, whereas dephosphorylation of Ser526 was mediated by protein phosphatase 2A and sensitive to okadaic acid and sodium fluoride. Finally, the association between MEKK3 and 14-3-3 was dependent on Ser526 and prevented dephosphorylation of Ser526. In summary, Ser526 of MEKK3 is an autophosphorylation site within the T-loop that is regulated by PP2A and 14-3-3 proteins.

Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Within each group, there is a highly conserved three-kinase signaling module consisting of a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAP2K), and a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K). Regulation of the MAP3K, presumably by phosphorylation, provides the impetus for activation of the three-kinase module. Once activated, the MAP3Ks activate MAP2Ks by phosphorylation of two residues within the activation loop. Phosphorylation of MAP2Ks activates these dual specificity kinases to phosphorylate MAPKs on a conserved threonine and tyrosine motif, TXY, also within the activation loop. Once phosphorylated, the MAPKs phosphorylate protein substrates and regulate cellular processes like growth, protein synthesis, gene expression, and nucleotide synthesis (2Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J.

However, little is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms that modulate the MEKK proteins to ultimately regulate the MAPKs. For example, it is known that overexpression of MEKK3 activates the ERK (3Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Typically, MEKK3-dependent regulation of these pathways is studied by using transfection studies, and activation of these pathways rarely requires an agonist. Therefore, it appears that some process intrinsic to MEKK3 is critical and sufficient for activation of these pathways. The activation loop of some protein kinase families, such as the arginine-aspartate family, is positioned between subdomains VII and VIII and is phosphorylated by other protein kinases or through autophosphorylation of the kinase itself (11Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation within the activation loop of protein kinases results in conformational changes in the protein structure that (i) enhance substrate binding, (ii) correctly position amino acids involved in catalysis, and (iii) relieve steric hindrance within the catalytic domain. Regardless of how the activation loop is phosphorylated, regulation of catalytic activity frequently correlates with phosphorylation of the activation loop. Given that phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating the MAPKs and the MAP2Ks, we investigated how phosphorylation of MEKK3 might affect its catalytic activity. Since phosphorylation sites within the activation loop of MEKK3 have not been reported, we systematically mutated serine and threonine residues within the activation loop to alanine and monitored MEKK3-dependent activities in HEK293 EBNA cells. Two key amino acids were identified at positions 526 and 530 using a luciferase-based reporter gene assay as well as assays that measure the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases. We demonstrate that Ser526 is phosphorylated by using a specific antibody that recognizes phospho-Ser526. In contrast, Thr530 is not phosphorylated but is required for MEKK3 catalytic activity. In addition, phosphorylation of endogenous MEKK3 occurs on Ser526 in response to osmotic stress. Finally, dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser526 is mediated by PP2A, and the association of 14-3-3 with phosphorylated MEKK3 prevents dephosphorylation by PP2A. MaterialsâAntibodies to phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-MEK, MEK1/2, and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against ERK1/2 and 14-3-3Î² were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The 14-3-3 antibody recognizes amino acids 3â21 of the human isoform of 14-3-3Î², and this sequence is highly conserved within the 14-3-3 family of proteins (Î², Î³, Ïµ, Î¶, Î·, Î¸, and Ï). An antibody to MEKK3 was generated as previously described (12Adams D.G. Sachs N.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the hemagglutinin and the FLAG epitopes were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Anti-FLAG affinity resin was obtained from Sigma. Plasmids and Site-directed MutagenesisâFLAGÂ·MEKK3 was excised from pBTM116 using SalI and ligated into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3.1 HisA (12Adams D.G. Sachs N.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). FLAGÂ·MEKK3 in pcDNA3.1 HisA was used as a template for PCR to generate 370-bp fragments containing point mutations in the activation loop, replacing serine or threonine with alanine, aspartic, or glutamic acid. The 370-bp fragment was flanked by HindIII and NotI endonuclease sites. Since the 5â² SalI site was lost after ligation of FLAGÂ·MEKK3 into pcDNA3.1 HisA, the NotI site of the polylinker was used as a 3â² cloning site in subsequent steps. The megaprimer method of site-directed mutagenesis, which involved two PCR steps, was utilized to generate point mutants. Unique sense primers, listed in Table 1, and the antisense primer, 5â²-T ACC TAG CAG GAA CAG ATT GTG TCG ACC TCA GTA CAC T-3â², were used in the first reaction (13Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the first reaction was used as a template for the second reaction with an MEKK3 sense primer, 5â²-GGC ATG TCA TAC CTG CAC AGC-3â², which is upstream of the HindIII site, and antisense primer 5â²-T ACC TAG CAT GAA CAG ATT G-3â². The product of this reaction was subcloned into pGEM-T and sequenced to verify the nucleotide sequence. The 370-bp HindIII/NotI fragment containing the mutation was ligated with the 1800-bp KpnI/HindIII fragment of MEKK3 into pcDNA3.1 HisA that was cleaved with KpnI/NotI. The same procedure was used to construct the point mutants listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Primer sequences used to generate point mutations in the MEKK3 activation loopSiteSense primer sequenceEndonuclease siteS511ATTT GGG GCC GCC AAA CGC CTG CAG ACCPstIT516ACGC CTA CAG GCC ATA TGC ATGNdeIS520ATGC ATG GCA GGG ACA GGC ATT CGA TCG GTC ACTPvuIT522ATCA GGG GCA GGC ATT AGA TCT GTC ACTBglIIS526AGGG ACA GGA ATT CGC GCT GTC ACT GGCEcoRIS526DTCA GGT ACC GGC ATT CGC GAT GTC ACT GGCKpnIS526EGGG ACA GGG ATT CGC GAA GTC ACT GGCBamHIT528ACGC TCT GTC GCC GGC ACA CCCNaeIT530AGTC ACT GGC GCC CCC TAC TGGNarIT530DGGC ATT AGA TCT GTC ACT GGC GAT CCC TACBglIIT530EGGC ATT CGA TCG GTC ACT GGC GAA CCC TAC TGGPvuI Open table in a new tab GST-lamin C (amino acids 66â206) was prepared by digesting pLexA-Lamin, which was provided by Anne B.

Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), with EcoRI and SalI and ligating into pGEX-5X-1 that was digested with the same enzymes. Cell CultureâHEK293 EBNA cells were maintained at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2, with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 250 Î¼g/ml Geneticin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. TransfectionsâHEK293 EBNA cells were transiently transfected with an empty vector as a control, MEKK3, K391M, or point mutants in the pcDNA3.1 HisA plasmid using 9 Î¼l of Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 3 Î¼g of DNA. Cells were transfected in OPTI-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen) and then replaced with complete medium 5 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblottingâCells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.25 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin. Cellular extracts were then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The protein concentration was determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, 1 mg of cell extract was incubated with 10 Î¼l of anti-FLAG affinity beads and rotated at 4 Â°C for 2 h. Samples were washed twice with 1 ml of PAN-Nonidet P-40 (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 20 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 100 mm NaCl (PAN), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and once with 1 ml of PAN. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 2000 Ã g for 2 min, and the protein-bound beads were heated at 90 Â°C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and probed with appropriate antibodies. For Western blots, 100 Î¼g of cellular extract was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with appropriate antibodies. JNK Activity AssayâThis assay was performed as previously described (16Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extract (40 Î¼g of protein) was incubated with 10 Î¼g of GST-c-Jun bound to glutathione-Sepharose and rotated for 2 h at 4 Â°C. After washing with PAN and PAN-Nonidet P-40 as described above, precipitated JNK was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with [Î³-32P]ATP and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. NF-ÎºB Luciferase AssayâHEK293 EBNA cells were transiently cotransfected with 3 Î¼g of MEKK3, K391M, or point mutants and 3 Î¼gof NF-ÎºB luciferase reporter construct (Promega, Madison, WI). Cellular extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection using passive lysis buffer (Promega) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 Ã g for 10 min, and 10 Î¼g of protein was used to measure luminescence with a TD luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). p38 MAP Kinase AssayâHEK293 EBNA cells were transiently transfected as previously described above. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. The p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated as described previously (17Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of cellular extract was incubated with polyclonal anti-p38 antibody (provided by Gary Johnson) and then rotated at 4 Â°C for 1 h with Protein A conjugated to Sepharose (Sigma). Protein complexes were collected by centrifugation at 2000 Ã g for 5 min. Samples were washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 25 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4. After the final wash, the buffer was removed from the beads, and a kinase reaction mix consisting of kinase buffer, 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 10 Î¼g of GST-ATF-2 was added to the beads. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 30 Â°C. The kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 Î¼l of 2Ã Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were heated for 5 min at 90 Â°C and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then the gel was dried and processed for autoradiography. Production of Phosphoantibody Ser526âPhosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides, CMSGTGIRpSVTGTPY and CMSGTGIRSVTGTPY (where pS denotes phosphoserine), were synthesized corresponding to amino acids 519â532 of MEKK3 (New England Peptide, Inc.). The amino-terminal cysteine was introduced to provide a sulfhydryl moiety for conjugating to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and a solid support. The phosphopeptide was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in PBS, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with 0.2 n NaOH for conjugation to KLH. The phosphopeptide (5 mg) was combined with 5 mg of KLH and incubated at 25 Â°C for 2 h, and the conjugated peptide was dialyzed overnight in PBS. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method, and the peptide-KLH conjugate was aliquoted (250 or 500 Î¼g) for injection into New Zealand White rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA). Both peptides were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 5 mm EDTA before coupling to a solid support. Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce) was brought to room temperature, and â¼5 ml of gel slurry (2.5-ml column volume) was packed into a column (Econo columns; Fisher). The column was equilibrated with 6 volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5mm EDTA prior to the addition of 4 mg of peptide. Gel and peptide were incubated for 15 min at room temperature without mixing. Subsequently, the peptide and column mixture were incubated for 30 min at room temperature without mixing. The resin was washed with 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 5 mm EDTA, and then 50 mm cysteine (prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 5 mm EDTA) was added to block nonspecific sites on the gel by applying 1 ml of cysteine for every 1 ml of gel. This reaction proceeded for 15 min with no mixing and 30 min of mixing. The resin was washed with 16 volumes of 1 m NaCl and 16 volumes of 0.05% sodium azide/PBS and then stored at 4 Â°C prior to use. Phosphospecific antibody was purified via a two-step affinity column procedure. Briefly, â¼7 ml of rabbit antisera was applied through a 0.45-Î¼m filter, the serum was delipidated with octanoic acid, and the IgG fraction was collected by ammonium sulfate precipitation (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 551-552Google Scholar). IgG was applied twice to an affinity column containing the phosphopeptide, and bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7. Affinity-purified antibody was dialyzed in PBS and then applied to an affinity column containing the nonphosphopeptide, and the antibody that passed through the column (anti-phospho-Ser526 antibody) was collected, dialyzed in PBS containing 50% glycerol, and stored at 4 Â°C until use. Dephosphorylation of MEKK3âHEK293 EBNA cells were transfected with FLAG-MEKK3 or an empty vector, and cell extracts were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, which was also supplemented with one tablet of serine and cysteine protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml of buffer. The buffer lacked serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors, and the cell extracts were maintained on ice. Extracts were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 14,000 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C. Cell extracts containing MEKK3 (100 Î¼g) were supplemented with 1.5 Î¼l of 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.12 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were incubated in a volume of 20 Î¼l at 30 Â°C, and after 1 h, 2Ã Laemmli sample buffer was added to the cell extracts, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Ser526 antibody. Phosphorylation of MKK6âFLAG-MEKK3 was transfected into HEK293 EBNA cells and immunoprecipitated as described above. Preparation of the cDNA that encodes GST-KA-MKK6 was previously described (19Derbyshire Z.E. Halfter U.M. Heimark R.L. Sy T.H. Vaillancourt R.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 271: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the GST portion of the fusion protein was removed by proteolysis with Factor Xa. The kinase assay was performed as follows in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 25 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 50 Î¼m ATP, 20 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol), and 10 Î¼g of recombinant KA-MKK6, incubated at 30 Â°C for 20 min, and stopped by the addition of 40 Î¼l of 2Ã Laemmli-DTT buffer. The proteins were denatured by heating for 5 min at 95 Â°C, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the gel was dried prior to autoradiography. Isolation of Proteins with GST-14-3-3ÏµâCell extracts were prepared by lysis in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.25 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin. Extracts were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 14,000 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C. Approximately 500 Î¼g of cellular extract was incubated with 20 Î¼g of recombinant GST-lamin (amino acids 66â206) or GST-14-3-3Ïµ fusion proteins bound to Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4Â°C. Samples were then washed twice with PAN-Nonidet P-40 and once with PAN, proteins were collected at 2000 Ã g in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, and then the isolated proteins were incubated with cell extract containing endogenous protein phosphatases. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and after transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was probed with an amino-terminal antibody that recognizes total MEKK3 or phospho-Ser526, followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody. Ser526 and Thr530 Are Required for MEKK3-dependent NF-ÎºB Luciferase ActivityâMEKK3 has previously been shown to play a critical role in the NF-ÎºB signal transduction pathway (9Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Chiao P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1287-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and therefore a NF-ÎºB luciferase assay was chosen as one method to screen point mutants in the activation loop of MEKK3. To investigate which amino acids might be essential in the regulation of NF-ÎºB-dependent transcription, each serine and threonine within the activation loop of MEKK3 was mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). Each point mutant of MEKK3 was transfected into HEK293 EBNA cells, along with a luciferase reporter gene containing the NF-ÎºB recognition sequence. After 48 h, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. Expression of MEKK3 resulted in agonist-independent transcription of the NF-ÎºB luciferase reporter gene, whereas only the (S526A) and (T530S) point mutants failed to activate the reporter gene (data not shown). This result suggested that Ser526 and Thr530 are required for MEKK3-dependent regulation of the NF-ÎºB promoter. Moreover, this result strongly suggested that Ser526 and Thr530 might be phosphorylation sites within the activation loop of MEKK3. Ser526 or Thr530 were mutated to aspartic or glutamic acid, since such mutations have been shown to produce constitutively active kinases (21Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 22Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in which S526A, S526D, S526E, T530A, T530D, and T530E MEKK3 were transfected into HEK293 EBNA cells, along with the NF-ÎºB luciferase reporter gene. The S526A and T530A MEKK3 mutants were unable to activate transcription of the NF-ÎºB luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1B). However, the aspartic and glutamic acid mutants of Ser526 restored â¼50% of wild-type MEKK3 activity, suggesting that the negative charge of the carboxyl group might mimic the negative charge of a phosphate moiety at this position. In contrast, the aspartic and glutamic acid mutants of Thr530 were unable to restore NF-ÎºB luciferase activity, indicating that a negative charge at position 530 was not tolerated within the activation loop. In addition, mutation of the active site lysine to methionine (K391M) abrogated luciferase activity, indicating that the catalytic activity of MEKK3 was required for NF-ÎºB-dependent luciferase activity. Thus, S526A and T530A MEKK3 were unable to activate transcription through the NF-ÎºB promoter, although the active site lysine was retained, demonstrating that serine 526 and threonine 530 are important for MEKK3-dependent transcription. Activation Loop Mutants S526A and T530A MEKK3 Is Unable to Activate the MEK and ERK PathwayâOverexpression of MEKK3 results in the activation of several MAP kinases that include the ERK, JNK, p38, and ERK5 pathways. Due to the intriguing biological activity of the S526A and T530A activation loop point mutants in the NF-ÎºB luciferase assay, we chose to investigate the role of these point mutants in activating the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways. First, we investigated the ERK MAPK pathway. HEK293 EBNA cells were transiently transfected with MEKK3, catalytically inactive MEKK3, and the seven activation loop point mutants to determine whether the activation loop point mutants were capable of activating the ERK pathway. After 48 h, cellular extracts were prepared and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for phosphorylated ERK. Consistent with the luciferase assays described above, expression of (S526A) and (T530A), as well as catalytically inactive MEKK3, did not result in phosphorylation of ERK1 and -2 (Fig. 2, top). In contrast, expression of MEKK3, as well as the S511A, T516A, T520A, T522A, and the T528A point mutants resulted in ERK activation. In addition, the constitutively active mutants of Ser526, S526D and S526E, also yielded a robust phosphorylation of the ERKs, whereas the constitutively active mutants of Thr530, T530D and T530E, were not able to activate the ERKs (data not shown), which was consistent with the luciferase assay previously shown. The nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently reprobed for ERK1 and -2 as a loading control, thereby demonstrating that differences in ERK phosphorylation were due to MEKK3 activity and not ERK expression. Previous work has shown that ERK1 and -2 are phosphorylated and activated by MEK1 and -2 (23Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of MEKK3 affected MEK phosphorylation, the experiment described above was also probed for phosphorylated MEK1 and -2. Consistent with the ERK data, cells transfected with the S526A and T530A point mutants did not result in phosphorylation of MEK1 and -2 (Fig. 2, middle). The membrane was subsequently reprobed for MEK1 and -2 as a loading control. In addition, the membrane was also probed for MEKK3 expression by using the monoclonal antibody that recognizes the FLAG epitope, which demonstrated similar transfection efficiencies for each of the mutants. It is interesting to note that K391M, S526A, and T530A MEKK3, which are the three mutants that were unable to activate ERK and MEK phosphorylation, appeared as discreet polypeptides on the MEKK3 immunoblot, which typically indicates a lack of phosphorylation (Fig. 2, bottom, lanes c, e, and i). The reduced width of the immunoblotted protein bands probably reflects decreased phosphorylation of MEKK3 and not decreased expression (also see Fig. 5, lane g). Activation Loop Mutants S526A and T530A MEKK3 Are Unable to Activate the p38 MAP KinaseâSince MEKK3 has been shown to activate the p38 MAP kinase (5Deacon K. Blank J.L. J. Biol.

The implications of these facts on the origin of informational polymers are discussed. Minimal requirements for informational polymers to have originated under prebiotic conditions are a unitary chemical frame for the synthesis of nucleobases and a favorable thermodynamic energy balance for the polymerization of nucleotides to oligonucleotides. A Formamide-based Unitary ChemistryâTo gather into a single reaction milieu all the precursors necessary for the assembly of the first informational polymers, a unitary chemical frame is needed. A series of observations suggest that formamide (NH2CHO) chemistry might have provided such a frame. To summarize the evidence: the one-carbon compound formamide is a highly versatile building block for the syntheses of all the necessary precursor nucleic bases. We have reported (Refs. 1Saladino R.

These compounds are obtained from formamide heated in the presence of simple inorganic catalysts such as silica, alumina, zeolites, CaCO3, TiO2, common clays, kaolin, montmorillonites, olivines, and cosmic dust analogues of olivines. In all cases and for each catalyst several compounds were simultaneously formed, as summarized in Ref. 4Saladino R. Crestini C. Neri V. Brucato J.R. Colangeli L. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 1368-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. The richest yields were obtained in the presence of clays, TiO2, and cosmic dust analogues. Guanine is conspicuously absent, but a possible efficient substitute in base pairing might have been provided by hypoxanthine. Notably, formamide also yields purine acyclonucleosides through a formose-like condensation of N-formyl derivatives (2Saladino R. Ciambecchini U. Crestini C. Costanzo G. Negri R. Di Mauro E. ChemBioChem. 2003; 4: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), providing a solution to the long-standing problem of the lack of reactivity between nucleobases and ribose or 2â²-deoxyribose. In addition, formamide is an efficient activator of nucleoside trans-phosphorylation (Refs. 5Schoffstall A.M.

Di Mauro and G. Costanzo, unpublished observations. further supporting its possible relevance in the prebiotic polymerization reactions that did lead to pre-genetic informational macromolecules. Formamide is easily formed by hydrolysis of HCN and is stable in liquid form over a wide range of temperatures (2.5-210 Â°C). This property favors its concentration from dilute aqueous solutions by moderate heating. These physico-chemical attributes and its presence along with that of H2O and HCN in planets, comets, asteroids, and in the interstellar space (8Millar T.J. Astrobiology: Future Perspectives.in: Ehrenfreund P. Irvine W.M. Owen T. Becker L. Blank J Brucato J.R. Colangeli L. Derenne S. Dutrey A. Despois D. Lazcano A. Robert F. Vol. 305. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2004: 17-31Google Scholar) support its possible prebiotic role. A hypothetical, but plausible and simple, scenario could thus consist of the following: in the presence of a varied (perhaps complete) panel of nucleic acid precursors dissolved in a water/formamide solution at moderately high temperature and in the presence of a phosphate donor, formamide-based trans-phosphorylation reactions would lead to the formation of oligomers and kick start a molecular evolutionary process. We are not dealing here in any further detail with such a highly hypothetical and fragmentarily outlined synthetic process, our intention being limited to the indication of its chemical plausibility. The Thermodynamic ProblemâIn the origin of the informational polymers, their survival as macromolecules is even more problematic than the polymerization process itself. Do physico-chemical conditions exist, providing kinetic and/or thermodynamic advantage to the otherwise intrinsically more unstable polymeric form over the monomer? We focus here on RNA and describe a systematic comparison of the stability of the phosphoester bonds in the precursor monomers versus the stability of the same bonds when present in RNA, under a wide range of temperatures and water/formamide ratios. Such comparison was lacking and provides information directly relevant to the monomer versus polymer bias. The stability of the Î²-glycosidic bond in the same set of conditions was also determined. A parallel analysis was recently performed (9Saladino R. Crestini C. Busiello V. Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35658-35669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) comparing the corresponding stability properties for 2â²-deoxynucleosides, deoxynucleotides, and deoxyoligonucleotides. Thus, a direct comparison between relative bond stabilities in RNA and DNA is here for the first time provided under comparable conditions. Adenine, ribose, ribose 5â²-monophosphate, adenosine, adenosine 5â²-monophosphate (5â²-AMP), and adenosine 3â²-monophosphate (3â²-AMP) were from Sigma Aldrich, analytical grade. The degradation of RNA in water, in formamide, and in formamide-containing aqueous solutions was studied on P1 RNA. This RNA has the sequence 5â²-GGAAACGUAUCCUUUGGGAG-3â², was purchased from RNATEC, and was kindly provided by E. Caffarelli (10La Neve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E.

HPLC AnalysisâSamples were resuspended at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in water or in the appropriate formamide reaction medium (usually in 0.5-1.0 ml). Temperatures and incubation times are indicated. 10-Î¼l aliquots of the reaction mixtures were diluted to a final concentration of 50% formamide in a final volume of 20 Î¼l and injected into a Supelcosilâ¢ LC-18-S 5-Î¼m HPLC column (Supelco) 15 cm Ã 4.6 mm. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at room temperature with methanol:30 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.3 (2.5:97.5), UV 254 nm, pressure 1.5 atmosphere, on an HPLC Beckman System Gold instrument. Identification of the peaks was performed by comparison with real samples. RNA Preparation and Labeling; RNA 5â²-Labelingâ10 Î¼molP1RNA were labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). The oligo was then purified on a 16% denaturing acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel. After elution, the residual polyacrylamide was removed by a NuncTrap Probe purification column (Stratagene). 2 pmol (typically 30,000 cpm) RNA were processed for each sample. Ribooligonucleotide Degradation Protocols and AnalysesâThe 5â²-labeled oligonucleotide was treated under the time, temperature, and solution conditions indicated where appropriate. To stop the reaction a solution of 5 Ã 10-4m (final concentration) of tetrasodium pyrophosphate (Sigma) dissolved in water, pH 7.5, was added to a final volume of 40 Î¼l. The samples were vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. This procedure was performed twice. The supernatant was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 5 Î¼l of formamide buffer, heated for 2 min at 65 Â°C, and loaded on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide).

Half-lives of the Bonds in the RibooligonucleotideâFor oligonucleotides, the half-lives of the phosphoester bonds were determined from the rate of disappearance of the band representing the intact 20-mer molecule. Cleavage of RNA normally requires participation of the 2â²-OH group as an internal nucleophile (12Morrow J.R. Aures K. Epstein D.J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1995; 23: 2431-2432Crossref Google Scholar) by two ânucleophilic cleavageâ events: the trans-esterification and hydrolysis reactions (Fig. 1). During the trans-esterification (pathway a), the 2â²-OH nucleophile attacks on tetrahedral phosphorus (V) affording a 2â²,3â²-cyclic monophosphate I, which in turn can be hydrolyzed to a mixture of 3â²- and 2â²-phosphate monoester II and III, respectively (pathway b). Both steps can be catalyzed by a large range of chemical species, including protons, hydroxide, nitrogen derivatives, and metal ions. On the basis of this known mechanism two operative assumptions were made. 1) It was assumed that the cleavage of the 3â²-phosphoester bond is largely more effective than the cleavage of the 5â²-one and that for practical calculation purposes the 5â²-phosphoester bond is not cleaved. In support, the cleavage of the 5â² terminally labeled RNA molecule only shows the standard cleavage of the 3â²-bond (see Fig. 6), whereas the double bands typically produced by 3â²- and 5â²-cleavages occurring in the same population of molecules were never detected. This contrasts with DNA (9Saladino R. Crestini C. Busiello V. Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35658-35669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), where under several conditions both cleavages do occur, giving rise to the diagnostic double bands. 2) In the ribooligonucleotide studied here, the breakage of the phosphodiester chain is not sequence biased under the conditions used. This sequence may have, like many other RNAs, preferential breakage sites (10La Neve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol.

Outside the special cleavage conditions this RNA is stable (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 10La Neve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These conditions are well characterized (10La Neve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I.

Best fit curves were calculated with Microsoft Excel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The half-life of the oligonucleotide was determined with standard graphical procedure from plots of the % disappearance of the intact 20-mer molecules. Given that one disappearing molecule represents one cleavage, and given the two assumptions reported (no 5â²-cleavage, no sequence bias), the half-life of a 3â²-phosphoester bond in the ribooligonucleotide is given by the half-life of the oligonucleotide Ã 19 (that is: the number of 3â²-phosphoester bonds in the 20-mer). The Î²-Glycosidic BondâThe stability of the Î²-glycosidic bond of nucleosides in water was determined in early studies under several conditions (13Kochetkov N.K. Budovskii E.I. Sverdlov E.D. Simukova N.A. Turchinskii M.F. Shibaev V.N. Organic Chemistry of Nucleic Acids.in: Kochetkov N.K. Budovskii E.I. Plenum Press, London and New York1972: 425-448Crossref Google Scholar). We describe here the effect of formamide on the stability of this bond. Measurements were performed as a function of formamide concentration in water and of temperature. In addition to its interest per se, determination of the stability of this bond is a prerequisite for the analysis of the stability of phosphoester bonds in nucleotides and in oligonucleotides. Fig. 2 shows the high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) 3The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. analysis of the degradation of adenosine (%, ordinate) as a function of time (abscissa) and of the concentration of formamide in the aqueous medium (from 0 to 100%, as indicated in each panel). The upper panel on the right side provides the interpretation key. The red letters indicate the starting compound, in this case ribose (R) bound to the base (B) adenine. The cleavage (arrow) of the glycosidic bond (red) yields ribose (R, black), which is not detected under our conditions, and adenine (B, green). The same color code is used in the plots of the following figures. Thus, the disappearance of adenosine (red line) is accompanied by the appearance of adenine (green line). For the nucleoside the process is slow. In the actual HPLC experimental layout, no peaks other than those of adenosine and adenine are observed. Thus, no other cleavage than that of the Î²-glycosidic bond occurs under this range of conditions. The half-life of this bond at 90 Â°C in water is >5 Ã 105 min. Increasing concentrations of formamide first decrease and then (>25%) increase the stability of this bond. Fig. 5 shows this double effect exerted by increasing formamide on the stability of the Î²-glycosidic bond. Fig. 5 also shows the t1/2 of the same bond in both 5â²- and 3â²-adenosine monophosphates (these latter data are from Figs. 3 and 4, respectively, see below). Interestingly, in the presence of a phosphate group in both 3â²- and (less so) in the 5â²-position, the half-life of the Î²-glycosidic bond is strongly decreased in water and it is progressively protected by increasing formamide concentrations. The t1/2 of the Î²-glycosidic bond in H2O is 0.14 Ã104 min for the 3â²-AMP and 0.21 Ã 104 min for the 5â²-AMP (see legend to Fig. 5). At formamide >33% the high stability (>5 Ã 105 min) of this bond is re-attained. These effects are markedly sensitive to temperature (Fig. 5, middle and lower panels).FIGURE 3HPLC analysis of the degradation kinetics of 3â²-monophosphate adenosine. Color code as above; the complete 3â²-AMP molecule is indicated in blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4HPLC analysis of the degradation kinetics of 5â²-monophosphate adenosine, as in Figs. 2 and 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 3â²-Phosphoester BondâThe degradation rates of the 3â²-AMP were analyzed as a function of both temperature and formamide concentrations (Fig. 3, the analysis shown is at 90 Â°C). The disappearance of the 3â²-AMP (blue) in water (upper left panel) is matched by the appearance of the nucleoside (red), thus being primarily caused by the cleavage of the 3â²-phosphoester bond. In water the Î²-glycosidic bond is cleaved with a slightly slower kinetics, and the corresponding product (adenine, green) appears with a slower kinetics. Eventually, all the nucleoside is cleaved into sugar (not detected) and adenine. The presence of low concentrations of formamide (starting at 3%) markedly protects the Î²-glycosidic bond (green line), allowing almost exclusively the cleavage of the phosphoester (red line). The 5â²-Phosphoester BondâThe same analysis was performed on 5â²-AMP. The results of the analysis at 90 Â°C are reported in Fig. 4. The overall trend is similar to that of 3â²-AMP, with the notable exception of the behavior in water (upper left panel). Under these conditions the Î²-glycosidic bond (green line) is cleaved faster than the phosphoester bond (red line). Also, for the 5â²-AMP the protective effect exerted by formamide is strong and starts at low concentration. The half-lives of both the 3â²- and 5â²-phosphoester bonds as a function of increasing formamide and at different temperatures are plotted in Fig. 7. Summarizing the numerous effects exerted by water/formamide and temperature on the stability of the Î²-glycosidic and the phosphate bonds in the nucleoside and in its 3â²- and 5â²-phosphate forms, we observe for the Î²-glycosidic bond: (i) high stability in water (> 5 Ã 105 min) for the nucleoside, (ii) enhanced cleavage by low formamide/water ratios (<33%) versus protection by higher ones (â¥33%) (Fig. 5), and (iii) enhanced instability exerted by the presence of a phosphate group, especially so in water (Fig. 5). This latter effect is contrary to what is observed in 5â²-deoxyadenosine, where the phosphate group exerts a strong protective effect on the Î²-glycosidic bond in water (Fig. 9 in Ref. 9Saladino R. Crestini C. Busiello V. Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35658-35669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the phosphoester bonds we observed (Fig. 7) an overall instability (higher for the 3â²-than for the 5â²-phosphoester bond) and a substantial lack of effects by formamide, contrasting with the marked protection exerted by formamide on the Î²-glycosidic bond. The comparison of this set of properties with those defined in 2â²-deoxymonomers is under âDiscussion.â The Half-life of the 3â²-Phosphoester Bond in a RibooligonucleotideâThe 5â²-labeled 20-mer ribooligonucleotide described under âMaterialsâ was treated at various temperatures for the indicated times (Fig. 6) in water or in the presence of 1.5, 3, 25, or 100% formamide. Fig. 6 shows one example of the degradation progression observed. The kinetics of degradation of the ribooligonucleotide is calculated from the disappearance of the full-sized molecule (top band) (see âMethodsâ). Fig. 6 shows that, as a general trend, increasing formamide concentration first increases and then protects RNA from the hydrolytic process. Fig. 7 shows the quantitative evaluation of this type of degradation experiment, performed at 30, 70, and 90 Â°C (left, middle, and right panels, as indicated) for the appropriate range of times: lower temperatures required longer reaction times. Each panel shows the half-lives of the 3â²-phosphoester bond determined from digestions similar to those reported in Fig. 6. The half-lives of the 5â²- and 3â²-phosphoester bonds, determined from the HPLC measurements described in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively, are also reported. The results in Fig. 7 show that in water and at high formamide concentrations at 70Â° and 90 Â°C the average 3â²-phosphoester bond in the oligonucleotide is more stable than the corresponding one in the nucleotide; the 5â²-phosphoester in the oligo is so stable that its cleavage could not be measured (see âMethodsâ and âDiscussionâ). The 5â²-phosphoester bond in the nucleotide is also always more stable than the 3â²-one. The gray shade indicates the area of polymer-higher-than-monomer 3â²-phosphoester bond stability. We have analyzed the stabilities of the bonds that are more relevant for the persistence of the ribonucleic acid as a polymer, the Î²-glycosidic and the 3â²- and 5â²-phosphoester ones. The stability of each bond markedly varied depending on the molecular context in which it was embedded. In addition, differential variations of the bond stabilities were observed as a function of the physical (namely temperature) and chemical (namely water and/or formamide) environment. The effects of the presence of formamide were studied because of the reported synthesis in its presence of a complete set of nucleic acid precursors and of its trans-phosphorylating activity. The hypothetical scenario for the synthesis of the pre-genetic nucleic polymers would thus simply consist of formamide-based syntheses in the presence of the appropriate combination of catalysts (1Saladino R. Crestini C. Costanzo G. Negri R. Di Mauro E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Saladino R. Ciambecchini U. Crestini C. Costanzo G. Negri R.

This scenario, however hypothetical, is chemically plausible and justifies the stability analyses reported here. The âwarm little pondâ imagined by Darwin (14Darwin F. Advances in Medicine and Biology. 3. John Murray, London1888: 18Google Scholar) as the original cradle would in this chemical system contain also formamide. Out of an origin-of-informational-polymers frame of interest the varying stabilities of the 3â²- and the 5â²-phosphoester bonds as a function of the molecular context are relevant per se. We have limited our approach to the phenomenological aspects of the problem, refraining for the moment from detailed chemical mechanistic studies. Three sets of comparisons highlight the relevant correlations found, as follows. Comparison of the Bond Stabilities in Ribo- and in 2â²-DeoxyriboNucleosides and NucleotidesâThe comparison of the bond stabilities in ribo- and in 2â²-deoxyribonucleosides and nucleotides (Table 1) shows the following.TABLE 1Comparison of bond stabilities in ribomonomers and deoxyribomonomersBondDeoxyribonucleosideDeoxyribonucleotideRibonucleosideRibonucleotideÎ²-glycosidicH2O10 Ã 103â>5 Ã 105â (both 3â² and 5â²)Formamideâ (low), â (high)â (low), â (high)â (low), â (high)â (both 3â² and 5â²)Phosphoester 5â²H2O>25 Ã 1032.0 Ã 103FormamideââPhosphoester 3â²H2O2.5 Ã 1030.9 Ã 103Formamideââ Open table in a new tab 1)The Î²-glycosidic bond is more stable in the ribo- than in the 2â²-deoxyribonucleosides by two orders of magnitude. This reactivity is in accordance with previous results on the stability of the Î²-glycosidic bond in nucleosides and 2â²-deoxynucleosides under acidic catalysis. In this case, electron-withdrawing substituents at the 2â²-position of the carbohydrate moiety, like the 2â²-OH group in ribose, lowered the reaction rate of the hydrolysis (15Garrett E.R. Seydel J.K. Sharper A.J. J. Org. Chem. 1966; 31: 189-194Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The presence of the phosphate group remarkably causes diverging effects in the 2â²-deoxyribo (stability increase) relative to the ribo (stability decrease) derivatives. This effect is strong (compare Fig. 9A of Ref. 9Saladino R. Crestini C. Busiello V. Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35658-35669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and Figs. 2, 3, 4 of this report).The Î²-glycosidic bond is destabilized by low concentrations of formamide (up to â¼ 25% weight/volume) and then at high concentration is stabilized again. This effect is observed for the 2â²-deoxyribonucleoside, for the 2â²-deoxyribonucleotide, and for the ribonucleoside, whereas for the ribonucleotide the presence of formamide strongly stabilizes the Î²-glycosidic bond starting from the lowest concentration tested (3% weight/volume) (Figs. 3 and 4).The protective effect exerted by formamide is probably due to the formation of an extensive and highly organized hydrogen bond network shielding the removal of nucleobases (9Saladino R. Crestini C. Busiello V. Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35658-35669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Harrison S.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 17Travers A.A. DNA-Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall, New York1993Crossref Google Scholar). Because of the high directionality of the hydrogen bond, the position of the phosphate moiety (5â²-versus 3â²-phosphate) is also a relevant stereo electronic parameter to be considered, 5â²-AMP being more stable than 3â²-AMP. Similar results were obtained in the case of 5â²-deoxy AMP and 3â²-deoxy AMP.2)The phosphoester bonds are more stable in the 2â²-deoxyribonucleotides than in the ribonucleotides, more markedly so for the 5â²-(one order of magnitude) than for the 3â²-one (2-3-fold). In accordance with a general base-catalyzed cleavage mechanism, the weakly basic formamide decreases the stability of the phosphoester bonds in all cases (18JÃ¤rvinen P. Oivanen M. LÃ¶nberg H. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 5396-5403Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This effect is particularly strong for 5â²-deoxy AMP (Fig. 9B of Ref. 9Saladino R. Crestini C. Busiello V. Ciciriello F.

Comparison of Bond Stabilities in Ribomononucleotides and RibooligonucleotidesâThe comparison of bond stabilities in ribomononucleotides and ribooligonucleotides (Fig. 7) shows that in water and in a large area corresponding to high formamide concentrations, the 3â²-phosphoester bond is more stable in the polymer than in the monomer. Because this is the weak bond of the RNA phosphodiester chain, the conditions identified (shaded in gray) define the physical frame in which the ribooligonucleotide has a thermodynamic advantage over the monomer. The other conditions tested (varying H2O/formamide ratios, higher and lower temperatures) all appear to favor the persistence of the monomer as an unpolymerized unit. Comparison of Bond Stabilities in Ribooligonucleotides and 2â²-DeoxyribooligonucleotidesâWe compared (Fig. 8) the half-lives of the phosphodiester bonds: the 5â²- and 3â²-bonds in 2â²-deoxyribooligonucleotides and the 3â²-bond in ribooligonucleotides.

But DNA has cognate properties. (i) Its codogenic capacities need no further mention. (ii) The variety of tertiary structures is a fundamental property of the double (and of the single) strand, from the subtle variations of the 16 conformational local parameters used for its systematization (21Diekmann S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to the global dynamic properties characterizing topologically defined DNA domains (22Bales T.C. White J.H. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol.

DNA catalytic potentialities and versatility are well established (recently reviewed in Ref. 30Peracchi A. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Translation remains a unique property of RNA at present and a support for RNA being an older information carrier than DNA. Codogenic structural and catalytic abilities are not absolute discriminating factors in deciding whether a âDNA worldâ existed before or after, or whether since the beginning it co-evolved, with the RNA world. Ignoring the physico-chemical conditions in which initial informational polymers formed, survived, and evolved does prevent an experimentally testable discrimination. A fourth property of the polymeric systems that might provide information on the origin of informational polymers and on the who-came-first problem is the ensemble of thermodynamic and kinetics considerations pertaining to polymerization process and polymers stability. Let us dub this property with a collective name: persistence. This topic is critically examined and brought to propositive conclusions in Ref. 31Halvorson H.O. van Holde K.E. The Origins of Life and Evolution. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1980: 31-46Google Scholar. Starting from the consideration that the condensation reactions are not thermodynamically spontaneous in dilute aqueous solution or even at moderate water activities, two possible solutions have been proposed for their occurrence (31Halvorson H.O. van Holde K.E. The Origins of Life and Evolution. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1980: 31-46Google Scholar). The first is the mechanism used by contemporary organisms, the activation of monomers by phosphorylation. The second is the evasion from the unfavorable Gibbs free-energy change (ÎGÂ°â²) by reducing the water activity. As for the first, the fact that phosphorylated monomers played a resolutory role in prebiotic polymerizations is highly unlikely on kinetic grounds. The second implies, in order to allow the formation of oligonucleotides (or for that matter of any other polymer) of appreciable chain length and in appreciable concentrations, both nearly pure monomers and highly dehydrating conditions. The idea of a primeval soup is therefore not thermodynamically sound. If syntheses of precursor monomers had occurred in an aqueous solution, the considerations reported above imply the necessity of a process involving dehydration and subsequent concentration. Given that the conditions needed for the syntheses of the first polynucleotides (dry chemistry) and for their template copying (solution chemistry) are essentially antithetical, repeated cycles of hydration and dehydration would have been required. These thermodynamic considerations help in delineating the physico-chemical initial scenario. Small bodies of water (i.e. aqueous droplets trapped in crevices in rocks) subject to periodic evaporation and re-hydration were suggested (31Halvorson H.O. van Holde K.E. The Origins of Life and Evolution. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1980: 31-46Google Scholar) as initial reaction milieu. This dynamic environment is compatible with the scenario into which our data may be adjusted with the specification that formamide must have also been present. The data reported in this study on the differential stabilities of the relevant bonds (monomers versus polymers) and (ribo versus deoxy) identify two thermodynamically permissive niches, which differ for DNA and RNA: >90 Â°C and >80% H2NCHO/H2O for DNA and >70-90 Â°C, H2O and/or various H2NCHO/H2O ratios for RNA. Which of the niches provided the conditions that were actually used for kick-starting the replication-evolution process is not ascertained at present. However, the approach defined here may bring the fourth property of the RNA world mentioned above (persistence) into an experimentally verifiable frame."

Crystal structures of PDE5 C domain bound with the inhibitors sildenafil or vardenafil revealed that atoms in these inhibitors that are analogous to substituents at N-1 and C-6 in cGMP form a bidentate H-bond with the Gln817 side chain (Fig. 1B) (12Sung B.J.

X-ray crystal structures of isolated C domains of PDEs co-crystallized with ligands provide invaluable insights into contacts and topography of the catalytic sites. However, the importance of these contacts must be experimentally quantified in holoenzymes to assess the role of these interactions in the enzyme-ligand complex and to provide appropriate direction for improved drug design. The combined approaches provide a more accurate profile of catalytic site function. Based on the prediction of the glutamine switch as the determinant of cN selectivity in PDEs and supporting x-ray crystallographic evidence, we hypothesized that Gln817 is a critical contact for interaction with cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, or IBMX and that H-bonding of the Gln817 side chain with Gln775 optimizes the configuration for contact with cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, and IBMX but not with cAMP. Removal of the H-bonding potential provided by Gln775 was predicted to free the rotational constraint of Gln817, weaken affinity for cGMP, and improve affinity for cAMP substantially. To address these questions, point mutations of Gln817 and Gln775 were created to determine (a) the importance of Gln817 in providing for potency of interaction of PDE5 with cGMP, cAMP, or inhibitors and (b) the role of Gln775 in providing for cGMP versus cAMP specificity in PDE5 and its impact on sildenafil or vardenafil potency. Materialsâ[3H]cGMP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. IBMX, Crotalus atrox snake venom, cGMP, and histone type II-AS were obtained from Sigma. Sildenafil was purified from Viagra tablets as described in our earlier report (16Francis S.H. Sekhar K.R. Rouse A.B. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2003; 15: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Generation of Wild-type and Mutant (Q817A and Q775A) hPDE5A1â Human cDNA coding for full-length PDE5A1 (courtesy of Dr. K. Omori, Tanabe-Seiyaku Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Saitama, Japan) was used as the template to generate full-length PDE5A1 by introduction of start and stop codons at appropriate loci. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPOÂ® vector (Invitrogen), verified by sequencing, and then ligated into the EcoRI and NotI unique sites of the baculovirus expression vector pAcHLT-A (Pharmingen). pAcHLT-A vector contains a His6 sequence that precedes the coding region. This step resulted in plasmid pAcA-PDE5 (Met1âAsn875), which generated N-terminally His-tagged recombinant hPDE5A1. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to make point mutations (Gln817 to Ala (Q817A) and Gln775 to Ala (Q775A)) in the pAcA-PDE5 expression vector according to the manufacturerâs protocol using the following pairs of mutagenic oligonucleotides (altered bases are underlined): 1) for Q817A, 5â²-ATCCCAAGTATGGCAGTTGGGTTCATAG-3â² and 5â²-CTATGAACCCAACTGCCATACTTGGGAT-3â²; 2) for Q775A, 5â²-AACCCTGGCCTATTGCACAACGGATAGCAG-3â² and 5â²-CTGCTATCCGTTGTGCAATAGGCCAGGGTT-3â². The presence of the desired mutation was verified by sequencing the entire DNA segment. Expression of Wild-type and Mutant hPDE5A1âSf9 cells (BD Pharmingen) were cotransfected with BaculoGold linear baculovirus DNA (BD Pharmingen) and one of the hPDE5A1 constructs (PDE5WT (Met1âAsn875), PDE5Q817A (Met1âAsn875)Q817A, and PDE5Q775A (Met1âAsn875)Q775A) in the pAcHLT-A baculovirus expression vector by the calcium phosphate method according to the protocol from BD Pharmingen. At 5 days post-infection, the cotransfection supernatant was collected, amplified three times in Sf9 cells, and used directly as viral stock for expression without additional purification of recombinant viruses. Sf9 cells grown at 27 Â°C in complete Graceâs insect medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 Î¼g/ml gentamicin (Sigma) in T-175 flasks (Corning) were typically infected with 100 Î¼l of viral stock/flask and harvested 92 h post-infection. Purification of Wild-type and Mutant hPDE5A1âPurification steps were done at 4 Â°C. The Sf9 cell pellet for each T-175 flask (â¼2 Ã 107 cells) was resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) containing Completeâ¢ protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cell suspension was homogenized in 10â20-ml aliquots on ice by two 6-s bursts in an Ultra Turrex microhomogenizer (Tekmar) with a 20-s recovery between bursts. Cell homogenate was centrifuged (20 min, 10,000 rpm, in a Beckman JA-20 rotor). The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column (1 Ã 2 cm) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was sequentially washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer and a stepwise gradient of imidazole (0.8 to 20 mm) in lysis buffer. Lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole was soaked into the resin, and after 2 h, ten 1-ml fractions were collected. Elutions containing PDE5 protein were dialyzed versus 2000 volumes of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 25 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, and 150 mm NaCl, flash-frozen in the same buffer containing 10% sucrose, and stored at â70 Â°C. Activity in frozen samples was stable for at least 10 months. SDS-PAGE of hPDE5A1 ConstructsâThe purity and integrity of proteins were assessed using SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were boiled for 4 min in the presence of 10% SDS, 2 m Î²-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before visualization by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. cGMP BindingâTo measure allosteric cGMP-binding, Millipore filter binding assays were conducted in a total volume of 50 Î¼l of reaction mixture that contained 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml histone type II-AS, 30 mm dl-dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sildenafil, and either 3 Î¼m (for stoichoimetry determination) or 0.05â4 Î¼m (for binding affinity determination) [3H]cGMP. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and incubated at 4 Â°C for 60 min. 1 ml of cold KP buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8) was added to each sample, and samples were filtered immediately onto premoistened Millipore HAWP filters (pore size 0.45 Î¼m). Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of cold KP buffer, dried, and counted using non-aqueous Ready Safe scintillation mixture (Beckman). Counts bound to PDE5 were corrected by subtraction of nonspecific binding (+1 mm unlabeled cGMP). Blanks containing no PDE5 were run for each [3H]cGMP concentration. Catalytic ActivityâPDE activity was determined as described (17Francis S.H. Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either cGMP (0â750 Î¼m and [3H]cGMP (60,000â150,000 cpm/assay tube)) or cAMP (0â1500 Î¼m [3H]cAMP (60,000â150,000 cpm/assay tube)) as substrate and one of the PDE5 proteins in a total volume of 50â100 Î¼l. Incubation time was 10â20 min at 30 Â°C. Apparent Km and Vmax were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of data using Prism Graphpad software. In all studies, <10% of total [3H]cNMP was hydrolyzed. To determine IC50 for sildenafil, vardenafil, or IBMX, PDE catalytic activity was assayed in triplicate in the presence of a range of inhibitor concentrations (1â1,000,000,000 pm) with 0.5 Î¼m cGMP as substrate. Ki values were calculated using the equation Ki = IC50/1 + [S]/Km. Calculation of Free Energy of BindingâThe Gibbs free energy change, ÎG, which occurs by association of a ligand with PDE5, is related to the equilibrium association constant for the interaction and was calculated using Equation 1,ÎG=-RTlnK(Eq. 1) where K = Km or Ki calculated from IC50 values for the inhibitors as described above R is the ideal gas constant (equal to 1.98 Ã 10â3 kcal/degree/mol), and T is the temperature at which the assay was done (303 K). Values reported represent three measurements, each in triplicate. High-affinity interaction is indicated when ÎG is a large negative value. The contribution of a substituted amino acid side chain to the Gibbs free energy of binding in enzyme-transition state complexes was calculated from the biochemical potency (Km or Ki values calculated from the IC50 values for the inhibitors) using Equation 2,ÎÎG=ÎGWT-ÎGmut(Eq. 2) where ÎÎG is the change in free energy of binding in enzyme-transition state complexes attributable to the substituted group (18Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Andrews P.R. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 1648-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Enzymes in these studies were His-tagged constructs that had been expressed in Sf9 cells, purified, and characterized as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Structural integrity of each was verified by pattern of migration on SDS-PAGE and allosteric cGMP-binding properties (see supplemental material). Effect of Gln817 Substitution on PDE5 Catalytic FunctionâKinetic characteristics of catalytic function of purified PDE5 constructs were determined as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ (Fig. 2, Table 1). PDE5WT had a Km for cGMP of 2.9 Â± 0.8 Î¼m and a kcat of 2.2 Â± 0.4 sâ1.Gln817 was replaced by alanine (PDE5Q817A), which lacks the Oâ and Nâ groups that in the PDE5 crystal structure were shown to form a bidentate H-bond with 5â²-GMP, sildenafil, or vardenafil; these contacts were inferred to also occur with cGMP. PDE5Q817A catalytic site affinity for cGMP was decreased 60-fold (Km = 180 Â± 5.2 Î¼m) (Fig. 2A, Table 1), indicating that the Gln817 side chain is extremely important for high-affinity interaction with cGMP; kcat (3.8 Â± 0.2 sâ1) was slightly improved.TABLE 1Effect of PDE5 Q817A and Q775A mutations on affinity for cGMP and cAMP as substrateshPDE5A1 proteinscGMP KmcGMP KmcGMP KcatcGMP Kcat/KmcAMP KmcAMP KmcAMP KcatcAMP Kcat/KmcN selectivityÎ¼m-fold effects-1Ã106 mol-1 s-1Î¼m-fold effects-1Ã106 mol-1 s-1KmcAMP/KmcGMPWT2.9 Â± 0.812.2 Â± 0.40.758290 Â± 8.011.6 Â± 0.20.005100Q817A180 Â± 5.2603.8 Â± 0.20.021630 Â± 4223.0 Â± 0.30.0053.5Q775A60 Â± 3.3204.6 Â± 0.20.076247 Â± 1813.4 Â± 0.20.0144.1 Open table in a new tab PDE5WT hydrolyzes cAMP with â¼100-fold lower affinity (Km = 290 Â± 8.0 Î¼m) than for cGMP; kcat for cAMP hydrolysis was 1.6 Â± 0.2 sâ1. PDE5Q817A affinity for cAMP (Km = 630 Â± 42 Î¼m) was slightly weaker (â¼2-fold) than that of PDE5WT; kcat (3.0 Â± 0.3 sâ1) was slightly improved (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for hydrolysis of cGMP declined 36-fold in PDEQ817A (Table 1) but was unchanged for cAMP. The selective impact of removal of the Gln817 side chain on affinity and catalytic efficiency for cGMP versus cAMP as substrate was consistent with the importance of this contact with cGMP, which was inferred from the co-crystal of PDE5 and 5â²-GMP. The lack of a deleterious effect of the mutation on kcat suggested that the mutation did not introduce a globally deleterious effect on the catalytic site. Effect of Gln775 Substitution on PDE5 Catalytic FunctionâThe kcat (4.6 Â± 0.2 sâ1) for hydrolysis of cGMP and kcat (3.4 Â± 0.2) for hydrolysis of cAMP by PDE5Q775A were slightly improved compared with PDE5WT (Table 1). Km for cGMP was weakened 20-fold (60 Â± 3.3 Î¼m) compared with that for PDE5WT (Fig. 2A, Table 1), but Km for cAMP was essentially unchanged (Km = 247 Â± 18 Î¼m) (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of PDE5Q775A for cGMP was decreased 10-fold and improved â¼3-fold for cAMP. Selectivity for cGMP over cAMP declined from â¼100-fold in PDE5WT to â¼4-fold in both mutants, but this was due to the loss in affinity for cGMP. These results indicated that restriction of the orientation of the Gln817 side arm by Gln775 is a positive determinant for cGMP affinity in the PDE5 catalytic site, but removal of that restriction does not improve cAMP affinity. This brings into question the importance of the orientation of the side chain of the invariant glutamine in determining cN selectivity in other PDEs as well. In the crystal structure of the PDE9 C domain, a cGMP-specific PDE, the side chain of the invariant glutamine is not tethered to restrict orientation (10Huai Q. Wang H. Zhang W. Colman R.W. Robinson H. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In combination, the results provided herein refute the assertion that an H-bond constraint of the glutamine side chain in cGMP-specific PDEs provides for discrimination against cAMP. In addition, the 20-fold change in affinity of PDEQ775A for cGMP suggests that Gln775 may contribute to cGMP binding affinity by processes not mediated through Gln817. Effect of Gln817 Substitution on Affinity of PDE5 Catalytic Site for InhibitorsâX-ray co-crystal structures of PDE5 with vardenafil, sildenafil, or IBMX revealed that, like 5â²-GMP, all three inhibitors form contacts with the Gln817 side chain (12Sung B.J. Hwang K.Y. Jeon Y.H. Lee J.I. Heo Y.S. Kim J.H. Moon J. Yoon J.M. Hyun Y.L. Kim E. Eum S.J. Park S.Y. Lee J.O. Lee T.G. Ro S. Cho J.M.

To quantify the role of the Gln817 side chain for inhibitor potencies, IC50 values were determined as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Substrate concentration (0.5 Î¼m [3H]cGMP) was significantly lower than the Km for each construct, so that IC50 should approach Ki. Potency of inhibition of PDE5Q817A by vardenafil, sildenafil, or IBMX (IC50 values of 61, 141, or 214,000 nm, respectively) was substantially weaker than that for PDE5WT (IC50 values of 0.1, 2.9, and 3500 nm, respectively) (Fig. 3, Table 2). The dramatic difference in effect of the Q817A mutation on affinity for vardenafil (610-fold) versus cGMP (60-fold) or sildenafil (48-fold) indicated that despite purportedly similar interactions between Gln817 and these ligands, as indicated in the x-ray crystal structures, significant quantitative differences exist. The 13-fold disparity between the effect on potencies of vardenafil and sildenafil challenges the interpretation that the two inhibitors bind similarly at this position in PDE5. The relative selectivity for vardenafil over sildenafil in PDE5Q817A declined sharply from 29-fold in PDE5wt to 2.3-fold in PDE5Q817A (Table 2). This emphasizes the particular importance of Gln817 as a determinant of vardenafil potency and selectivity between vardenafil and sildenafil. The similar change in potency for sildenafil and IBMX (48- and 60-fold, respectively) was surprising and suggests that despite the difference in potency (â¼1200-fold) of these inhibitors and the H-bonding pattern (Fig. 1B), the relative importance of Gln817 for binding of each inhibitor is similar.TABLE 2Comparison of the effect of PDE5 Q817A mutation on potency of inhibition by vardenafil, sildenafil, or IBMXhPDE5A1IC50IC50 -fold effectIC50vardenafil/ IC50sildenafil selectivityVardenafilSildenafilIBMXVardenafilSildenafilIBMXnmnmÎ¼mnmnmÎ¼m-foldWild type0.1 Â± 0.022.9 Â± 0.43.5 Â± 0.311129Q817A61 Â± 3.1141 Â± 3.5214 Â± 4.361048602.3Q775A0.08 Â± 0.012.6 Â± 0.4ND0.80.9ND33 Open table in a new tab Effect of Gln775 Substitution on PDE5 Affinity for Sildenafil or VardenafilâThe potency of sildenafil or vardenafil inhibition of PDEQ775A catalytic activity, assessed as described under âExperimental Procedures,â did not differ significantly from that of PDE5WT (Table 2). Thus, freeing the putative rotation potential of the Gln817 side chain had little if any effect on the affinity for these inhibitors compared with a 20-fold effect on affinity for cGMP. Contribution of Gln817 to Free Energy of Binding of cGMP and PDE InhibitorsâThe interactions of cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, or IBMX with PDE5WT were quantified by calculating the Gibbs free energy of binding (ÎG) of 7.7, 13.8. 11.9, and 7.6 kcal molâ1, respectively, as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ (18Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Andrews P.R. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 1648-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and using the Km for cGMP or the Ki calculated from the respective IC50 values for the inhibitors. IC50 was determined under conditions in which IC50 should not differ substantially from the Ki. The change in free energy of binding (ÎÎG) of PDE5Q817A for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, or IBMX (2.5, 3.8, 2.4, and 2.5 kcal molâ1) was consistent with loss of one H-bond because an H-bond contribution to the binding energy of a ligand for its receptor is 2.5â4 kcal molâ1 (18Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Andrews P.R. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 1648-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). ÎÎG for loss in PDE5Q775A affinity for cGMP was 1.9 kcal molâ1. Concluding RemarksâMutation of invariant Gln817 causes a â¼60-fold decline in cGMP affinity but only a slight change in cAMP affinity; the decline in cGMP/cAMP selectivity from 100-fold to â¼4-fold is due almost entirely to loss in cGMP binding affinity. As indicated by ablation of the H-bond provided by Gln775 to immobilize the Gln817 side chain, rotational constraint of the Gln817 side chain is a positive determinant for cGMP binding affinity but does not affect cAMP affinity. Thus, contrary to accepted dogma, features in the PDE5 catalytic site other than Gln817 and the orientation of its side group restrict PDE5 affinity for cAMP. This challenges the interpretation that rotational constraint of the glutamine switch is a major determinant of PDE cN selectivity. Discrimination between the two cNs in the various PDE catalytic sites is likely to be mechanistically diverse and to result from subtle differences in the various sites. Evidence suggests that the invariant glutamine can in some instances provide a substantial portion of the affinity for interaction with cGMP or cAMP. However, cN selectivity of a site relies on multiple factors including access of the cN to the pocket and formation of multiple contacts within the site. In solution, cGMP and cAMP are in equilibrium between syn and anti conformers. It seems unlikely that conformational features of the cNs in solution influence PDE catalytic site selectivity, but different catalytic sites could impose conformational changes on the cNs, thereby influencing contacts that foster high affinity. The 20-fold decline in affinity for cGMP upon removal of Gln775 (PDE5Q775A) could suggest that Gln775 directly contacts cGMP or stabilizes other important interactions. A co-crystal structure of PDE5 with cGMP will be required to resolve these possibilities. Notably, there was no change in affinity for sildenafil or vardenafil in PDE5Q775A. although the side chain of Gln817 would be predicted to be in an unfavorable orientation for binding the inhibitors part of the time. This reveals further differences in the binding of cGMP and sildenafil or vardenafil. The contribution of Gln817 to PDE5 affinity for vardenafil is 10-fold greater than that for cGMP or sildenafil. This could be due to a substantially stronger bidentate H-bond between the Gln817 side chain and vardenafil than with the other ligands, but electronegativity of the pyrimidine N-1 does not differ significantly between vardenafil and sildenafil (data not shown). Alternatively, Gln817 could influence other contacts between vardenafil and PDE5 more than for other ligands. Gln817 is also critical for PDE5 selectivity for vardenafil over sildenafil. The results presented herein and in our previous report (20Zoraghi R. Francis S.H. Wood D. Bischoff E. Hutter J. Knorr A. Niedbala M. Enyedy I. Pomerantz K. Corbin J.D. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) emphasize that interpretation of the importance of contacts detected in x-ray co-crystal structures of PDE C domains and ligands is limited. The energetic contribution of each amino acid must be experimentally quantified in holoenzymes to more accurately assess the role of interactions and to provide direction for improved drug design. A comparison of differences in the effect of alanine substitution for Gln817 (60-fold) or Tyr612 (15-fold) (20Zoraghi R. Francis S.H. Wood D. Bischoff E. Hutter J. Knorr A. Niedbala M. Enyedy I. Pomerantz K. Corbin J.D. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) on cGMP affinity or potency of inhibition by vardenafil, sildenafil, and IBMX reveals that Gln817 plays a central role in binding each of these. The unexpected differences in the role of Gln817 in the potency of vardenafil, sildenafil, and IBMX may be due in part to the fact that current studies used PDE5 holoenzyme, whereas the crystal structures utilized isolated C domain in complex with ligands. More consideration must be given to the impact of the regulatory domain of PDEs on ligand interaction at the catalytic site because holoenzymes are the pharmacological targets (21Corbin J.D.

Immunol. 2004; 16: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).TAP is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily, which uses ATP to translocate a large variety of solutes across biological membranes (3Higgins C.F.

The minimal functional unit of an ABC transporter requires two transmembrane domains (TMDs), which align the peptide-binding site and translocation pathway as well as two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains, which energize substrate translocation across the membrane. In eukarya, these domains are organized either as a âfull transporterâ or as a homo- or heterodimeric âhalf-transporter.â The ER-resident TAP complex is a heterodimer of TAP1 (81 kDa) and TAP2 (76 kDa), each composed of one TMD and one nucleotide-binding domain (5Abele R. TampeÌ R. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6Beismann-Driemeyer S. TampeÌ R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Strikingly, both ABC transporters display an entirely different organization of the TMDs with regard to the arrangement and number of TMs. Due to the difficulties obtaining well diffracting crystals, in particular of mammalian membrane proteins, biochemical techniques still represent the major tool to investigate their structure. In this respect, TAP is a challenge, as it is a multicomponent complex containing unique, largely extended TMDs.Considerable progress has been made to determine the topology of membrane proteins, employing a variety of bioinformatics tools and experimental approaches, such as site-directed mutagenesis or reporter protein fusions. However, fusion of reporter molecules, such as Î²-lactamase, epitope tags, or glycosylation-targeting sequences, to truncated variants of ABC transporters often result in misintegrated and non-functional proteins. Moreover, because the length and hydrophobicity of TMs of ABC transporters are not well defined, prediction algorithms cause conflicting results. Taken together, the membrane topologies of ABC transporters, in particular TAP, are very difficult to predict and to approach experimentally.In this study, we determined the membrane topology of TAP1 by a minimally invasive approach. Guided by hydrophobicity algorithms in combination with sequence alignments of TAP from different species and other members of the ABC-B subfamily, we introduced single cysteines into putative loops between transmembrane segments and probed for their accessibility toward labeling with thiol-specific, membrane-impermeable fluorescein-5-maleimide (FM). Labeling was performed in semipermeabilized cells.

Abele R. TampeÌ R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. For radioactive transport assays, microsomes (100 Î¼g of total protein) were resuspended in 50 Î¼l of AP buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) in the presence and absence of ATP (3 mm). Preparation of microsomes was performed as described previously (16Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. TampeÌ R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The transport reaction (50 Î¼l) was started by adding 0.46 Î¼m radiolabeled peptide for 3 min at 32 Â°C and terminated with stop buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) on ice. After centrifugation, the microsomes were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) for 20 min on ice. N-core-glycosylated and thus transported peptides were recovered with concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 Â°C. After washing with lysis buffer, ConA-bound peptides were quantified by Î³-counting. A 200-fold molar excess of non-labeled RRYQKSTEL peptide or 20 Î¼m herpes viral inhibitor ICP47 was used for competition of the TAP-specific peptide translocation.To probe TAP function and membrane topology in parallel, insect cells (2.5 Ã 106) were semipermeabilized with 0.025% saponin (Sigma) for 1 min at 25 Â°C in 300 Î¼l of HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). After washing, the cells were resuspended in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of AP buffer containing ATP (10 mm). The transport reaction was initiated with the fluorescent peptide RRYQNSTC(Î¦)L (Î¦ indicates fluorescein coupled via a cysteine residue) at 0.46 Î¼m and stopped after 3 min at 32 Â°C as described above. After lysis and binding to ConA beads, the glycosylated peptides were eluted with methyl-Î±-d-mannopyranoside (200 mm) and quantified with a fluorescence plate reader (Î»ex/em = 485/520 nm; Polarstar Galaxy, BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). Background transport activity was measured in the presence of apyrase (1 unit).Thiol Accessibility AssayâSf9 insect cells (2 Ã 107) were harvested from shaking cultures 48 h after infection, washed once with HEPES buffer, and subsequently semipermeabilized with 0.025% saponin in HEPES buffer. Thiol-specific labeling of proteins was performed with 50 Î¼m FM (stock in dry N,N-dimethylformamide, Molecular Probes) for 5 min at 25 Â°C in a final volume of 120 Î¼l of HEPES buffer. The labeling reaction was stopped with Î²-mercaptoethanol (25 mm). After washing, the cells were solubilized on ice with 35 mm n-decyl-Î²-maltoside (DM, Glycon) in 120 Î¼l of solubilization buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, pH 7.4). For reference, the cells were permeabilized with 35 mm DM prior to labeling with FM. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The solubilized TAP complex was bound via the His10 tag of TAP1 to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), washed twice with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 15% glycerol, 3 mm DM, 20 mm histidine, pH 7.0), and eluted with histidine (100 mm) in washing buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%). FM labeling was monitored by in-gel fluorescence using the Lumi-Imager F1â¢ (Roche Applied Science). Following transfer onto nitrocellulose, immunoblotting was performed with TAP1-(mAb148.3) and TAP2-specific (mAb435.3) antibodies (16Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. TampeÌ R.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).RESULTSFunction of the Cysteine-less TAP ComplexâTo light up the membrane topology of human TAP, Cys-less TAP subunits were generated by de novo gene assembly (13Heintke S. Chen M. Ritz U. Lankat-Buttgereit B. Koch J. Abele R. Seliger B. TampeÌ R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We first studied whether the substitution of all 19 cysteines may affect transport function of the heterodimeric TAP complex. Cys-less tap1 and tap2 were combined in the baculovirus expression vector pFastBacDual to achieve expression of a Cys-less TAP heterodimer. Both subunits were expressed in insect cells as shown in Fig. 1A. Cys-less TAP1 and TAP2 display a slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility compared with wild-type subunits due to an additional C-terminal His10 tag and Strep tag for TAP1 and TAP2, respectively.We then examined peptide transport of the Cys-less TAP complex using isolated microsomes and the radiolabeled peptide RR(125I)YQNSTEL. N-core-glycosylated and thus translocated peptides were bound to ConA beads and quantified by Î³-counting. As shown in Fig. 1B, Cys-less and wild-type TAP have almost the same ATP-dependent transport activity. Peptide translocation is peptide- and TAP-specific, as the transport activity is reduced to the background in the presence of an excess of non-labeled peptide (RRYQKSTEL) or the viral inhibitor ICP47 from herpes simplex virus (18Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. SempeÌ P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. FruÌh K. TampeÌ R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate the formation of a functional heterodimeric complex of Cys-less TAP1 and Cys-less TAP2.Function of Single-cysteine TAP ComplexesâTo investigate the membrane topology of human TAP, we generated single-cysteine TAP1 constructs. Guided by sequence alignments as well as hydrophobicity algorithms of TAP from different species and related ABC transporters, 11 positions in loops between predicted transmembrane segments were chosen: S6C, A51C, A87C, S124C, S179C, S220C, F265C, S326C, T399C, S436C, and S488C. To ensure co-expression of TAP1 and TAP2 within every infected cell, each single-cysteine TAP1 variant was combined with Cys-less TAP2 in the pFastBacDual vector. Cells were harvested early after infection (48 h) to preserve the cell morphology and to exclude effects because of over-expression.To check whether the introduced single cysteines might interfere with TAP function, we analyzed the peptide translocation activity of all of the constructs in semipermeabilized cells with the fluorescent peptide RRYQNSTC(Î¦)L. Similar to the assay described previously, N-core-glycosylated and thus transported peptides were bound to ConA beads and quantified after specific elution with methyl-Î±-d-mannopyranoside. As summarized in Fig. 2, all single-cysteine TAP complexes showed specific and ATP-dependent peptide transport. For most constructs, the transport efficiencies were similar to Cys-less TAP. Notably, the constructs S179C and S326C displayed even a slightly higher transport activity (130%), whereas the construct F265C exhibited 30% activity, when compared with Cys-less TAP. The expression levels of TAP1 and TAP2 were the same for most of the 12 TAP variants, as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Taken together, all single-cysteine complexes are functional and therefore suitable to investigate the membrane topology of TAP.FIGURE 2Peptide transport of single-cysteine TAP mutants. ATP-dependent peptide transport of single-cysteine TAP1 mutants was analyzed in semipermeabilized insect cells. The assay was performed with fluorescein-labeled peptide (0.46 Î¼m, RRYQNSTC(Î¦)L) for 3 min at 32 Â°C in the presence and absence of Mg-ATP (10 mm). N-core-glycosylated and therefore transported peptides were bound to ConA-beads and quantified by fluorescence detection after elution with methyl-Î±-d-mannopyranoside. The relative transport efficiencies of the single-cysteine TAP constructs are plotted in comparison to that of Cys-less TAP. The error bars indicate the deviation of three independent experiments. Aliquots (2 Ã 105 cells) used for the peptide transport assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and subsequent immunoblotting with TAP1-(mAb148.3) and TAP2-specific (mAb435.3) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Membrane Topology Analyzed by Cysteine AccessibilityâTo establish a cysteine accessibility assay for an intracellular membrane protein complex, semipermeabilized cells were incubated with various concentrations of membrane-impermeable FM. After quenching of the reaction with Î²-mercaptoethanol, the cells were solubilized and the TAP complex was co-purified on Ni-NTA-agarose via the C-terminal His10 tag of TAP1 (Fig. 3, intact membranes, i.m.). As a control and reference, intracellular membranes were permeabilized (Fig. 3, per.) prior to labeling with FM. Fig. 3 summarizes the results obtained for in-gel fluorescence measurements and corresponding TAP1- and TAP2-specific immunoblots of the single-cysteine constructs S6C and S220C. Notably, the cysteine at position 6 (S6C) was already labeled at 5 Î¼m FM. The reaction is site-specific, because Cys-less TAP shows no labeling even with a large excess of FM (500 Î¼m, see also Fig. 5). The low concentration of FM sufficient for S6C labeling indicates that the N terminus is located in the cytosol. In contrast, the cysteine at position 220 displays a different reactivity. No specific labeling was detected with intact ER membranes at 5â50 Î¼m FM, whereas aliquots permeabilized prior to labeling reacted quantitatively with the thiol-specific compound at a concentration of 50 Î¼m. These results show that position 220 is located in the ER lumen. Notably, in the presence of a large excess of FM (250 Î¼m), labeling was also detected within intact membranes, suggesting that, under these conditions, FM can cross the membrane. Treatment of the constructs S6C and S220C with the membrane-impermeable maleimide compound stilbene disulfonate maleimide (AMS) prior to labeling with FM confirmed the localization of the introduced cysteines. Labeling of the cysteine S6C is impeded when pre-incubated with AMS, whereas the single-cysteine S220C is labeled at 250 Î¼m FM (data not shown).FIGURE 3FM labeling of single-cysteine TAP mutants. Insect cells expressing single-cysteine AP variants (S6C or S220C of TAP1) were semipermeabilized with 0.025% saponin for 1 min at 25 Â°C and washed two times with HEPES buffer. Labeling was performed at different concentrations of FM (0â500 Î¼m) for 5 min at 25 Â°C (intact membranes, i.m.). The labeling reaction was stopped with Î²-mercaptoethanol. As a reference, membranes were permeabilized (per., 50) with DM prior to labeling with 50 Î¼m FM. After labeling, the TAP complex was solubilized and purified via Ni-NTA-agarose. Aliquots were applied to SDS-PAGE (10%). FM labeling was monitored by in-gel fluorescence imaging. Co-purification of TAP1 and TAP2 was confirmed by immunoblotting with TAP1-(mAb148.3) and TAP2-specific (mAb435.3) antibodies, respectively. The relative accessibility of the single cysteines for FM labeling in intact membranes is plotted in dependence of the FM concentration.

B, labeling of single cysteines within the predicted N-terminal domain (S6C, A51C, A87C, S124C, and S179C). Cys-less TAP was used as a negative control in the labeling reaction. In addition to intact membranes (i.m.), membranes were permeabilized (per.) with DM prior to labeling. After labeling with FM (50 Î¼m) and purification of the TAP complex via Ni-NTA-agarose, aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%). FM labeling was monitored by in-gel fluorescence imaging.

In particular, the large C-terminal region from residue 344 to 488 is ill-defined and has been placed outside the TMD (19Gileadi U. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11103-11108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Vos J.C. Spee P. Momburg F. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6679-6685PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the membrane topology of this region, we examined the accessibility of three cysteines (T399C, S436C, and S488C) by the membrane-impermeable probe FM (Fig. 4). Semipermeabilized cells were labeled with 50 Î¼m FM for different periods of time (0.5â5 min). For reference, the membranes were permeabilized prior to labeling and treated identically. Cysteines at positions 399 and 488 are equally well accessible and therefore located in the cytosol. Strikingly, the cysteine at position 436 was not labeled in intact intracellular membranes at any time, whereas it could be easily labeled after membrane permeabilization. As a control, the corresponding immunoblot revealed similar expression levels of TAP1 and TAP2. These data clarify conflicting models regarding the structural organization of the TAP complex and demonstrate that residue 436 is sited in an ER-luminal loop and separated by two transmembrane segments from residues 399 and 488, which are located in cytosolic loops. Thus, TAP1 has an unusually large TMD that spans almost 490 residues.FIGURE 4Kinetics of FM labeling of single cysteines. Semipermeabilized cells were labeled with FM (50 Î¼m). The reaction was stopped with Î²-mercaptoethanol at different time points (0.5â5 min) (intact membranes, i.m.). For reference, membranes were permeabilized (per.) with DM prior to labeling. After labeling, the TAP complex was solubilized and purified via Ni-NTA-agarose. Aliquots were applied to SDS-PAGE (10%). FM labeling was monitored by in-gel fluorescence imaging. Co-purification of TAP1 and TAP2 was confirmed by immunoblotting with TAP1-(mAb148.3) and TAP2-specific (mAb435.3) antibodies, respectively. The relative accessibility of the single cysteines for FM labeling is plotted against the reaction time. Values for the accessibility of S488C (â¢), T399C (â), and S436C (â´) are depicted from the intensities in intact membranes measured by in-gel fluorescence imaging.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Membrane Topology of the Core Transmembrane DomainâMost recently, a translocation core TMD within TAP1 and TAP2 has been identified, which is sufficient for membrane targeting, heterodimer assembly, peptide binding, and translocation of the transport complex (7Koch J.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4413-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To investigate the membrane topology of this translocation core domain, we generated a set of single-cysteine mutants in the region of residues 179â488 (Fig. 5A). For F265C, T399C, and S488C, we detected equal labeling efficiencies with FM in intact membranes as well as permeabilized membranes. These results indicate that residues 265, 399, and 488 are positioned in the cytosol. No labeling was observed for cysteines introduced at positions 220, 326, or 436 in intact membranes, whereas strong labeling was observed after permeabilization of intracellular membranes. These data prove that residue 220, 326, and 436 are located in the ER lumen. Similar expression levels for all TAP constructs were confirmed by immunoblotting. No labeling was detected for Cys-less TAP (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that all reactions are site-specific.Membrane Topology of the N-terminal DomainâMembers of the TAP family harbor a unique, extra N-terminal domain, which is not found in P-glycoprotein or any other ABC transporter. This N-terminal domain (residues 1â175 of TAP1 and 1â140 of TAP2) is essential for tapasin binding and assembly of the macromolecular peptide-loading complex (7Koch J. Guntrum R. Heintke S.

To map the membrane topology of this N-terminal domain, we introduced single cysteines at position 6, 51, 87, 124, and 179 of TAP1 (Fig. 5B). Similar expression levels for all TAP constructs were confirmed by immunoblotting. For cysteines S6C and A87C, no difference in FM labeling between intact membranes and permeabilized membranes was observed, demonstrating that these residues are located in cytosolic loops. In contrast, construct S124C showed a clear labeling pattern accounting for its ER localization. Surprisingly, the introduced cysteines at positions 51 and 179 (predicted to be in the ER lumen and cytosol, respectively) were not accessible for labeling. For A51C, labeling was not possible under either condition, indicating that this cysteine, although sited in a predicted hydrophilic loop, is hidden within the assembled TAP complex. In the case of S179C, FM labeling was low and slightly weaker in intact membranes than in permeabilized membranes. However, specific cleavage of an epitope tag fused N-terminally to residue 167 of TAP1 (residues 167â748) by a cytoso"

In most cases it is assumed that the natural MHC class I ligand is the one that has the canonical anchor sites, the minimal length, and the optimal antigenicity when tested as synthetic peptide. N-terminal extensions of such potential epitopes have been used to study trimming by aminopeptidases purified from the ER or microsomal fractions. There are several reports which show that the two enzymes, mouse endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing (ERAAP)/human ERAP1 and human leukocyte-derived arginine aminopeptidase (L-RAP)/ERAP2, can indeed trim the precursors to yield the putative epitope in solution in the absence of the peptide-binding MHC class I molecule and that they usually stop at around 8â9-aa-long products and in front of an X-proline bond (12Fruci D.

These properties suffice to consider them bona fide trimming enzymes for antigen presentation. There is also an intriguing report showing that MHC class I molecules can direct this trimming (18Brouwenstijn N. Serwold T. Shastri N. Immunity. 2001; 15: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), implying that trimming might occur on the formed complex. We have previously studied the natural peptides endogenously processed in living cells from the HIV gp160 glycoprotein and presented by the murine MHC class I molecule Dd (19Samino Y. LoÌpez D.

Unexpectedly, the natural situation was more complex than having a single type of peptide-MHC class I complex, as we found evidence of a nested set of two or three equally abundant and equally antigenic peptides that differed in the N terminus. This suggested the existence of an intracellular pool of peptides derived from this natural protein in infected cells that are available for binding to MHC class I molecules. The shortest natural Dd ligand derived from gp160 is a 9-mer with the canonical anchor motifs for Ld (20Corr M. Boyd L.F. Frankel S.R. Kozlowski S. Padlan E.A. Margulies D.H. J. Exp.

The analysis of the natural Ld peptidic ligands resulting from the endogenous processing of the envelope glycoprotein shows the presence of at least three different MHC-peptide complexes in infected cells. Two peptides coincide with those described in Dd (19Samino Y. LoÌpez D. Guil S. de LeoÌn P. Del Val M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a 9-mer and a 10- or 11-mer. The third peptidic species corresponds to a 15-mer peptide with an N-terminal extension of 6 residues, which probably protrude out of the Ld binding groove. The 15-mer peptide binds to the presenting molecule Ld, is recognized by 9-mer-selected CTL with an antigenicity only slightly lower than the optimal 9-mer, and is more abundant in infected cells than this minimal epitope. The presence of N-terminal extensions in all these high affinity natural ligands in the face of an aminopeptidase activity at the site of complex formation suggests that trimming cannot proceed once the complexes are formed. This complex mixture of natural ligands for Ld parallels and expands the natural ligands of Dd from the same epitope, suggesting that antigen processing gives rise to a rich pool of possible ligands from which MHC class I molecules can choose. These results may have general implications for the rational design of vaccines. Mice, Cell Lines, and Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses (rVV)âBALB/c mice (H-2d haplotype) were bred in our animal facilities in accordance with national regulations. All cell lines were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 Ã 10â5 m Î²-mercaptoethanol. The P13.1 cell line is a derivative from mouse mastocytoma P815 cells (H-2d) by transfection with the lacZ gene encoding Î²-galactosidase (22Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp.

Transfectants with single and multiple mutations in the sequence of the Ld molecule were also used (25Hengel H. Burke K. Kyburz D. Zinkernagel R.M. Koszinowski U.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4557-4564PubMed Google Scholar). They were named with the residue number followed by the single-letter code for the new aa introduced. For stability assays, the TAP-deficient human lymphoblastoid T2 cells transfected with Ld were employed (26Crumpacker D.B. Alexander J. Cresswell P. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3004-3011PubMed Google Scholar). rVV-ENV (vSC25) encodes the envelope glycoprotein gp160 from the strain IIIB of HIV-1 under the control of the vaccinia early-late promoter 7.5k (27Chakrabarti S. Robert-Guroff M. Wong-Staal F. Gallo R.C. Moss B. Nature. 1986; 320: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Its DNA sequence was confirmed. The HIV glycoprotein can be detected by Western blot, but its intermediate to low level of expression precludes direct detection among the major proteins synthesized in the infected cell. The parental Western Reserve strain was used as control. Synthetic PeptidesâPeptides were synthesized in a peptide synthesizer (model 433A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purified when needed by cation exchange (IE) and/or reversed-phase (RP) HPLC. They were quantitated by A280 using peptide R10I as a standard, and the identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. All peptide sequences are derived from the sequence 313KIRIQRGPGRAFVTIGKIGN-MRQAH337, which forms part of the V3-loop antigenic area from HIV-1 strain IIIB envelope glycoprotein. They are named indicating the first aa, the length, and the last aa. Thus, G9I refers to the nonamer of sequence 319GPGRAFVTI327. The single-letter aa code is used throughout.

Open table in a new tab T Cell Lines and Cytotoxicity AssayâPolyclonal gp160-IIIB-monospecific CTL were generated by immunization of mice with rVV-ENV followed by weekly restimulation of splenocytes with G9I synthetic peptide and interleukin 2, as described (19Samino Y.

As targets, L/Dd and L/Ld cells were infected overnight with rVV as described (24Del Val M. Volkmer H. Rothbard J.B. Jonjic S. Messerle M. Schickedanz J. Reddehase M.J. Koszinowski U.H. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3965-3972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For peptide titrations, targets and peptides were incubated for 20 min, and CTLs were then added. Isolation of Naturally Processed PeptidesâL cells (3 Ã 109 in 30 roller bottles) were infected with rVV at a multiplicity of infection of 3.5 plaque-forming units/cell, and 16 h later naturally processed peptides were extracted from whole cells with trifluoroacetic acid, selected with a Macrosep centrifugal concentrator (Filtron) with a cut-off of 10 kDa, and purified by RP HPLC (19Samino Y.

Control extractions were performed identically, except that pellets of 109 P13.1 cells received 10 nmol of synthetic peptides immediately after the addition of trifluoroacetic acid. Pooled RP HPLC fractions that tested positive in cytotoxicity assays with P13.1 target cells and gp160-specific CTLs were newly chromatographed by IE HPLC chromatography in a Mono S column (19Samino Y. LoÌpez D. Guil S. de LeoÌn P. Del Val M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fractions from this second column and dilutions thereof were analyzed in new cytotoxicity assays. As the internal standard, a gp160-unrelated peptide was included in all HPLC runs. To ensure comparability of different runs, the actual conductivity gradient was always monitored. Contamination of the HPLC columns was excluded by testing preceding HPLC runs with CTL. Sometimes Dd-restricted CTLs were used in these assays (but not in any other experiment included in this report), because they showed an almost identical sensitivity to variations in peptide sequence as the Ld-restricted CTL (compare Table 1 and Ref. 19Samino Y. LoÌpez D. Guil S. de LeoÌn P. Del Val M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For standardization, serial dilutions of synthetic peptides were tested always in parallel. Mass SpectrometryâHPLC fractions containing peptides from the cellular extracts were sequenced by quadrupole ion trap electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in a Deca XP LCQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan ThermoQuest, San JoseÌ, CA) (19Samino Y. LoÌpez D. Guil S. de LeoÌn P. Del Val M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The charge and the mass of the ionic species were determined by high resolution sampling of the mass/charge rank. Collision energy and ion-precursor resolution were improved to optimize the fragmentation spectrum. Some synthetic peptides derived from gp160 were analyzed, and their detection limit was 1 fmol (G9I), 10 fmol (R10I and Q11I), and 50 fmol (K15I). MHC-Peptide Stability AssayâTAP-deficient T2 cells transfected with Ld were cultured at 26 Â°C, and 14 h later they were washed and incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C with 500 Î¼m concentrations of the different synthetic peptides, as described (19Samino Y. LoÌpez D. Guil S. de LeoÌn P. Del Val M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After washing (time point 0), the cells were further incubated at 37 Â°C. Aliquots removed at different time points were stained with monoclonal antibody 30-5-7S, which recognizes Ld bound to peptides (30Ozato K. Hansen T.H. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2473-2477PubMed Google Scholar), followed by flow cytometry. Cells incubated without peptide had peak fluorescence intensities close to background staining with second Ab alone. Fluorescence index was calculated at each time point as the ratio of peak channel fluorescence of the sample to that of the control incubated without peptide. TAP Transport AssayâA TAP translocation assay was performed as described (31Lauvau G. Kakimi K. Niedermann G. Ostankovitch M. Yotnda P. Firat H. Chisari F.V. van Endert P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using 5 Ã 106 murine A20 cells permeabilized with streptolysin O and the reporter peptide RYWANATRSF (R10F) that has an acceptor sequence for glycosylation once transported into the ER (32Momburg F. Roelse J. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Hammerling G.J. Neefjes J.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). R10F was labeled with 125I by using chloramine T (33van Endert P.M. Tampe R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and ENV synthetic peptides were used as competitors. Affinities of competitor peptides were expressed as 1/IC50. Differential Recognition Patterns of gp160-specific CTL LinesâIn BALB/c mice the CTL response against HIV-1 strain IIIB envelope glycoprotein is mainly restricted by the Dd class I molecule (34Takahashi H. Cohen J. Hosmalin A. Cease K.B. Houghten R. Cornette J.L. DeLisi C. Moss B. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). A minor Ld-restricted CTL population was previously described (21Bergmann C. Tong L. Cua R.V. Sensintaffar J.L. Stohlman S.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5603-5612PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize these responses gp160-specific CTL lines were generated that selectively recognized gp160 peptides presented either by Dd or by Ld (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). Additional experiments performed with three other Ld-positive cell lines confirmed the Ld-restricted recognition of the latter CTL line (data not shown). Endogenously synthesized gp160 was also presented to either CTL line in cells that were infected with a rVV that expresses the native glycoprotein, rVV-ENV (Fig. 1, C and D). Generation of similar long term Ld-restricted gp160-specific CTL lines by selection with the G9I peptide was achieved several times over a period of several years. In accordance with published experience, they were less easy to establish from BALB/c mice than Dd-restricted gp160-specific CTL lines. Titration curves with different synthetic peptides using L cells transfected with Dd or Ld were performed. The nonamer G9I, which contains the canonical anchor residues for binding to Ld, was compared with peptides with N-terminal extensions (R10I) and deletions (P8I and G7I). G9I and R10I were equally efficiently recognized, whereas P8I was 1000-fold less antigenic, and G7I was not recognized (Table 1). Comparable Presentation of gp160 Peptides by Mutants of the Ld MoleculeâL cells transfected with different mutants of the Ld allele were used to characterize the Ld-restricted response against gp160. The altered positions in each cellular line are detailed in its respective plot in Fig. 2 and include both single and multiple mutations located in the peptide binding groove. They were chosen to mimic the six changes that exist between Ld and Lq, its closest allele (25Hengel H. Burke K. Kyburz D. Zinkernagel R.M. Koszinowski U.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4557-4564PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cells that have the six positions altered actually express Lq. Titration curves of G9I and R10I synthetic peptides are shown in Fig. 2. The mutation in residue 116 was the one that singly affected most presentations by MHC class I and recognition by the T-cell receptor. Its negative effect was not compensated by any additional mutation, as all transfectants with additional mutations besides that at 116 were negative. Changes at positions 95 and 97, also located on the floor of the groove as residue 116, caused a milder 10â100-fold decrease in antigenicity. Residue 116 might be more critical because it contributes to pocket F that hosts the C terminus of the peptide (35Balendiran G.K. Solheim J.C. Young A.C.M. Hansen T.H. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6880-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and that has been found also to affect CTL recognition of other epitopes presented by Ld (25Hengel H. Burke K. Kyburz D. Zinkernagel R.M. Koszinowski U.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4557-4564PubMed Google Scholar). Recognition of rVV-ENV-infected transfectants with mutations at residues 116, 95, and 97 was clearly less efficiently than with the wild-type presenting molecule (data not shown), supporting the synthetic peptide data. The same pattern of recognition was observed in all cases for both R10I and G9I peptides (Fig. 2). None of the mutations in the presenting molecule differentially affected presentation of either one of these envelope synthetic peptides to specific CTL. The simplest model to account for this observation is that both peptides bind with a similar conformation to Ld, as all Ld mutations had the same effect on presentation of either peptide. Because G9I has the canonical length and P2 and P9 anchor residues to Ld, the data suggest that peptide R10I binds as G9I does and that the R residue in R10I extends N-terminally out of the MHC class I binding groove. Physiological Processing Generates at Least Three Different Ld-associated Peptidic SpeciesâTo identify the natural endogenously processed peptides of the gp160 glycoprotein that are associated with Ld, the peptides generated after infection of L/Ld cells with rVV-ENV were acid-extracted. The peptides were separated by RP HPLC, and the fractions collected were analyzed in a cytotoxicity assay, detecting a broad antigenic peak (data not shown). Whole cells rather than antibody-selected Ld cells were used for natural peptide extraction in order not to exclude potential precursor peptides. Because of this, it was interesting to test whether this antigenic activity was detected only when the Ld molecule was present. Consequently, extraction experiments were carried out using the Ld-negative parental Ltkâ cells using similar infected cell equivalents as tested previously with Ld-positive cells. No antigenic peaks were found in the RP HPLC runs from infected Ltkâ cells (data not shown) (19Samino Y. LoÌpez D. Guil S. de LeoÌn P. Del Val M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results indicate that peptides generated by endogenous processing of the envelope glycoprotein in infected L/Ld cells must be bound to the presenting Ld molecule and are, therefore, neither free from MHC nor bound also to the endogenous H-2k molecules of L cells. Even though the gradient used for elution of the natural peptides from the RP HPLC column was rather flat, several different overlapping synthetic peptides from the antigenic region encompassing gp160 residues 313â337 eluted within the antigenic peak (data not shown). This is probably because all these peptides have related, low hydrophobicity, as all of them are positively charged. To determine the peptidic species present in the antigenic peak obtained in the RP HPLC analysis of infected cells, the pool of positive fractions was further separated by IE HPLC. The fractions were again analyzed by cytotoxicity assays. Fig. 3 shows three different antigenic peaks generated as a result of the endogenous processing of the envelope glycoprotein in L/Ld cells. The first antigenic peak (fractions 21â23) coelutes with monocharged species. Quadrupole/ion trap mass spectrometry analysis showed that fractions 21â23 recognized by CTL unequivocal"

Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression of collagen types and specialized ECM components results in the formation of architecturally precise interacting networks with unique functional and biological characteristics. A diverse range of ECM components have been described including more than 20 distinct collagen subtypes and a large number of proteoglycans and noncollagenous proteins. Many of these matrix proteins are modular in structure in that they are composed of protein domains, which is important in generating the multifunctionality that is characteristic of ECM proteins (2Hohenester E. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these domains, found in a growing number of ECM proteins involved in supramolecular structures, is the A domain first described in von Willebrand factor (VWA domain). VWA domains are found in a diverse range of ECM proteins including collagens (types VI, VII, XII, XIV, XX, XXI, XXVII, and XXVIII), matrilins, cochlin, polydom, AMACO (VWA-like domains related to those in matrilins and collagens), and the extracellular portions of nine transmembrane Î±-integrin chains (4Whittaker C.A.

The WARP protein comprises a single N-terminal VWA domain containing a putative metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, two fibronectin type III repeats, and a unique C-terminal segment. Our studies demonstrated WARP expression by chondrocytes, and in transfected cells WARP is a secreted glycoprotein that can form multimeric structures (7Fitzgerald J. Ting S.T. Bateman J.F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We report here that in mouse cartilage WARP defines the presumptive articular cartilage prior to joint cavitation and subsequently during development is present in articular cartilage as well as in several fibrocartilage elements. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that WARP exists as disulfide-bonded multimers in cartilage tissue. Furthermore, we show that WARP can strongly interact with perlecan, providing a mechanism by which WARP is integrated into the extracellular matrix of cartilage. cDNA Constructs and Cell CultureâThe hexahistidine-tagged WARP constructs in the pCEP4 vector (7Fitzgerald J.

The wild-type and mutant His-WARP cDNAs were transfected into HEK 293-EBNA cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and grown as described (7Fitzgerald J. Ting S.T.

Following sonication, the soluble material was collected (fraction 1), and the insoluble material was treated overnight at 37 Â°C with 0.02 units of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) and 1 unit of hyaluronidase (Sigma) to cleave hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate GAG chains. Following washing the soluble material was collected (fraction 2), and the insoluble pellet was dissolved in 6 m GuHCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors for 5 h at 4 Â°C and then centrifuged at room temperature for 20 min. The supernatant was saved as soluble fraction 3, the matrix components were precipitated with 95% ethanol, and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. The samples were then freeze-dried and resuspended in 200 Î¼l of 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris base, and 2 mm tributyl phosphine (Bio-Rad). For some experiments the reducing agent tributyl phosphine was omitted. AntibodiesâPolyclonal antisera against the VWA domain and C-terminal domains of WARP were produced commercially in rabbits (Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia) using the GST-VWA domain (amino acids 21-212) and the maltose-binding protein-C-terminal domain (amino acids 389-415) fusion proteins expressed in bacteria as antigens. The antisera bound to the fusion proteins in a dose-dependent manner in a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (not shown). The anti-VWA domain WARP polyclonal antibody was further affinity-purified against the antigen immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane as described elsewhere (10Michalczyk A.A. Allen J. Blomeley R.C. Ackland M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and used in immunohistochemical staining experiments at a final concentration of 1 Î¼g/ml. Briefly, the GST-VWA domain fusion protein was transferred to nitrocellulose following SDS-PAGE. The band was visualized by staining with 0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid and cut out. The nitrocellulose strip was destained, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS, and incubated with the anti-VWA antiserum overnight at 4 Â°C. Following washing, bound antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The polyclonal anti-C-terminal antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:1000 in immunohistochemistry and immunoblots and 1:200 in solid phase assays. Serum from the same rabbit, taken prior to immunization with the WARP fusion protein, was used as a negative control. For immunogold electron microscopy experiments, a polyclonal antibody raised in sheep against full-length recombinant WARP (described under âRecombinant Proteins â) was used. An antibody to bovine matrilin-1 was kindly provided by Prof. Mats Paulsson (University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany) and was used at a dilution of 1:3000 for immunohistochemistry or 1:500 for immunoblotting. Affinity-purified antibody against mouse perlecan domain V (11Brown J.C. Sasaki T. Gohring W. Yamada Y. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was used at a final concentration of 2 Î¼g/ml in immunohistochemical experiments. A monoclonal antibody against perlecan (MAB 1948; Chemicon), was used in the immunogold experiments. WARP ImmunoblottingâFractions 1, 2, and 3 (20 Î¼g) were denatured by heating at 95 Â°C for 5 min, separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to Immobilonâ¢-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked in 5% milk powder in PBS for 1 h and then incubated in antibody buffer (0.5% milk powder in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) containing either WARP (1:1000 dilution) or matrilin-1 antisera for 1 h. Following three washes in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Dako) was added at a dilution of 1:10,000 in antibody buffer and incubated for 1 h. Following washing, the signal was developed with ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography using X-Omat film. WARP ImmunohistochemistryâEmbryonic mouse tissues were surgically removed and frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Circle Scientific). Tissues from post-natal mice were fixed in Histochoice (Amresco) overnight at 4 Â°C before decalcification in PBS with 7% (w/v) EDTA. 10-Î¼m sections were mounted and fixed in 95% ethanol, 5% acetic acid or in Histochoice (Amresco). To facilitate antibody penetration into the ECM, sections were treated with 0.2% hyaluronidase (bovine, type IV; Sigma) and treated with 0.3% H2O2 (v/v) in methanol to inactivate endogenous peroxidases. After blocking with 1% BSA (w/v) in PBS, the sections were immunolabeled with the rabbit antisera or preimmune serum and detected using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Bound antibodies were visualized using Sigma-Fast DAB tablets, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunogold electron microscopy, native suprastructural fragments were isolated from human articular cartilage and placed on grids. Samples were doubly immunostained with polyclonal sheep antisera against full-length WARP (or the VWA domain or C-terminal WARP, described above) and a monoclonal antibody against perlecan and colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibodies of different sizes and analyzed with transmission electron microscopy as described (12Kassner A. Hansen U. Miosge N. Reinhardt D.P. Aigner T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Grassel S. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridizationâ15-Î¼m cryosections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Nonspecific probe binding was blocked by carbethoxylation with 0.1% active diethyl pyrocarbonate in PBS twice for 15 min before prehybridization in buffer containing 50% formamide, 5Ã SSC, and 40 Î¼g/ml salmon sperm for 2 h at 58Â°C. Hybridization solution was prepared by adding a 1-kb digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe complementary to the 3â²-untranslated region of WARP, or the sense orientation negative control, to prehybridization solution at 400 ng/ml and denatured at 80 Â°C. The sections were hybridized at 58 Â°C overnight and washed with 2Ã SSC and 1Ã SSCfor 1 h at 65 Â°C. Immunodetection was performed as described elsewhere (13Braissant O. Wahli W. Biochemica. 1998; 1: 10-16Google Scholar). Recombinant ProteinsâRecombinant His-WARP was purified from the media of transfected 293-EBNA cells using nickel ion affinity chromatography as described for decorin (14Goldoni S. Owens R.T.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were expressed in 293-EBNA cells and purified as described. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Full-length perlecan was purified from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (20Paulsson M. Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Solid Phase Binding AssayâMultiwell plates (96 wells, Immulon 4; Dynatech) were coated with recombinant proteins (1 or 5 Î¼g/ml, 50 Î¼l/well) or heparin (1 Î¼g/ml) (Sigma) isolated from porcine intestinal mucosa in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay coating buffer (50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.2) overnight at room temperature. Following four wash buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) rinses, nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 1% BSA. Incubations with recombinant WARP (0-200 nm) were carried out in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. In some experiments 5 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA was included in WARP incubations and the subsequent washes. Incubation with the primary polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:200) against the soluble ligands was followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000; Dako). Color was developed with 2,2â²-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) in citrate buffer (0.1% (w/v) ABTS, 0.03% H2O2, 61 mm citrate, 77 mm Na2HPO4.2H2O pH 4.0), and color yields were determined at 405 nm using a microtitre plate reader (model 450; Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding to 1% BSA was subtracted from each absorbance reading. Surface Plasmon Resonance AnalysisâThe BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore AB) was used to characterize interactions between WARP and perlecan and WARP self-association. Purified recombinant proteins were immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip at 25 Â°C at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min. The sensor chip was activated with a 35-Î¼l mixture of 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 200 mm N-ethyl-Nâ²-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. WARP (30 Î¼g/ml) in 5 mm sodium malate, pH 6.0, or perlecan subdomain III-2 (30 Î¼g/ml) in sodium citrate, pH 3.35, were coupled. The remaining active groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5. A control surface containing no immobilized ligand was prepared by activation and blocking in the absence of ligand. The immobilization resulted in 3500-4200 resonance units for WARP and 3600 resonance units for perlecan subdomain III-2. Binding studies were performed in HEPES-buffered saline buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.005% P-20) at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l/min, and the binding sites of the immobilized ligands were regenerated using a 12-s pulse of either 30 or 50 mm NaOH at 50 Î¼l/min. WARP was immobilized (3900 response units) to the C1 biosensor surface in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The perlecan domain 1 binding studies were performed as described above except that WARP surface was regenerated using a 6s pulse of 10 mm NaOH and the experiment was carried out at a flow rate of 30 Î¼l/min. For the kinetic analyses, the flow rates were performed at 30 Î¼l/min. In one experiment WARP was coupled directly to the sensor chip (990 response units). Alternatively WARP (30 Î¼g/ml, 5-min injection) was bound to immobilized anti-His antibody (9000 response units). After subtraction of blank curves, the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants were determined simultaneously using global curve fits to the equation for 1:1 Langmuir binding in the BIAevaluation 3.2 software (BIAcore AB). Distinct Localization of WARP in Joint Cartilage during Developmentâ The spatial distribution of WARP in the developing mouse knee joint was assessed during development at E15.5 and E18.5 and later in the 2- and 6-week-old knee joint. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the polyclonal antibody raised to the WARP C-terminal domain, with the corresponding preimmune serum used as a negative control. The results were verified by immunostaining with the WARP anti-VWA domain antibody (data not shown). At E15.5, the joint cavity between the cartilage rudiments of the femur and tibia had not formed. The femur and tibia anlagen were separated by the joint interzone, consisting of two chondrogenous layers separated by an intermediate zone of mesenchymal cells, which will differentiate to form the articular surfaces and the joint cavity. At E15.5 WARP was present in the chondrogenous layers of the joint interzone of the femur and tibia (Fig. 1A) but was absent from the underlying epiphyseal cartilage and the noncartilaginous intermediate layer of the future joint space. In comparison, antibodies against another VWA domain superfamily member used as a marker for developing cartilaginous structures, matrilin-1, strongly labeled the cartilage anlage of the developing femur and tibia but not the joint interzone (Fig. 1B). In E18.5 mice, WARP protein was restricted to â¼6-10 cell layers extending from the articular surface (Fig. 1C). Matrilin-1 was absent from this developing articular zone but was abundant throughout the epiphyses of the femur and tibia (Fig. 1D). No staining was detected with the preimmune serum (not shown). To determine the site of WARP mRNA expression during early joint development, in situ hybridization was performed on frontal sections from an E14.5 mouse knee joint. Consistent with the distribution of WARP protein, WARP mRNA was expressed by cells of the two chondrogenous layers of the joint interzone separating the femur and patella but was absent from the mesenchymal intermediate layer of the interzone and from the epiphyseal cartilage (Fig. 1E). No signal was seen with the sense orientation negative control (Fig. 1F). In 2-week-old mice, after development of the secondary ossification center, WARP localized to the pericellular matrix primarily around superficial zone chondrocytes of the femoral and tibial articular cartilage (Fig. 1, H and J) and could also be detected in the superficial layers of the meniscus (Fig. 1H) and the patella (not shown). In 6-week-old articular cartilage, the distribution of WARP was clearly restricted to the pericellular matrix, with no detectable interterritorial matrix staining (Fig. 1, K and M). Pericellular WARP immunolabeling was also seen in the meniscus, the patella, and the intermediate as well as superficial zones of the femoral and tibial articular cartilage. No immunostaining was detected in sections probed with the preimmune serum (Fig. 1, I and L). WARP Also Localizes to the Permanent Cartilages of Spine and SternumâIn the spine, immunostaining for WARP was restricted to the articular surfaces of the ribs and vertebrae at the costo-vertebral joint and barely detectable in the rib costal cartilage and vertebral body (Fig. 2A). WARP also exhibited a pericellular staining pattern throughout the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc (Fig. 2B). In contrast, matrilin-1 antibodies strongly labeled the cartilage anlage of the developing vertebral bodies and ribs (Fig. 2, E and F) and was barely detectable in articular cartilage of the costo-vertebral joint and in the annulus fibrosus, in a distribution complementary to that of WARP. In the embryonic sternum, WARP exhibits a pericellular distribution in the fibrocartilaginous synarthrodial joint between each sternebrae (Fig. 2, C and D) and is absent from the anlage of the developing ribs and sternebrae. Strong matrilin-1 immunoreactivity was detected throughout the embryonic anlage of the ribs and sternebrae but was absent from the synarthrodial joint (Fig. 2, G and H). This distribution is complementary to that of WARP, a consistent observation from analysis of the developing joint and spine. WARP Forms Disulfide-bonded Multimers in CartilageâTo assess whether WARP forms multimeric structures in vivo, mouse cartilage preparations were serially extracted under progressively more denaturing conditions and the solubilized material in each extract subjected to immunoblot analysis using WARP antisera. Serial extraction of femorotibial joint cartilage, first with neutral salt buffer and then extraction of the insoluble material with hyaluronidase and chondroitinase ABC to degrade hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate GAG chains and release interacting proteins, did not extract WARP (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). However, extraction of the remaining insoluble material with the strong denaturant 6 m guanidine HCl solubilized WARP protein, which was detected as a band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels migrating at â¼50 kDa when resolved under reducing conditions (lane 3), consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the WARP monomer (7Fitzgerald J. Ting S.T. Bateman J.F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ECM âadaptorâ molecule, matrilin-1, was also present in the guanidine-soluble extract (lane 4), in agreement with published data (21Hauser N. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32247-32252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The finding that WARP is solubilized by 6 m guanidine HCl suggests that, as with matrilin-1, WARP is a strongly interacting component of the cartilage ECM. When resolved without reduction, WARP migrated as disulfide-bonded oligomeric forms greater than 200 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Immunoblot analysis on conditioned media from cells transfected with WARP cDNA confirms that WARP assumes several multimeric forms, including a dimer at 100 kDa, that are reducible to a 50-kDa monomer (Fig. 3B, lanes 2-4). These multimers were also formed by purified recombinant WARP, confirming that these structures are likely to be oligomers of WARP rather than WARP bound to other molecules (lanes 5 and 6). The ability of WARP to self-associate was assessed in BIAcore biosensor experiments where WARP coupled to the sensor chip surface was challenged with WARP in solution (Fig. 3C). Soluble WARP (120-720 nm) bound to immobilized WARP in a dose-dependent manner. Global or local curve fitting using BIA evaluation software (v3.2) failed to fit these binding curves using the Langmuir 1:1 model, suggesting that the WARP-WARP interactions reflect complex self-associations, consistent with WARP multimerization. To test whether one or both Cys residues are involved in multimer stabilization, the two C-terminal cysteines were mutated to serine residues separately and in tandem (Fig. 3D), and their effects on multimerization were assessed in transfected cells (Fig. 3E). Because the majority of WARP is present in the medium fraction rather than the cell fraction of all four transfected cell lines, the introduced mutations did not result in intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein. In cells expressing the wild-type chain, WARP migrated primarily as dimeric and higher order forms with several discrete bands greater than 250 kDa (lane 2) that were identified as WARP in immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 3B). The C1 and C2 single cysteine mutants both migrated as a monomer and a dimer with no higher molecular mass structures evident (lanes 3-6). As expected, disulfide-bonded dimers or multimers were not detected in the C1C2 double mutant, which migrated only as a monomer (lanes 7 and 8). These data suggest that both Cys residues can participate in disulfide bond formation and that both Cys residues are required to stabilize the higher molecular mass WARP oligomers. WARP Co-localizes with PerlecanâOur finding that WARP forms multimeric structures in the cartilage extracellular environment raises the possibility that, like other multimeric components such as matrilins, WARP interacts with different cartilage ECM molecules. Because it has been reported that perlecan, a large multidomain proteoglycan that is essential for skeletal development, is a component of the cartilage pericellular environment (22SundarRaj N.

We performed immunohistochemistry on mouse articular cartilage from 6-week-old mice and immunogold electron microscopy on human articular cartilage extract using antisera against WARP and monoclonal antibodies against perlecan (Fig. 4). In 6-week-old mice perlecan was present in articular cartilage and specifically localized to the chondrocyte pericellular region (Fig. 4, A and B) in a pattern that was strikingly similar to that of WARP (Figs. 1M and 4C). Immunogold electron microscopy was performed on extracts of human articular cartilage using an antibody against recombinant full-length WARP (18-nm particles) and a monoclonal anti-perlecan antibody (12-nm particles) (Fig. 4D). Both molecules were frequently found in close association within the amorphous extrafibrillar material, providing further evidence that WARP and perlecan co-localize in articular cartilage. The immunogold EM experiments were repeated using the VWA domain and C-terminal WARP antisera, and the same pattern of co-localization with perlecan was demonstrated (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2099617249,"Damaged axons do not regenerate after axotomy in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). This may be due to local inhibitory factors at the site of injury, such as overexpression of chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans (CSPG), and the presence of myelin-associated inhibitors (MAI). To overcome CSPG- or myelin-induced inhibition, strategies based on extrinsic and intrinsic treatments have been developed. For example, NEP1-40 is a synthetic peptide that promotes axonal regeneration by blocking Nogo-66/NgR interaction and chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), which degrades CS, thereby also promoting axon regrowth. Here, we examined whether the combination of these complementary strategies facilitates regeneration of the lesioned entorhino-hippocampal pathway (EHP) in slice cultures. In this model, overexpressed CSPG and MAI impaired axon regrowth, which mimics regeneration failure in vivo. Both CS cleavage with ChABC and NEP1-40 strongly facilitated the regrowth of entorhinal axons after axotomy, permitting the re-establishment of synaptic contacts with target cells. However, the combined treatment did not improve the regeneration induced by ChABC alone, and the delayed treatment of ChABC, but not NEP1-40, had a less pronounced effect on axonal regrowth compared with acute treatment. These results provide insight into the development of new assays and strategies to enhance axon regeneration in injured cortical connections."

Given the role that protein phosphatases play in the regulation of many biologically relevant processes, inhibitors against PTP-1B must be not only potent, but also selective.

Such an inhibitory mechanism may be applicable to other homologous enzymes. The quest for agents that can intervene in type 2 diabetes continues to be a major research focus and challenge in many laboratories. As impaired insulin action is an underlying mechanism in type 2 diabetes, the insulin signaling pathway has naturally been the focus of research in attempts to identify suitable therapeutic target(s) for drug intervention against the disease. Insulin signaling begins with the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) via tyrosine phosphorylation and culminates in the uptake of glucose into cells by the glucose transporter, Glut4 (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). The activated IR must then be deactivated and returned to a basal state, a process that is believed to involve protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B). 4The abbreviations used are: PTP-1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; TCPTP, T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase; FDP, fluorescein diphosphate; Rsmd, root-mean-square deviation; WT, wild type.

This phosphatase is therefore a very attractive therapeutic target for the treatment not only of type 2 diabetes but also of obesity. Predictably, there has been an intense research effort by many groups to identify potent and selective inhibitors of PTP-1B (for recent reviews, see Refs. 9Taylor S.D. Hill B. Exp. Opin. Investig.

Although it is not evident that co-inhibition of TCPTP (with PTP-1B) will result in serious adverse effects, mice lacking the TCPTP gene die within 3-5 weeks after birth from defects in hematopoiesis and immune function (18You-Ten K.E.

Hence, it is highly desirable to design PTP-1B inhibitors that are selective over TCPTP as potential therapeutic agents particularly as type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease. The only demonstrable structural determinant(s) of inhibitor selectivity between PTP-1B and TCPTP reported to date is located in the enzyme secondary binding site (16Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M.

Biol. 2004; 11: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) reported the discovery of a novel allosteric site that could be used for PTP-1B inhibition. Although the discovery of this site appears to be promising for the design of inhibitors with enhanced pharmacological properties, the issue of selectivity versus TCPTP remains partially unaddressed. The two enzymes share over 95% of sequence similarity in this area, and are structurally identical, although TCPTP lacks the phenylalanine at position 280 that appears to play a role in inhibitor binding. In order to further address the selectivity problem, we report here the identification of a previously unknown structural determinant between PTP-1B and TCPTP, and the biochemical and mutagenesis data that confirmed it. This new site may be exploited, alone or in conjunction with other selectivity determinants, to increase potency and elicit selectivity. Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and PurificationâA plasmid that expresses the isolated catalytic domain of human PTP-1B, pFlag2-hPTP-1B-(1-298), was used as template DNA for the mutagenesis. The Chameleonâ¢ double-stranded mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was employed for all site-directed mutagenesis by following the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides used for the site-directed mutagenesis were custom-synthesized by Invitrogen. Codons specifying the targeted amino acid changes were incorporated into the oligonucleotides as shown below (the codon changes that were introduced have been underlined): V113I, 5â²-GTCATGCTCAACAGAATAATGGAGAAAGGTTCG-3â²; M114V, 5â²-ATGCTCAACAGAGTGGTTGAGAAAGGTTCGTTA-3â²; V113I,M114V, 5â²-GTCATGCTCAACAGAATAGTTGAGAAAGGTTCGTTA-3â²; G117E, 5â²-AGAGTGATGGAGAAAGAATCGTTAAAATGCGCA-3â²; L119V, 5â²-ATGGAGAAAGGTTCGGTTAAATGCGCACAATAC 3â². For TCPTP, the mutations were introduced into pFlag2-hTCPTP-(1-296) that was used as template DNA. The oligonucleotides used for introduction of the mutation that codes for the V121L substitution were as follows: 5â²-GTGGAGAAAGAATCGCTGAAATGTGCACAGTAC-3â². The correct construction of the mutant derivatives was verified by DNA sequencing. DNA was subsequently isolated from the positive clones and introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for protein expression. Protein expression was assessed by growing E. coli BL21 cells to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm in Luria Bertani broth supplemented with 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin (LB-Amp)2. The culture was then induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested 3-h postinduction and the lysate analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10-20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradient gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE). The separated bacterially expressed proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody by chemiluminescence. The Super Signalâ¢ West Pico kit was used for the detection of proteins by following the suggested protocol. Activity AssaysâThe FLAG-tagged catalytic domains of WT and mutant PTP-1B and TCPTP proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as reported previously (15Asante-Appiah E. Ball K. Bateman K.

Kinetic constants were obtained by fitting the observed rates of reactions to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the aid of the non-linear curve fitting software program, Grafit 4.0.10 (Erithacus Software Inc.). Similarly, inhibitor concentrations that give 50% inhibition of enzyme activity (IC50) were derived by fitting rates obtained in the presence and absence of inhibitor to a four-parameter equation. Under the conditions of the assay, all progress curves remained linear. Synthesis of InhibitorsâThe synthesis of compounds was carried out as described previously (22Lau C.K. Bayly C.I.

Crystal Structure DeterminationâCrystals of the isolated catalytic domains of WT PTP-1B and L119V mutant in complex with compound 1 were obtained as previously reported (23Scapin G. Patel S.B.

The data sets were collected from a single crystal using synchrotron radiation at the beamline 17ID in the facilities of the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallographic Association Collaborative Access Team (IMCA-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). Crystals were dipped for about 10-30 s in cryoprotectant (15% MPD in mother liquor) before flash-freezing them in the liquid nitrogen stream. The data were integrated and scaled using X-gen (27Howard A.J. Crystallographic Computing 7: Proceedings from the Macromolecular Crystallographic Computing School 1996.in: Bourne P.E. Watenpaugh K.D.

Refinement of the model was carried out by alternating cycles of manual rebuilding of the model in O (29Jones A.T. Kjeldgaard M.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar); bulk solvent correction was applied throughout the entire refinement, and the refinement was performed using the cross-validated maximum likelihood approach (32Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 659-668Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar). NCS was applied at the initial stages of the refinement, and released toward the end. Typically, two cycles of torsion angle dynamics (33Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins: Struct. Funct.

Lead Compound IdentificationâOur initial screening campaign of thousands of compounds did not yield any inhibitors that were selective for PTP-1B over TCPTP. Similarly, efforts to identify differences between TCPTP and PTP-1B by enzyme kinetic analysis did not reveal any discernible differences between the two enzymes that could be exploited for inhibitor design to achieve selectivity (23Scapin G. Patel S.B. Becker J.W. Wang Q. Desponts C. Waddleton D. Skorey K. Cromlish W. Bayly C. Therien M. Gauthier J.Y. Li C.S. Lau C.K. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. Asante-Appiah E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11451-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a structural comparison of the three-dimensional crystal structures of both enzymes did not reveal obvious determinants of selectivity within the active site region. The structural comparison showed a high homology of 92% identity between the enzymes among the first shell residues (within 5 AÌ) of the inhibitor binding locus. Thus, we decided to re-assess our PTP-1B inhibitor data base to identify any compounds that showed a hint of selectivity between the two enzymes. Following a detailed and an in-depth re-evaluation of the data base, it became apparent that the presence of an ester group in a few inhibitors as exemplified by compound 1 in Fig. 1 resulted in a very modest selectivity over TCPTP. Re-evaluation of compound 1 showed a reproducible 2-fold selectivity between the enzymes. Subsequent structure-activity relationship studies revealed that the non-esterified derivative of the compound was not selective between the enzymes (compound 2, Fig. 1). Identification of Selectivity DeterminantsâUsing the crystal structure of PTP-1B in complex with other inhibitors as our guide (23Scapin G. Patel S.B. Becker J.W. Wang Q. Desponts C. Waddleton D. Skorey K. Cromlish W. Bayly C. Therien M. Gauthier J.Y. Li C.S. Lau C.K. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. Asante-Appiah E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11451-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the ester group would be likely positioned near the loop spanning residues 110-121 hereafter referred to as loop 110-121. We speculated that this disordered loop may serve as a potential source of selectivity, albeit at least â¼6.4 AÌ away from the nearest chemical moiety examined. To identify the residue(s) responsible for the selectivity we aligned the amino acid sequences of PTP-1B and TCPTP to determine substitutions in this loop region. Four substitutions were found at positions 113, 114, 117, and 119 (PTP-1B numbering adopted). Valine 113 in PTP-1B is substituted with isoleucine in TCPTP; methionine 114 is replaced with a valine; glycine 117 is changed to glutamic acid, and leucine 119 is a valine. The amino acid changes found in TCPTP were then introduced into PTP-1B by site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity and characterized kinetically. Because residues 113 and 114 are nearest neighbors and could exert a concerted effect the doubly substituted protein, V113I/M114V, was also constructed. The introduction of the amino acid substitutions did not appreciably alter the kinetic parameters of PTP-1B (Table 2). The Km for FDP remained unchanged for all the mutant proteins, whereas the kcat was within 2-fold of the value obtained for the wild-type protein. To ensure the structural integrity of the loop, we also examined the effect of the amino acid substitutions on the inhibitory potency of a nonselective compound, BzN-EJJ-amide, whose binding orientation on PTP-1B has been reported and does not involve loop 110-121 (39Asante-Appiah E. Patel S. Dufresne C. Roy P. Wang Q. Patel V. Friesen R.W. Ramachandran C. Becker J.W. Leblanc Y. Kennedy B.P. Scapin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). No significant differences were observed between the loop mutants and wild-type PTP-1B with respect to inhibitory potency of BzN-EJJ-amide (Table 3). Thus, we conclude that the amino acid changes in loop 110-121 do not significantly alter the overall conformation of the proteins. Next, we examined the effect of the amino acid substitutions on the potency of the modestly selective compound 1. As shown in Table 4, the mutant proteins maintained affinity for compound 1 with the exception of the L119V-substituted protein. The leucine to valine amino acid substitution at position 119 resulted in a 2-fold loss in potency of compound 1, equivalent to the selectivity that was observed over TCPTP.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of PTP-1B loop mutants determined with FDP as substratePTP-1BKmkcatkcat/KmÎ¼mminâ1mâ1 sâ1Wild type20 Â± 2112 Â± 89.3 Ã 104V113I20 Â± 2122 Â± 171.0 Ã 105M114V22 Â± 2154 Â± 141.2 Ã 105V113I, M114V20 Â± 259 Â± 104.1 Ã 104G117E29 Â± 796 Â± 365.5 Ã 104L119V19 Â± 283 Â± 67.1 Ã 104 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3IC50 values for BzN-EJJ-amide on PTP-1B wild type and loop mutantsIC50nmWild type8 Â± 3V113I14 Â± 3M114V13 Â± 3V113I, M114V7 Â± 3G117E11 Â± 2L119V12 Â± 4 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4IC50 values for compound 1 on loop mutantsCompound 1nmWild type39 Â± 10V113I39 Â± 8M114V45 Â± 8V113I, M114V29 Â± 3G117E32 Â± 8L119V142 Â± 41 Open table in a new tab Crystal Structures of PTP-1B WT and L119V in Complex with Compound 1âTo further understand the involvement of Leu119 in the ester-dependent selectivity and provide a structural basis for its effects, we determined the crystal structures of the isolated catalytic domains of WT-PTP-1B and of the L119V mutant in complex with compound 1. Table 1 summarizes the statistics for the refined complexes. In both cases the protein crystallized in space group P212121, with two molecules per AU. In the WT structure, the inhibitor binds with the phosphonate in the primary binding site, or P-loop (colored in red in Fig. 2A), where the catalytic cysteine (Cys215) is located. The benzotriazole moiety is located under the YRD loop (yellow in Fig. 2A), where it makes one hydrogen-bonding interaction with the main chain nitrogen of Asp48. The cinnamyl moiety binds toward the secondary binding site (as defined by Puius et al., Ref. 16Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar; blue in Fig. 2A), and the benzyl ester is located in the proximity of the loop spanning residues 110-121 (colored according to atom type in Fig. 2A). This loop, in most of the structures reported to date, was always held by interactions with symmetry-related molecules in an âopenâ and well ordered conformation. In the structure of BzN-EJJ-amide, the loop is not involved in interactions with other molecules, and appears to be very flexible (39Asante-Appiah E. Patel S. Dufresne C. Roy P. Wang Q. Patel V. Friesen R.W. Ramachandran C. Becker J.W. Leblanc Y. Kennedy B.P. Scapin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the structures of several other inhibitors similar to compound 1 but with just a phenyl ring in proximity of the loop (23Scapin G. Patel S.B. Becker J.W. Wang Q. Desponts C. Waddleton D. Skorey K. Cromlish W. Bayly C. Therien M. Gauthier J.Y. Li C.S. Lau C.K. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. Asante-Appiah E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11451-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it appears again to be disordered and/or to assume a different conformation from that observed in the 1PTY structure. However, none of these inhibitors show selectivity between PTP-1B and TCPTP as exemplified by compound 2 (see Fig. 1). In the compound 1 structure, the loop assumes two somewhat different conformations in the two molecules (Fig. 2B), but it appears in both cases to be in a âcloseâ conformation, with the side chain of Leu119 within van der Waals distance from the benzyl ester. The overall L119V mutant structure is extremely similar to the WT structure, and the inhibitor binds in the same fashion. The only difference is that in the mutant structure the loop 110-121 is highly disordered, and density for the residues 117-119 was not available (Fig. 3B). This further suggests that the presence of Leu119 is necessary for ordering of the loop.FIGURE 3Comparison of the position of the 110-121 loop in the WT PTP-1B: compound 1 and PTP-1B L119V: compound 1 complexes. A, stereo-view of the loop in the WT complex: the electron density (2 Fo - Fc map, contoured at 1.5 AÌ) is continuous and clearly indicates the presence of the loop atoms. B, stereo-view of the loop in the L119V complex: the electron density map is contoured as above. The loop as observed in the WT enzyme is shown in magenta for comparison. In this complex, the 114-122 loop is highly disordered, and electron density for residues 117-119 is not visible.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The V121L Mutant in TCPTPâCrystal structures suggested a structural mechanism for the role of Leu119 as a selectivity determinant between PTP-1B and TCPTP. To establish whether or not that residue alone was sufficient to elicit the ester-dependent selectivity between the two enzymes, we engineered the reciprocal Val to Leu substitution into TCPTP. As shown in Table 5 (left panel), substitution of Val at position 121 (equivalent to position 119 in PTP-1B) elicited selectivity between the derivative and the wild-type proteins. The modest 2-fold selectivity was retained between the two derivatives as was observed for PTP-1B indicating that the residue at position 119 (PTP-1B numbering) is necessary and sufficient to confer selectivity. Also shown in Table 5 (right panel) is compound 3, a PTP-1B inhibitor that takes advantage of the loop differences and is an order of magnitude more selective over TCPTP. Absence of the oxadiazole group from this inhibitor abolishes selectivity between the two phosphatases (data not shown). In this case, the oxadiazole moiety also serves as a metabolically more stable replacement for the methyl ester of compound 1. As expected, substitution of Leu119 to Val abolishes the selectivity observed with PTP-1B over TCPTP whereas the reciprocal V121L replacement engenders a similar effect in TCPTP. Thus, the single amino acid change from Leu to Val interconverts PTP-1B and TCPTP with respect to the ester and oxadiazole-dependent selectivity.TABLE 5Leu to Val substitutions between PTP-1B and TC-PTP influence inhibitor selectivity Open table in a new tab We have previously reported on structural determinants on PTP-1B that mediate selectivity over other PTPs with the exception of TCPTP (15Asante-Appiah E. Ball K. Bateman K. Skorey K. Friesen R. Desponts C. Payette P. Bayly C. Zamboni R. Scapin G. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26036-26043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By exploiting those determinants it was possible to synthesize inhibitors that were >30-fold selective over other PTPs and three orders of magnitude more selective over cdc25A, a dual-specificity phosphatase. Here, we have reported the identification of a selectivity determinant between PTP-1B and the structurally highly homologous TCPTP by exploiting a previously unknown characteristic of PTP-1B inhibitors, the ability to induce an ordered conformation out of the otherwise unstructured loop 110-121. Our data suggest that the size of the inhibitor substituent near the loop influences the position of the loop itself. The side chain of Leu119 clearly interacts with the bound inhibitor, providing some degree of binding energy (compound 2, the compound 1 analog without the ester has an IC50 of 109 nm, versus the 39 nm of compound 1, Fig. 1). The favorable interaction may be explained by the fact that, although the entropic factor is unfavorable during loop stabilization, there is a gain in energy obtained by removing the mostly hydrophobic loop from the solvent and locking it into a more hydrophobic environment. Substitution of Leu with Val (as in the TCPTP sequence), probably has the effect of reducing the extent of interactions between the loop and the inhibitor, with consequent loss of binding affinity, and concomitant increase in the inhibitor's IC50. Comparison of the two structures (WT and L119V mutant) clearly indicate that a smaller side chain in position 119 is not able to exploit the same function as the Leu thus suggesting that Leu119 is indeed the selectivity determinant (at least in this class of compounds) between PTP-1B and TCPTP. To confirm this, we engineered the reciprocal Val to Leu substitution into TCPTP. The prediction was that the reciprocal substitution should induce a similar 2-fold selectivity between wild-type TCPTP and its (V121L) derivative if that residue alone suffices to elicit selectivity and it did (Table 5). In this report, we also demonstrated the ability to exploit the structural determinant to design a more selective PTP-1B inhibitor over TCPTP. Because of the obvious potential of this discovery, we have also looked closely at this region in all PTPs in the data base (data not shown). Of all the tyrosine-specific PTPs, PTP-1B is the only enzyme that carries Leu at position 119. Hence, it seems possible that even if other PTPs fold similarly to PTP1B, this region may still be exploited for selectivity. We hope our work will provide the framework for the design and synthesis of even more potent and selective PTP-1B inhibitors. As the structured loop 110-121 is positioned fairly close to the active site of PTP-1B, targeting Leu119 should facilitate the design and synthesis of selective inhibitors that are less bulky compared with inhibitors designed to target the secondary phosphotyrosine binding site denoted by Phe52 (PTP-1B numbering). Such inhibitors will have a better chance of achieving oral bioavailability, another important issue associated with the design and synthesis of PTP-1B inhibitors as therapeutic agents. The identification of Leu119 as a determinant of inhibitor selectivity was not possible from a strict structural comparison of the crystal structures of PTP1B and TCPTP alone (11Iversen L.F.

We propose âconformation-assisted inhibitionâ to describe such instances where the targeted structural feature is not readily identifiable from the crystal structure as it may not be properly induced and/or spatially aligned appropriately upon substrate (or analog) binding to influence inhibitor design. Our study is a testament to the remarkable power of combining protein engineering, medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystallography to structure-function relationships. We anticipate that conformation-assisted inhibition may be applicable to other structurally highly homologous proteins under similar circumstances.

LRP-1 also is implicated in integrin maturation. In this study, we applied a proteomics strategy to identify novel proteins involved in ECM modeling that are regulated by LRP-1. We show that LRP-1 deficiency in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is associated with increased levels of type III collagen and pigment epithelium-derived factor, which accumulate in the substratum surrounding cells. The collagen receptor, uPAR-AP/Endo-180, is also increased in LRP-1-deficient MEFs. Human LRP-1 reversed the changes in protein expression associated with LRP-1 deficiency; however, the endocytic activity of LRP-1 was not involved. Instead, regulation occurred at the mRNA level. Inhibition of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) blocked type III collagen expression in LRP-1-deficient MEFs, suggesting regulation of JNK activity as a mechanism by which LRP-1 controls mRNA expression.

Because LRP-1 binds diverse ligands and undergoes constitutive endocytosis and recycling, one major function of this receptor is to deliver extracellular proteins to lysosomes for degradation (1Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Some LRP-1 ligands are multiprotein complexes that include other transmembrane receptors (2Gonias S.L.

Metab. 2002; 13: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As a result, LRP-1 regulates the protein composition of the plasma membrane. LRP-1 also regulates cell signaling, either by directly binding proteins such as Shc and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein (JIP) or by modifying the activity of other signaling receptors such as uPAR (4Gotthardt M.

It is now clear that LRP-1 is a member of a gene family that includes the low density lipoprotein receptor and other receptors that have partially overlapping or, in some cases, opposing activities (3Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. Argraves W.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In the mouse, LRP-1 gene knock-out is embryonic lethal (6Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditional inactivation of the LRP-1 gene in vascular smooth muscle cells leads to abnormal proliferation and aneurysm formation (7Boucher P. Gotthardt M. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Herz J. Science. 2003; 300: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of LRP-1 includes two NPÃY motifs, which may be involved in binding signaling adaptor proteins (4Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, and threonine in the LRP-1 light chain may regulate its function in cell signaling and its effects on various cellular activities, including cell migration and growth (11Li Y.

We have demonstrated that LRP-1 expression is associated with increased platelet-derived growth factor Î²-receptor mRNA expression in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in vitro (14Wu L. Arandjelovic S. Gonias S.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, LRP-1 may regulate levels of other cellular proteins by diverse mechanisms, in addition to facilitating catabolism. We are interested in mechanisms by which cells regulate the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This process is important not only in development but also in wound healing, ischemic injury, and cancer (15Green K.A. Lund L.R. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Kalluri R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Functioning as a catabolic receptor, LRP-1 regulates levels of thrombospondin and fibronectin in pericellular spaces (17Godyna S. Liau G. Popa I. Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J.

By a yet unclear mechanism, LRP-1 regulates maturation of Î²1 integrin and thereby alters the amount of integrin available for cell adhesion and ECM modeling (19Salicioni A.M. Gaultier A. Brownlee C. Cheezum M.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10005-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by binding and promoting the endocytosis of complexes of proteinases with Î±2-macroglobulin and members of the Serpin family, LRP-1 clears proteinases that otherwise target ECM proteins (1Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 3Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. Argraves W.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To identify novel mechanisms by which LRP-1 may be involved in tissue modeling, our laboratory has undertaken a discovery-based proteomics approach. Our experimental system compares LRP-1-deficient MEF-2 cells with LRP-1-positive PEA-10 cells, which were cloned from the same preparation (6Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that identified differences are due to LRP-1, we also examine B-41 cells (18Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which are MEF-2 cells rescued by expression of full-length human LRP-1. In this paper, we report on three proteins with known activities related to tissue formation and remodeling that are regulated by LRP-1. In each case, regulation does not involve LRP-1 endocytic activity but instead reflects the ability of LRP-1 to regulate mRNA expression/stability, probably downstream of LRP-1-dependent cell-signaling pathways. The newly identified targets include: 1) type III collagen, a fibrillar collagen and the second most abundant collagen in the body, linked intimately to blood vessel structure (20Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Krane S. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar); 2) pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a collagen-associated member of the Serpin family that lacks proteinase inhibitory activity but functions as a potent anti-angiogenesis factor (21Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar); and 3) uPAR-AP/Endo-180, a member of the macrophage mannose receptor family that serves as a catabolic receptor for multiple collagens (22Engelholm L.H.

Antibodies specific for PEDF and for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Phosphorylated JNK-specific antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). uPAR-AP/Endo-180-specific antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Niels Behrendt (Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen). Receptor-associated protein was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-RAP) in bacteria, as described previously (23Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-RAP functions as an antagonist of LRP-1 ligand binding activity (24Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol.

Alexa 598-conjugated antibodies and Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin were from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA). Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was purchased from Pierce. Streptavidin-Sepharose, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and supplies for two-dimensional PAGE were from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Prolifix S6 cell culture supplement was from Biomedia (Lyon, France). LY294002, anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one 1,9-pyrazoloanthrone (JNK inhibitor), PD98059, and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) were purchased from EMD Biosciences (Darmstadt, Germany). qPCR reagents, including primers and probes for PEDF, type III collagen, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and uPAR-AP/Endo-180 were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Cell CultureâMEFs that are genetically deficient in LRP-1 (MEF-2) and LRP-1+/- MEFs (PEA-10) were obtained from the ATCC. PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells were cloned from the same MEF culture, heterozygous for LRP-1 gene disruption, after selection with Pseudomonas exotoxin A (6Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B-41 cells are MEF-2 cells that were transfected for stable expression of full-length human LRP-1 (18Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S.

Webb D.J. Moravec R. Salicioni A.M. Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). For some experiments, MEFs were cultured in complete medium supplemented with 250 nm GST-RAP or with an equivalent concentration of GST (negative control) for 3 days. The medium, including GST-RAP or GST, was replaced daily. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were grown in DMEM-low glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and non-essentials amino acids. Preparation of Conditioned Medium for Two-dimensional PAGEâ PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells were cultured in complete medium for 18 h. The cells were washed three times with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), and cultured for another 24 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10% Prolifix S6. Conditioned medium was recovered and subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 200 Ã g to remove non-adherent cells. The media samples were then supplemented with complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and 2.5 mm EDTA and concentrated using Centricons with 10-kDa molecular mass retention filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Final samples were dialyzed for 24 h against 0.25 mm NaPO4, 7 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm KCl, pH 7.5, at 4 Â°C. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). The amount of sample to be analyzed was standardized based on an equivalent number of cells, as opposed to an equivalent amount of protein, in recognition of the possibility that released proteins may accumulate at a different rate in conditioned medium from the different cell lines. Protein in media samples was precipitated with 4 volumes of cold acetone. After centrifugation, protein pellets were resuspended in two-dimensional PAGE first dimension buffer (4% CHAPS, 2 m thiourea, 7 m urea, and 0.5% immobilized pH gradient buffer, pH 4-7). Two-dimensional PAGEâSamples were loaded on 18-cm immobilized pH gradient strips, pH 4-7, and subjected to isoelectric focusing using an IPGPhor system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the second dimension, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide (Protean XL, Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized by silver staining, as described by Vorum et al. (27Vorum H. Hager H. Christensen B.M. Nielsen S. Honore B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Gels were imaged using a flat-bed scanner (Epson) and analyzed using PDQuest software (Bio-Rad). Spots with at least a three times increase in quantity in LRP-1-deficient cells were targeted for micro-sequencing. Mass SpectrometryâGel pieces containing spots of interest were transferred to siliconized tubes and washed in 50% methanol overnight. The gel pieces were dehydrated in acetonitrile and then rehydrated for treatment with reductant (10 mm dithiothreitol), followed by 50 mm iodoacetamide, and finally, trypsinization (20 ng/Î¼l) for 12 h at 37 Â°C. Extracted peptides were evaporated to 25 Î¼l for mass spectrometry analysis. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system consisted of a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer with a Protana nanospray ion source interfaced to a self-packed 8 cm Ã 75 Î¼m inner diameter Phenomenex Jupiter 10 Î¼m C18 reversed-phase capillary column. Peptides were eluted from the column in an acetonitrile, 0.1 m acetic acid gradient and injected directly into the mass spectrometry. The nanospray ion source was operated at 2.8 kV. Peptide sequences were analyzed using the Sequest search algorithm. Peptides that were not identified by this algorithm were interpreted manually by searching expressed sequence tag data bases. RT-PCR and qPCRâTotal RNA was extracted from confluent MEF cultures that were maintained for 24 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 10% Prolifix S6, using the RNAeasy kit, as directed by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and specific primers for PEDF, type I collagen, type III collagen, and Î²-actin. The amplification program consisted of 30 cycles. qPCR was performed using a System 7300 instrument (Applied Biosystems) and a one-step program: 95 Â°C, 10 min; 95 Â°C, 30 s, 60 Â°C, 1 min for 40 cycles. Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene expression was measured as a normalizer for each sample. Results were analyzed by the relative quantity (ÎÎCt) method, as described previously (28Thellin O. Zorzi W. Lakaye B. De Borman B. Coumans B. Hennen G. Grisar T. Igout A. Heinen E. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 75: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate with internal duplicate determinations. Surface-Protein Labeling and Affinity PrecipitationâCell-surface proteins were biotinylated using the membrane-impermeable reagent, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (1 mg/ml), as described previously (29Gaultier A. Cousin H. Darribere T. Alfandari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23336-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were washed with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Cells extracts were prepared in 1% Triton X-100, 0.125% Tween 20, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and complete proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C for 15 min. Equal amounts of cellular protein were incubated with streptavidin-agarose for 4 h at room temperature, and in some cases, the unbound fraction was then incubated with concanavalin A-Sepharose overnight at 4 Â°C. Streptavidin beads and concanavalin A beads were washed two times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), 1.0% Triton X-100 and again with TBS. Proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for analysis. SDS-PAGE and ImmunoblottingâUnless otherwise specified, cells were extracted in 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.125% Tween 20, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of cellular protein were subjected to one- or two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, using the Laemmli buffer system (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar), and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized using 0.2% Ponceau Red in 3% trichloroacetic acid prior to immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Purified primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were diluted in the same buffer. Detection was performed using Immunstar-horse-radish peroxidase chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad) and Kodak Biomax films. ImmunofluorescenceâPEA-10 and MEF-2 cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine or type I collagen (100 Î¼g/ml), maintained for 72 h in serum free medium supplemented with 10% Prolifix S6, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 1% BSA and primary antibody. The cells were then washed. Secondary anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa 598 (10 Î¼g/ml) and phalloidin-coupled to Alexa 488 (1 unit/ml) were added to the cells after dilution in PBS, 1% BSA. Cells were imaged with a Leica DMRE inverted microscope. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of PEDFâSpecific primers corresponding to the 5â² and 3â² ends of the mouse PEDF open reading frame were designed for cloning PEDF into pCDNA3.1His-myc (Invitrogen). The primers included HindIII and KpnI restriction sites. PCR was performed with total cDNA obtained from MEF-2 cells, and the resulting amplicon was cloned into the vector. The sequence of the construct was verified. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the expression construct using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's instructions. After 3 weeks of selection with G418 (0.5 mg/ml), PEDF-expressing cells were single cell-cloned. PEDF protein was purified by affinity chromatography, using the His tag in the construct (29Gaultier A. Cousin H. Darribere T. Alfandari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23336-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PEDF Ligand BlotâPurified PEDF (50 Î¼g) was labeled with Na125I using IODO-BEADs (Pierce), according to manufacturer's instructions. BSA, fibronectin, type I collagen, and type III collagen (5 Î¼g) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dry milk and then incubated with 5 nm 125I-PEDF in the same buffer for 12 h at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed extensively with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and imaged using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). RAP ActivityâTo confirm that GST-RAP is active, we studied inhibition of binding of activated Î±2M to LRP-1, as described previously (31Arandjelovic S. Hall B.D. Gonias S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified activated Î±2M was labeled with Na125I using IODO-BEADs and incubated with confluent cultures of PEA-10 or MEF-2 cells for 4 h at 4 Â°C. The concentration of 125I-labeled Î±2M was 1 nm. Unlabeled Î±2M (0.2 Î¼m) or 0.25 Î¼m GST-RAP was added to some wells. After washing the cultures, cell-associated radioactivity was recovered and determined in a Î³ counter. Cellular protein was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay. Specific binding was determined as the fraction of total binding inhibited by unlabeled Î±2M. Type III Collagen InternalizationâType III collagen was labeled with Na125I using IODO-BEADs. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured until confluent. To begin an experiment, the cells were washed once and then incubated for 1 h in binding buffer, which consisted of DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mg/ml BSA, and insulin-transferrin-selenium complement (Invitrogen). The medium was replaced by fresh binding buffer containing 5 nm 125I-labeled type III collagen. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 3 h at 37Â°C. In some wells, GST-RAP (0.5 Î¼m) was added. To determine cellular uptake, the cultures were washed twice with cold binding buffer and then treated for 15 min with 0.25% Pronase in DMEM at 4 Â°C. The detached cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 Ã rpm for 3 min. Radioactivity associated with the cell pellet was measured in a Î³ counter. Cell-signaling Pathways That Regulate Type III Collagen ExpressionâConfluent cultures of PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells were treated with JNK inhibitor (10 Î¼m), LY294002 (10 Î¼m), PD98059 (40 Î¼m), DAPT (10 Î¼m), or vehicle (Me2SO) for 18 h. mRNA was recovered and qPCR analyses were performed. In separate experiments, MEF-2 and PEA-10 cells were cultured for 18 h in JNK inhibitor or Me2SO. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis for phosphorylated JNK, type III collagen, and total ERK. Proteomics Analysis of Conditioned Medium from LRP-1-deficient and LRP-1-expressing MEFsâTo identify novel proteins that may accumulate differently in the cellular microenvironment depending on whether LRP-1 is expressed, we analyzed conditioned medium from PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells by two-dimensional PAGE. Differences in silver staining intensity were assessed by PDQuest software. Representative gels are shown in Fig. 1. The insets show two spots that were consistently (n = 4) and substantially increased in LRP-1-deficient MEF-2 cells. These proteins were subjected to microsequence analysis. For the spot migrating with an apparent mass of 52 kDa, 23 peptides were identified, all corresponding in sequence to PEDF. The identified peptides covered 31% of the sequence of PEDF. The apparent mass of PEDF in our two-dimensional PAGE system was consistent with the reported mass of PEDF monomer (32Steele F.R. Chader G.J. Johnson L.V. Tombran-Tink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The second spot migrated with an apparent mass of 60 kDa. Fifteen peptides isolated by proteolysis of the spot corresponded exactly in sequence to type III collagen. The 15 peptides included 11% of the protein length and were all restricted to the C-terminal portion of the type III collagen subunit. The absolute C terminus of type III collagen includes the 25-kDa propeptide, which is released by proteolysis after formation of the triple helix (33Gerstenfeld L. Beldekas J.C. Sonenshein G.E. Franzblau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9158-9162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 60-kDa fragment has been reported previously to be released from the C terminus by mammalian collagenases (33Gerstenfeld L. Beldekas J.C. Sonenshein G.E. Franzblau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9158-9162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step to validate our results, the conditioned medium samples shown in Fig. 1 were subjected to two-dimensional PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The immunoblot for type III collagen is shown in Fig. 2A. Only the section of the blot with immunoreactivity is shown. In MEF-2 cell conditioned medium, a broad band of immunoreactivity is observed, probably reflecting heterogeneity in glycosylation and thus differential migration in the isoelectric focusing first dimension. By contrast, almost no immunoreactivity was detected in PEA-10 cell-conditioned medium. The apparent mass of the immunoreactive region in the MEF-2 cell blot is most consistent with the known mass of the N-terminal region of type III collagen monomer after collagenase processing (33Gerstenfeld L. Beldekas J.C. Sonenshein G.E. Franzblau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9158-9162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of larger monomer fragments in the two-dimensional PAGE system probably reflects the specimen processing procedure (see Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 2B, the immunoblot for PEDF showed a pattern that was very similar to that observed by silver staining.FIGURE 4Regulation of type III collagen expression by LRP-1. A, equal amounts of cellular protein from detergent-soluble extracts of PEA-10, MEF-2, and B-41 cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis for type III collagen (Cell). Conditioned medium from the same cultures was also analyzed (Conditioned medium). B, PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine for 72 h in serum-free medium. After fixation, the cells were immunostained for type III collagen (red) and actin (green). Note the red-staining fibrils associated with the substratum selectively in the MEF-2 cell preparations. C, total RNA was isolated from PEA-10, MEF-2, and B-41 cells and analyzed by RT-PCR (left) and qPCR (right) using specific primers for type I collagen, type III collagen, and Î²-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PEDF Is Increased at the Protein and mRNA Levels in LRP-1-deficient MEFsâTo further explore the relationship between LRP-1 and PEDF, we compared cell extracts of PEA-10 and MEF-2 cells with extracts of B-41 cells, which are MEF-2 cells that express full-length human LRP-1. The level of human LRP-1 in B-41 cells is similar to the level of murine LRP-1 in PEA-10 cells (18Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Opi1p repressor activity is most active in inositol-supplemented cells. Regulation of Opi1p repressor activity is mediated by multiple phosphorylations catalyzed by protein kinases A and C. In this work, we showed that Opi1p was also phosphorylated by casein kinase II. Using purified maltose-binding protein-Opi1p as a substrate, casein kinase II activity was doseand time-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of maltosebinding protein-Opi1p (Km = 25 Î¼g/ml) and ATP (Km = 7 Î¼m). Of three mutations (S10A, S38A, and S239A) in putative phosphorylation sites, 10 only the S10A mutation affected Opi1p phosphorylation. That Ser was a specific target of casein kinase II was confirmed by the loss of a phosphopeptide in the S10A mutant protein. The S10A mutation did not affect phosphorylation of Opi1p by either protein kinase A or protein kinase C. Likewise, phosphorylation of Opi1p by casein kinase II was not affected by mutations in protein kinase A (S31A and S251A) and protein S10A kinase C (S26A) phosphorylation sites. Expression of the OPI1 allele in an opi1Î mutant attenuated (2-fold) the repressive effect of Opi1p on INO1 expression, and this effect was only observed when cells were grown in the absence of inositol.

We established an in vitro system using digitonin-permeabilized cells to analyze nuclear import of c-Fos in detail. Two import receptors of the importin Î² superfamily, importin Î² itself and transportin, promote import of c-Fos in vitro. Under conditions where importin Î²-dependent transport was blocked, c-Fos still accumulated in the nucleus in the presence of cytosol. Inhibition of the transportin-dependent pathway, in contrast, abolished import of c-Fos. Furthermore, c-Fos mutants that interact with transportin but not with importin Î² were efficiently imported in the presence of cytosol. Hence, transportin appears to be the predominant import receptor for c-Fos. A detailed biochemical characterization revealed that the interaction of transportin with c-Fos is distinct from the interaction with its established import cargoes, the M9 sequence of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 or the nuclear localization sequence of some basic proteins. Likewise, the binding sites on importin Î² for its classic import cargo and for c-Fos can be separated. In summary, c-Fos employs a novel mode of receptor-cargo interaction. Hence, transportin may be as versatile as importin Î² in recognizing different nuclear import cargoes. c-Fos, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, is rapidly imported into the nucleus after translation.

Hence, transportin may be as versatile as importin Î² in recognizing different nuclear import cargoes. Import of proteins into the nucleus is mediated by importins, members of the importin Î² superfamily. The âclassicâ signals for nuclear import (nuclear localization signal; NLS) 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; AP-1, activator protein-1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; IBB, importin Î² binding domain; LZ, leucine zipper; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PTHrP, parathyroid hormone-related protein; SREBP-2, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. are short basic stretches of amino acids with lysines as characteristic components, which may occur either as a single or a bipartite motif. These classic NLSs are recognized by the adapter molecule importin Î±, which forms a heterodimer with the actual transport receptor, importin Î² (for reviews see Refs. 1GÃ¶rlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 2Fried H. Kutay U. Cell Mol.

The importin Î±/Î²-NLS-cargo complex is then translocated through the nuclear pore complex. Nucleoporins, the protein components of the nuclear pore complex, may interact with the transport receptor, facilitating the translocation of the complex. Importin Î² interaction with RanGTP on the nuclear side of the nuclear pore complex results in dissociation of the transport complex (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Hundreds of individual nuclear proteins or proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm are thought to use this classic importin Î±/Î² nuclear import pathway. Over the last couple of years, however, a number of proteins have been described that do not depend on the adapter protein importin Î±. Some of these bind directly to the classic import receptor, importin Î², without requiring any adapter protein. These include the proteins Rev and Rex of the human immunodeficiency virus (5Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Truant R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2 (11Nagoshi E. Imamoto N. Sato R. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2221-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)), the zinc finger protein Snail (12Yamasaki H. Sekimoto T. Ohkubo T. Douchi T. Nagata Y. Ozawa M. Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the transcription factor CREB (13Forwood J.K. Lam M.H. Jans D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5208-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins also contain basic NLSs. In contrast to the classic NLS, however, arginine is the predominant basic amino acid in these motives. Other import substrates do not bind to importin Î² but to other members of the importin Î² superfamily. The best described member of this family (besides importin Î² itself) is transportin, which has originally been shown to serve as an import receptor for the M9 sequence, a 38-amino acid domain in the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 protein that functions as an NLS (14Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Transportin is also an import receptor for other heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (15Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as well as for ribosomal proteins (16JÃ¤kel S. GÃ¶rlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and the nucleoporin Nup153 (17Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Other members of the family are, for example, importin 5 and importin 7, with ribosomal proteins and core histones as import substrates (16JÃ¤kel S. GÃ¶rlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and importin 8, which mediates nuclear import of a protein of the signal recognition particle (18Dean K.A. von Ahsen O. GÃ¶rlich D. Fried H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3479-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some cargo molecules like histones or certain ribosomal proteins can be imported by more than one receptor (16JÃ¤kel S. GÃ¶rlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). For some importins, no import cargo has been identified so far (3Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). AP-1 (activator protein-1), one of the first mammalian transcription factors to be identified, converts short-term signals to long-lasting responses in a large variety of complex cellular processes like transformation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (for reviews see Refs. 19Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar and 20Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). The best characterized components of AP-1, which functions as a dimer of basic leucine zipper proteins, are c-Jun and c-Fos. c-Jun may form homodimers, but it interacts preferentially with c-Fos proteins, forming heterodimers. c-Fos, unable to form homodimers, is a nuclear proto-oncogene that is expressed at low levels in most exponentially growing cells. Its expression level can be increased by a variety of stimuli. After translation, c-Fos accumulates in the nucleus very rapidly. Its nuclear import appears to be regulated by extracellular signals, as newly synthesized c-Fos accumulates in the cytoplasm in serum-deprived cells (21Roux P. Blanchard J.M. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Jeanteur P. Piechaczyk M. Cell. 1990; 63: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Higashi N. Kunimoto H. Kaneko S. Sasaki T. Ishii M. Kojima H. Nakajima K. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Different regions in the c-Fos protein are required for its efficient nuclear import (23Tratner I. Verma I.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2049-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 24Campos M.A. Kroon E.G. Gentz R. Ferreira P.C. Cell Biol. Int. 1999; 23: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Nuclear transport of c-Fos and c-Jun appears to be independent of importin Î±, because both proteins interact directly with the transport receptor importin Î². The apparent affinities of the transcription factors for importin Î², however, are rather low (13Forwood J.K. Lam M.H. Jans D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5208-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and importin Î²-dependent transport has not been demonstrated in a permeabilized cell system so far. In this study, we investigate nuclear import of c-Fos in detail, using digitonin-permeabilized cells. Surprisingly, c-Fos still accumulated in the nucleus, even when importin Î²-dependent transport was strongly inhibited. We identified transportin as the major import receptor for c-Fos. Under certain conditions, importin Î² may also function as a transport receptor for the transcription factor. A detailed biochemical analysis revealed that the binding sites for c-Fos and classic import cargoes are distinct on both transportin and importin Î². Likewise, distinct regions in c-Fos are involved in the interaction with either transport receptor. Regarding transportin, these results clearly point to a novel mode of receptor-cargo interaction.

The IBB domain of importin Î± (amino acids 1â65) was amplified and cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pGEX-KG. Transportin 1â890, transportin 1â517, and transportin 518â890 were amplified from pQE32-transportin (27Baake M. Bauerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Eur. J.

MBP-M9 was generated by digestion of pGEX-M9 (14Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

MBP-IBB was constructed by amplification of the IBB domain of importin Î± and cloning into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pMal-c2. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification and LabelingâProtein expression was induced with 0.25 mm (MBP-tagged proteins) or 0.5 mm (all others) isopropylthio-Î²-Î-galactoside at 25 Â°C for 2â4 h. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(-DE3) cells and natively purified by single-step affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. MBP fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells in the presence of 2% glucose. For MBP-transportin, MBP-transportin-N, MBP-transportin-C, and MBP-IBB, bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 Î¼g/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. After sonification, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 Ã g and incubated with amylose beads (New England Biolabs) for 4 h at 4Â°C. The beads were washed with buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. For purification of MBP-M9, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors as above. After sonification and centrifugation at 100,000 Ã g, the lysate was incubated with DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma). The flow-through was collected and subjected to a 40â75% saturation ammonium sulfate cut, followed by gel-filtration on a S200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His-Fos was expressed in BL21(-DE3) cells and natively purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Importin Î² 1â396 and 304â876 (28Bednenko J. Cingolani G. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were expressed in BL21(-DE3) and purified via their N-terminal His tags using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole and supplemented with 30 mm dithiothreitol, inducing cleavage of the C-terminal intein tag. The tag was removed by addition of chitin beads (New England Biolabs). His-S-Importin Î² (43Chi N.C. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), wild-type Ran, and RanQ69L (29Melchior F. Sweet D.J. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were purified as described. All GST fusion and MBP fusion proteins, except of MBP-M9, were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol. MBP-M9, transport receptors, Ran, and RanQ69L were dialyzed against transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EGTA). For binding studies, RanQ69L was loaded with GTP as described (30Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). His-Fos was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3, and labeled with Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Preparation of FITC-BSA-NLS was essentially as described (31Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). All proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80 Â°C. Binding StudiesâBinding of cytosolic proteins to c-Fos: 200 Î¼g of GST, GST-Fos, or GST-Fos3â160 were immobilized on 100 Î¼l of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with 600 Î¼l of HeLa cell cytosol (32Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); 10 mg/ml, in binding buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol), that had been preincubated with or without 10 Î¼m RanQ69LGTP. After incubation for 4 h at 4 Â°C, beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and bound material was eluted with 120 Î¼l of 2Ã SDS buffer. 5 Î¼l each were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting or silver staining. 60 Î¼l were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and mass spectrometry. Binding of recombinant transport receptors to c-Fos: GST or GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with 10 mg/ml BSA to a final concentration of 1 Î¼g/Î¼l. 5 Î¼g of recombinant His-tagged or MBP-tagged transport receptors in 400 Î¼l of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2 mg/ml BSA) were added to 5 Î¼l of beads. In some reactions, transport receptors were preincubated with 2 Î¼m RanQ69LGTP or a 20-fold molar excess (relative to the immobilized proteins) of MBP-IBB and MBP-M9 as competitors. After incubation for 2 h at 4 Â°C, beads were washed three times with binding buffer without BSA, and bound proteins were eluted with 2Ã SDS buffer. In experiments where relative affinities between c-Fos and import receptors were measured, importin Î² without an affinity tag was used (purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration; a kind gift from F. Melchior). In binding studies with His-S-importin Î²,5 Î¼g of this import receptor was immobilized on 5 Î¼l of S-protein-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with an equimolar amount of GST-Fos, preincubated with or without an equimolar amount or a 10-fold excess of transportin. Mass SpectrometryâProtein digestion was performed essentially as reported (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), and peptides were desalted and concentrated using C18 extraction tips (34Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). The peptide mixture was analyzed with an Ultimate nanoHPLC system (LC Packings) coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Thermo Finnigan) using a C18 reversed-phase column (PepMap, LC Packings). Peak lists were searched against the Swiss-Prot Protein Sequence Data Base. In Vitro Import AssaysâFor nuclear import assays (36Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), HeLa cells were grown on 10-well slides (Roth), permeabilized with 30 Î¼g/ml digitonin (Calbiochem) in transport buffer on ice, and washed. In some experiments, permeabilized cells were preincubated with 200 Î¼g/ml wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, Sigma) in transport buffer for 12 min on ice. Each import mixture contained 250â500 nm import substrates, 4 Î¼m Ran or RanQ69L, 2 mm GTP, 3 mg/ml BSA, an ATP-regenerating system (32Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and either 2 mg/ml HeLa cytosol (in transport buffer) or 500 nm His-tagged importins. In competition experiments, HeLa cytosol was preincubated with 3 Î¼l of a monoclonal anti-importin Î²-antibody (Affinity BioReagents, clone 3E9 (32Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) or with 20 Î¼m of MBP-M9 as competitor. Import reactions were performed for 30 min at 25 Â°C for c-Fos or at 30 Â°C for GST-NLS, BSA-NLS, and GST-M9. After washing, cells incubated with Cy3-Fos or FITC-BSA-NLS were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and analyzed directly by fluorescence microscopy. Cells incubated with GST-tagged import substrates were first subjected to indirect immunostaining using an anti-GST-antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and Alexa 594 donkey-anti-goat (Molecular Probes). Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope. Pictures were processed using Adobe Photoshop. SDS-PAGE and Western BlottingâProteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using standard methods. Rabbit anti-importin Î² and anti-importin 7 antibodies were a kind gift from D. GÃ¶rlich (35GÃ¶rlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The rabbit-anti-transportin antibody was a kind gift from L. Gerace. Rabbit anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) was purchased from New England Biolabs. The mouse anti-His antibody was from Covance. HRP-coupled goat anti rabbit or goat anti mouse IgG (Dianova) was used as secondary antibody. The ECL system (Pierce) was used for visualization of proteins. Importin Î²-independent Nuclear Import of c-Fos in VitroâThe transcription factor c-Fos has been suggested to be imported into the nucleus by the transport receptor importin Î², independent of the adapter protein importin Î± (13Forwood J.K. Lam M.H. Jans D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5208-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importin Î²-dependent import of c-Fos in permeabilized cells, however, has not been demonstrated so far. To analyze nuclear transport of c-Fos in detail, we established an import assay in digitonin-permeabilized cells (36Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, c-Fos was efficiently imported into nuclei of permeabilized cells at 25 Â°C in the presence of cytosol and wild-type Ran. Transport was energy-dependent, as it was blocked at 4 Â°C, and required the addition of soluble factors, as no nuclear accumulation was observed in cells incubated with buffer alone. To test whether nuclear import of c-Fos depends on transport receptors of the importin Î²-superfamily, a reaction was performed in the presence of RanQ69L, a Ran-mutant that is predominantly in the GTP-bound form (37Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), preventing the interaction of import substrates with import receptors (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). RanQ69L strongly inhibited nuclear accumulation of c-Fos, demonstrating the specificity of the nuclear transport reaction. We next used our in vitro transport assay to test if import of c-Fos depends on the activity of importin Î². Importin Î²-dependent transport can be inhibited with a monoclonal antibody against this transport receptor (38Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Preincubation of cytosol with this antibody resulted in strong inhibition of nuclear import of GST-NLS, a substrate that uses the importin Î±/Î² dimer as a transport receptor (Fig. 1B). In contrast, nuclear import of GST-M9, a substrate for the import receptor transportin, was not affected by the anti-importin Î² antibody. Likewise, nuclear import of c-Fos was not significantly reduced upon preincubation of cytosol with the anti-importin Î² antibody. These results strongly suggest that cytosolic transport factors distinct from importin Î² can mediate nuclear import of c-Fos. c-Fos Interacts with Different Import ReceptorsâTo identify transport receptors that specifically interact with c-Fos, a GST fusion protein of the transcription factor was immobilized on Sepharose beads and incubated with cytosol in the absence or presence of RanQ69L. This Ran-mutant inhibited nuclear import of c-Fos (Fig. 1A), and we therefore expected it to release transport-relevant interaction partners from the immobilized bait. As shown in Fig. 2A, two proteins â¼100 and 120 kDa specifically bound to GST-Fos in the absence but not in the presence of RanQ69L. To identify these potential import receptors for c-Fos, the bands were cut from the gel and tryptic digests of proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In each band, two proteins could unequivocally be identified. The strong band at 100 kDa contained importin Î² and transportin (specifically, transportin 1 (14Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar)), whereas the weaker band at 120 kDa contained importins 7 and 8. We next used specific antibodies against three of these four import receptors to verify their specific interaction with GST-Fos. Importin Î², importin 7, as well as transportin specifically bound to GST-Fos in the absence but not in the presence of RanQ69L (Fig. 2B). No binding to immobilized GST was detected. Strikingly, a strong accumulation of transportin on the GST-Fos beads was observed, whereas only a rather small proportion of importin Î² or importin 7 was bound to the beads (compare âinputâ and âGST-Fosâ). c-Fos contains a leucine-zipper and forms stable dimers with proteins like c-Jun. To exclude the possibility that the identified import receptors bound indirectly to c-Fos via proteins that interact with its leucine-zipper, we expressed an N-terminal fragment of c-Fos, lacking this protein interaction domain (GST-Fos 3â160; see also Fig. 5A). Binding of importin 7, importin Î², and transportin to this fragment was as strong as to the full-length protein (Fig. 2B), suggesting a direct interaction. To demonstrate such a direct interaction of import receptors with c-Fos, importin 7, importin Î², and transportin, as well as importin 5 as a negative control, were expressed in bacteria and incubated with immobilized GST-Fos. Importin 5 did not interact with GST-Fos under these conditions (Fig. 2C). Importin Î² and transportin bound efficiently to GST-Fos, whereas importin 7 bound rather weakly (compare âGST-Fosâtoâinputâ). Binding of importin Î² and transportin was abolished when RanQ69L was included in the reaction, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. Binding of importin 7 to GST-Fos was less sensitive to RanQ69L, probably reflecting the lower affinity of this transport receptor for RanGTP, compared with importin Î² (35GÃ¶rlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Importin 7 has been shown to form a heterodimer with importin Î² (35GÃ¶rlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This dimer serves as an import receptor for histone H1 (39JÃ¤kel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. GÃ¶rlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We therefore combined importin Î² and importin 7 in the binding reaction and now observed increased binding of importin 7 (together with importin Î²) to GST-Fos (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that at least part of the cytosolic importin 7 that interacted with GST-Fos (Fig. 2A) was indirectly bound via importin Î². Taken together, different transport receptors of the importin Î² superfamily specifically interact with c-Fos and may therefore function as physiological import receptors.FIGURE 5Different regions in c-Fos are involved in the interaction with importin Î² and transportin.

B and C,5 Î¼g of GST or GST-Fos proteins 1â10 (as in A) were immobilized on beads and incubated with 5 Î¼g of full-length importin Î² (B) or transportin (C). BSA was used as a blocking reagent. D,5 Î¼g of S-importin Î² was immobilized on beads and incubated with 3.5 Î¼g of GST-Fos and either 5 Î¼g (1Ã) or 50 Î¼g (10Ã) of transportin.

Cells were incubated either at 4 Â°C or 25 Â°C with equimolar concentrations of the various transport receptors. At 25 Â°C, transportin promoted the strongest accumulation of c-Fos in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). Importin Î² also mediated nuclear import of c-Fos, yet to a somewhat lower extent. Importins 5 and 7 did not promote nuclear import of c-Fos, a"
https://openalex.org/W1969296872,"Wnt proteins play a key role in cell survival, cell proliferation, and cell fate during development. In endothelial cells, we identified the expression of Wnt13A, Wnt13B, and Wnt13C mRNAs, which are generated by alternative promoters and alternative RNA splicing. Wnt13A and Wnt13B proteins differ only in their N-terminal sequences. Wnt13A, a typical Wnt, is N-glycosylated and localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, with only a small fraction being secreted. Wnt13B proteins appear as a protein doublet, L-Wnt13B and S-Wnt13B, which are neither N-glycosylated nor secreted. Wnt13B proteins localized mainly to mitochondria, as demonstrated using detection in mitochondria enriched fractions and colocalization with Mitotracker and HSP60. A nuclear localization was also observed in 20% of Wnt13B-expressing cells. Both the N-terminal hydrophobic stretch (residues 1-17) and Î±-helix (residues 26-50) were the main determinants for Wnt13B mitochondrial targeting. Serial deletions of Wnt13B N-terminal sequences abolished its association with mitochondria and favored instead a nuclear localization. The production of S-Wnt13B was independent of the mitochondrial targeting but dependent on an alternative translation start corresponding to Met74 in L-Wnt13B. The same translation start is used in Wnt13C mRNA to encode a protein undistinguishable from S-Wnt13B. S-Wnt13B when expressed alone localized to the nucleus like Wnt13C, whereas L-Wnt13B localized to mitochondria. Wnt13 nuclear forms increased the Î²-catenin/T-cell factor activity in HEK293 cells and increased apoptosis in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Altogether our results demonstrate that, in addition to alternative promoters and RNA splicing, an alternative translation start in Wnt13B and Wnt13C mRNAs increases the complexity of both human wnt13 expression and functions.

Wnt proteins are cysteine-rich glycoproteins that play diverse functions during development, including control of cell fate and cell proliferation, establishment of cell polarity, and initiation of cell migration (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins elicit most of these activities through binding with the seven-transmembrane Frizzled receptors (2Strutt D. Development. 2003; 130: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and with the co-receptors low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 and -6 (3He X. Semenov M. Tamai K. Zeng X. Development. 2004; 131: 1663-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Depending upon the combination of Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors, three different signaling pathways have been identified. All three pathways involve common downstream protein adaptors, the disheveled/Dvl proteins (4Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 5Sheldahl L.C. Slusarski D.C. Pandur P. Miller J.R. Kuhl M. Moon R.T. J.

The canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway leads to the stabilization of cytoplasmic Î²-catenin, which subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the transcription factors of the T-cell factor (TCF) 2The abbreviations used are: TCF, T-cell factor; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell(s); HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HSP, heat shock protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CM, conditioned media; ECM, extracellular matrix; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; aa, amino acid(s). family and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle and cell adhesion (6Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The Wnt/Ca2+-dependent pathway is a classical G-protein-coupled receptor pathway leading to the activation of protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (7Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). The Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway leads to the activation of the small GTPases of the Rho family, Rho A, Rac 1, and Cdc42, which in turn regulate the cytoskeleton and thus cell morphology and migratory behaviors (8Mlodzik M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 564-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 9Malliri A. Collard J.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In mammals, 19 different Wnt family members displaying a conserved pattern of 21-23 cysteine residues have been identified so far. Although a high similarity exists between them, their roles in vivo, as identified by specific knock-out in mice, are not redundant (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 10Uusitalo M. Heikkila M. Vainio S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). wnt genes are often expressed in a spatial and temporal fashion, which accounts for the major part of their specific activity. In addition, Wnt proteins also display divergent N-terminal sequences that account for their differential ability to be secreted (11Burrus L.W. McMahon A.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although Wnt proteins are found secreted and associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM), the efficiency of secretion is very poor, and most of the Wnt proteins are mainly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) despite the lack of ER retrieval and ER retention consensus sequences (12Smolich B.D. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Papkoff J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Retention in the ER is dependent upon the interaction of the Wnt proteins with the ER chaperone Grp78/BiP (11Burrus L.W. McMahon A.P. Exp.

Efficient secretion of the Wnt proteins, both in Drosophila and mammalian cells, requires the expression of Porcupine, a transmembrane protein located in the ER with a putative acyltransferase activity (14Tanaka K.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3116-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Porcupine binds a conserved region in the N terminus of the Wnt proteins surrounding the N-glycosylation site and favors their N-glycosylation by a mechanism that remains yet to be identified (17Tanaka K. Kitagawa Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, Wnt3A, Wnt8, and Dwnt1 proteins were found to be lipid-modified, in particular by the addition of palmitate on a conserved cysteine (Cys77 in Wnt3A) present in the interaction domain with Porcupine (18Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates J.R.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 19Zhai L. Chaturvedi D. Cumberledge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33220-33227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), hence reinforcing the concept of an association of the Wnt proteins with membrane compartments, such as the ER and secretory vesicles. Altogether these results emphasize the importance of determining the cellular processing and targeting of the Wnt proteins in order to understand their mechanism of action and/or the regulation of their activity. The wnt13 gene, also called wnt2b, is one of the rare wnt genes that gives rise to different mRNA forms by alternative splicing (20Katoh M. Kirikoshi H. Saitoh T. Sagara N. Koike J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In adult gastric epithelial cells, two Wnt13/Wnt2B mRNA forms were found expressed, Wnt13A/Wnt2B2 and Wnt13B/Wnt2B1, which code for proteins that differ only by their N-terminal sequences (20Katoh M. Kirikoshi H. Saitoh T. Sagara N. Koike J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). During chick development of the retina, wnt13 was expressed in particular at the marginal tip of the retina, where it maintains undifferentiated progenitor cells in the ciliary marginal zone (21Kubo F. Takeichi M. Nakagawa S. Development. 2003; 130: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 22Jasoni C. Hendrickson A. Roelink H. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These effects of Wnt13 were associated with the activation of the canonical Î²-catenin/LEF/TCF signaling pathway (23Liu H. Mohamed O. Dufort D. Wallace V.A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Another role as a morphogen was also described in the chick retina, where wnt13 expression in the anterior rim allows the proper development of laminated retinal layers (24Nakagawa S. Takada S. Takada R. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the particular form of Wnt13 expressed in this study was not defined, it probably refers to Wnt13A/Wnt2B2, since only Wnt13A/Wnt2B2 proteins, and not Wnt13B/Wnt2B1, were able to activate the canonical Î²-catenin/TCF pathway and induce axis duplication in Xenopus embryo (25Katoh M. Kirikoshi H. Terasaki H. Shiokawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have identified the expression of three different mRNA forms of the wnt13 gene in endothelial cells of different origins: the previously described Wnt13A/Wnt2B2 and Wnt13B/Wnt2B1 mRNA forms (20Katoh M. Kirikoshi H. Saitoh T. Sagara N. Koike J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and an additional Wnt13C mRNA generated by an alternative splicing that skips exon 2 (Fig. 1). In this report, we demonstrate that these various Wnt13 mRNA isoforms code for proteins with distinct N termini, processing, and subcellular localizations. Whereas Wnt13A is a classical Wnt protein, N-glycosylated and secreted, Wnt13B and Wnt13C are intracellular forms targeted to mitochondria and to the nucleus respectively. Such different subcellular localizations for Wnt13A and Wnt13B proteins explain the differential activities previously observed for these two forms (25Katoh M. Kirikoshi H. Terasaki H. Shiokawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

Recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± was from R&D Systems. Wnt13-FLAG ConstructsâFull-length Wnt13A, Wnt13B, and Wnt13C cDNAs were obtained using total RNAs extracted from BAEC and HUVEC respectively and reverse transcription-PCR with the primers described in Table 1. After elimination of the stop codon, the FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) was added in frame with the first ATG at the C terminus of each Wnt13 cDNAs, and the resulting cDNAs were cloned into pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen). All of the N-terminal deletion mutants, Î(1-17)Wnt13B, Î(1-52)Wnt13B, and Î(1-88)Wnt13B, were obtained by PCR using the upstream primers as indicated in Table 1 and the FLAG tag reverse primer. All the mutations resulting in single and multiple aa changes in the Wnt13B-FLAG construct were obtained by PCR using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with the various primers described in Table 1 and with either Wnt13B-FLAG or the appropriate mutated Wnt13B-FLAG constructs as template. The chimeric N-terminal constructs Wnt13AB (Wnt13A-(1-42) + Wnt13B-(26-372)) and Wnt13BA (Wnt13B-(1-25) + Wnt13A-(43-391)) were generated after insertion of a SphI site by PCR in both Wnt13A-FLAG and Wnt13B-FLAG cDNA sequences, respectively, at positions +126 and +79 using PCR. The swapping of the N-terminal sequences was obtained after SphI restriction digest and ligation with the C-terminal sequences of either Wnt13A or Wnt13B. The integrity of each construct was verified by sequencing. The YC4-mit plasmid coding for the mitochondria matrix-targeted green fluorescent protein was used as control in the transfection experiments (26Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh J.V.J. Demaurex N. J.

J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and maintained in MCDB105 (Sigma) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), respectively. The human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 and the epithelial cell line HEK293 were maintained also in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 4.5 g/liter glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections of BAEC and HEK293 cells with the various constructs were performed using Exgen 500 reagent (MBI Fermentas) as recommended by the manufacturer. Analysis of Wnt13 mRNA ExpressionâTotal RNAs (1 Î¼g) were subjected to DNase I treatment for 15 min at 20 Â°C to remove any DNA contaminations prior to the addition of 0.5 Î¼g of oligo(dT)12-18 primers and 10 units of the SuperScript reverse transcriptase for 50 min at 42 Â°C according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). cDNAs for Wnt13A and for Wnt13B/C were amplified by 40 cycles of PCR using forward primers specific for exon 3 (5â²-CGTAGACACGTCCTGGTGGTA-3â²) and exon 1 (5â²-CATGTTGGATGGCCTTGGAG-3â²), respectively, and a universal Wnt13 reverse primer located in exon 4 (5â²-GCTGACACTCTCGGATCCAT-3â²). The expression of the ribosomal protein L32 mRNA was used as internal control, and rpL32 cDNAs were amplified for 25 cycles of PCR with rpL32-fwd primer (5â²-GCCAGATCTTGATGCCCAAC-3â²) and rpL32-rev primer (5â²-CGTGCACATGAGCTGCCTAC-3â²). Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot AnalysisâFor whole cell extracts, the cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Insoluble fraction pellets were discarded after centrifugation at 20,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 Â°C. For cell fractionation, the conditioned media (CM) were collected, and the cells were washed with cold PBS prior to being detached from the plates with cold PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA. The detached cells were collected and processed as described below; meanwhile, the plates were washed extensively with ice-cold water to eliminate residual cells, and the ECM components were dissociated from the plates with denaturing Laemmli buffer. The cells were centrifuged at 400 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C. Cell pellets were suspended in hypotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures) and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to being subjected to 20 passages through 26-gauge needles to disrupt the cells. The nuclei and cytoskeleton fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 1,200 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C (pellet), and the resulting supernatants were further subjected to 100,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C to obtain the membrane fractions (pellet) and the cytosolic fractions (supernatant). The nuclei and membrane pellets were suspended and dissolved in the hypotonic buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl, and the insoluble fractions were discarded after centrifugation at 20,000 Ã g for 20 min. The cytosolic fractions were adjusted to 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 final concentration, and the CM were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture and adjusted to 1% Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged proteins, the various cell fractions or whole lysates were incubated with 20 Î¼l of M2-anti-FLAG-agarose beads for 16 h at 4 Â°C. After extensive washes, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 20 Î¼l of denaturing Laemmli buffer. For Western blot analysis, proteins were fractionated on polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp.). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with the various primary antibodies as indicated and subsequently with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using SuperSignalÂ® chemiluminescence (Pierce). Mitochondria Isolation and Biochemical AnalysisâMitochondria were prepared as previously described (28Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC were harvested 24 h post-transfection and suspended in 500 Î¼l of homogenizing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, supplemented with protease and phosphatase mixture inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were disrupted by 20 passages through 26-gauge needles. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 400 Ã g for 5 min at 4 Â°C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 8,000 Ã g for 15 min to obtain the mitochondria enriched pellets. After an additional wash in the homogenizing buffer, the crude mitochondria preparation was used either for immunoprecipitation or biochemical analyses. For BAEC subcellular fractionations, this protocol was modified as follows. The cell disruption step was repeated twice, and the various subcellular fractions were obtained by differential centrifugations: nuclear pellet, 400 Ã g for 5 min; mitochondria pellet, 8,000 Ã g for 10 min; ER pellet, 25,000 Ã g for 10 min; and cytosol plus light membrane fraction, 25,000 Ã g supernatant. Each obtained pellet was washed twice in the homogenizing buffer prior to analysis. The association of Wnt13B with mitochondria was tested using high salt and alkaline extraction as previously described (29Lynn B.D. Turley E.A. Nagy J.I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 65: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were suspended in the homogenizing buffer in the absence or presence of either 1 m KCl or 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g for 15 min for obtaining the mitochondria pellet and the supernatant containing extracted mitochondrial proteins. The supernatants and mitochondria pellets were analyzed by Western blotting. For the immunoprecipitation experiments, mitochondria were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton supplemented with protease and phosphatase mixture inhibitors, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography using the M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence and Confocal MicroscopyâBAEC were plated in LabTek slide chambers coated with fibronectin (1 Î¼g/cm2) (Invitrogen) 24 h prior to transfection. 24 h post-transfection, when required, mitochondria were stained with Mitotracker-633 deep red for 45 min as recommended by the manufacturer prior to cell washes with PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and fixation in 4% formaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.7% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) at 37 Â°C for 30 min followed by sequential incubations with primary antibodies and Alexa-secondary antibodies for 2 h each in the same buffer. Nuclei were stained with 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole during slide mounting with Vectashield H1200 (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Images were taken with a Leica confocal upright microscope every 1 Î¼m throughout the heights of the cells at either Ã 64 or Ã 100 magnification, and maximum average images were recorded. At least four independent transfections and staining experiments were done, and representative images are shown. Luciferase AssaysâHEK293 cells were plated in 12-well culture clusters and 24 h later transiently cotransfected with 5 ng of phRG-TK plasmid as control for the efficiency of transfection (Promega), 250 ng of the TOP-Flash or FOP-Flash luciferase constructs containing, respectively, wild-type or mutated TCF binding sites upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (30Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar), 300 ng of pcDNA3-S37A-Î²-catenin plasmid, and 450 ng of the various Wnt13 expression constructs, as indicated. 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed, and the Renilla and firefly luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) and quantified using LmaxII luminometer (Molecular Devices). Five independent transfection experiments were performed in duplicates. Analysis of the Induction of IL-8 mRNA Expression in HEK293 Cells by Real Time PCRâHEK293 cells (5 Ã 105 cells) were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected 24 h later either with 4 Î¼g of PCR3 vector as control, 2 Î¼g of S37A-Î²-catenin + 2 Î¼g of PCR3 vectors, 2 Î¼g of pCR3-M1L-Wnt13B + 2 Î¼g of PCR3 vectors, or 2 Î¼g of S37A-Î²-catenin + 2 Î¼g of pCR3-M1L-Wnt13B vectors. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and total RNAs were extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNAs (1 Î¼g) were subjected to DNase I treatment and reverse transcription as previously described for the analysis of Wnt13 mRNA expression. Real time PCRs were conducted using the SyBr Green PCR kit and the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the relative levels of IL-8 cDNAs were determined using the threshold cycles (Ct value). The expression of rpL32 cDNA was used as an internal control, and the Ct values obtained for IL-8 were corrected for any variations of the Ct values of rpL32. The primers used for human IL-8 were as follows: forward, 5â²-GTGCAGTTTTGCCAAGGAGTG-3â²; reverse, 5â²-CTCTGCACCCAGTTTTCCTTG-3â². Analysis of Apoptosis in BAECâBAEC were transiently transfected either with YC4-mit control plasmid, Wnt13A-FLAG, or the various Wnt13B-FLAG constructs for 24 h. The appearance of apoptotic nuclei in BAEC expressing the various proteins of interest was quantified using immunofluorescence microscopy after staining of both the nuclei with 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and the FLAG-tagged proteins with the polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies. Activation of caspase-3 was determined by following the appearance of the active cleaved form of caspase-3 using Western blotting and the specific cleaved caspase-3 antibodies (Cell Signaling). For these experiments, BAEC expressing the various target proteins were treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-Î± for 12 h, prior to being lysed directly in denaturing Laemmli buffer. At least three independent experiments were performed for each of the apoptosis assays. Endothelial Cells Express Three Different Wnt13 RNA IsoformsâUsing the Wnt degenerate primers previously described (31Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and cDNAs obtained from HUVEC and HMEC-1, we found that wnt13 and wnt5A were the main wnt genes expressed in these differentiated endothelial cells (not shown). The cloning of full-length Wnt13 cDNAs from these cell lines gave three different cDNAs. Two cDNAs corresponded to the previously described Wnt13A/Wnt2b2 mRNA transcribed from the P2 promoter and composed of exons 3-7 and Wnt13B/Wnt2b1 mRNA transcribed from the P1 promoter and composed of exons 1 and 2 and exons 4-7 (Fig. 1, A-C). An additional Wnt13 cDNA corresponded to a novel Wnt13 mRNA species that was named Wnt13C. Wnt13C mRNAs are transcribed from the P1 promoter like Wnt13B mRNAs but are composed of exons 1 and 4-7, since the entire exon 2 is skipped during an alternative splicing (Fig. 1, A-C). The expression of these three Wnt13 mRNA species was also observed in the epithelial HEK293 cells (Fig. 1C). Wnt13B and Wnt13C mRNAs differ thus by the deletion of 71 nucleotides corresponding to exon 2 (Fig. 1C), and this deletion in Wnt13C leads to a change in the open reading frame of exon 4 and generation of a stop codon within exon 4. Consequently, the deduced amino acid sequence coded by Wnt13C mRNA from the first translation initiation codon in exon 1 is a very short peptide of 30 amino acids in length, whereas Wnt13A and Wnt13B mRNAs code for proteins"
https://openalex.org/W2031900580,"In Escherichia coli K-12, the RecA- and transposase-independent precise excision of transposons is thought to be mediated by the slippage of the DNA polymerase between the two short direct repeats that flank the transposon. Inactivation of the uup gene, encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) ATPase, led to an important increase in the frequency of precise excision of transposons Tn10 and Tn5 and a defective growth of bacteriophage Mu. To provide insight into the mechanism of Uup in transposon excision, we purified this protein, and we demonstrated that it is a cytosolic ABC protein. Purified recombinant Uup binds and hydrolyzes ATP and undergoes a large conformational change in the presence of this nucleotide. This change affects a carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein that displays predicted structural homology with the socalled little finger domain of Y family DNA polymerases. In these enzymes, this domain is involved in DNA binding and in the processivity of replication. We show that Uup binds to DNA and that this binding is in part dependent on its carboxyl-terminal domain. Analysis of Walker motif B mutants suggests that ATP hydrolysis at the two ABC domains is strictly coordinated and is essential for the function of Uup in vivo.

Mutations and genetic rearrangements are frequently associated with repetitive DNA sequences (1Lovett S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Genetic rearrangements are the deletion or expansion of repeated DNA sequences, leading to genomic changes that are important for bacterial survival or evolution (2van Belkum A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transposon precise excision is a special case of deletion at short direct repeats created by the transposition mechanism and facilitated by the large inverted repeats constituting the insertion sequences of these elements (3Foster T.J. Lundblad V. Hanley-Way S. Halling S.M. Kleckner N. Cell. 1981; 23: 215-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Precise and nearly precise excision are host-mediated processes that occur in the absence of recA function or any transposon-encoded functions (3Foster T.J. Lundblad V. Hanley-Way S. Halling S.M. Kleckner N. Cell. 1981; 23: 215-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). tex (for transposon excision) mutations have been identified that elevate the frequency of these rearrangements (4Lundblad V. Kleckner N. Basic Life Sci. 1982; 20: 245-258PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations include unusual recBC alleles that alter but do not abolish the functions of RecBC (5Lundblad V. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and alleles of genes involved in the methylation-directed pathway for repair of base pair mismatches such as mutS, mutH, mutL, dam, and uvrD (6Lundblad V. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1984; 109: 3-19Crossref Google Scholar). Conditional mutations in ssb, the essential gene encoding the Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein SSB, also confer a tex phenotype (6Lundblad V. Kleckner N.

Recently it was reported that mutations in topA (toposimerase I), dnaA (DNA polymerase I), and dnaBE (helicase and Î±-subunits of DNA polymerase III) also lead to the same phenotype (8Nagel R. Chan A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All of these mutations affect genes encoding proteins involved in DNA replication or repair, supporting the notion that deletions are the result of errors during replication (1Lovett S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Other tex mutations affect the uup gene and cause an increase in the frequency of precise excision of transposons Tn10, mini-Tn10, and Tn5 and a defective growth of bacteriophage Mu (10Hopkins J.D. Clements M. Syvanen M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 384-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence determination of the uup gene suggested that the Uup protein is cytosolic and belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 3The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; IPTG, isopropyl thio-Î²-d-galactoside; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitriloacetic acid; LF, little finger; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; HCA, hydrophobic cluster analysis; LD, linker domain.3The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; IPTG, isopropyl thio-Î²-d-galactoside; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitriloacetic acid; LF, little finger; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; HCA, hydrophobic cluster analysis; LD, linker domain. proteins (7Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). tex mutations affecting transposon precise excision fall into two categories: the first, such as uup, ssb, topA, and polA, increase precise excision of both Tn10 and mini-Tn10; and the second, such as mutHLS, dam, and uvrD, increase precise excision of Tn10 but not of mini-Tn10. The role of Uup in DNA metabolism was never investigated.ABC proteins constitute one of the largest families of paralogues in sequenced genomes (11Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). They couple ATP hydrolysis to a wide variety of cellular processes, including transmembrane transport, gene regulation, and DNA repair. All ABC proteins are characterized by the presence of a conserved domain, known as the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), which contains at least five characteristic sequence motifs (12Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In addition to the Walker motifs A and B identified in many ATPase families, NBDs contain the ABC signature motif (motif S), a conserved glutamine loop (Q-loop or Lid), and a conserved histidine loop (H-loop or Switch). In ABC proteins associated with membrane transport, the NBDs bind and hydrolyze ATP and transmit conformational changes to membrane-spanning domains, which typically form a pathway for the transported substrate (12Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Genome and phylogenetic analyses have identified three classes of ABC proteins that correlate well to functional categories (13Dassa E. Bouige P. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Classes 1 and 3 are comprised of exporters and importers, respectively. In contrast, class 2 consists of ABC proteins devoid of transmembrane domains or known transmembrane protein partners and composed of two tandemly repeated ABC domains fused together. Within class 2, phylogenetic analyses identified four subfamilies of proteins in which some members have been involved in antibiotic resistance (ARE), transcription or translation regulation (REG and RLI), and DNA repair (UVR) (13Dassa E. Bouige P. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 14Kerr I.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Uup belongs to the REG subfamily, which is comprised mainly of eukaryote and prokaryote proteins with unknown function. However, a few are known to participate in gene expression regulation, although their exact mechanism of action and the role of ATP hydrolysis in their function are unknown. Among the five ATPases of this family that have been studied, the best characterized is the yeast protein GCN20. It associates with another protein, GCN1, to stimulate the activity of GCN2, a kinase that phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, ultimately leading to increased translation of the transcriptional activator GCN4 in amino acid-starved cells (15Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, none of the four proteins have been characterized at the molecular level. The Agrobacterium tumefaciens ChvD protein was found to be inactivated in a mutant selected for the reduced transcription of the virA and virG genes (16Winans S.C. Kerstetter R.A. Nester E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Caulobacter crescentus HfaC protein was found to be important for the attachment of the holdfast adhesive organelle to the cell (17Kurtz Jr., H.D. Smit J. Smith J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 116: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In E. coli, inactivation of yheS causes an increase in the periplasmic production of a recombinant Sc-Fv antibody fragment by an unknown mechanism (18Belin P. Dassa J. Drevet P. Lajeunesse E. Savatier A. Boulain J.C. Menez A. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To date, the sole phenotype reported for uup null mutants is an increase in the frequency of precise excision of transposons and of sequences located between two tandemly repeated sequences (7Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Hopkins J.D. Clements M. Syvanen M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 384-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To provide insight into the mechanism of Uup in transposon excision, we undertook a biochemical and genetic analysis of this protein. In this report, we provide evidence that purified recombinant Uup undergoes a conformational change upon ATP binding. We also demonstrate that recombinant Uup has intrinsic ATPase activity and interacts with DNA in vitro. This binding is in part dependent on the 90-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain of Uup that shares similarities with little finger domains found in the Y family of DNA polymerases. Analysis of Walker motif B mutants led to the conclusion that ATP hydrolysis at the two ABC domains of the protein is essential for the function of Uup in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Strain ConstructionsâStrains are listed in Table 1. All cloning steps were performed with E. coli K-12 strain Top10Fâ² (Invitrogen). Strain MG1655 was used for construction of mutant DM1. In strain DM1, the uup gene was replaced by an aphA cassette, encoding a kanamycin resistance determinant, by a PCR-based procedure (19Chaveroche M.K. Ghigo J.M. d'Enfert C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E97Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Complementation studies were achieved in strains GJ1885 and GJ1886 (7Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in derivatives of the latter. Transductions were performed as described previously (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 439Google Scholar). Overexpression of uup alleles placed under the control of the T7 promoter was achieved in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pLysS).TABLE 1List of strainsStrainGenotypeSource or Ref.TOP10Fâ²InvitrogenMG1655Fâ rph-1Laboratory collectionDM1MG1655 uup::aphAIIIThis workGJ1885ara zbh-900::Tn10dKan(Ts)1 lacZ4525::Tn10dKan9GJ1886GJ1885 uup-351::Tn10dTet19MG1655âµaraBADâµlacIZaraBAD::aphAIII âµlacIZ::apha360DM1987GJ1886 araBAD::aadA7 attB::pBADuupThis workDM1988GJ1886 araBAD::aadA7 attB::pBADuup1This workDM1989GJ1886 araBAD::aadA7 attB::pBADuup2This workDM1990GJ1886 araBAD::aadA7 attB::pBADuup3This workBL21(DE3)(pLysS)Fâ ompT hsdSB (rB - mB -) gal dcm (Î» cIts857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV(T7 gene1)/pLysS (CmR)Laboratory collection Open table in a new tab Plasmid ConstructionsâThe plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. Oligonucleotides used for uup cloning and mutagenesis are listed in Table 3. Standard DNA methods were performed as described previously (21Mourez M. Jehanno M. Schneider E. Dassa E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was achieved by using the Expand High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the supplier's recommendations. The mutations of the uup gene affecting codons 181 and 465 and the replacement of lysine 551 by a stop codon to construct the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) deletion were carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pETuup as described in Stratagene's QuikChange protocol. The resulting fusion proteins, His6-UupD181N, His6-UupD465N, His6-UupD181N/D465N, and His6-UupÎCTD called hereafter Uup1, Uup2, Uup3, and UupÎCTD, respectively, contained a 20-amino acid amino-terminal extension (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH). The same point mutations were constructed on a uup gene cloned under the control of araBAD promoter in plasmid pBAD18. Cloned DNA sequences of wild-type and mutants alleles of uup were checked by DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Meylan, France).TABLE 2List of plasmidsNameDescriptionOrigin or Ref.pET15bExpression vector, phage T7 gene 1 promoter (AmpR)NovagenpETuupWild-type uup cloned into pET15b (Ndel and XhoI)This workpETuup1Mutagenized uup on pETuup (D181N)This workpETuup2Mutagenized uup on pETuup (D465N)This workpETuup3Mutagenized uup on pETuup (D181N), (D465N)This workpBAD18Arabinose-inducible expression vector (Ampr)24pBADuupuup wild-type gene cloned into pBAD18 (EcoRI and NdeI)This workpBADuup1Mutagenized uup on pBADuup (D181N)This workpBADuup2Mutagenized uup on pBADuup (D465N)This workpBADuup3Mutagenized uup on pBADuup (D181N/D465N)This work Open table in a new tab TABLE 3List of oligonucleotidesOligonucleotide nameUsed forSequence5DM1Cloning of uup into pET15b and pBAD18CGGAATTCATATGTCATTAATCAGTATGCATGGCGCAT3DM1Cloning of uup into pET15bCCGCTCGAGTCAGCCACCATTTTTTAACGCTTCA5DM2Cloning of uup into pBAD18GGAATTCCGCAGCCTGAAAGGAATAGTAATG5MUT1Site-directed mutagenesis: T541ACCGCGCGTGCTGTTGCTTAATGAACCGAC3MUT1Site-directed mutagenesis: A541TGTCGGTTCATTAAGCAACAGCACGCGCGG5MUT2Site-directed mutagenesis: T1393ACCAAGCAACTTATTGATTCTTAACGAACCGACCAACG3MUT2Site-directed mutagenesis: A1393TCGTTGGTCGGTTCGTTAAGAATCAATAAGTTGCTTGG5CTDSite-directed mutagenesis A1651TGCCGCCGCGGCATAAGCAGAAACTGTAAAAC3CTDSite-directed mutagenesis T1651AGTTTTACAGTTTCTGCTTATGCCGCGGCGGC Open table in a new tab Media, Chemicals, and Growth ConditionsâBacteria were usually grown at 37 Â°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 439Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added when required; ampicillin (100 or 50 Î¼gÂ·ml-1 for plasmid and chromosomal constructions, respectively), chloramphenicol (25 Î¼gÂ·ml-1), kanamycin (50 Î¼gÂ·ml-1), spectinomycin (50 Î¼gÂ·ml-1), and tetracycline (12 Î¼gÂ·ml-1). Cells of strain BL21(DE3)(pLysS) carrying pETuup (the wild-type uup gene cloned into pET15b) and pETuupÎCTD were grown in LB medium at 30 Â°C. Gene expression was induced by the addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl thio-Î²-d-galactoside (IPTG) at A600 = 0.2 for 3 h. Cells of strain BL21(DE3)(pLysS) harboring pETuup1, pETuup2, and pETuup3, respectively, were grown as described for wild-type pETuup, but gene expression was induced by 0.1 mm IPTG.Purification of His6-Uup and Its VariantsâAll purification protocols were carried out at 4 Â°C. Wild-type and mutant His6-Uup proteins were purified from cells of strain BL21(DE3)(pLysS) carrying the respective alleles on plasmid vector pET15b. After growth, cells were suspended in 20 ml of buffer TNA (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with one tablet of Roche Applied Science Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. Cell suspension was disrupted in an SLM Aminco FrenchÂ® pressure cell press (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 14,000 p.s.i., and the cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 Ã g. After removal of cell debris, cell extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h at 4Â°C, and His6-Uup and its variants were purified from the supernatants, supplemented with 5 mm imidazole on an Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen), as described in the supplier's handbook. The column was washed with 20 ml of TNA containing 40 mm imidazole, and proteins were eluted in 10 ml of TNA containing 250 mm imidazole, except for UupÎCTD, which was eluted at 1 m imidazole. 1-ml fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing recombinant proteins were pooled and extensively dialyzed against TNA in SlideALyser cassettes (Pierce, 30,000 Da). After concentration with a centrifugal filter (Amicon, 30,000-Da cutoff) to a final volume of 5 ml, proteins were applied onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column, equilibrated in the same buffer, and fitted on an ÎKTA device (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the protein samples was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Finally the fractions containing pure proteins were combined and concentrated. Protein concentration was colorimetrically determined by using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).ATPase AssayâHydrolysis of ATP was monitored by assaying the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated from ATP using NaH2PO4 as a standard as described previously (21Mourez M. Jehanno M. Schneider E. Dassa E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Standard reaction mixtures (250 Î¼l) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and purified protein (5-100 Î¼g). The reaction was started by adding ATP (0.25-2 mm) and terminated after various times by the addition of the Malachite Green reagent. Absorbance was measured at 630 nm. Vanadate inhibition was achieved by adding 0.01-10 mm orthovanadate prepared as described previously (22Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). N-Ethylmaleimide inhibition was achieved by adding 0.01-4 mm N-ethylmaleimide prepared in 100% ethanol.Limited Proteolysis by TrypsinâDigestion with trypsin was carried out as described previously (21Mourez M. Jehanno M. Schneider E. Dassa E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 20 Î¼g of purified His6-Uup were incubated at 0 Â°C in TNA buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 with and without 2 mm ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of trypsin (Uup:trypsin, 1:1, w/w). After 10-60 min of incubation, 15-Î¼l samples were withdrawn and mixed immediately with concentrated gel loading buffer. Digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue.Gel Mobility Shift DNA Binding AssayâDNA probes were generated by PCR, purified, and 3â²-end-labeled with phage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [Î³-32P]ATP (370 MBqÂ·ml-1). DNA binding experiments were performed in a buffer as described previously (23Bellier A. Mazodier P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3238-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 5-20 Î¼g of protein were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with [Î³-32P]ATP-labeled DNA (20,000 cpm) and 1 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC) (nonspecific competitor) in a final volume of 10 Î¼l. Samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried, analyzed by autoradiography, and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Complementation StudiesâDetection of precise excision of a mini-Tn10 inserted within the lacZ gene was done by a colony papillation assay on MacConkey lactose medium as described previously (9Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To study the ability of uup and its Walker motif B variants to complement a null mutant of uup, these genes were placed under the control of the araBAD promoter into vector pBAD18 (24Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3906) Google Scholar), and these constructs were introduced into the Î» prophage attB site of MG1655 by using the Î» InCh system (25Boyd D. Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The attB-inserted genes, whose expression was inducible by l-arabinose at a final concentration of 0.2%, were transduced in strain GJ1886, which carried a uup gene inactivated by the insertion of a defective Tn10 transposon (7Reddy M. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then the araBAD::aadA7 mutation was transduced from MG1655ÎaraBADÎlacIZ into these strains to avoid the effects of arabinose utilization on the phenotype of mutants on MacConkey lactose plates.Sequence AnalysisâSequence similarity searches were performed using PSI-BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar) on a non-redundant version of Swiss-Prot (178,545 sequences) using as query amino acids 511-635 of the E. coli uup sequence. The search was limited to iteration 3 due to the inclusion of nonspecific sequences in subsequent iterations. Results of iteration 3 only gathered ABC proteins and DNA polymerase Y little fingers. Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) was used to predict and compare secondary structures (27Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 28Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In the HCA plots, the sequence is written on a duplicated Î±-helical net in which hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Ile, Leu, Phe, Met, Tyr, and Trp) are contoured. These form clusters, which mainly correspond to regular secondary structures (Î±-helices and Î²-strands). Clusters often constitute robust signatures allowing an efficient comparison of related but divergent sequences.Miscellaneous MethodsâSubcellular fractionation, protein solubility tests, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (21Mourez M. Jehanno M. Schneider E. Dassa E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For raising antibodies directed against His6-Uup, two New Zealand White rabbits were immunized by intradermic injection of purified protein according to standard protocols. Antibodies were absorbed on total cellular extracts of strain DM1. Protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed by the Institut Pasteur Proteomic Facility. Protein identification by amino-terminal partial sequencing was performed by the Institut Pasteur Protein Analysis Facility on Applied Biosystems model 473 and 494 sequencers.RESULTSOverproduction and Purification of Recombinant His6-UupâTo optimize expression and solubility of recombinant Uup, 5-ml cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pLysS) cells harboring plasmid pETuup were grown at different temperature and induction conditions. As can be seen in Fig. 1 lane 5, 0.25 mm IPTG-induced cells synthesized a major protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa, that was absent in non-induced cells (lane 1) or in control cells harboring pET15b (data not shown). When induced cells were disrupted by sonication, 70% of the 72-kDa protein was found in the supernatant of the cell extract centrifuged at 20,000 Ã g (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7). The apparent molecular mass corresponds well with the data deduced from the nucleotide sequence of His6-Uup. Purification of His6-Uup was performed as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The soluble fraction of broken cells was purified on a nickel-chelating resin. Because few bands were visible on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel after the first purification step (Fig. 2A), a second purification step on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column was undertaken to improve purification and to estimate the native apparent molecular mass of the His6-Uup protein. The protein eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa (Fig. 2B). The same molecular mass was deduced from the migration of the protein on a Sephacryl S300 column (data not shown), indicating that the anomalous mass was not due to interactions with the matrix. Treatment of the protein sample with 50 units of DNase I prior to chromatography does not lead to a change in apparent molecular mass.FIGURE 2Purification of His6-Uup.

A minor band (highlighted by an asterisk) was shown to correspond to a degradation product of His6-Uup as determined by mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). The purification yield was 60 mgÂ·liter-1. The protein was used to raise specific antibodies and for biochemical characterization.Uup Is a Cytosolic ProteinâThe antibodies raised against purified recombinant Uup protein were used to detect a protein that is present in total extracts of MG1655 and absent in those of the uup deletion strain DM1 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, lane 1, a band of 69 kDa molecular mass is present only in total cell extracts of MG1655. We showed that Uup is detected from early exponential phase to stationary phase in similar amounts (data not shown). To determine the cellular location of Uup, equivalent volumes of membrane, ribosomal, and soluble fractions, prepared as described previously (21Mourez M. Jehanno M. Schneider E. Dassa E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), were probed by immunoblotting. No band was detected in membrane and ribosomal fractions; however, a strong signal corresponding to the Uup protein was detected in unbroken cells and debris and in soluble fractions (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 4), suggesting that Uup is a cytosolic protein. In the soluble fraction, two other bands were immunodetected, and their migration is similar to that of material detected in the uup deletion strain.FIGURE 3Subcellular localization of Uup by cell fractionation.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Particulate fractions were resuspended in the same volume as soluble extracts. Equivalent volumes of unbroken cells and debris (lane 1), membrane (lane 2), ribosomal (lane 3), and cytoplasmic (lane 4) fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblotting as described in A.

https://openalex.org/W2017049809,"Streptomyces griseus leucine aminopeptidase (SGAP), which has two zinc atoms in its active site, is clinically important as a model for understanding the structure and mechanism of action of other metallopeptidases. SGAP is a calcium-activated and calcium-stabilized enzyme, and its activation by calcium correlates with substrate specificity. In our previous study, we found a non-calcium-modulated leucine aminopeptidase secreted by Streptomyces septatus, the primary structure of which showed 71% identity with SGAP. In this study, we constructed chimeras of SGAP and S. septatus aminopeptidase by using an in vivo DNA shuffling system and several mutant enzymes by site-directed mutagenesis to identify the key residues in this modulation by calcium. We identified the key residues Asp-173 and Asp-174 of SGAP associated with both SGAP activation and stabilization by calcium. We also showed that the known calcium-binding site, which is composed of Asp-3, Ile-4, Asp-262, and Asp-266 of SGAP, only contributes to SGAP stabilization by calcium. Furthermore, we identified an important residue, Glu-196, that functions in cooperation with Asp-173, Asp-174, and calcium to increase the catalytic activity of SGAP."
https://openalex.org/W2022479918,"Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) replaces the G in position 34 of tRNA with preQ1, the precursor to the modified nucleoside queuosine. Archaeal TGT, in contrast, substitutes preQ0 for the G in position 15 of tRNA as the first step in archaeosine formation. The archaeal enzyme is about 60% larger than the bacterial protein; a carboxyl-terminal extension of 230 amino acids contains the PUA domain known to contact the four 3â²-terminal nucleotides of tRNA. Here we show that the C-terminal extension of the enzyme is not required for the selection of G15 as the site of base exchange; truncated forms of Pyrococcus furiosus TGT retain their specificity for guanine exchange at position 15. Deletion of the PUA domain causes a 4-fold drop in the observed kcat (2.8 Ã 10â3 sâ1) and results in a 75-fold increased Km for tRNAAsp(1.2 Ã 10â5 m) compared with full-length TGT. Mutations in tRNAAsp altering or abolishing interactions with the PUA domain can compete with wild-type tRNAAsp for binding to full-length and truncated TGT enzymes. Whereas the C-terminal domains do not appear to play a role in selection of the modification site, their relevance for enzyme function and their role in vivo remains to be discovered. Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) replaces the G in position 34 of tRNA with preQ1, the precursor to the modified nucleoside queuosine. Archaeal TGT, in contrast, substitutes preQ0 for the G in position 15 of tRNA as the first step in archaeosine formation. The archaeal enzyme is about 60% larger than the bacterial protein; a carboxyl-terminal extension of 230 amino acids contains the PUA domain known to contact the four 3â²-terminal nucleotides of tRNA. Here we show that the C-terminal extension of the enzyme is not required for the selection of G15 as the site of base exchange; truncated forms of Pyrococcus furiosus TGT retain their specificity for guanine exchange at position 15. Deletion of the PUA domain causes a 4-fold drop in the observed kcat (2.8 Ã 10â3 sâ1) and results in a 75-fold increased Km for tRNAAsp(1.2 Ã 10â5 m) compared with full-length TGT.

Whereas the C-terminal domains do not appear to play a role in selection of the modification site, their relevance for enzyme function and their role in vivo remains to be discovered. Transfer RNA from all three kingdoms of life contains a unique series of highly modified nucleosides derived from 7-deazaguanine (1Grosjean H. BjoÌrk G.R. Trends Biochem.

In eukaryotes and bacteria, the modified nucleoside queuosine (Q) 2The abbreviations used are: Q, queuosine; ArcTGT, archaeosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase; ORF, open reading frame; preQ0, 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine; preQ1, 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine; QueTGT, queuosine tRNA-guanine transglycosylase; TGT, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase.

The replacement of G by Q in the first anticodon position affects tRNA efficiency in codon recognition during translation (4Meier F. Suter B. Grosjean H. Keith G. Kubli E.

The 7-deazaguanine derivative, archaeosine (Fig. 1), is found at position 15 in most archaeal tRNAs (6Gupta R. J. Biol.

Westhof E. SoÌll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 93-126Google Scholar). Archaeosine at this position may therefore strengthen this tertiary interaction and further stabilize the overall tRNA structure. The biosynthesis of these hypermodified 7-deazaguanine derivatives begins with GTP and requires the action of several enzymes only recently uncovered (10Reader J.S. Metzgar D.

Through the action of the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) enzyme, guanine is replaced with a 7-deazaguanine precursor, forming preQ0 at position 15 in archaeal or preQ1 at position 34 in bacterial tRNAs (Fig. 1). Once incorporated into the tRNA, these precursors are further modified by additional enzymes to form the mature archaeosine or queuosine bases. Only one of the enzymes acting downstream of TGT in the bacterial pathway has been identified to date (12Slany R.K. Bosl M. Crain P.F. Kersten H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and its crystal structure was recently solved (13Mathews I. Schwarzenbacher R. McMullan D. Abdubek P. Ambing E.

The TGT enzyme in the bacterial pathway to Q formation (QueTGT) requires its substrate G34 to be flanked by U in positions 33 (conserved in all tRNAs) and 35 (the second base of the anticodon) (23Curnow A.W.

In contrast to QueTGT, which requires three nucleotides for proper tRNA recognition, the P. horikoshii enzyme was shown to need only G15 as a tRNA identity element (28Watanabe M. Nameki N. Matsuo-Takasaki M. Nishimura S. Okada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2387-2394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most archaeal tRNA genes known to date contain G15 (7Sprinzl M. Vassilenko K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D139-D140Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 29Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (8312) Google Scholar), and half of the archaeal tRNAs whose post-transcriptional modifications have been determined contain archaeosine at this position (6Gupta R.

The archaeal and bacterial TGTs differ in size and domain architecture. QueTGT is only 61% of the archaeal enzyme's size, due to the addition of three small domains to the C terminus of the ArcTGT catalytic core (Fig. 2A, C1âC3). The structure of the ArcTGT catalytic domain is superimposable upon that of QueTGT from Zymomonas mobilis with a main chain root mean square deviation of â¼1.4 AÌ (30Romier C. Meyer J.E. Suck D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C3 domain, proximal to the ArcTGT carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2A), was identified as a potential RNA binding domain based on sequence analysis (31Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This domain is present in TGT proteins from all branches of the archaeal domain; it was named PUA due to its occurrence in several pseudouridine synthases and archaeosine-tRNA transglycosylases. An interesting subclass of split TGTs is found in the genomes of at least 11 archaeal organisms including Methanosarcina barkeri. This form is encoded by two distinct ORFs, with the âsplitâ always occurring between domains C1 and C2 (Fig. 2A; split ArcTGT). It was suggested that the ability of the archaeal TGT enzymes to recognize a modification site in the tRNA different from their bacterial counterparts might be attributed to the presence of the C-terminal domains of ArcTGT (Fig. 2A) (30Romier C. Meyer J.E. Suck D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Ishitani R. Nureki O. Fukai S. Kijimoto T. Nameki N. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Sekine M. Okada N. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of P. horikoshii TGT complexed to unmodified tRNAVal (33Ishitani R. Nureki O. Nameki N. Okada N. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2003; 113: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) revealed the tRNA in an alternate structure (termed the Î»-form). In this form, the tRNA D-loop is extremely distorted, and base pairing along the entire D-stem is disrupted. As a consequence, the normally buried G15 is exposed, and the rearranged D-loop and stem are bound primarily by the catalytic core of the enzyme, whereas canonical structures of the acceptor stem, T-arm, and anticodon arm remain largely intact. Based on this structure, a model for the modification site selection of ArcTGT was proposed that necessitates the use of the C-terminal extension and PUA domain to anchor the acceptor stem of the tRNA (33Ishitani R. Nureki O. Nameki N. Okada N. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2003; 113: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). With one end anchored, the enzyme would then be able to bind the Î»-form, allowing the positioning of G15 into the active site due simply to its nucleotide distance from the 5â²-end of the tRNA chain. Whereas this model provides a compelling explanation for the ability of ArcTGT to recognize G15 in tRNAs with an apparent lack of sequence requirements (28Watanabe M. Nameki N. Matsuo-Takasaki M. Nishimura S. Okada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2387-2394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), there is little experimental evidence to support the contributions made by the C terminus. Here we show that the entire C-terminal extension (C1, C2, and C3), including the PUA domain, is dispensable for P. furiosus TGT activity and for proper modification at G15. Thus, the ArcTGT catalytic core, like its bacterial homolog, is sufficient to effectively target a specific site in the tRNA for modification. GeneralâOligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were carried out by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Research Laboratory at Yale University. [8-14C]Guanine hydrochloride (50 mmol/Î¼Ci) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and [Î±-32P]ATP (10 mmol/Î¼Ci) was from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and T7 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Escherichia coli strains JE7350 (Q-deficient) (34Noguchi S. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6544-6550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DH5Î± harboring pTGT5 for overexpression of the E. coli TGT enzyme were generous gifts from G. A. Garcia (University of Michigan). P. furiosus genomic DNA was courtesy of K. O. Stetter. E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIL was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). CloningâThe gene encoding the P. furiosus TGT (PF1046) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using the Expand Hi Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). Restriction sites for NcoI and XhoI were introduced at the 5â²- and 3â²-ends of the gene, respectively, and the terminal stop codon was deleted, to allow translation of the His6 tag present in the recipient vector, pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The primers used include the forward primer PFCA3FW (5â²-CATGCCATGGGCATGCTAAGATTTGAAATAAAGGAC-3â²) and reverse primer PFCA3RV (5â²-GGGATCCTCGAGCTTTTTCTCCTCTACA-C-3â²). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI overnight. The digested fragment was then ligated into pET28a previously digested with NcoI/XhoI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The sequence of the gene was verified, and the resulting plasmid, pJSPFCA3, was transformed into BL21(DE3) RIL for overexpression. The truncations of the P. furiosus gene were PCR-amplified as above using pJSPFCA3 as the template. The positions at which the protein was truncated were chosen to be in looped regions separating defined domains. This was based on sequence conservation among archaeal TGT enzymes as well as the existing structural data for the P. horikoshii enzyme (32Ishitani R. Nureki O. Fukai S. Kijimoto T. Nameki N. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Sekine M. Okada N. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with which P. furiosus TGT shares 93% amino acid similarity. The corresponding DNA sequences were amplified using the forward primer (5â²-GGAATTCCATATGCTAAGATTTGAAATAAAGGAC-3â²) that hybridizes to the same sequence as PFCA3FW above but introduces an NdeI site into the 5â²-end of the gene. The reverse primers used to determine the end point of the sequence amplified are as follows: amino acids 1â506, 5â²-CGGGATCCTCGAGTTATGGATATGGGAGAGTTCGT-3â²; amino acids 1â424, 5â²-CGGGTCTCGAGTTAGTCTTCCTCACTCTCGCTTT-3â²; amino acids 1â363, 5â²-CGGGATCCTCGAGTTAAGTTATTGGTTCGTATTCCT-3â². Each reverse primer introduced an in-frame stop codon to terminate translation after the position indicated as well as an XhoI cut site. PCR products were gel-purified, digested with NdeI/XhoI, and further processed as described above. Each fragment was then ligated into pET15b (Novagen), which was previously digested with NdeI/XhoI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The sequence of the resulting plasmids were verified and transformed into the BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIL for overexpression. The free PUA domain (Fig. 2, domain C3) was cloned by PCR amplification using the plasmid pJSPFCA3 as the template. The forward primer (5â²-CATGCCATGGGCATGAGAGTTGTGGTTAATAAGGAA-3â²) along with PFCA3RV (see above) were used to amplify the sequence corresponding to amino acids 508â585, which was cloned as described above into pET28a. The M. barkeri MS ORFs encoding TGT were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using primers designed against the M. barkeri fusaro sequence (accession number NZ_AAAR02000001). The ORFs encoding the N-terminal fragment (accession number ZP_00296567; annotated as queuosine/archaeosine tRNA-ribosyltransferase) as well as the C-terminal fragment (accession number ZP_00297604; annotated as a member of the family of molecular chaperones implicated in de novo protein folding) in the M. barkeri fusaro genome were identified as most similar to the split TGT genes of Nanoarchaeum equitans (35Waters E.

The forward primer (5â²-GGGAATTCCATATGTCAGCAATATTCGAAAT-3â²) and the reverse primer (5â²-CGGGATCCTCGAGTTATTCTTTTTTCCATCTT-3â²) were used to amplify the N-terminal portion, whereas the forward (5â²-GGGAATCCATATGAATAATGATACCGAAG-3â²) and reverse (5â²-CGGGATCCTCGAGCTTTTCTTTTTTCGAAGCTA-3â²) primers were used to amplify the C-terminal peptide containing the PUA domain. The PCR product corresponding to the N-terminal peptide was cloned into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET15b, resulting in the addition of a His6 tag on the N terminus. The PCR product corresponding to the C-terminal peptide was cloned into pET20b after digestion with NdeI and XhoI. This construct appends a His6 tag to the C terminus of the protein. The sequence of each fragment was compared with that published from M. barkeri fusaro strain. Only 73 and 33 base changes, resulting in 7 and 8 amino acid changes, were noted for the coding sequence of the N- and C-terminal peptides, respectively. The sequence of the N-terminal (accession number DQ104433) and C-terminal (accession number DQ104434) portions of this TGT have been deposited in GenBankâ¢. Overexpression and PurificationâThe E. coli TGT was overexpressed in DH5Î± harboring the pTGT5 vector and purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography on a Hi-Trap Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described (36Garcia G.A. Koch K.A. Chong S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of cells harboring plasmid pJSPFCA3 expressing a C-terminally His6-tagged full-length P. furiosus TGT were diluted 20-fold into Luria broth containing 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin and 34 Î¼g/ml chloramphenicol. Cultures were shaken (250 rpm) at 37 Â°C until reaching A600 = 1. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside, and the ampicillin level was refreshed to 100 Î¼g/ml. Induction was allowed to continue for 3 h, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2700 Ã g for 15 min and then stored at â80 Â°C. The frozen pellets were thawed on ice for 30 min and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme was then added to 1 mg/ml. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cell suspension was sonicated (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) five times for 30 s each at 50% duty cycle, 60% output. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 Ã g for 90 min. The entire protein extract was incubated at 60 Â°C for 30 min, and the flocculated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 8000 Ã g for 5 min. To the supernatant, imidazole was added to 10 mm as well as 1 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose slurry (50% ethanol, 50% matrix). The subsequent purification steps were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell growth, overexpression, lysate preparation, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification of the free PUA domain, the N-terminally His6-tagged, truncated P. furiosus enzymes, and the N-terminal peptide of the M. barkeri enzyme was performed as described above. The mutant enzymes, however, precipitate during flocculation; thus, this step was omitted. Growth of the strain overexpressing the C-terminal portion of M. barkeri TGT was carried out as described with the following alterations. Upon reaching A600 â¼1, ethanol was added to a final content of 2% (w/v), and the cell culture was shifted from 37 to 15 Â°C and allowed to acclimate for 10 min. After this incubation, protein production was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside, and the ampicillin was refreshed as outlined above. The cultures were incubated for an additional 6 h at 15 Â°C before the cells were harvested. The remaining steps were performed identically to those described above for the truncated enzymes. Mutant enzymes used in kinetic analyses were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose (5 ml) column (Amersham Biosciences). Before being loaded onto the column, the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified samples were diluted 10-fold into start buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol); proteins were eluted with a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. The majority of the active enzyme was found in the flow-through, which was concentrated and dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. The sample was subsequently loaded onto a MonoS HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The TGT enzyme was eluted with a gradient of 0â1 m NaCl in the start buffer. The resulting protein was >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Enzyme-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol and stored at 4 Â°C. The fraction of active molecules in each sample of truncated TGT was estimated based on RNA binding ability using a filter-binding assay carried out under conditions described below. In this assay, a constant concentration of each mutant protein (15 Î¼m) measured by the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) was incubated with increasing concentrations of tRNAAsp transcripts (up to 20 Î¼m) isotopically labeled by the addition of 32P-labeled tRNAAsp. The fraction of protein bound to tRNA at saturation was normalized against that for the full-length enzyme (data not shown) and used to correct the protein concentration obtained by Bradford assay for the presence of inactive protein in the sample. Preparation of Unfractionated Q-deficient tRNAâUnfractionated tRNA lacking the Q base (34Noguchi S. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Nishimura S. J. Biol.

The resulting tRNA could be modified to a level representing 40 and 10% of the total tRNA by the wild-type P. furiosus and E. coli TGTs, respectively (data not shown). In Vitro Transcription and Purification of E. coli tRNAAspâConstruction of the plasmid containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter upstream of the sequence for E. coli tRNAAsp has been described previously (22Salazar J.C.

The correct end for run off transcription with T7 RNA polymerase was generated by digestion with BstNI overnight at 55 Â°C, and the tRNA gene was transcribed according to published procedures (40Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The tRNA transcripts were purified from the reaction mixture by anion exchange chromatography essentially as described (41Jahn M.J. Jahn D. Kumar A.M. SoÌll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using an Amersham Biosciences Îkta FPLC system and MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing full-length tRNA were pooled, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in water. On average, transcripts prepared in this manner could be modified, using the activity assay described below, to levels reaching 90â95% of the predicted maximum based on absorbance at 260 nm (data not shown). The in vitro transcription cassette for E. coli tRNAAsp lacking the 3â² bases 73â76 comprising G73 at the discriminator base position and the 5â²-C74C75A76-3â² end (Fig. 4; ÎGCCA) was constructed by annealing two DNA oligonucleotides (5â²-GATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGCGGTAGTTCAGTCGGTTAGAATACCTGCCTGTCACGCAGGGGGTCGCGGGTTCGAGTCCCGTCCGTTCCGTTTAAACTCATCCA-3â² and 5â²-AGCTTGGATGAGTTTAAACGGAACGGACGGGACTCGAACCCGCGACCCCCTGCGTGACAGGCAGGTATTCTAACCGACTGAACTACCGCTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAG-3â²) containing the tRNA gene and a downstream FokI recognition site (underlined) positioned to allow cleavage of the template strand immediately 5â² to the template base for C72 (boldface type). The annealed duplex DNA was directly ligated into pUC19 digested with BamHI/HindIII. The ligated plasmid was transformed into DH5Î± for amplification, and the sequence was verified. In order to generate the proper 3â²-end of the template, prior to run-off transcription, the plasmid was digested overnight at 37 Â°C using FokI. Subsequent steps were identical to those described above. Two additional transcription cassettes were constructed as above, having altered tRNAAsp sequences (Fig. 4): (i) G15A, G to A mutation at position 15; (ii) 5PBP, G to C mutation at position 73, deletion of 5â²-C74C75A76-3â², and addition of a single G to the 5â²-end (position â1), resulting in the addition of a G:C base pair between Gâ1 and C73 to the top of the acceptor stem.

Incorporation of [14C]guanine was measured in reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The tRNA substrates and NaCl were present at concentrations noted in the text. For determination of kinetic parameters, initial velocities were measured in duplicate at seven concentrations of tRNA transcripts and a constant enzyme concentration of 10 nm over the course of 15 and 45 min for full-length P. furiosus TGT, 10 nm and 90 min for E. coli TGT, and 50 nm and 15 and 25 min for the ÎPUA enzyme. Unless otherwise noted, [14C]guanine was present at 15 Î¼m, and reactions were carried out at 65 Â°C for P. furiosus full-length and truncated enzymes and 37 Â°C for E. coli TGT. Kinetic parameters were calculated using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) by nonlinear regression of plots of initial velocity versus tRNA concentration and are reported in Table 2. Each reaction was started by the addition of enzyme, and a thin layer of mineral oil was added to prevent evaporation over the course of the experiment. Aliquots of 15 t"

In a key step, the activated Î±-subunit of transducin (GÎ±t-GTP) activates the cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by binding the inhibitory Î³-subunit (PDEÎ³). Significant progress in understanding the interaction between GÎ±t and PDEÎ³ was achieved by solving the crystal structure of the PDEÎ³ C-terminal peptide bound to GÎ±t in the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (Slep, K.

However, some of the structural elements of each molecule were absent in the crystal structure. We have probed the binding surface between the PDEÎ³ C terminus and activated GÎ±t bound to guanosine 5â²-O-(3-thio)-triphosphate (GTPÎ³S) using a series of full-length PDEÎ³ photoprobes generated by intein-mediated expressed protein ligation. For each of seven PDEÎ³ photoprobe species, expressed protein ligation allowed one benzoyl-l-phenylalaine substitution at selected hydrophobic C-terminal positions, and the addition of a biotin affinity tag at the extreme C terminus. We have detected photocross-linking from several PDEÎ³ C-terminal positions to the GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S N terminus, particularly from PDEÎ³ residue 73. The overall percentage of cross-linking to the GÎ±t-GTPÎ³SN terminus was analyzed using a far Western method for examining GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S proteolytic digestion patterns.

For example, x-ray analysis of the complex formed between the PDEÎ³ C terminus, GÎ±t, and the catalytic domain of the ninth member of the regulator of G-protein signaling family (RGS9), required prior removal of the GÎ±t N terminus (1Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the N terminus was present in the x-ray structure of the transducin GÎ±Î²Î³t heterotrimer (4Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) where it adopts an extended Î±-helix participating in extensive contacts with transducin Î²-subunit. This interaction, called the N-terminal interface, contributes roughly one-third of the total binding energy of GÎ±t-GDP toward the Î²-subunit (4Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The photocross-linking study reported here extends the role of the GÎ±t N terminus to interactions with PDEÎ³, suggesting a possible regulatory role for the G-protein N terminus in interactions with effectors. The extreme GÎ±t N terminus is myristoylated (5Neubert T.A. Johnson R.S. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18274-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Neubert T.A.

Compared with other G-protein Î±-subunits that are also palmitoylated, GÎ±t is uniquely soluble in low-salt buffers or cell cytosol-like buffers, and translocates to the lipid membrane only when in the transition state or its AlF4- analog (8Kuhn H.

Although the precise mechanism is not fully understood, intramolecular binding sites for the GÎ±t N terminus and its myristoyl group have been proposed (15Medkova M. Preininger A.M. Yu N.-J.

In this work, we demonstrate that the GÎ±t N terminus also makes contact with the C terminus of PDEÎ³. PDEÎ³ maintains nanomolar binding affinity to activated GÎ±t through two discrete regions. The central portion (residues 24â46) and the C-terminal region (residues 46â87) each contribute roughly half of the binding energy toward transducin (17Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PDEÎ³ C-terminal region also modulates GTPase-activating protein affinity toward transducin, primarily through the action of seven hydrophobic residues (18Slepak V.Z. Artemyev N.O. Zhu Y.

The PDEÎ³ C terminus interacts primarily with the Î±3 helix and conserved switch regions (1Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B.

It is also thought that key conformational changes in PDEÎ³ residue Leu-76 and surrounding residues, initiated by GÎ±t binding, may displace the PDEÎ³ C-terminal domain from the PÎ±Î² catalytic site (20Granovsky A.E.

In the x-ray crystal structure of the RGS9 bound model of PDEÎ³/GÎ±tÂ·AlF4- interactions, a peptide PDEÎ³-(50â87) interacts primarily with the Î±3 helix of GÎ±tÂ·AlF4-, a binding surface also detected by a peptide truncation study (21Skiba N.P.

In this crystal structure information concerning the GÎ±t N terminus or the myristoyl modification was not available. Fluorescence anisotropy and electron spin resonance measurements of the inhibitory G-protein Î±-subunit, GÎ±i, revealed that the conformation of the N terminus is dynamic (15Medkova M.

Considering the high homology and structural similarity of GÎ±i to GÎ±t (23Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) it is plausible to speculate that the local structure of the GÎ±t N terminus is also modulated by activation. Perhaps a âmeltedâ GÎ±t N terminus may interact with PDEÎ³. We have employed a library of intein-derived, full-length PDEÎ³ benzophenone photoprobes, generated by expressed protein ligation (24Evans Jr., T.C. Benner J. Xu M.Q. J. Biol.

Biotin/streptavidin far Western blot analysis revealed that the W70Z, F73Z, and L81Z and I86Z photoprobes demonstrated significant levels of photoinsertion into the GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S N terminus. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of cross-linked peptide fragments localized cross-linking from PDEÎ³ I86Z to GÎ±t N-terminal residues GÎ±t-(22â26). MaterialsâThe IMPACT expressed protein ligation kit and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin and plasmid purification kits were acquired from Qiagen. Endoproteinase Lys-C (endo Lys-C), endoproteinase Glu-C (endo Glu-C), GTPÎ³S, GDP, 4-(N-maleimido)-benzophenone (MBP), trifluoroacetic acid, NÏµ-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased from Sigma. POROS R2 resin was purchased from Applied Biosystems. All remaining chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific. MutagenesisâPCR was used to amplify the PDEÎ³-(1â61) cDNA from a bovine retinal rod PDEÎ³ cDNA (28Brown R.L. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4922-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), using forward (5â²-CATATGCATATGAACCTCGAGC-3â²) and reverse (5â²-TGCTCTTCCGCAGATAACGGTGATGTCG-3â²) primers compatible with intein ligation. The amplified DNA was then subcloned into the unique SmaI site of pBlueBac. The fragment was excised with NdeI and SapI, then ligated into the intein pTXBI vector (New England Biolabs). Escherchia coli XL1 Blue cells were transformed with the PDEÎ³-(1â61)/intein pTXBI vector. Plasmid DNA was purified from individual colonies and screened by digestion with XbaI and BamHI. Positive clones were further verified by DNA sequencing. A hexylhistidine (His6) affinity motif was added to the PDEÎ³ N terminus using forward (CATATGCACCATCACCATCACCATATG) and reverse (GTATACGTGGTAGTGGTAGTGGTATAC) primers. Positive colonies were identified by sequencing. The vector containing His6-tagged PDEÎ³-(1â61) intein fusion protein cDNA was then transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Synthesis of C-terminal PDEÎ³ PeptidesâThe PDEÎ³ C-terminal peptides and the rhodopsin (Rh) 3rd intracellular loop peptide VKEAAAQQQESATTQKAEKEVTR, residues 230â252, were synthesized (25 Î¼mol scale) by standard Fmoc chemistry (29Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2153Crossref Scopus (6751) Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems Synergy 432A peptide synthesizer at the University of Wisconsin Peptide Synthesis Center. The seven PDEÎ³-(62â87ZXG) C-terminal synthetic peptides were created based on the PDEÎ³ C-terminal sequence CDITVIAPWEAFNHLELHELAQYGIIXG, where the appropriate benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Z) and biotinyl-lysine/glycine (XG) substitutions were incorporated using the Fmoc derivatives of benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bachem) and biotin-l-lysine (Anaspec). The N-terminal residue of each peptide was cysteine to accommodate the intein ligation chemistry, and an additional C68A replacement was made to minimize disulfide formation. The C-terminal peptides were deprotected with 0.3 m dithiothreitol in 90% trifluoroacetic acid, precipitated three times in tert-butyl-methyl-ether, resuspended in H2O, and lyophilized. The sequence and molecular mass of each PDEÎ³ C-terminal peptide is reported as follows: CDITZIAPWEAFNHLELHELAQYGIIXG (V66Z, [M + H]+ 3557.4), CDITVIAPZEAFNHLELHELAQYGIIXG (W70Z, [M + H]+ 3470.2), CDITVIAPWEAZNHLELHELAQYGIIXG (F73Z, [M + H]+ 3510.1), CDITVIAPWEAFNHZELHELAQYGIIXG (L76Z, [M + H]+ 3543.2), CDITVIAPWEAFNHLEZHELAQYGIIXG (L78Z, [M + H]+ 3545.5), CDITVIAPWEAFNHLELHEZAQYGIIXG (L81Z, [M + H]+ 3543.7), CDITVIAPWEAFNHLELHELAQYGZIXG (I86Z, [M + H]+ 3543.0). Intein-mediated Synthesis and Purification of PDEÎ³ PhotoprobesâThe PDEÎ³-(1â61)/intein fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli by standard methods, and purified by the method of Evans (24Evans Jr., T.C. Benner J. Xu M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3923-3926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After cell lysis by sonication, the PDEÎ³-(1â61)/intein construct was incubated overnight with chitin beads (10 ml/liter of cell extract) at 4 Â°C, in the presence of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0). Bead-bound PDEÎ³ (1â61) was washed with 10 volumes of high-salt buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0), followed by 10-ml of low-salt buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Bead-bound PDEÎ³-(1â61) was transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube and then eluted with an equal volume of 0.5 m Î²-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid in low-salt buffer. The activated intermediate PDEÎ³-(1â61)/Î²-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid was aliquoted, and frozen at â80 Â°C until use. Preparations were stable for up to 1 month. To initiate intein ligation, 1 mg of C-terminal PDEÎ³ peptide was solubilized in 50 Î¼l of Me2SO, then added to a 2-ml aliquot of PDEÎ³-(1â61)/Î²-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid eluate. The expressed protein ligation mixture was then incubated for 24 h at room temperature (22â24 Â°C). The resultant full-length PDEÎ³ photoprobes were purified over Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) in the presence of a urea-containing column wash buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 8 m urea, 20 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). After washing with 10 column volumes of wash buffer, photoprobes were eluted in batch using low pH imidazole buffer (100 mm NaOAc, 250 mm imidazole, 8 m urea, 20 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, pH 4.0). Full-length photoprobes were purified from excess PDEÎ³-(1â61) by HPLC on a self-packed POROS R2 column, utilizing an acetonitrile gradient from 10â50% over 40 min, in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The PDEÎ³ concentration was determined by the Bradford/Lowry method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 62: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and also by the level of Coomassie staining when analyzed using SDS-PAGE gels. The full-length PDEÎ³ photoprobe was lyophilized on a speed vacuum centrifuge (Savant) and stored at â80 Â°C. Mass spectrometric measurement by MALDI-TOF MS identified molecular masses consistent with those of appropriately modified full-length photoprobes, as determined using the Protein Prospector software (31Clauser K.R. Baker P.R. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). These data, reported as [M + H]+ are as follows: V66Z, 11,130.5 (calculated 11,132); W70Z, 11,179.5 (calculated 11,180); F73Z, 11,129.4 (Na+ salt, calculated 11128); L76Z, 11,140.8 (calculated 11,140); L78Z, 11,137.4 (calculated 11,140); L81Z, 11,138.2 (calculated 11,140); and I86Z, 11,137.5 (calculated 11,140). Preparation of Maleimido-benzophenone PDEÎ³ PhotoprobesâThe F73C and I87C PDEÎ³ polypeptides with a C68A mutation were prepared as described previously (32Guo L.-W. Grant J.E. Hajipour A.R. Muradov H. Arbabian M. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12585-12592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The MBP derivative was prepared as described for PDEÎ³ peptides (33Artemyev N.O. Mills J.S. Thornberg K.R. Knapp D.R. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23611-23615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The appropriate PDEÎ³ polypeptide was treated with a 15-fold excess of 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone, in the presence of 40 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.7, 10 mm EDTA, and 40% ACN). The polypeptide photoprobe was purified over a self-packed POROS R2 column, which eluted at â¼37% acetonitrile when chromatographed at 0.7%/min, with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purification of GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S and GÎ±t-(26â350)-GTPÎ³SâRod outer segment membranes were purified from dark-adapted frozen retinas (W. L. Lawson Co). Both the GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S and GÎ²Î³t subunits were released from the purified rod outer segment membranes then purified over a Blue Sepharose CL-6B column by standard methods (34Ting T.D. Goldin S.B. Ho Y.-K. Methods Neurocsi. 1993; 15: 180-195Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purity of GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S was assessed by SDS-PAGE. To generate GÎ±t-(26â350)-GTPÎ³S, GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S was first treated with endo Lys-C with 1:100 (w/w, enzyme:protein) for 18 h, and GÎ±t-(26â350)-GTPÎ³S was isolated over Blue Sepharose as described for intact GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S. Recombinant RGS9/GÎ²5 for use in GTPase turnover measurements was obtained by published procedures (35Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GTPase AssaysâThe ability of each PDEÎ³ photoprobe species to stimulate the RGS9-catalyzed GTPase activity of GÎ±t was measured using the single turnover approach (36Martemyanov K.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assays were conducted at room temperature (22â24 Â°C) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2. Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes, lacking endogenous RGS9 activity, were used as a source for the photoexcited rhodopsin required for transducin activation. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 10-Î¼l of 0.6 Î¼m [32P]GTP (â¼105 disintegrations/min/sample) to 20 Î¼l of urea-treated rod outer segments membranes (20 Î¼m final rhodopsin concentration) reconstituted with transducin heterotrimer (1 Î¼m) and recombinant RGS9-GÎ²5 complex (0.5 Î¼m). The reactions were performed either in the absence or presence of PDEÎ³ derivatives (1 Î¼m). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 Î¼l of 6% perchloric acid, then 32Pi formation was measured with activated charcoal as described (37Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photocross-linking of PDEÎ³ Benzophenone Photoprobes to GÎ±t-GTPÎ³SâTo initiate photocross-linking experiments, 20 Î¼g of PDEÎ³ photoprobe was incubated with 100 Î¼g of GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S for 20 min at room temperature. The total reaction volume was 200 Î¼l in cross-linking buffer comprised of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2. Samples were irradiated with 350 nm of UV light in 10-min increments for a total of 30 min in a Rayonet UV irradiator (Southern New England Ultraviolet Company, CT), at 4 Â°C. The percentage of PDEÎ³ photoinsertion into GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S, relative to the total quantity of GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S present in each cross-linking reaction, was determined from Coomassie-stained gels by measuring the intensity of both the cross-linked and unreacted GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S. Because PDEÎ³ stains poorly on the 15% SDS-PAGE gels relative to GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S, no adjustment was necessary to account for the PDEÎ³ content in the cross-linked bands. Endo Lys-C Digestion of PDEÎ³/GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S Cross-links and Far Western AnalysisâLimited digestion experiments were performed as described previously with minor modifications (26Fung B.K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 503-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endo Lys-C digestion of cross-links, which removes the transducin N terminus selectively and the N-terminal half of PDEÎ³, was performed for 18 h at room temperature (1:100, w/w, enzyme:total protein). Aliquots (2 or 5 Î¼l) were electrophoresed on duplicate 15% SDS-PAGE minigels (Hoefer). Protein bands were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described under âAnalytical Methods.â The extent of PDEÎ³ photoprobe cross-linking to the GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S protein core (âinternal XLâ) was determined by first measuring the relative level of biotin-positive signal representing intact, cross-linked PDEÎ³/GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S species (50 kDa) prior to limited digestion, here termed âtotal XL.â Limited endo Lys-C removes cross-links from PDEÎ³ to the GÎ±t N terminus, leaving only unreacted GÎ±t at 36 kDa and/or PDEÎ³-cross-linked GÎ±t-(26â350)-GTPÎ³S at 41 kDa. The cross-linked band at 41 kDa reflects proteolytic removal of the PDEÎ³ N-terminal half as well as the GÎ±t N terminus. The relative level of biotin-positive signal remaining associated with the 41-kDa band, representing cross-links to GÎ±t-(26â350)-GTPÎ³S, is denoted as internal XL. The ratio of internal cross-linking to total cross-linking was defined as percent of internal cross-linking. The percent photoinsertion into the GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S N terminus (N-terminal XL) was inversely proportional to the degree of internal photoinsertion. Endo Glu-C Digestion of PDEÎ³/GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S Cross-links and HPLC Purification of FragmentsâAfter cross-linking was performed, the unpurified reaction products were treated directly with endo Glu-C protease at a ratio of 1:20, w/w, enzyme:protein. The digest mixture was allowed to incubate 18 h at room temperature, quenched with 100 Î¼m TLCK, and frozen at â80 Â°C. Protein fragments were purified by HPLC over a POROS R2 column, utilizing a steep gradient from 10 to 90% ACN over 20 min. Individual 1-ml fractions were collected, frozen, and dried by vacuum centrifugation. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of Cross-linking ReactionsâIndividual, lyophilized HPLC fractions subjected to the endo Glu-C digestion procedure were resuspended in 5-Î¼l of a solution of 20% ACN. A 0.5-Î¼l aliquot of each fraction was spotted onto an individual well on the MALDI target. To this, 0.5-Î¼l of saturated Î±-cyano-4â²-hydroxylcinnamic acid matrix solution (70% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was added. Samples were analyzed on a Bruker REFLEX II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Billerica, MA) using a 337-nm N2 laser and both positive reflectron and positive linear modes. All spectra (at least 50 shots) were calibrated with an appropriate combination of mass standards including bradykinin (1,060.6), neurotensin (1,672.9), insulin (5,734.6) and cytochrome c (12,360). Analytical MethodsâSDS-PAGE (15%) was performed as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and Tricine SDS-PAGE (16.5%) was performed by the method of Schagger and von Jagow (39Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Protein molecular weight standards from Sigma and prestained standards from Bio-Rad were used to approximate molecular weight. The homogeneity of PDEÎ³ photoprobe preparations was assessed using 16.5% Tricine gels, and all other experiments were performed with 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Protein bands were transferred to 0.2-Î¼m nitrocellulose (Pierce) and subjected to far Western analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection of biotin was performed using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagents obtained from Pierce. Densitometric measurements of Coomassie-stained gel bands and of far Western blots were acquired with a HP ScanJet laser scanner and quantified with NIH Image. Characterization of PDEÎ³ PhotoprobesâAll seven full-length PDEÎ³ photoprobes (Fig. 1A) were purified to homogeneity. The progress of the two-step purification by Ni-NTA chromatography, followed by HPLC, is illustrated for the I86Z photoprobe (Fig. 1, B and C). Purified photoprobe preparations were homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1D, lane 1). Analysis of two PDEÎ³-based standards (Fig. 1D, lane 2) demonstrated that the apparent molecular mass of the full-length PDEÎ³ photoprobes on the SDS-PAGE gel was greater than both wild type PDEÎ³ (molecular mass â 11 kDa) and the PDEÎ³-(1â61) fragment (Mr â 7 kDa). The anomalous apparent migration at approximately 14 kDa was presumably because of the His6 and biotin/glycine additions. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (see âExperimental Proceduresâ) indicated, however, that these photoprobes attained the correct molecular mass. The maximal percentage of photoinsertion of the seven PDEÎ³ C-terminal photoprobes into GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S was evaluated at saturating concentrations of GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S (Fig. 2, A and B). The F73Z photoprobe demonstrated the highest level of cross-linking to GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S. In contrast, a low level (â¼10%) of the V66Z photoprobe to GÎ±t-GTPÎ³S was detected on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels, even at saturating concentrations of PDEÎ³. The W70Z, L76Z, L78Z, L81Z, and I86Z photoprobes showed greater than 30% cross-linking. The functional activity of each PDEÎ³ photoprobe was determined by its ability to stimulate the RGS9-catalyzed GTPase activity of GÎ±t in reconstituted membrane preparations (Fig. 3A). The role of PDEÎ³ in this reaction is to enhance the affinity between activated GÎ±t and RGS9 (40Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the His6 addition to the PDEÎ³ N terminus has no effect on functional activity toward the GÎ±t-GTPase or the cGMP phosphodiesterase"
https://openalex.org/W2009283906,"Transcription factor IID (TFIID) plays a central role in regulating the expression of most eukaryotic genes. Of the 14 TBP-associated factor (TAF) subunits that compose TFIID, TAF1 is one of the largest and most functionally diverse. Yeast TAF1 can be divided into four regions including a putative histone acetyltransferase domain and TBP, TAF, and promoter binding domains. Establishing the importance of each region in gene expression through deletion analysis has been hampered by the cellular requirement of TAF1 for viability. To circumvent this limitation we introduced galactose-inducible deletion derivatives of previously defined functional regions of TAF1 into a temperature-sensitive taf1ts2 yeast strain. After galactose induction of the TAF1 mutants and temperature-induced elimination of the resident Taf1ts2 protein, we examined the properties and phenotypes of the mutants, including their impact on genome-wide transcription. Virtually all TAF1-dependent genes, which comprise â¼90% of the yeast genome, displayed a strong dependence upon all regions of TAF1 that were tested. This finding might reflect the need for each region of TAF1 to stabilize TAF1 against degradation or may indicate that all TAF1-dependent genes require the many activities of TAF1. Paradoxically, deletion of the region of TAF1 that is important for promoter binding interfered with the expression of many genes that are normally TFIID-independent/SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase)-dominated, suggesting that this region normally prevents TAF1 (TFIID) from interfering with the expression of SAGA-regulated genes.

DNA binding sequence-specific activators regulate eukaryotic genes at many stages including the recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors that increase the accessibility of promoters to the transcription machinery. Activators also assist in the loading of the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II at promoters to form a preinitiation complex that is capable of transcribing the gene. The transcription machinery assembles at promoters via two major pathways in yeast, one that involves TFIID 3The abbreviations used are: TFIID, transcription factor IID; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; FHT, Flu-His6-TEV; HA, hemagglutinin; TEV, tobacco etch virus; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroo-rotic acid; WT, wild type; SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TAND, TAF1 N-terminal domain; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; gal, galactose; YPR, yeast extract, peptone, raffinose; CSM, complete synthetic medium; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; ts, temperature-sensitive; HA, hemagglutinin. and the other involving a compositionally related complex called SAGA (1Naar A.M.

TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), 4In this manuscript, we have followed the systematic TAF naming rules proposed by Tora (39Tora L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). of which all but one are essential for cell viability. Several of these TAFs, along with TBP, are also found in SAGA (4Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although TBP is widely regarded as responsible for delivering TFIID to promoters through interactions of TBP with the TATA box, TFIID largely functions at TATA-less promoters (3Huisinga K.L.

TATA-containing promoters tend to be TFIID-independent and instead prefer to load TBP via the SAGA assembly pathway (3Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The vast majority of all yeast genes (80â90%) are regulated through a TFIID/TATA-less arrangement, whereas a smaller minority depend primarily on a SAGA/TATA arrangement. Strikingly, the latter class largely includes stress-induced genes. Thus transcription complex assembly via the SAGA pathway might provide a greater level of inducibility, which is characteristic of stress-induced responses (3Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol.

In the absence of SAGA, expression of virtually the entire measurable yeast genome becomes TFIID-dependent. Thus, TFIID may be capable of setting up transcription complexes at all polymerase II-transcribed genes. TAFs perform a variety of functions including interactions with transcriptional activators, other general transcription factors, and promoter DNA (10Shen W.C. Bhaumik S.R. Causton H.C. Simon I.

Genome-wide studies using temperature-sensitive alleles of various TAFs indicate that some TAFs may be selective in the genes they activate (9Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Hostege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N.

Similarly, a variety of temperature-sensitive alleles located throughout TAF10 reveal potential promoter-selective roles for distinct regions of a single TAF (11Kirschner D.B. vom Baur E. Thibault C.

TAF1 is considered to be a âhallmarkâ of TFIID in that it resides only in TFIID and not in SAGA, and it may serve as a scaffold upon which TBP and TAFs assemble, although other TAFs might also play a scaffolding role (12Mencia M.

When the studies reported here were initiated, TAF1 had been systematically dissected into four functional domains: an N-terminal TBP-binding domain termed TAND, a TAF-TAF interaction domain, a putative histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, and a promoter recognition domain (12Mencia M.

More recently, a fifth domain that interacts with TAF7 has been identified (18Singh M.V. Bland C.E. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, the physiological significance of the yeast TAF1 HAT activity has come into question (23Durant M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Collectively, the potentially gene-specific roles of TAFs and the potential modularity of TAF1 and other TAFs led us to consider whether the various functional domains of TAF1 play gene-specific roles in vivo. Because TFIID contributes to the expression of nearly the entire yeast genome, a greater understanding of the yeast gene regulatory network might be achieved by assessing the contribution of each of the TFIID activities on genome-wide transcription. Any investigation into the genome-wide function of TAF1 or any other essential factor is hampered by the fact that deleterious mutations block cell growth. Creation of temperature-sensitive alleles has been a powerful and productive means of dissecting essential functional regions. However, this approach can be biased and restrictive in that any mutation must knock out an essential function at the nonpermissive temperature but renders the protein functional at the permissive temperature. Because a large fraction of yeast genes are not essential for cell growth, this strategy could miss TAF1 mutations that are specifically defective in expression of many nonessential genes. As an alternative strategy, we employed a systematic targeted approach by disrupting known functional domains of TAF1. To minimize potential indirect effects caused by constitutive expression of the TAF1 mutants, we chose to express each mutant under an inducible promoter. Because TAF1 is essential, this approach necessitated the use of a functional copy of TAF1 to promote cell growth. However, when assaying for mutant function it was desirable to eliminate the functional TAF1 copy so that it would not obscure or suppress the deletion construct. This was achieved by using a temperature-sensitive TAF1 allele (3Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 24Walker S.S.

Using this approach we first assayed for the ability of an induced version of wild type or mutant TAF1 to functionally complement the growth defect of a temperature-sensitive TAF1 allele. Next we characterized the expression, subcellular localization, TFIID integrity, and stability of the TAF1 mutants in order to better assess its potential to impact gene expression. Lastly, genome-wide expression studies were performed to evaluate the contribution of each functional domain to transcription. YCp50 (TAF1 WT, URA3), and pRS313 taf1ts2 HIS3 (25Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were gifts from J. Reese of this department (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University). pYN2 (TAF145 WT, TRP1) (15Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was a gift from T. Kokubo (Yokohama City University, Japan). pJI11 (pRS315 taf1ts2 LEU2) and pJI12 (pRS315 TAF1 WT LEU2) were created by amplifying the TAF1 gene from pRS313 taf1ts2 or pYN2, respectively, with taf1ts2 oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, supplemental Table S2) containing NotI and SalI restriction sites. The 4,456-bp PCR products were digested with NotI and SalI (New England Biolabs) (4,442 bp) and ligated into digested pRS315 (5,953 bp) to create 10,396-bp plasmids pJI11 and pJI12. The PCR product contained 494 bp upstream of TAF1 open reading frame and 741 bp downstream. To confirm the taf1ts2 temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype, pJI11 and pJI12 were transformed into Y13.2 (15Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and plated on CSM-LEU. pYN1 (TAF1 WT URA3) was shuffled out of Y13.2 by plating cells on CSM-LEU + 5-FOA (Zymo Research). Cells were then grown at 23 or 37 Â°C for 3 days on CSM-LEU (dextrose) plates to confirm the ts phenotype. The temperature-sensitive phenotype was confirmed independently in the taf1::KanMX null strain (yjdi381) on CSM-LEU (dextrose). pCALF-T(PGK) (26Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was converted to pCALF-FHT-T(PGK) 2.2 by inserting a 66-bp HIS-TEV oligo into the NdeI site. pUG6-FHT-P (4,170 bp) was made by PCR-amplifying a 259-bp fragment containing the FHT sequence from pCALFHT-T(PGK) 2.2 plasmid. PCR product was digested with SalI, and 161 bp was ligated into SalI-digested pUG6 plasmid (4,009 bp) such that the orientation was FHT-loxP-KanMX-loxP. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4743 (27Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen) was used as the parental strain. Initially, the stain was transformed with pSH47 (URA3) (28Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) encoding galactose inducible Cre recombinase. 70-mer oligonucleotides F4 and R2 (supplemental Table S2; regions of homology to TAF1 are in bold) were used to PCR-amplify 1991 bp of pFA6a-His3MX6-PGAL1 containing the HIS3 gene and GAL1 promoter (29Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The PCR product was transformed into BY4743 using a high efficiency lithium acetate method (28Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) to replace 550 bp of the endogenous TAF1 promoter with the GAL1 promoter, creating strain yLAC3. HIS+ homologous recombination transformants were selected on CSM-HIS-URA media and verified with colony PCR. Regions of TAF1 were deleted by replacing coding sequences with an FHT tag. The FHT tag encodes three HA (Flu) repeats, a hexahistidine (H) sequence, and the TEV protease sequence (T). The kanamycin resistance region of pUG6-FHT-p was PCR-amplified with 68-mer oligonucleotides with 50-bp homology to distinct regions of TAF1 (supplemental Table S2, Fig. 1). 1,826-bp PCR products were transformed into yLAC3 and selected on CSM-HIS-URA (dextrose) plates containing 500 Î¼g/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites was removed by induction of Cre recombinase with 2% galactose for 4 h, leaving the FHT tag N-terminal to the mutation in TAF1. Kanamycin-sensitive colonies were identified by replica plating on media containing and lacking G418. Additionally, mutations were verified by colony PCR with primers specific to each mutation. Kanamycin-sensitive FHT-TAF1 strains (Table 1) were plated on CSM-HIS + 5-FOA to select cells having lost pSH47 (30Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) and verified by replica plating on CSM-HIS and CSM-HIS-URA. Strains were then transformed with YCp50 (TAF1 WT, URA3) and transformants selected on CSM-HIS-URA media. Strains were plated on pre-sporulation medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 10% dextrose) for 2 days at 30 Â°C. Cells were cultured in sporulation medium (0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% raffinose) for 3 days at 30 Â°C. 200 Î¼l of the culture was pelleted, resuspended in 1.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and treated with 20 units of (1 mg/ml) zymolyase (MP Biomedicals) at room temperature for 20 min. Tetrads were dissected according to standard yeast techniques on YPD plates (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose). Spores were replica plated onto CSM-HIS-URA medium to select for the HIS3 gene (and therefore the GAL1 promoter). Mating types of the taf1 strains were confirmed with MATa and MATÎ± sex tester strains. MATÎ± leu- HIS+ LYS+ tetrads were selected. Strains were then transformed with pJI11 (taf1ts2, LEU2) or pJI12 (TAF1 WT, LEU2) and selected on CSM-LEU media. Cells that lost YCp50 (TAF1 WT, URA3) were selected by plating on CSM-LEU + 5-FOA.TABLE 1Yeast strainsStrainPromoterTAF1 allelePlasmidMATRef.BY4743TAF1WTDiploid27Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J.

ViabilityâMATÎ± haploid strains carrying YCp50 (TAF1 WT, URA3) were grown at 25 Â°C in YPD medium (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose). Cells were diluted into YPR + 0.2% galactose and grown to mid-log phase. 0.5 A600 units of cells were removed, and 5 Î¼l of 10-fold serial dilutions were plated. Cells having lost the YCp50 plasmid were selected by growing on CSM + 5-FOA with 2% dextrose or 2% galactose at 25 or 37 Â°C. ToxicityâMATÎ± haploid strains carrying pJI12 (TAF1 WT LEU2) plasmid were grow in CSM-LEU raffinose to mid-log phase. 0.5 A600 of cells were serially diluted 10-fold, and 5 Î¼l was plated on CSM-LEU + 2% dextrose or 2% galactose at 19, 25, and 37 Â°C. Photographs were taken after 96 h for 25 and 37 Â°C plates and after 120 h for 19 Â°C plates. FHT-TAF1 strains were grown in YPR at 25 Â°C until the A600 was â¼0.8. Galactose was added to 2%, and strains were incubated at 25 Â°C for 45 min. Dextrose was then added to 2%, and the cultures were placed in a 37 Â°C water bath. Equal-volume aliquots were removed at 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 min after the addition of dextrose. After Western blotting, quantitation was performed on four independent replicates using a densitometer and ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. Exposure times were chosen so that all signals were in the linear range of detection. Local background was subtracted from the signal band at each time point. Intensity peaked at 15 min in dextrose (at 37 Â°C) for all strains. This value was set as 100%, and the percent of TAF1 remaining over time was plotted. Whole cells containing constitutively expressed HA-Bdf1 were loaded in each lane of the immunoblots as an internal control for protein extraction, recovery, transfer, and immunodetection but were not included in the quantitation. Cultures were grown in YPR overnight at 30 Â°C, diluted to A600, an A600 of 0.2, and grown for 3.5 h in YPR + 2% galactose at 30 Â°C. 2.0 A600 units were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, treated with zymolyase, and bound to polylysine-coated slides. FHT-tagged TAF1 proteins were visualized by incubating with anti-HA.11 monoclonal antibodies (1:1000, Babco) and then with goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). 4â²,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to visualize nucleic acids (31Manzini G. Barcellona M.L. Avitabile M. Quadrifoglio F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8861-8876Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The method was adapted from Ref. 30Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar. Samples were viewed on an Axioplan epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). TIFF images were collected using a Spot2 cooled charge-coupled device digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Cells were washed in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide for 5 min at room temperature, spun, resuspended in 2Ã protein sample buffer, and heated to 95 Â°C (32Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). HA-TAF1 mutants were electrophoresed in 7.8% Bis-acrylamide gels (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose in 80% Tris-glycine-SDS/20% methanol for 120 min at 1.0 A. FHT-TAF1 mutants were detected with anti-HA (HA.11, Babco) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). TAF1 strains were induced with 2% galactose in CSM-LEU media for 75 min at 25 Â°C. â¼10 A600 equivalents of cellular lysate were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies (Babco) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (19Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Approximately 2.5 A600 of cells were loaded onto 4â12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE Novex gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 80% Tris-glycine-SDS/20% methanol for 120 min at 1.0 A. Polyclonal TAF antibodies (gifts of P. A. Weil, Vanderbilt University), polyclonal HA antibodies (Rockland), polyclonal yTBP antibodies, and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used to detect co-immunoprecipitated TAFs and TBP. For TAF1 production after galactose induction, cultures were grown in CSM-LEU raffinose at room temperature and induced with 2% galactose. 0.5 A600 aliquots were removed at 10-min intervals after the addition of galactose and immunoblotted. For TAF1 induction for use in microarray analysis, cultures were grown in CSM-LEU raffinose at room temperate until A600 â¼ 0.8. Galactose was added to 2% at 0, 15, 30 or 60 min before shifting culture to 37 Â°C with warm CSM-LEU + 2% galactose. After shift to 37 Â°C, the cultures were incubated for 45 min before harvesting and use in expression profiling. In generating histograms of log2 expression as a function of time in galactose prior to temperature shift, strain yjdi375 (PTAF1- TAF1 WT + taf1ts2) was used as reference. Test strains were yjdi363 (PGAL1-TAF1 WT + taf1ts2) and yjdi381 (PGAL1-taf1::kanMX + taf1ts2). Microarrays were performed essentially as described (3Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 33Chitikila C. Huisinga K.L. Irvin J.D. Basehoar A.D. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown at â¼24 Â°C in CSM-LEU + 3% raffinose to an A600 of â¼0.8. FHT-TAF1 mutants were induced by adding galactose to 2% at 30 min prior to temperature shift. Cultures were shifted to 37 Â°C by adding an equal volume of warm CSM-LEU + 2% galactose and placed in a 37 Â°C incubator for 45 min to inactivate taf1ts2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature, washed in RNase-free (diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated) double distilled H2O, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA and poly(A+) mRNA purification, reverse transcription, and labeling with fluorescent dyes (Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences)), hybridization, and scanning were all performed as described (3Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 33Chitikila C. Huisinga K.L. Irvin J.D. Basehoar A.D. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 4 Î¼g of mRNA was used for hybridizations instead of the conventional 2 Î¼g. Slides were treated with Dye Saver2 (Genisphere) according to manufacturer's instructions to preserve signal intensity. Raw data are accessible at GeneExpression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; GenBankâ¢ accession numbers GSM65302 to GSM65315). Processed data are presented in supplemental Table S3. R software was used to mode-center replicates (dye swaps) (34Ihaka R.G., R. J. Comp. Graph. Stat. 1996; 5: 299-314Google Scholar). Bacillus subtilis transcripts (Phe, Lys, Dap, Thr, Trp) were added to each culture prior to total RNA isolation based on A600 units. These hybridize to cognate spots on each of the 16 grids per microarray slide. R output (mode-centered) data were normalized by the spiking controls. Genes were filtered by several criteria to minimize false positives. 1) Genes were eliminated if their signal on the array was greater than 25% saturated. 2) The mean foreground signal minus the median background signal had to be greater than standard deviation of background signal. 3) Quality data were needed from both replicates of the dye swap. 4) The directional change of signal of the mutant (relative to reference) had to be equivalent in the replicates.
