Nie et al. show that a thermally stable catalyst, atomically dispersed Pt 2+ on CeO 2 , can become active for CO oxidation at 150°C after steam treatment at 750°C. In studies with simulated vehicle exhaust, this catalyst treatment also improves its oxidation activity for other exhaust components such as hydrocarbons. Science , this issue p. 1419"

However, these same characteristics also mean that chain dynamics are slow, which impedes potential self-healing. Yanagisawa et al. developed a family of ether-thiourea linear polymers that form hydrogen-bonded networks and still manage to stay amorphous. The polymers are stiff, showing the strength of the hydrogen bonding; however, because these bonds can easily reform, the polymer is also able to self-heal when compressed.

Quantum liquids, other than liquid helium, have been comparatively more difficult to come by. Cabrera et al. combined two BECs and manipulated the atomic interactions to create droplets of a quantum liquid (see the Perspective by Ferrier-Barbut and Pfau). Because the interactions were not directional, the droplets had a roughly round shape. The simplicity of this dilute system makes it amenable to theoretical modeling, enabling a better understanding of quantum fluids. Science , this issue p. 301 ; see also p. 274"

This diversity necessitates multiple pathways for their effective membrane insertion. Guna et al. found that a widely conserved protein complex is responsible for inserting a subset of membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (see the Perspective by Fry and Clemons Jr.). This ER membrane protein complex (EMC) inserts transmembrane domains whose topology and hydrophobicity preclude effective recognition by other insertion factors.

https://openalex.org/W2774012114,"Necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like (NLP) proteins constitute a superfamily of proteins produced by plant pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes. Many NLPs are cytotoxins that facilitate microbial infection of eudicot, but not of monocot plants. Here, we report glycosylinositol phosphorylceramide (GIPC) sphingolipids as NLP toxin receptors. Plant mutants with altered GIPC composition were more resistant to NLP toxins. Binding studies and x-ray crystallography showed that NLPs form complexes with terminal monomeric hexose moieties of GIPCs that result in conformational changes within the toxin. Insensitivity to NLP cytolysins of monocot plants may be explained by the length of the GIPC head group and the architecture of the NLP sugar-binding site. We unveil early steps in NLP cytolysin action that determine plant clade-specific toxin selectivity."

We study the Higgs and Goldstone modes in a supersolid quantum gas that is created by coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate symmetrically to two optical cavities. The cavity fields form a U(1)-symmetric order parameter that can be modulated and monitored along both quadratures in real time. This enables us to measure the excitation energies across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, establish their amplitude and phase nature, as well as characterize their dynamics from an impulse response. Furthermore, we can give a tunable mass to the Goldstone mode at the crossover between continuous and discrete symmetry by changing the coupling of the quantum gas with either cavity."

https://openalex.org/W2774339797,"Recent advances in the study of nodal Weyl fermions (WFs), quasi-relativistic massless particles, constitute a novel realm of quantum many-body phenomena. The Coulomb interaction in such systems, having a zero density of states at the Fermi level, is of particular interest, since in contrast to conventional correlated metals, its long-ranged component is unscreened. Here, through nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements, we unveil the exotic spin correlations of two-dimensional WFs in an organic material, causing a divergent increase of the Korringa ratio by a factor of 1000 upon cooling, in striking contrast with conventional metallic behaviors. Combined with model calculations, we show that this divergence stems from the interaction-driven velocity renormalization that almost exclusively suppresses the zero-momentum spin fluctuations. At low temperatures, the NMR rate shows a remarkable increase, which is shown by numerical analyses to correspond to inter-node excitonic fluctuations, precursor of a transition from massless to massive quasiparticles."

We implemented an SVE for a consumer virtual reality system where each user’s body could be represented by a jointed self-avatar that was dynamically controlled by head and hand controllers. We investigated the impact of a self-avatar on collaborative outcomes such as completion time and trust formation during competitive and cooperative tasks. We used two different embodiment levels: no self-avatar and self-avatar, and compared these to an in-person face to face version of the tasks. We found that participants could finish the task more quickly when they cooperated than when they competed, for both the self-avatar condition and the face to face condition, but not for the no self-avatar condition. In terms of trust formation, both the self-avatar condition and the face to face condition led to higher scores than the no self-avatar condition; however, collaboration style had no significant effect on trust built between partners. The results are further evidence of the importance of a self-avatar representation in immersive virtual reality."

Using subwavelength-scale disordered metasurfaces, Maguid et al. observed a phase transition in how the light is scattered as a function of disorder. Weak disorder induced a photonic spin Hall effect, whereas strong disorder led to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical-Rashba effect.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, have been implicated in the regulation of a spectrum of both physiological and pathological conditions, including immune responses. Although the immune regulatory miRNA networks in higher vertebrates have been well described, regulation of these responses in fish species is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of the miRNA miR-203 involved in inflammatory responses in miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy). We found that the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio anguillarum and lipopolysaccharide significantly up-regulated host miR-203 expression. The increased miR-203 expression suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines and thereby prevented mounting of a full immune response. Mechanistically, we identified and validated IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) as a target of miR-203. We observed that miR-203 post-transcriptionally controls IRAK4 expression and thereby inhibits the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. In summary, our findings reveal that miR-203 in fish is a critical suppressor of innate immune responses to bacterial infection by suppressing a feedback to IRAK4–NF-κB–mediated signaling.

In summary, our findings reveal that miR-203 in fish is a critical suppressor of innate immune responses to bacterial infection by suppressing a feedback to IRAK4–NF-κB–mediated signaling. Innate immunity is the primary defense mechanism that recognizes pathogenic microorganisms by various conserved pattern recognition receptors.

When TLRs (except TLR3) bind to TLR ligands, they recruit the adaptor molecule MyD88 to mediate the MyD88-dependent signaling cascade (2Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Innate immune recognition.Annu.

It is well documented that recruitment of adaptor kinases is the prime factor for initiation of the TLR signaling cascade. IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), known as the pivotal adaptor kinase used by almost all TLR signaling, could be recruited to MyD88, forming the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2/1 receptor complex that further activates TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (5Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. Wu H. Helical assembly in the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex in TLR/IL-1R signalling.Nature. 2010; 465 (20485341): 885-89010.1038/nature09121Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 6Cao Z.

Afterward, the IRAK-TRAF6 complex dissociates from the receptor complex to interact with TAK1 (7Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Activation of the IκB kinase complex by TRAF6 requires a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex and a unique polyubiquitin chain.Cell. 2000; 103 (11057907): 351-36110.1016/S0092-8674(00)00126-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The activation of TAK1 eventually leads to the activation of NF-κB signaling (8Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K.

In contrast, dysregulation of this process is detrimental to the host, leading to inflammatory damage and autoimmune diseases. Thus, TLR-mediated innate immune response must be tightly regulated by detailed mechanisms.

Recent studies have proposed a series of regulatory controllers involved in regulating TLR signaling cascades at several layers, including TLR molecules, TLR-related signaling molecules, and TLR-triggered transcription factors and inflammatory genes. Previous studies suggested that Rab7b could negatively regulate TLR4 signaling by direct degradation of TLR4 (9Wang Y. Chen T. Han C. He D. Liu H. An H. Cai Z. Cao X. Lysosome-associated small Rab GTPase Rab7b negatively regulates TLR4 signaling in macrophages by promoting lysosomal degradation of TLR4.Blood. 2007; 110 (17395780): 962-97110.1182/blood-2007-01-066027Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Phosphatase SHP-1 has been reported to negatively regulate TLR-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines by interacting with and inhibiting the kinase IRAK1 (10An H. Hou J. Zhou J. Zhao W. Xu H. Zheng Y. Yu Y. Liu S. Cao X. Phosphatase SHP-1 promotes TLR- and RIG-I-activated production of type I interferon by inhibiting the kinase IRAK1.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 (18391954): 542-55010.1038/ni.1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Additionally, anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, could also be the effective suppressors to control TLR signaling activity to avoid excessive inflammation (11Siewe L. Bollati-Fogolin M. Wickenhauser C. Krieg T. Müller W. Roers A. Interleukin-10 derived from macrophages and/or neutrophils regulates the inflammatory response to LPS but not the response to CpG DNA.Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36 (17111348): 3248-325510.1002/eji.200636012Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although much of the focus has been on the study of protein regulators in the TLR signaling pathway, recent evidence has pointed to the potential regulatory role of microRNA in managing this signaling pathway. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and single-stranded noncoding RNA sequence (21–24 nucleotides) emerging recently as translational repressors of gene transcripts by binding to their 3′-UTRs, resulting in target transcript degradation or protein translation inhibition (12Selbach M. Schwanhäusser B. Thierfelder N. Fang Z. Khanin R. Rajewsky N.

In mammals, as many as 60% of all protein-coding genes have been documented to be regulated by miRNAs (14Friedman R.C. Farh K.K. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.Genome. Res. 2009; 19 (18955434): 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6362) Google Scholar). miRNAs act as vital and versatile modulators that regulate the intricate networks controlling fundamental biological processes, including growth, development, proliferation, apoptosis, and immune response (14Friedman R.C.

In the field of inflammation, miRNAs have attracted tremendous interest for their ability to modify strength and timing in TLR-mediated signaling responses. To date, a series of miRNAs have been documented to regulate the different levels of the cascade reaction. At the level of regulating TLR expression, the let-7 miRNA family, including let-7e and let-7i, have been reported to modulate TLR4, and microRNA (miR)-19a/b could reduce TLR2 level, thereby inhibiting the production of TLR2-triggered cytokines (17Li Y. Shi X. MicroRNAs in the regulation of TLR and RIG-I pathways.Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2013; 10 (23262976): 65-7110.1038/cmi.2012.55Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although these miRNAs eliminate TLR expression, it is more effective to regulate TLR-related signaling molecules by miRNAs. In higher vertebrates, several downstream TLR-related signaling adaptor proteins are identified as strong miRNA targets. MyD88 has been identified as an miR-155 target in both mice and humans (18Tang B. Xiao B. Liu Z. Li N. Zhu E.D. Li B.S. Xie Q.H. Zhuang Y. Zou Q.M. Mao X.H. Identification of MyD88 as a novel target of miR-155, involved in negative regulation of Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammation.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 (20219467): 1481-148610.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.063Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). IRAK1 and TRAF6 have also been indicated as targets for miR-146a, which was later confirmed to target IRAK2 (19Hou J. Wang P. Lin L. Liu X. Ma F. An H. Wang Z. Cao X. MicroRNA-146a feedback inhibits RIG-I- dependent Type I IFN production in macrophages by targeting TRAF6, IRAK1, and IRAK2.J. Immunol. 2009; 183 (19596990): 2150-215810.4049/jimmunol.0900707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In addition, IRAK4 has been identified and validated as a target of miR-132/-212 in monocytes (20Nahid M.A. Yao B. Dominguez-Gutierrez P.R. Kesavalu L. Satoh M. Chan E.K. Regulation of TLR2-mediated tolerance and cross-tolerance through IRAK4 modulation by miR-132 and miR-212.J. Immunol. 2013; 190 (23264652): 1250-126310.4049/jimmunol.1103060Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in inflammation upon pathogen infection are much less well studied in fish due to the limitations of research materials and appropriate methods. Fish, having broad roles in terms of ecology and food production, have been consistently threatened by pathogenic microorganisms, of which Gram-negative bacteria is a major group. Diseases caused by Gram-negative bacteria infection have been the focus of studies because of their wide prevalence, high incidence, and great harm. Recently, the development and aquaculture of the miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy) has been hindered by vibriosis, leading to the high mortality and severe economic losses (21Zhang F. Peng Z. Zhang J. Liu M. Fu R. Luo H. Isolation and identification of the pathogenic strain of Vibrio harveyi from Miichthys miiuy.Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 2010; 50 (20499633): 304-309PubMed Google Scholar). Vibrio anguillarum is a Gram-negative, comma-shaped rod bacterium, which belongs to the family Vibrionaceae. V. anguillarum is an important causative agent of vibriosis, which is a deadly hemorrhagic septicemic disease affecting various fish (22Frans I. Michiels C.W. Bossier P. Willems K.A. Lievens B. Rediers H. Vibrio anguillarum as a fish pathogen: virulence factors, diagnosis and prevention.J. Fish. Dis. 2011; 34 (21838709): 643-66110.1111/j.1365-2761.2011.01279.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the present study, the host regulation mechanism of miRNAs in inflammatory responses is documented in miiuy croaker upon V. anguillarum infection. We found that treatment with V. anguillarum, as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly up-regulated miR-203 expression in miiuy croaker. Overexpression of miR-203 in LPS-treated macrophages could markedly reduce the production of anti-inflammatory genes. Digging deeper, we demonstrated that miR-203 inhibited the expression of IRAK4 and thus suppressed the activation of NF-κB signaling, thereby attenuating inflammatory response and avoiding excessive inflammation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show the role of miRNAs in modulating IRAK–NF-κB–mediated inflammatory signaling in fish species and indicates that miR-203 is a candidate modulator involved in inflammation resolution. miRNAs have been recently reported as new regulators implicated in the regulation of diverse biological processes by post-transcriptional modulating gene expression. To investigate whether the expression of miRNAs might be regulated upon V. anguillarum infection, we examined the miRNA expression profiles in miiuy croaker spleen and performed a small RNA deep-sequencing analysis (data not shown). The deep-sequencing data revealed that a series of miRNAs was up-regulated upon V. anguillarum infection, with miR-203 being one of the significantly increased miRNAs. To validate the expression profiles of miR-203 upon pathogen stimulation, we determined the expression of miR-203 in V. anguillarum-infected miiuy croaker liver and spleen samples by real-time qPCR. The expression of miR-203 in both bacterially infected liver and spleen was up-regulated compared with uninfected counterparts (Fig. 1, A and B). To validate the expression of miR-203, we also determined its levels in vitro and in vivo under conditions of stimulation with ultrapure LPS, the endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria. As shown in Fig. 1C, miR-203 expression was rapidly increased and reached a peak at 6 h in LPS-stimulated macrophages nearly 8-fold higher than that in untreated cells. In agreement with the above results, LPS also exhibited an activating effect on miR-203 expression in LPS-treated miiuy croaker kidney sample (Fig. 1D). These findings demonstrated that miR-203 expression could be up-regulated by V. anguillarum infection as well as LPS stimulation, indicating its important role in the infectious process of Gram-negative bacterium. To determine the potential role of miR-203 in bacterial infection, we examined the effect of miR-203 on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine gene expression in miiuy croaker macrophages. Using our previously reported methods (23Chu Q. Sun Y. Cui J. Xu T. Inducible microRNA-214 contributes to the suppression of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response via targeting myd88 gene in fish.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28235799): 5282-529010.1074/jbc.M117.777078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we first formed useful experimental models to overexpress or underexpress miR-203 in miiuy croaker macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), transfection of miR-203 mimics into miiuy croaker macrophages increased miR-203 expression, whereas miR-203 inhibitors decreased its expression. Afterward, we probed the contribution of miR-203 to inflammatory cytokine gene expression upon LPS stimulation. Miiuy croaker macrophages were thus transfected with chemically synthesized miR-203 mimics and inhibitors for up to 24 h and then stimulated with LPS for several time periods. As shown in Fig. 2C, miR-203 mimics could markedly inhibit LPS-induced IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α mRNA expression by >30% compared with control mimics. The results indicated that miR-203 exerts the time-dependent effect on the expression of IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α upon LPS stimulation, and the peak of the expression of both IL-8 and TNF-α was at 6 h, whereas the peak of the expression of IL-1β was at 12 h. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2D, miR-203 inhibitors could significantly increase the expression of IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α compared with control inhibitors, and the up-regulated function of miR-203 on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine gene expression could last at least 12 h. To delve into the detailed regulation mechanism, we also examined the expression of inflammatory cytokine using a multidose of LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2E, a higher dose of LPS stimulation can lead to a more strongly up-regulated effect on the expression of inflammatory cytokine, and the up-regulated gene expression can be significantly attenuated by transfection with miR-203 mimics but be further increased by transfection with miR-203 inhibitors. Taken together, these findings suggested that miR-203 is able to specifically down-regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated miiuy croaker macrophages. To identify the molecular target of miR-203, we first searched for predicted miR-203 targets using bioinformatics tools (Table S1). Among the possible targets of miR-203, we focused on IRAK4, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be a critical player involved in TLR-dependent immune response. To dissect the possibility that IRAK4 is the target gene for miR-203, we constructed reporter plasmids by cloning 3′-UTR of miiuy croaker IRAK4 into the pmirGLO luciferase reporter within the mutation at miR-203 binding site as a control and then transfected with these plasmids into HEK293 cells for Dual-Luciferase reporter assays. As shown in Fig. 3A, transfection of miR-203 mimics inhibited the luciferase activity by 43% compared with control mimics, whereas both the control and miR-203 mimics showed no effect on activity of luciferase reporter containing the mutated IRAK4 3′-UTR. The significantly down-regulation mechanism was further investigated by using miR-203 inhibitors, revealing that inhibition of luciferase activity by miR-203 mimics was attenuated after cotransfection with miR-203 inhibitors (Fig. 3B). In addition, the concentration and time gradient experiments were conducted, and the result indicated that miR-203 could reduce the level of the luciferase reporter containing the wildtype IRAK4 3′-UTR, and the down-regulation mechanism showed dose-dependent and time-dependent characteristics (Fig. 3, C and D). Because the miRNA-processing system is conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates (24Denli A.M. Tops B.B. Plasterk R.H. Ketting R.F. Hannon G.J.

After transfection of pre-miR-203 plasmids into HEK293 cells, we observed that overexpression of pre-miR-203 could be sufficient to decrease luciferase activity compared with control plasmid, whereas no change of luciferase was observed in cells transfected with mutated-type IRAK4 3′-UTR in the presence of pre-miR-203 (Fig. 3E). Moreover, pre-miR-203 was found to down-regulate GFP gene expression when the 3′-UTR of IRAK4 was cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3F). Consistent with miR-203, pre-miR-203 also showed a dose-dependent effect on inhibition of luciferase activity at both 24 and 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 3G). In summary, our data adequately revealed that IRAK4 is a target of miR-203. Given that miRNAs modulate target gene expression through mRNA degradation or translation inhibition, we next investigated the function of miR-203 in the regulation of IRAK4 expression. To this end, we determined the expression levels of IRAK4 in miiuy croaker macrophages treated with miR-203 mimics or inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of miR-203 mimics decreased the protein level of IRAK4 in a time-dependent manner, and the inhibition effect appeared more significant at 48 h post-transfection in miiuy croaker macrophages. In contrast, miR-203 inhibitors increased IRAK4 protein level compared with control inhibitors, and the activating effect also presented in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). To assess whether miR-203 could also regulate the expression of IRAK4 at mRNA levels, we transfected with miR-203 mimics, miR-203 inhibitors, or negative controls into miiuy croaker macrophages for 24 h and then stimulated with LPS for 6 and 12 h. As shown in Fig. 4C, miR-203 mimics could reduce the mRNA expression of IRAK4, and the inhibition effect appeared more significant at 6 h post-stimulation. In contrast, miR-203 inhibitors raised the mRNA expression of IRAK4, which significantly up-regulated its expression at 6 h post-stimulation (Fig. 4D). The results suggested that miR-203 could regulate IRAK4 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, to further examine the effect of miR-203 on the regulation of IRAK4 expression, we constructed IRAK4 expression plasmid that contains the full-length CDS region and 3′-UTR of miiuy croaker IRAK4 and transfected it into HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4E, overexpression of miR-203 exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the mRNA level of IRAK4 as well as on its protein level in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with miR-203, pre-miR-203 also reduces the expression of IRAK4 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results demonstrated that IRAK4 is a direct target of miR-203, which could negatively regulate IRAK4 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. IRAK4 is known as the pivotal adaptor kinase and has been demonstrated to be an important player in TLR-dependent immune responses in mammals (5Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. Wu H. Helical assembly in the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex in TLR/IL-1R signalling.Nature. 2010; 465 (20485341): 885-89010.1038/nature09121Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 6Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. TRAF6 is a signal transducer for interleukin-1.Nature. 1996; 383 (8837778): 443-44610.1038/383443a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). To explore the function of IRAK4 in miiuy croaker, we first examined the expression levels of IRAK4 upon pathogen infection. The mRNA expression profiles of IRAK4 in liver, spleen, and kidney after V. anguillarum infection were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5A, Gram-negative bacterium V. anguillarum could significantly up-regulate IRAK4 mRNA expression in these immune tissues. Consistent with this, purified LPS also exhibited an activating effect on IRAK4 mRNA expression in liver and kidney samples (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the expression profiles of IRAK4 were detected in LPS-treated miiuy croaker macrophages, and the results also showed that IRAK4 mRNA expression was up-regulated upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that IRAK4 could be involved in immune response. Based on this result, we then further explored the regulation role of miiuy croaker IRAK4. To this end, we transfected of miiuy croaker IRAK4 expression plasmid, together with reporter gene NF-κB, IL-8, or IL-1β into HeLa cells. After a 24-h transfection, HeLa cells were stimulated with LPS for another 6 h and then measured for Dual-Luciferase reporter assays. As shown in Fig. 5D, overexpression of IRAK4 markedly up-regulated NF-κB, IL-8, and IL-1β reporter genes compared with controls, and the activating effects were more significant after stimulation with LPS. Given that miR-203 could target IRAK4 and modulate its expression, we next tested whether miR-203 could affect NF-κB signaling. We thus transfected with miiuy croaker IRAK4 expression plasmid, which contains the full-length CDS region and 3′-UTR of the miiuy croaker IRAK4 gene, together with the NF-κB reporter gene, miR-203 mimics, miR-203 inhibitors, or negative controls, into HeLa cells. After a 24-h transfection, HeLa cells were stimulated with LPS for another 6 h and then measured for Dual-Luciferase reporter assays. As shown in Fig. 6A, miR-203 mimics sharply suppressed the activation of the NF-κB reporter gene, whereas the inhibitory effect was weakened by cotransfection with the miR-203 inhibitors. The results indicated that upon LPS stimulation, miR-203 played a negative regulation role in NF-κB activation. Consistent with this, miR-203 also showed the negative effect on reporter genes IL-8 and IL-1β upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 6A). Moreover, pre-miR-203 plasmid was used to further verify these results. As shown in Fig. 6B, pre-miR-203 showed the attenuated effect on NF-κB, IL-8, and IL-1β reporter genes, and the inhibitory effect appeared more significant at 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these data sufficiently demonstrated that miR-203 could negatively regulate IRAK4–NF-κB signaling in a manner dependent on modulating IRAK4 upon LPS stimulation. To confirm the contribution of IRAK4 on the regulation of inflammatory cytokines, we then examined the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated macrophages. After transfection with IRAK4-specific siRNA (si-IRAK4) into miiuy croaker macrophages, the expression levels of IRAK4 in both protein and mRNA were significantly inhibited (Fig. 7A). Then we silenced IRAK4 and examined the production of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated miiuy croaker macrophages. As shown in Fig. 7 (B–D), knockdown of IRAK4 significantly inhibited the expression of IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α, which produced an effect similar to miR-203 overexpression. These results indicated that miR-203 regulates inflammatory response through suppression of endogenous IRAK4 in miiuy croaker. In addition, we have also addressed the generality of the findings that miR-203 targets IRAK4 in other model animals, such as large yellow croaker, and the results shown in Fig. 7E indicated that miR-203 could also target IRAK4 in large yellow croaker, which indicated the generality of our findings. Taken together, these data convincingly demonstrate that miR-203 inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines by negative regulation of the miR-203 target gene IRAK4 and modulation of NF-κB signaling, thereby inhibiting the excessive inflammatory responses (Fig. 7F). Eradication of bacterial invasion requires timely and appropriate innate immune responses, but excessive induction of inflammatory cytokines production may lead to acute or chronic inflammatory disorders. Hence, various layers of negative mechanisms and regulators play important roles in controlling homeostasis of the immune system and avoiding excessive inflammation. Since microRNA-146a was first reported to be associated with inflammatory responses (19Hou J. Wang P. Lin L. Liu X. Ma F. An H. Wang Z. Cao X.

Our aim was to assess whether oral butyrate could modulate brain metabolism and plasticity and if this would relate to gut function. Sixteen pigs were subjected to sodium butyrate (SB) supplementation via beverage water or water only [control (C)]. All pigs had blood sampled after 2 and 3 wk of treatment, and were subjected to a brain positron emission tomography after 3 wk. Animals were euthanized after 4 wk to sample pancreas, intestine, and brain for gut physiology and anatomy measurements, as well as hippocampal histology, Ki67, and doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry. SB compared with C treatment triggered basal brain glucose metabolism changes in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus ( P = 0.003), increased hippocampal granular cell layer volume ( P = 0.006), and neurogenesis (Ki67: P = 0.026; DCX: P = 0.029). After 2 wk of treatment, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lactate, glucagon-like peptide 1, and peptide tyrosine tyrosine remained unchanged. After 3 wk, plasma levels of lactate were lower in SB compared with C animals ( P = 0.028), with no difference for glucose and insulin. Butyrate intake impacted very little gut anatomy and function.

https://openalex.org/W2952903119,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a therapy for epilepsy and depression. However, its efficacy varies and its mechanism remains unclear. Prior studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activations with VNS in human brains, but have reported inconsistent findings. The source of inconsistency is likely attributable to the complex temporal characteristics of VNS-evoked fMRI responses that cannot be fully explained by simplified response models in the conventional model-based analysis for activation mapping. To address this issue, we acquired 7-Tesla blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI data from anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats receiving electrical stimulation at the left cervical vagus nerve. Using spatially independent component analysis, we identified 20 functional brain networks and detected the network-wise activations with VNS in a data-driven manner. Our results showed that VNS activated 15 out of 20 brain networks, and the activated regions covered >76% of the brain volume. The time course of the evoked response was complex and distinct across regions and networks. In addition, VNS altered the strengths and patterns of correlations among brain networks relative to those in the resting state. The most notable changes in network-network interactions were related to the limbic system. Together, such profound and widespread effects of VNS may underlie its unique potential for a wide range of therapeutics to relieve central or peripheral conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2775769578,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), a low-affinity IGF binder, may play an important role in bone metabolism. However, its function in osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated its effects on osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of IGFBP7 enhanced the expression of osteo-specific genes and proteins, and IGFBP7 knockdown decreased osteogenesis-specific markers. More mineral deposits and higher alkaline phosphatase activity were observed after the up-regulation of IGFBP7. Moreover, β-catenin levels were up-regulated by the overexpression of IGFBP7 or the addition of extracellular IGFBP7 protein and were reduced by the depletion of IGFBP7. The increase in osteogenic differentiation due to the overexpression of IGFBP7 was partially decreased by specific Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors. Using a rat tibial osteotomy model, a sheet of IGFBP7–overexpressing BMSCs improved bone healing, as demonstrated by imaging, biomechanical, and histologic analyses. Taken together, these findings indicate that IGFBP7 regulates the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs partly via the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway.— Zhang, W., Chen, E., Chen, M., Ye, C., Qi, Y., Ding, Q., Li, H., Xue, D., Gao, X., Pan, Z.

Here, using sulfur-SAD phasing, we determined the crystal structure of m4-1BB to 2.2-Å resolution. We found that similar to other TNFRSFs, m4-1BB has four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). However, the organization of CRD1 and the orientation of CRD3 and CRD4 with respect to CRD2 in the m4-1BB structure distinctly differed from those of other TNFRSFs. Moreover, we mapped two Asn residues within CRD4 that are N-linked glycosylated and mediate m4-1BB binding to Gal-9. Kinetics studies of m4-1BB disclosed a very tight nanomolar binding affinity to m4-1BBL with an unexpectedly strong avidity effect. Both N- and C-terminal domains of Gal-9 bound m4-1BB, but with lower affinity compared with m4-1BBL. Although the TNF homology domain (THD) of human (h)4-1BBL forms non-covalent trimers, we found that m4-1BBL formed a covalent dimer via 2 cysteines absent in h4-1BBL. As multimerization and clustering is a prerequisite for TNFR intracellular signaling, and as m4-1BBL can only recruit two m4-1BB monomers, we hypothesize that m4-1BBL and Gal-9 act together to aid aggregation of m4-1BB monomers to efficiently initiate m4-1BB signaling. 4-1BB (CD137) is a TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) member that is thought to undergo receptor trimerization upon binding to its trimeric TNF superfamily ligand (4-1BBL) to stimulate immune responses. 4-1BB also can bind to the tandem repeat–type lectin galectin-9 (Gal-9), and signaling through mouse (m)4-1BB is reduced in galectin-9 (Gal-9)–deficient mice, suggesting a pivotal role of Gal-9 in m4-1BB activation.

https://openalex.org/W2774805541,"The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is a serious pest worldwide, transmitting Candidatus Liberibacter spp. (Alphaproteobacteria), the causative agents of a devastating citrus disease known as huanglongbing or greening disease. In a symbiotic organ called the bacteriome, D. citri possesses an organelle-like defensive symbiont, Candidatus Profftella armatura (Betaproteobacteria), and a nutritional symbiont, Ca. Carsonella ruddii (Gammaproteobacteria). Drastically reduced symbiont genomes and metabolic complementarity among the symbionts and D. citri indicate their mutually indispensable association. Moreover, horizontal gene transfer between the Profftella and Liberibacter lineages suggests ecological and evolutionary interactions between the bacteriome symbiont and the HLB pathogen. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we examined the behavior of Profftella and Carsonella during transovarial transmission and the development of D. citri. In the bacteriomes of sexually-mature female adults, symbionts transformed from an extremely elongated tubular form into spherical or short-rod forms, which migrated toward the ovary. The symbionts then formed mosaic masses, which entered at the posterior pole of the vitellogenic oocytes. After anatrepsis, Carsonella and Profftella migrated to the central and peripheral parts of the mass, respectively. Following the appearance of host nuclei, the mass cellularized, segregating Carsonella and Profftella in the central syncytium and peripheral uninucleate bacteriocytes, respectively. Subsequently, the uninucleate bacteriocytes harboring Profftella assembled at the posterior pole, while the syncytium, containing Carsonella, sat on the anterior side facing the germ band initiating katatrepsis. During dorsal closure, the syncytium was divided into uninuclear bacteriocytes, which surrounded the mass of bacteriocytes containing Profftella. Once fully surrounded, the bacteriocyte mass containing Profftella was fused into a syncytium. Prior to hatching, a pair of wing-like protrusions arose from both lateral sides of the bacteriome, which continued to grow throughout the nymphal stages. These findings provide a foundation for better understanding the intricate relationship between D. citri and its microbiota."

Previous studies indicated that semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), an axon guidance molecule, initiated inflammatory microglial activation and disrupted endothelial function in the CNS. However, whether Sema4D disrupts BBB integrity after stroke remains unclear. To study the effect of Sema4D on BBB disruption in stroke, rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and targeted injection of lentivirus-mediated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene disruption of PlexinB1. We found that Sema4D synchronously increased with BBB permeability and accumulated in the perivascular area after stroke. Suppressing Sema4D/ PlexinB1 signaling in the periinfarct cortex significantly decreased BBB permeability as detected by MRI and fibrin deposition, and thereby improved stroke outcome. In vitro, we confirmed that Sema4D disrupted BBB integrity and endothelial tight junctions. Moreover, we found that Sema4D induced pericytes to acquire a CD11b-positive phenotype and express proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, Sema4D inhibited AUF1-induced proinflammatory mRNA decay effect.

Initially, null mutation of RBPJ in the mouse uterus (Pgrcre/+Rbpjf/f; Rbpj c-KO) results in subfertility, but we have found that these mice become infertile after pregnancy as a result of dysfunctional postpartum uterine repair, including delayed endometrial epithelial and myometrial regeneration. RNA sequencing of postpartum uterine repair sites revealed global up-regulation of inflammatory pathways, including IFN signaling. Consistent with elevated IFN-γ, macrophages were recruited and polarized toward an M1-cytotoxic phenotype, which is associated with preventing repair and promoting further tissue injury. Through embryo transfer experiments, we show that dysfunctional postpartum repair directly impairs future embryo implantation in Rbpj c-KO mice. Last, we clinically correlated our findings from the Rbpj c-KO mouse in women diagnosed with uRPL. Reduced RBPJ in women with uRPL was associated with increased levels of IFN-γ.

https://openalex.org/W2773435161,"Mutations in the gene for the serine/threonine protein kinase PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) are the second most frequent cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). Via its kinase activity, PINK1 regulates neuronal cell survival and mitochondrial quality control. Numerous reports have revealed that PINK1 has diverse and physiologically significant functions, and therefore its activity should be tightly regulated. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating PINK1 stability and the modulator(s) involved have not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin E3 ligase carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) promotes PINK1 ubiquitination and decreases its steady-state levels. Moreover, PINK1 levels were strongly reduced in HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells exposed to the apoptosis-inducer staurosporine. Of note, we found that this reduction resulted from CHIP-mediated PINK1 ubiquitination. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated CHIP knockdown reduced susceptibility to staurosporine-induced cell death. Taken together, these findings suggest that CHIP plays a role in negative regulation of PINK1 stability and may suppress PINK1's cytoprotective effect during staurosporine-induced mammalian cell death. We propose that this PINK1 regulatory pathway might contribute to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis."

The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is a major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that modulates unfolded protein response (UPR), and mice with GRP78 heterozygosity were resistant to diet-induced obesity. Here, we show that mice with macrophage-selective ablation of GRP78 (Lyz-GRP78−/−)are protected from skeletal muscle insulin resistance without changes in obesity compared with wild-type mice after 9 wk of high-fat diet. GRP78-deficient macrophages demonstrated adapted UPR with up-regulation of activating transcription factor (ATF)-4 and M2-polarization markers. Diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation was reduced, and bone marrow-derived macrophages from Lyz-GRP78−/− mice demonstrated a selective increase in IL-6 expression.

Taken together, our data indicate that GRP78 deficiency activates UPR by increasing ATF-4, and promotes M2-polarization of macrophages with a selective increase in IL-6 secretion.

However, the activity and role of the Rv2633c protein in host colonization is unknown. Here, we analyzed the Rv2633c protein sequence, which revealed the presence of an HHE cation-binding domain common in hemerythrin-like proteins. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Rv2633c is a member of a distinct subset of hemerythrin-like proteins exclusive to mycobacteria. The Rv2633c sequence was significantly similar to protein sequences from other pathogenic strains within that subset, suggesting that these proteins are involved in mycobacteria virulence. We expressed and purified the Rv2633c protein in Escherichia coli and found that it contains two iron atoms, but does not behave like a hemerythrin. It migrated as a dimeric protein during size-exclusion chromatography. It was not possible to reduce the protein or observe any evidence for its interaction with O2. However, Rv2633c did exhibit catalase activity with a kcat of 1475 s−1 and Km of 10.1 ± 1.7 mm. Cyanide and azide inhibited the catalase activity with Ki values of 3.8 μm and 37.7 μm, respectively.

We note that Rv2633c is the first example of a non-heme di-iron catalase, and conclude that it is a member of a subset of hemerythrin-like proteins exclusive to mycobacteria, with likely roles in protection against host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2771363460,"A Swedish pedigree with an autosomal dominant inheritance of idiopathic scoliosis was initially studied by genetic linkage analysis, prioritising genomic regions for further analysis. This revealed a locus on chromosome 1 with a putative risk haplotype shared by all affected individuals. Two affected individuals were subsequently exome-sequenced, identifying a rare, non-synonymous variant in the CELSR2 gene. This variant is rs141489111, a c.G6859A change in exon 21 (NM_001408), leading to a predicted p.V2287I (NP_001399.1) change. This variant was found in all affected members of the pedigree, but showed reduced penetrance. Analysis of tagging variants in CELSR1-3 in a set of 1739 Swedish-Danish scoliosis cases and 1812 controls revealed significant association (p = 0.0001) to rs2281894, a common synonymous variant in CELSR2. This association was not replicated in case-control cohorts from Japan and the US. No association was found to variants in CELSR1 or CELSR3. Our findings suggest a rare variant in CELSR2 as causative for idiopathic scoliosis in a family with dominant segregation and further highlight common variation in CELSR2 in general susceptibility to idiopathic scoliosis in the Swedish-Danish population. Both variants are located in the highly conserved GAIN protein domain, which is necessary for the auto-proteolysis of CELSR2, suggesting its functional importance."
https://openalex.org/W2771392940,"Background To analyse and compare the impact of cardiovascular risk factors and disease on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with and without diabetes living in the community. Methods We used data of 1,905 people with diabetes and 19,031 people without diabetes from the last Spanish National Health Survey (years 2011–2012). The HRQoL instrument used was the EuroQol 5D-5L, based on time trade-off scores. Matching methods were used to assess any differences in the HRQoL in people with and without diabetes with the same characteristics (age, gender, education level, and healthy lifestyle), according to cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. Disparities were also analysed for every dimension of HRQoL: mobility, daily activities, personal care, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Results There were no significant differences in time trade-off scores between people with and without diabetes when cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease were not present. However, when cardiovascular risk factors were present, the HRQoL score was significantly lower in people with diabetes than in those without. This difference was indeed greater when cardiovascular diseases were present. More precisely, people with diabetes and any of the cardiovascular risk factors, who have not yet developed any cardiovascular disease, report lower HRQoL, 0.046 TTO score points over 1 (7.93 over 100 in the VAS score) compared to those without diabetes, and 0.14 TTO score points of difference (14.61 over 100 in the VAS score) if cardiovascular diseases were present. In fact, when the three risk factors were present in people with diabetes, HRQoL was significantly lower (0.10 TTO score points over 1 and 10.86 points over 100 in VAS score), obesity being the most influential risk factor. Conclusions The presence of established cardiovascular disease and/or cardiovascular risk factors, specially obesity, account for impaired quality of life in people with diabetes."

We have applied the updated 30-item STARD 2015 checklist to a set of studies included in a Cochrane DTA systematic review of imaging tools for diagnosing manifest glaucoma.Three pairs of reviewers, including one senior reviewer who assessed all studies, independently checked the adherence of each study to STARD 2015. Adherence was analyzed on an individual-item basis. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of publication year and impact factor on adherence.We included 106 DTA studies, published between 2003-2014 in journals with a median impact factor of 2.6. Overall adherence was 54.1% for 3,286 individual rating across 31 items, with a mean of 16.8 (SD: 3.1; range 8-23) items per study. Large variability in adherence to reporting standards was detected across individual STARD 2015 items, ranging from 0 to 100%. Nine items (1: identification as diagnostic accuracy study in title/abstract; 6: eligibility criteria; 10: index test (a) and reference standard (b) definition; 12: cut-off definitions for index test (a) and reference standard (b); 14: estimation of diagnostic accuracy measures; 21a: severity spectrum of diseased; 23: cross-tabulation of the index and reference standard results) were adequately reported in more than 90% of the studies. Conversely, 10 items (3: scientific and clinical background of the index test; 11: rationale for the reference standard; 13b: blinding of index test results; 17: analyses of variability; 18; sample size calculation; 19: study flow diagram; 20: baseline characteristics of participants; 28: registration number and registry; 29: availability of study protocol; 30: sources of funding) were adequately reported in less than 30% of the studies. Only four items showed a statistically significant improvement over time: missing data (16), baseline characteristics of participants (20), estimates of diagnostic accuracy (24) and sources of funding (30).Adherence to STARD 2015 among DTA studies in glaucoma research is incomplete, and only modestly increasing over time."

This social amoeba kills bacteria via phagocytosis for nutrient acquisition at its single-cell stage and for antibacterial defense at its multicellular stages. Here, we demonstrate that peroxidase A from D. discoideum (DdPoxA) is a stable, monomeric, glycosylated, and secreted heme peroxidase with homology to mammalian peroxidases.

Here, we present the biochemical characterization and the first crystal structure of DdPoxA and demonstrate that the overall structures and heme cavity architecture of mammalian peroxidases were already established very early in evolution.

The metalloenzyme is shown to follow the halogenation cycle and to catalyze the efficient two-electron oxidation of iodide and thiocyanate. Nevertheless, DdPoxA is a poor oxidizer of bromide and cannot mediate the oxidation of chloride. The presented in vivo investigations include a detailed expression pattern of DdpoxA throughout the development cycle of D. discoideum at the protein level together with comparative cell development studies on wildtype D. discoideum and the DdpoxA knockout mutant (ΔDdpoxA). It is demonstrated that the heme enzyme supports maintenance of sterility of the slug and the subsequently produced fruiting bodies, which suggests a role in antibacterial defense of the multicellular aggregate. Recombinant DdPoxA was successfully produced with an N-terminal His6 tag in the Pichia pastoris BG11 (ΔAOX1) strain. The secreted protein was purified by a two-step ammonium sulfate precipitation and, after resuspension, by affinity chromatography. The yield was found to be ∼50 mg/liter of P. pastoris supernatant and the purity number (RZ, ASoret/A280 nm) 1.1–1.2 indicating 90–95% heme occupancy. Fig. 1A depicts the UV-visible spectrum of ferric DdPoxA with the Soret maximum at 416 nm, Q-bands at 541 and 576 nm, and the charge transfer band at 644 nm (black spectrum). The secreted glycosylated peroxidase has three N-glycosylation sites at positions Asn-62, Asn-131, and Asn-338 as predicted by the on-line tool N-Glycosite (20Zhang M. Gaschen B. Blay W. Foley B. Haigwood N. Kuiken C. Korber B. Tracking global patterns of N-linked glycosylation site variation in highly variable viral glycoproteins: HIV, SIV, and HCV envelopes and influenza hemagglutinin.Glycobiology. 2004; 14 (15175256): 1229-124610.1093/glycob/cwh106Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Analysis of the protein by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting showed hyperglycosylation, which is typical for recombinant protein expressed in P. pastoris (data not shown). Thus, deglycosylation of recombinant DdPoxA by Endo Hf glucosidase was performed, followed by SEC purification. Deglycosylation had no impact on the UV-visible and ECD spectral features in the far-UV, near-UV, and visible range, clearly suggesting that the overall and heme cavity architecture were not affected (compare black and gray spectra in Fig. 1, A–C). Between pH 5.0 and pH 9.0, the spectral features of DdPoxA remained unchanged (data not shown). In the homologous lactoperoxidase (LPO) (orange spectrum in Fig. 1, A–C) the Soret band is blue-shifted as is evident by the respective UV-visible (412 nm) and ECD (minimum at 406 nm) spectra, which clearly suggest differences in the heme cavity architecture compared with DdPoxA. It is well known that LPO has two heme to protein ester bonds derived from a hydrogen peroxide-mediated post-translational modification (18Zederbauer M. Furtmüller P.G. Brogioni S. Jakopitsch C. Smulevich G. Obinger C. Heme to protein linkages in mammalian peroxidases: impact on spectroscopic, redox and catalytic properties.Nat. Prod.

The involved acidic amino acids (Asp-225 and Glu-375, goat LPO numbering) are fully conserved in family 1 peroxidases (Fig. S1). Interestingly, the sequence alignment shown in Fig. S1 suggests that DdPoxA has only one covalent link between the 1-methyl substituent of the prosthetic group and Glu-236, because the DdPoxA residue corresponding to Asp-225 of LPO is an isoleucine. Differences in the active-site architecture were also reflected by spectroelectrochemical investigations of DdPoxA at pH 7.0. Upon reduction of ferric to ferrous DdPoxA, its Soret peak shifts from 416 to 428 nm. Fig. 1D shows a representative family of spectra at different applied potentials in the OTTLE cell. The calculated reduction potential, E′0, for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, determined from the corresponding Nernst plot (inset to Fig. 1D), was calculated to be −0.276 ± 0.010 V, which is significantly more negative compared with LPO (−0.176 V) (23Battistuzzi G.

Importantly, incubation of recombinant DdPoxA with low micromolar hydrogen peroxide altered neither its UV-visible and ECD spectral features nor the standard reduction potential (data not shown). This suggests that the autocatalytic post-translational modification of the heme group (24Ortiz de Montellano, P.

By contrast, for other members of this heme peroxidase superfamily addition of excess H2O2 was necessary to complete the post-translational modification, which was reflected by changes in spectral and redox properties (25Auer M.

Next, we probed the presence of the proposed covalent heme to protein ester bond in deglycosylated DdPoxA by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A). The resulting chromatogram shows four major peaks, whereby peak 1 (60,583.7 Da) was assigned to DdPoxA with three N-acetyl-d-glucosamines (GlcNAcs) and a covalently bound heme. Peaks 2 and 3 in the chromatogram (60,745.7 and 60,906.9 Da) represent DdPoxA carrying one and two additional hexoses (162 Da each). Peptide mapping revealed that these hexoses derive from single O-glycosylations at positions Thr-133 and Thr-142, which were not cleaved during deglycosylation (data not shown). The minor peak 4 (60,196 Da) was assigned to a degradation product lacking four histidines from the N-terminal His6 tag. Most importantly, no peak could be assigned to protein without covalently bound heme. The presence of a covalently bound heme in DdPoxA was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and visualization of the blotted proteins was by enhanced chemiluminescence. Note that unbound heme is lost during SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fig. 2B compares LPO, DdPoxA, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The latter carries non-covalently bound heme b at the active site. It is clearly demonstrated that both LPO and DdPoxA but not HRP exhibited chemiluminescence at the respective protein bands, demonstrating covalent heme attachment. Furthermore, we probed the oligomeric state of deglycosylated DdPoxA by SEC-MALS. Fig. 2C depicts a sharp peak at a retention time at 20.3 min in the corresponding chromatogram. By using MALS, an average molar mass of 63.4 kDa was calculated, which is similar to the theoretical mass (60.7 kDa) and suggests the presence of a monomer. Finally, we investigated the thermal stability of DdPoxA using differential scanning calorimetry and temperature-dependent ECD experiments (Fig. 3). In the DSC experiment, ferric glycosylated DdPoxA showed two independent unfolding events with Tm values of 71.1 and 80.4 °C, respectively, at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3A). The thermal stability rapidly decreases at alkaline pH, whereas stability is retained in the acidic region until pH 5.0 (Fig. 3B). Complementary temperature-dependent ECD measurements of glycosylated DdPoxA at pH 7.0 showed a mid-point transition of 62 °C in the far-UV at 208 nm reflecting unfolding of the secondary structure (Fig. 3C). The overall secondary structures of deglycosylated DdPoxA and LPO were slightly less stable (Tm = 59.6 °C). In the visible region at 408 nm, glycosylated DdPoxA showed a Tm value of 74.3 °C suggesting that the second endotherm in the DSC thermogram reflects unfolding of the heme cavity (Fig. 3D). The corresponding Tm values of deglycosylated DdPoxA and LPO were found to be at 68.3 and 75.1 °C, respectively. Crystal structures of deglycosylated DdPoxA (space group P 31 2 1) (Table 1) comprises two DdPoxA molecules per asymmetric unit (r.m.s.d. value between the two chains: 0.54 Å calculated over 508 Cα atoms, PDB code 6ERC). The structure was solved to 2.5 Å resolution by molecular replacement using the balbes web server (29Long F. Vagin A.A. Young P. Murshudov G.N. BALBES: a molecular-replacement pipeline.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64 (18094476): 125-13210.1107/S0907444907050172Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows the overall largely α-helical structural organization of DdPoxA. Only three small antiparallel β-strands (residues Phe-43–Pro-46, Ala-141–Glu-143, and Tyr-160–Asn-164) are present. The protein is composed of 21 α-helices of varying length. The central core of the molecule consists of five long α-helices (H2, H6, H7, H8, and H13) with the covalently attached heme group. A very similar architecture is found in LPO (core helices are H2, H5, H6, H8, and H12) (r.m.s.d. value between the chain A of DdPoxA and goat LPO (PDB code 2R5L) is 1.61 Å calculated over 444 Cα atoms, Z-score is 13.4) (22Singh A.K.

The conserved distal residues Gln-97 and His-101 are found in helix 2, whereas the proximal His-325 belongs to helix 8 and the proximal Asn-403 and Arg-406 are part of helix 13. As in LPO, the core helices form triangles (H6, H7, and H8 in DdPoxA and H5, H6, and H8 in LPO), whereby the heme group is located between helix 2 and 8 (22Singh A.K. Singh N. Sharma S. Singh S.B.

Open table in a new tab The heme environment of DdPoxA shows a striking sequence similarity to LPO (Fig. S1). The important catalytic residues on the distal heme site (His-101, Gln-97, and Arg-233) are fully conserved, including Glu-236 that forms an ester bond with the 1-methyl substituent of the heme porphyrin ring (Fig. 4B and Fig. S2). However, DdPoxA lacks the covalent ester bond that is formed between the heme and the distal aspartate in LPO, because the corresponding residue in DdPoxA is an isoleucine. The position of the distal Ca2+-binding site is conserved; however, different residues are involved in binding of the ion. In LPO, the Ca2+-binding site consists of the residues Asp, Asp, Ser, Tyr, and Phe, and in DdPoxA, the ion is coordinated by Asn-102, Gly-167, Tyr-169, Asp-171, and Asn-173. The proximal triad His-325, Asn-403, and Arg-406 is fully conserved between the two enzymes (Fig. 4, C and D). The polypeptide chain of DdPoxA contains eight cysteines, six of which are involved in disulfide bridges (Cys-120–Cys-128, Cys-146–Cys-159, and Cys-277–Cys-505) (Fig. 4A). In comparison, LPO has 15 cysteine residues, forming seven intramolecular disulfide bridges. None of the disulfide bridges are conserved between DdPoxA and LPO. DdPoxA contains three N-glycosylation sites (Asn-62, Asn-131, and Asn-338), which are all occupied by complex sugar moieties in the recombinant protein. However, in the crystal structure, only one GlcNAc is left on each N-glycosylation site due to the deglycosylation procedure (see also Fig. 2A). In comparison, LPO shows four N-glycosylation sites, and none of them is conserved between the two proteins. Approximate bottlenecks of the substrate channel were determined by tunnel calculations using CAVER 3.0. The most important channels of both, DdPoxA and goat LPO, are given by throughput values of 0.75 and 0.79, respectively (throughput values range from 0 to 1; the higher the value, the greater the probability that the tunnel is functionally relevant). The bottleneck radii 1.19 Å (DdPoxA) and 1.22 Å (LPO) are very similar, but their length differs significantly with 8.61 Å (DdPoxA) compared with 4.85 Å (LPO) (Fig. 4E). Finally, we probed the accessibility and binding kinetics of cyanide to the heme cavity of ferric DdPoxA. Upon cyanide binding, the high-spin (S = 5/2) ferric protein is converted into the low-spin ferric protein (S = 1/2), thereby shifting the Soret maximum from 416 to 425 nm with a clear isosbestic point at 420 nm. In the visible range, a typical low-spin peak at 541 nm arose, whereas the peaks at 576 and 644 nm disappeared (Fig. 5A). Plotting the single exponentially fitted pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) versus cyanide concentration yielded an apparent second-order dissociation rate constant (kon) of 3.3 × 105 m−1 s−1 (KD = koff/kon = 3.7 μm), which was ∼5-fold lower than for MPO (kon = 1.6 × 106 m−1 s−1, KD = 1.9 μm) and LPO (kon = 1.3 × 106 m−1 s−1, KD = 23 μm) (17Furtmüller P.G.

https://openalex.org/W2775204416,"Inhibiting fatty acid oxidation is one approach to lowering glucose levels in diabetes. Skeletal muscle specific Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1b knockout mice (Cpt1bm-/-) comprise a model of impaired fat oxidation; and have decreased fat mass and enhanced glucose disposal and muscle oxidative capacity compared to controls. However, unfavorable effects occur relative to controls when Cpt1bm-/- mice are fed a 25% fat diet, including decreased activity and fat free mass and increased intramuscular lipid and serum myoglobin. In this study we explore if a low fat, high carbohydrate diet can ablate the unfavorable effects while maintaining the favorable phenotype in Cpt1bm-/- mice. Mice were fed either 10% fat (low fat) or 25% fat (chow) diet. Body composition was measured biweekly and indirect calorimetry was performed. Low fat diet abolishes the decreased activity, fat, and fat free mass seen in Cpt1bm-/- mice fed chow diet. Low fat diet also reduces serum myoglobin levels in Cpt1bm-/- mice and diminishes differences in IGF-1 seen between Cpt1bm-/- mice and control mice fed chow diet. Glucose tolerance tests reveal that glucose clearance is improved in Cpt1bm-/- mice relative to controls regardless of diet, and serum analysis shows increased levels of muscle derived FGF21. Electron microscopic analyses and measurements of mRNA transcripts show increased intramuscular lipids, FGF21, mitochondrial and oxidative capacity markers regardless of diet. The favorable metabolic phenotype of Cpt1bm-/- mice therefore remains consistent regardless of diet; and a combination of a low fat diet and pharmacological inhibition of CPT1b may offer remedies to reduce blood glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2774272020,"IQGAP1 interacts with a number of binding partners through a calponin homology domain (CHD), a WW motif, IQ repeats, a Ras GAP-related domain (GRD), and a conserved C-terminal (CT) domain. Among various biological and cellular functions, IQGAP1 is known to play a role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics during membrane ruffling and lamellipodium protrusion. In addition, phosphorylation near the CT domain is thought to control IQGAP1 activity through regulation of intramolecular interaction. In a previous study, we discovered that IQGAP1 preferentially localizes to retracting areas in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, not areas of membrane ruffling and lamellipodium protrusion. Nothing is known of the domains needed for retraction localization and very little is known of IQGAP1 function in the actin cytoskeleton of melanoma cells. Thus, we examined localization of IQGAP1 mutants to retracting areas, and characterized knock down phenotypes on tissue culture plastic and physiologic-stiffness hydrogels. Localization of IQGAP1 mutants (S1441E/S1443D, S1441A/S1443A, ΔCHD, ΔGRD or ΔCT) to retracting and protruding cell edges were measured. In retracting areas there was a decrease in S1441A/S1443A, ΔGRD and ΔCT localization, a minor decrease in ΔCHD localization, and normal localization of the S1441E/S1443D mutant. In areas of cell protrusion just behind the lamellipodium leading edge, we surprisingly observed both ΔGRD and ΔCT localization, and increased number of microtubules. IQGAP1 knock down caused loss of cell polarity on laminin-coated glass, decreased proliferation on tissue culture polystyrene, and abnormal spheroid growth on laminin-coated hydrogels. We propose that the GRD and CT domains regulate IQGAP1 localization to retracting actin networks to promote a tumorigenic role in melanoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2773302227,"B. subtilis adapts to changing environments by reprogramming its genetic expression through a variety of transcriptional regulators from the global transition state regulators that allow a complete resetting of the cell genetic expression, to stress specific regulators controlling only a limited number of key genes required for optimal adaptation. Among them, MarR-type transcriptional regulators are known to respond to a variety of stresses including antibiotics or oxidative stress, and to control catabolic or virulence gene expression. Here we report the characterization of the ydcFGH operon of B. subtilis, containing a putative MarR-type transcriptional regulator. Using a combination of molecular genetics and high-throughput approaches, we show that this regulator, renamed PamR, controls directly its own expression and influence the expression of large sets of prophage-related and metabolic genes. The extent of the regulon impacted by PamR suggests that this regulator reprograms the metabolic landscape of B. subtilis in response to a yet unknown signal."
https://openalex.org/W2773753814,"Foliage echoes could play an important role in the sensory ecology of echolocating bats, but many aspects of their sensory information content remain to be explored. A realistic numerical model for these echoes could support the development of hypotheses for the relationship between foliage properties and echo parameters. In prior work by the authors, a simple foliage model based on circular disks distributed uniformly in space has been developed. In the current work, three key simplifications used in this model have been examined: (i) representing leaves as circular disks, (ii) neglecting shading effects between leaves, and (iii) the uniform spatial distribution of the leaves. The target strengths of individual leaves and shading between them have been examined in physical experiments, whereas the impact of the spatial leaf distribution has been studied by modifying the numerical model to include leaf distributions according to a biomimetic model for natural branching patterns (L-systems). Leaf samples from a single species (leatherleaf arrowwood) were found to match the relationship between size and target strength of the disk model fairly well, albeit with a large variability part of which could be due to unaccounted geometrical features of the leaves. Shading between leaf-sized disks did occur for distances below 50 cm and could hence impact the echoes. Echoes generated with L-system models in two distinct tree species (ginkgo and pine) showed consistently more temporal inhomogeneity in the envelope amplitudes than a reference with uniform distribution. However, these differences were small compared to effects found in response to changes in the relative orientation of simulated sonar beam and foliage. These findings support the utility of the uniform leaf distribution model and suggest that bats could use temporal inhomogeneities in the echoes to make inferences regarding the relative positioning of their sonar and a foliage."
https://openalex.org/W2774116296,"Positive feedbacks in drivers of degradation can cause threshold responses in natural ecosystems. Though threshold responses have received much attention in studies of aquatic ecosystems, they have been neglected in terrestrial systems, such as forests, where the long time-scales required for monitoring have impeded research. In this study we explored the role of positive feedbacks in a temperate forest that has been monitored for 50 years and is undergoing dieback, largely as a result of death of the canopy dominant species (Fagus sylvatica, beech). Statistical analyses showed strong non-linear losses in basal area for some plots, while others showed relatively gradual change. Beech seedling density was positively related to canopy openness, but a similar relationship was not observed for saplings, suggesting a feedback whereby mortality in areas with high canopy openness was elevated. We combined this observation with empirical data on size- and growth-mediated mortality of trees to produce an individual-based model of forest dynamics. We used this model to simulate changes in the structure of the forest over 100 years under scenarios with different juvenile and mature mortality probabilities, as well as a positive feedback between seedling and mature tree mortality. This model produced declines in forest basal area when critical juvenile and mature mortality probabilities were exceeded. Feedbacks in juvenile mortality caused a greater reduction in basal area relative to scenarios with no feedback. Non-linear, concave declines of basal area occurred only when mature tree mortality was 3–5 times higher than rates observed in the field. Our results indicate that the longevity of trees may help to buffer forests against environmental change and that the maintenance of old, large trees may aid the resilience of forest stands. In addition, our work suggests that dieback of forests may be avoidable providing pressures on mature and juvenile trees do not pass critical thresholds."
https://openalex.org/W2773160063,"Microcystins are secondary metabolites produced by several freshwater, bloom-forming cyanobacterial species. Microcystin-producing cyanobacteria co-occur with a complex community of heterotrophic bacteria. Though conflicting, studies suggest that microcystins affect the physiology of heterotrophic bacteria by inducing oxidative stress and increasing cell envelope permeability. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that exposure to microcystin should induce differential expression in genes responding to oxidative and envelope stress and trigger shifts in metabolite pools. We tested this hypothesis by exposing Escherichia coli MG1655 to 1 and 10 mg/L microcystin-LR and monitored global changes to gene expression, cellular metabolite pools, and lipid composition using RNA-sequencing and UPLC-MS. Contrary to reported studies, we observed no evidence that microcystin-LR induced oxidative or cell envelope stress in E. coli under the tested conditions. Our results suggest a potential difference in mechanism by which microcystin-LR interacts with heterotrophic bacteria vs. cyanobacteria."

However, as neurosurgeons advance in their careers, they tend to narrow their practice and increase volumes in certain specific types of operations. Failing to test the type of procedures most relevant to the practitioner is a lost opportunity to improve the knowledge and practice of the individual neurosurgeon. In this study, we assess the neurosurgical community's appetite for designations of board-recognized Recognized Focused Practice (RFP). We administered a validated, online, confidential survey to 4,899 neurosurgeons (2,435 American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS) Diplomates participating in MOC, 1,440 Diplomates certified prior to 1999 (grandfathered), and 1,024 retired Diplomates). We received 1,449 responses overall (30% response rate). A plurality of respondents were in practice 11-15 years (18.5%), in private practice (40%) and participate in MOC (61%). 49% of respondents felt that a RFP designation would not be helpful. For the 30% who felt that RFP would be helpful, 61.3% felt that it would support recognition by their hospital or practice, it would motivate them to stay current on medical knowledge (53.4%), or it would help attract patients (46.4%;). The most popular suggestions for RFP were Spine (56.2%), Cerebrovascular (62.9%), Pediatrics (64.1%), and Functional/Stereotactic (52%). A plurality of neurosurgeons (35.7%) felt that RFP should recognize neurosurgeons with accredited and non-accredited fellowship experience and sub-specialty experience. Ultimately, Recognized Focused Practice may provide value to individual neurosurgeons, but the neurosurgical community shows tepid interest for pursuing this designation."

https://openalex.org/W2771521185,"Studying folding and assembly of naturally occurring α-helical transmembrane proteins can inspire the design of membrane proteins with defined functions. Thus far, most studies have focused on the role of membrane-integrated protein regions. However, to fully understand folding pathways and stabilization of α-helical membrane proteins, it is vital to also include the role of soluble loops. We have analyzed the impact of interhelical loops on folding, assembly and stability of the heme-containing four-helix bundle transmembrane protein cytochrome b6 that is involved in charge transfer across biomembranes. Cytochrome b6 consists of two transmembrane helical hairpins that sandwich two heme molecules. Our analyses strongly suggest that the loop connecting the helical hairpins is not crucial for positioning the two protein ""halves"" for proper folding and assembly of the holo-protein. Furthermore, proteolytic removal of any of the remaining two loops, which connect the two transmembrane helices of a hairpin structure, appears to also not crucially effect folding and assembly. Overall, the transmembrane four-helix bundle appears to be mainly stabilized via interhelical interactions in the transmembrane regions, while the soluble loop regions guide assembly and stabilize the holo-protein. The results of this study might steer future strategies aiming at designing heme-binding four-helix bundle structures, involved in transmembrane charge transfer reactions."
