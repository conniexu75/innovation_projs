https://openalex.org/W1971451591,"Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) access silent chromatin and initiate cell-fate changes, using diverse types of DNA binding domains (DBDs). FoxA, the paradigm pioneer TF, has a winged helix DBD that resembles linker histone and thereby binds its target sites on nucleosomes and in compacted chromatin. Herein, we compare the nucleosome and chromatin targeting activities of Oct4 (POU DBD), Sox2 (HMG box DBD), Klf4 (zinc finger DBD), and c-Myc (bHLH DBD), which together reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency. Purified Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 proteins can bind nucleosomes in vitro, and in vivo they preferentially target silent sites enriched for nucleosomes. Pioneer activity relates simply to the ability of a given DBD to target partial motifs displayed on the nucleosome surface. Such partial motif recognition can occur by coordinate binding between factors. Our findings provide insight into how pioneer factors can target naive chromatin sites."

Though it has been recently shown in the context of liver models, demonstrating the applicability of this approach to other systems by delineating the molecular mechanisms guiding organ bud formation is critical. Here, we demonstrate a generalized method for organ bud formation from diverse tissues by combining pluripotent stem cell-derived tissue-specific progenitors or relevant tissue samples with endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The MSCs initiated condensation within these heterotypic cell mixtures, which was dependent upon substrate matrix stiffness. Defining optimal mechanical properties promoted formation of 3D, transplantable organ buds from tissues including kidney, pancreas, intestine, heart, lung, and brain. Transplanted pancreatic and renal buds were rapidly vascularized and self-organized into functional, tissue-specific structures. These findings provide a general platform for harnessing mechanical properties to generate vascularized, complex organ buds with broad applications for regenerative medicine."

Here, we report a hypoxic response that depends on the accumulation of lactate, a metabolite whose production increases in hypoxic conditions. We find that the NDRG3 protein is degraded in a PHD2/VHL-dependent manner in normoxia but is protected from destruction by binding to lactate that accumulates under hypoxia.

Our study, therefore, elucidates the molecular basis for lactate-induced hypoxia signaling, which can be exploited for the development of therapies targeting hypoxia-induced diseases. Oxygen homeostasis is essential for metazoan physiology. Under low oxygen conditions, cells resort to hypoxia-induced responses to adapt to and survive harsh environments (Cassavaugh and Lounsbury, 2011Cassavaugh J. Lounsbury K.M. Hypoxia-mediated biological control.J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Hypoxia responses are an integral part of normal physiology during embryonic development and postnatal life. They are also pathophysiologic components of many disorders, including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases. Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) play central roles in hypoxia responses by controlling the expression of a host of hypoxia-responsive genes functioning in diverse processes, including metabolism, oxygen delivery, pH regulation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and survival (Harris, 2002Harris A.L. Hypoxia—a key regulatory factor in tumour growth.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4263) Google Scholar, Cassavaugh and Lounsbury, 2011Cassavaugh J. Lounsbury K.M. Hypoxia-mediated biological control.J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In particular, the HIF-mediated upregulation of glycolysis and suppression of the citric acid (TCA) cycle is a crucial adaptive response at the early stage of hypoxia (Cassavaugh and Lounsbury, 2011Cassavaugh J. Lounsbury K.M. Hypoxia-mediated biological control.J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The expression and activity of HIFs are tightly regulated by oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of their α subunits (Semenza, 2003Semenza G.L. Targeting HIF-1 for cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that hypoxia has many aspects that are not explained by HIF-mediated mechanisms alone. For example, the inhibition of HIF-mediated pathways does not always prevent tumor growth; tumors derived from HIF-1α-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells have growth advantages owing to decreased hypoxia-induced apoptosis and increased stress-induced proliferation (Carmeliet et al., 1998Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. et al.Role of HIF-1alpha in hypoxia-mediated apoptosis, cell proliferation and tumour angiogenesis.Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). A number of reports suggest that tumor angiogenesis constitutes the major pathway of HIF-independent tumorigenesis. Thus, angiogenesis was preserved when HIF1A was knocked-out in ES cells (Höpfl et al., 2002Höpfl G. Wenger R.H. Ziegler U. Stallmach T. Gardelle O. Achermann R. Wergin M. Kaser-Hotz B. Saunders H.M. Williams K.J. et al.Rescue of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-deficient tumor growth by wild-type cells is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2962-2970PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the pro-angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), can be induced via both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways (Mizukami et al., 2004Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1-independent regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by hypoxia in colon cancer.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Induction of other pro-angiogenic factors such as IL-8 preserves the angiogenic response in HIF-1α-deficient colon cancer cells (Mizukami et al., 2005Mizukami Y. Jo W.S. Duerr E.M. Gala M. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Zukerberg L.R. Kohgo Y. et al.Induction of interleukin-8 preserves the angiogenic response in HIF-1alpha-deficient colon cancer cells.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Moreover, multiple pathways and transcription factors (TFs) other than HIFs are known to respond to hypoxia to induce biological responses in a HIF-independent manner. Among those oxygen-regulatable TFs are NF-κB, AP-1, and CEBP, which are activated in hypoxia (Cummins and Taylor, 2005Cummins E.P. Taylor C.T. Hypoxia-responsive transcription factors.Pflugers Arch. 2005; 450: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Consequently, several reports demonstrated that some of the genes regulated by hypoxia were not regulated by HIFs, suggesting a role for other oxygen-regulated pathways that are, similar to HIF pathways, controlled by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes (Elvidge et al., 2006Elvidge G.P. Glenny L. Appelhoff R.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Ragoussis J. Gleadle J.M. Concordant regulation of gene expression by hypoxia and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase inhibition: the role of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, and other pathways.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15215-15226Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Also, a number of protein kinases such as PKA, PKC, PI3K, AKT, JNK, PTK2B (Pyk2), SRC, MAPK14 (p38), and ERK1/2 are reported to be activated in hypoxia (Seta et al., 2002Seta K.A. Spicer Z. Yuan Y. Lu G. Millhorn D.E. Responding to hypoxia: lessons from a model cell line.Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: re11PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite all of these studies, key elements and mechanisms responsible for oxygen-dependent regulation of the HIF-independent branch of hypoxia responses remain elusive. In this study, we identified an oxygen-regulated protein, NDRG3 (NDRG family member 3; NM_032013), as a bona fide substrate of the PHD2/VHL system. NDRG3 was highly induced under oxygen-limited conditions in diverse cell types, although its mRNA expression was independent of HIF levels under hypoxia. Interestingly, NDRG3 required binding by the glycolytic end-product lactate for its hypoxic accumulation, rendering its expression indirectly dependent on HIF expression as HIF-1α regulates the hypoxic expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). We found that NDRG3 plays critical roles in lactate-induced hypoxia signaling by mediating the activation of the Raf-ERK pathway to promote angiogenesis and cell growth during prolonged hypoxia. Thus, NDRG3 provides a critical genetic element for the oxygen- and lactate-dependent regulation of prolonged hypoxia responses. To identify the regulators of hypoxia responses, we searched for PHD2-binding proteins in MCF-7 cells expressing Flag-tagged PHD2 via Flag-mediated immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. Among the candidates enriched in the protein bands reproducibly exhibiting differential immunoprecipitation patterns between mock and PHD2-Flag fractions, we chose NDRG3 for further studies since it belongs to a gene family implicated in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as in differentiation and development (Melotte et al., 2010Melotte V. Qu X. Ongenaert M. van Criekinge W. de Bruïne A.P. Baldwin H.S. van Engeland M. The N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG) family: diverse functions, multiple applications.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 4153-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which are biological features closely associated with hypoxia (Harris, 2002Harris A.L. Hypoxia—a key regulatory factor in tumour growth.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4263) Google Scholar, Cassavaugh and Lounsbury, 2011Cassavaugh J. Lounsbury K.M. Hypoxia-mediated biological control.J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). To characterize NDRG3 in detail, we developed an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody specific to NDRG3 among the human NDRG family members (Figure S1B). This antibody detected NDRG3 as a 42-KDa band in the PHD2-Flag immunoprecipitation fraction (Figure 1A). We verified the NDRG3-PHD2 interaction by immunoprecipitating endogenous NDRG3 with PHD2-Flag from HeLa cells grown under hypoxia (Figure 1B) and directly by a pull-down assay using recombinant PHD2-His and NDRG3-GST proteins (Figure S1C). Thus, we concluded that NDRG3 is a bona fide PHD2-binding protein. We then examined possible functional relationships between PHD2 and NDRG3 using a PHD inhibitor, desferrioxamine (DFX). Although the basal-level expression of NDRG3 was negligible, PHD inhibition caused its dose-dependent accumulation in HeLa (Figure 1C) and MCF-7 cells (Figure S1D). These results were reproducible with two other PHD inhibitors, dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) and CoCl2 (Figure S1E), suggesting that the NDRG3 protein expression might be under PHD-mediated posttranslational control. We then examined different PHD family members for their involvement in the regulation of NDRG3 by silencing their expression under normoxia using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The analysis results revealed that, as in the case of HIF-1α, PHD2 is the major regulator of NDRG3 expression among the PHD family members (Figure 1D, left). This was supported by the identification of differential interactions between NDRG3 and PHD2 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Figure S1F). Depletion of VHL, the targeting element of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, also caused NDRG3 accumulation under normoxia (Figure 1D, right), suggesting that NDRG3 is likely a target of PHD2/VHL-mediated posttranslational modification. To address this point more thoroughly, we prepared several variants of the NDRG3 protein carrying single amino acid changes in their putative PHD2-docking site, predicted from a docking model between a putative NDRG3 structure and the published PHD2 structure (Chowdhury et al., 2009Chowdhury R. McDonough M.A. Mecinović J. Loenarz C. Flashman E. Hewitson K.S. Domene C. Schofield C.J. Structural basis for binding of hypoxia-inducible factor to the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylases.Structure. 2009; 17: 981-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Figure S1G). A co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that the NDRG3 mutants could be ranked according to their PHD2-binding strengths in the following order: V296D > Q97E > R47D ≈ N66D, which, interestingly, appeared to be inversely correlated with their protein expression levels in normoxia (Figure 1E). Moreover, NDRG3 variants retaining higher affinity for PHD2 co-immunoprecipitated higher amount of HA-tagged VHL protein (Figure 1E), indicating that the interaction of NDRG3 with PHD2 and VHL is a critical determinant of its protein expression. Next, in an in vivo ubiquitination assay, the amount of ubiquitin immunoprecipitated with NDRG3 was increased by overexpression of NDRG3, while it was decreased by silencing of its expression by different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Figures 1F and S1H). In addition, proteasome inhibition with MG132 dramatically increased the detected levels of NDRG3 in HeLa cells (Figure S1I). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NDRG3 is a PHD2-interacting protein whose expression is negatively regulated by PHD2/VHL-mediated proteasomal pathways. Since PHD2 critically depends on O2 availability for its activity, we examined whether the NDRG3 protein expression is regulated in an oxygen-dependent manner. NDRG3 accumulated in MCF-7 cells at rates that were inversely correlated with O2 concentrations (Figures 2A and S2A). Consistent with this, NDRG3 ubiquitination was significantly suppressed in HeLa cells under hypoxia (Figure 2B). The hypoxic induction of NDRG3 was demonstrated in cancer cells of diverse tissue origins as well as in non-transformed cells (Figure S2B), suggesting a universality of the phenomenon. However, in contrast to HIF-1α protein showing a sort of bell-shaped induction pattern at the early stage of hypoxia, NDRG3 exhibited a sigmoidal expression pattern, starting when HIF-1α levels began to decline and lasting until later stages of hypoxia (Figure 2C). The hypoxic expression of NDRG3 slowly diminished as cells were reoxygenated (Figure S2C). These results strongly suggest that NDRG3 protein expression is negatively regulated by oxygen.Figure S2Expression Pattern of NDRG3 under Hypoxia, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Confocal fluorescence microscopy of NDRG3 protein expression during hypoxia.

Huh-1 cells were transfected with pooled small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting HIF-1β or a non-targeting control siRNA pool and cultured under a normoxic or hypoxic condition for the indicated time period. Gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Next, we investigated the molecular basis of the oxygen-dependent regulation of NDRG3 protein expression. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that NDRG3 is specifically hydroxylated at proline 294, suggesting that it might be the residue modified by PHD2 (Figure 2D). Site-directed mutagenesis of proline 294 to alanine (P294A) resulted in pronounced accumulation of the variant protein in normoxia (Figure 2E, left). Moreover, a co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that the P294A mutant protein possessed a significantly reduced binding affinity for PHD2 and VHL proteins compared to wild-type (Figure 2E, right), indicating that proline 294 is the critical target site of PHD2-mediated hydroxylation that determines NDRG3 protein stability in normoxia. Since the expression of HIF-1α immediately preceded that of NDRG3 (Figure 2C), we investigated the possibility of HIF-1α transcriptionally regulating NDRG3 expression during hypoxia. RT-PCR analysis showed that NDRG3 mRNA level remained virtually unchanged during hypoxia, even when HIF proteins reached their peak levels (Figure S2D). This result indicates the HIF independence of NDRG3 transcription and confirms the posttranslational nature of NDRG3 expression during hypoxia. Depletion of different subunits of HIF had no effects on NDRG3 mRNA levels, confirming the HIF independence of its transcription (Figure 2F). It is noteworthy that although NDRG3 protein expression in hypoxia was clearly detectable in HIF-silenced cells, it was significantly reduced compared to control by HIF-1β knockdown and, to a much lesser extent, by HIF-1α knockdown, suggesting a potential non-transcriptional effect of the HIF pathway on NDRG3 protein expression. Meanwhile, we could show that HIF played a role as a transcriptional activator for the hypoxic expression of another NDRG family member, NDRG1 (Figure S2E). These results collectively indicate that HIF activity is not required for the transcriptional regulation of NDRG3 expression during hypoxia. We investigated the potential functions of NDRG3 in hypoxia by correlating its protein expression profile with the genomic activity profile of five gene ontology categories representative of hypoxia responses (Figure S3A). The genomic activity of a gene ontology was estimated via the gene set enrichment analysis, whereby a standardized difference score (Z score) was calculated from transcriptome expression data of Huh-7 cells at a particular time point during hypoxia. The results showed that NDRG3 protein expression was highly correlated with the activity of “angiogenesis,” “anti-apoptosis,” “proliferation (positive),” and “motility” functions but not with “glycolysis” (Figure 3A). On the other hand, depletion of NDRG3 at 24 hr under hypoxia, when cellular NDRG3 protein expression should have otherwise reached a significant level, caused significant changes in the activity of “angiogenesis,” “anti-apoptosis,” “proliferation (positive),” and “motility” categories but not that of “glycolysis” (Figure 3B). In contrast, “glycolysis” was significantly targeted by HIF-1α depletion at 6 hr under hypoxia, when HIF-1α protein expression is expected to have reached its peak level (Figure S3B). Consistently, the ectopic expression of a normoxia-stable variant of NDRG3 (N66D in Figure 1E) caused the upregulation (>1.5-fold) of genes having primary functions in angiogenesis > proliferation ≈ growth ≈ apoptosis ≈ migration > glycolysis (Figure S3C).Figure 3NDRG3 Is a Critical Regulator of Prolonged Hypoxia ResponsesShow full caption(A) Correlation analyses between the NDRG3 protein expression during hypoxia and the activity of five representative hypoxia-responsive gene sets.(B) Changes in the activity of hypoxia-responsive gene sets upon NDRG3 silencing in Huh-7 cells at 24 hr under hypoxia (1% O2).(C) Matrigel plug assay of NDRG3-mediated angiogenic activity.

We then experimentally evaluated the roles of NDRG3 in “angiogenesis,” “anti-apoptosis,” and “proliferation,” the functions often implicated in tumor growth and significantly targeted by NDRG3 depletion (Figure 3B). In tube forming assays using HUVEC cells, NDRG3 depletion caused significant suppression of the angiogenic activity induced by hypoxia in Huh-7 cells (Figure S3D). In parallel, the Matrigel plug assay showed that NDRG3 knockdown inhibited the angiogenic activity of Huh-7 cells in BALB/c-nu mice (Figure 3C). At the molecular level, hypoxia-induced expression of pro-angiogenic markers was abolished by NDRG3 depletion, while it was upregulated in normoxia by NDRG3(N66D) (Figure 3D). Next, examination of the anti-apoptotic activity of NDRG3 via caspase-3/7 and PARP cleavage assays indicated that NDRG3 depletion significantly promotes apoptosis in hypoxia (Figure 3E). Accordingly, the hypoxia-induced expression of anti-apoptotic genes, notably members of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) family, was abolished by NDRG3 depletion in Huh-7 cells (Figure 3F). Moreover, the depletion of NDRG3 using an shRNA targeting its 3′-UTR (Figure S1H, #5) significantly inhibited the growth of Huh-7 cells under mild hypoxia (3% O2; Figure 3G), but this phenotype was effectively rescued by a recombinant NDRG3(N66D) expression vector lacking the natural 3′-UTR sequences of NDRG3 (Figures 3G and S3E). In addition, NDRG3 knockdown strongly suppressed the tumorous growth of Huh-7 cells in BALB/c-nu mice (Figures 3H and S3F). Interestingly, simultaneous depletion of NDRG3 and either of the HIFs completely abrogated tumor growth, suggesting complementary roles for NDRG3 and HIFs in hypoxic cell growth (Figure 3H). Immunofluorescence microscopy of resected tumors revealed that NDRG3 depletion effectively suppressed the expression of markers of tumor angiogenesis (IL8 and CD31) and cell proliferation (Ki-67), while their levels in HIF-depleted tumors were comparable to those in controls (Figure S3G). In contrast, the ectopic expression of NDRG3(N66D) highly promoted colony formation of Huh-1 cells in soft agar (Figure S4J) as well as their tumorigenic activity in BALB/c-nu mice (Figures 3I and S3H). These results demonstrate that NDRG3 plays crucial roles in promoting angiogenesis, anti-apoptosis, and cell proliferation during hypoxia. Compared to HIF-1α, which showed an early induction pattern during hypoxia and rapidly disappeared upon reoxygenation of cells, NDRG3 started accumulating relatively later in hypoxia and its levels slowly declined upon reoxygenation (Figures 2C and S2C). The long lag periods observed for the accumulation and degradation of NDRG3 suggested that multiple layers of regulation might be involved in its hypoxic expression. Therefore, we explored biochemical features relevant to “prolonged hypoxia” other than low oxygen levels and found that NDRG3 protein expression is highly correlated with cellular lactate production; NDRG3 protein expression began at ∼6 hr under hypoxia, closely following the lactate production pattern (Figure 4A). On the other hand, suppression of lactate production with a LDHA inhibitor, sodium oxamate, specifically inhibited the NDRG3 protein accumulation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B). Similarly, inhibition of lactate production via siRNA-mediated depletion of LDHA (Figure 4C) or disruption of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (Figure S4A) suppressed the hypoxic NDRG3 protein expression. Depriving cells of glucose and/or glutamine, the input substrates for glycolysis and glutaminolysis, respectively—two major metabolic pathways leading to intracellular lactate production—also reduced the NDRG3 protein accumulation with a parallel reduction in lactate production but without affecting the transcription of NDRG3 (Figure 4D). However, compared to the significant consequences of glucose deprivation, the glutamine effect seemed relatively minor. In contrast, the facilitation of lactate production (via LDHA overexpression and/or pyruvate overfeeding; Figure S4B) or its intracellular accumulation (by blocking export through MCT4; Figure 4C) augmented the hypoxic accumulation of NDRG3 protein. These results indicate that, unlike HIF proteins, oxygen deprivation per se is not enough to cause the accumulation of NDRG3 protein, but glycolytic production of lactate is additionally required. We then verified the effects of lactate on NDRG3 protein dynamics more directly by providing exogenous lactate to the cells whose intracellular lactate production had been compromised by genetic or pharmacological means. Lactate exogenously added to Huh-1 cells dose dependently restored the hypoxic NDRG3 protein expression that had been reduced by LDHA silencing, without affecting the level of NDRG3 mRNA or HIF-1α protein (Figure 4E). Similar results were obtained when lactate production was suppressed by glucose deprivation (Figure S4C) or oxamate treatment (Figure S4D). However, the lactate-mediated restoration of NDRG3 protein expression was abrogated by siRNA targeting MCT1, a monocarboxylate transporter responsible for importing extracellular lactate into the cell, both in normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Figure 4F). We also observed similar effects of MCT1 knockdown in Huh-1 cells subjected to oxamate treatment or glucose deprivation (Figures S4E and S4F). Collectively, these results indicate that NDRG3 requires lactate build-up for its protein accumulation under hypoxia, pointing to the possibility that NDRG3 might function as a hypoxia-inducible lactate sensor, triggering HIF-independent biologic responses in the cell. We, therefore, examined the functional significance of hypoxic NDRG3 expression in the context of lactate metabolism. Inhibition of lactate production with oxamate caused a dose-dependent suppression of Huh-1 cell growth under mild hypoxia (Figure S4G). However, this effect was effectively rescued by ectopically expressing NDRG3(N66D) (Figure S4G), suggesting that NDRG3 may play a critical role in lactate-induced hypoxic cell growth. Apparently, NDRG3(N66D) exerted no direct effects on lactate production irrespective of oxamate treatment (Figure S4H) nor was its expression affected by oxamate (Figure S4I), indicating that the rescuing effect is tru"
https://openalex.org/W2090597220,"Breathing is essential for survival and under precise neural control. The vagus nerve is a major conduit between lung and brain required for normal respiration. Here, we identify two populations of mouse vagus nerve afferents (P2ry1, Npy2r), each a few hundred neurons, that exert powerful and opposing effects on breathing. Genetically guided anatomical mapping revealed that these neurons densely innervate the lung and send long-range projections to different brainstem targets. Npy2r neurons are largely slow-conducting C fibers, while P2ry1 neurons are largely fast-conducting A fibers that contact pulmonary endocrine cells (neuroepithelial bodies). Optogenetic stimulation of P2ry1 neurons acutely silences respiration, trapping animals in exhalation, while stimulating Npy2r neurons causes rapid, shallow breathing.

Here, we used advanced imaging in mouse models of hepatitis B virus (HBV) pathogenesis to understand the mechanisms whereby these cells home to the liver, recognize antigens, and deploy effector functions. We show that circulating CD8 TE arrest within liver sinusoids by docking onto platelets previously adhered to sinusoidal hyaluronan via CD44. After the initial arrest, CD8 TE actively crawl along liver sinusoids and probe sub-sinusoidal hepatocytes for the presence of antigens by extending cytoplasmic protrusions through endothelial fenestrae. Hepatocellular antigen recognition triggers effector functions in a diapedesis-independent manner and is inhibited by the processes of sinusoidal defenestration and capillarization that characterize liver fibrosis. These findings reveal the dynamic behavior whereby CD8 TE control hepatotropic pathogens and suggest how liver fibrosis might reduce CD8 TE immune surveillance toward infected or transformed hepatocytes."

Here, we demonstrate discrete and opposing roles for the lncRNA transcript Haunt and its genomic locus in regulating the HOXA gene cluster during ESC differentiation. Reducing or enhancing Haunt expression, with minimal disruption of the Haunt locus, led to upregulation or downregulation of HOXA genes, respectively. In contrast, increasingly large genomic deletions within the Haunt locus attenuated HOXA activation. The Haunt DNA locus contains potential enhancers of HOXA activation, whereas Haunt RNA acts to prevent aberrant HOXA expression. This work reveals a multifaceted model of lncRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation of the HOXA cluster, with distinct roles for a lncRNA transcript and its genomic locus, while illustrating the power of rapid CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing for assigning lncRNA functions."
https://openalex.org/W2075376711,"Medial entorhinal grid cells fire in periodic, hexagonally patterned locations and are proposed to support path-integration-based navigation. The recursive nature of path integration results in accumulating error and, without a corrective mechanism, a breakdown in the calculation of location. The observed long-term stability of grid patterns necessitates that the system either performs highly precise internal path integration or implements an external landmark-based error correction mechanism. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined grid cells in behaving rodents as they made long trajectories across an open arena. We found that error accumulates relative to time and distance traveled since the animal last encountered a boundary. This error reflects coherent drift in the grid pattern. Further, interactions with boundaries yield direction-dependent error correction, suggesting that border cells serve as a neural substrate for error correction. These observations, combined with simulations of an attractor network grid cell model, demonstrate that landmarks are crucial to grid stability."

The critical size of Tau assemblies, or “seeds,” responsible for this activity is currently unknown, but this could be important for the design of effective therapies. We studied recombinant Tau repeat domain (RD) and Tau assemblies purified from Alzheimer disease (AD) brain composed largely of full-length Tau. Large RD fibrils were first sonicated to create a range of assembly sizes. We confirmed our ability to resolve stable assemblies ranging from n = 1 to >100 units of Tau using size exclusion chromatography, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, cross-linking followed by Western blot, and mass spectrometry. All recombinant Tau assemblies bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, which are required for Tau uptake and seeding, because they were equivalently sensitive to inhibition by heparin and chlorate. However, cells only internalized RD assemblies of n ≥ 3 units. We next analyzed Tau assemblies from AD or control brains. AD brains contained aggregated species, whereas normal brains had predominantly monomer, and no evidence of large assemblies. HEK293 cells and primary neurons spontaneously internalized Tau of n ≥ 3 units from AD brain in a heparin- and chlorate-sensitive manner. Only n ≥ 3-unit assemblies from AD brain spontaneously seeded intracellular Tau aggregation in HEK293 cells.

Our findings reveal the complex protein dynamics that coordinate helicase loading and indicate that distinct mechanisms load the oppositely oriented helicases that are central to bidirectional replication initiation. Eukaryotic DNA replication must occur faithfully each cell cycle to maintain genomic stability. Initiation of replication occurs at genomic sites called origins. To ensure that no origin initiates replication more than once per cell cycle, the cell restricts the DNA loading and activation of the Mcm2–7 replicative helicase to distinct cell-cycle stages (Siddiqui et al., 2013Siddiqui K.

Importantly, helicase loading (also known as pre-RC formation) licenses origins of replication by establishing the correct architecture for helicase activation and bidirectional replication initiation. Three helicase-loading proteins direct Mcm2–7 loading: the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 (reviewed in Yardimci and Walter, 2014Yardimci H. Walter J.C.

ORC binds origins of replication and recruits Cdc6 at the M/G1 transition. Cdc6-bound ORC recruits Mcm2–7 in complex with Cdt1 to origin DNA. In an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction, recruited Mcm2–7 complexes are loaded around the origin DNA (Coster et al., 2014Coster G. Frigola J. Beuron F. Morris E.P. Diffley J.F.X.

Although the structure of the double-hexamer product of helicase loading is clear, important questions remain about how the helicase-loading proteins achieve this outcome. In particular, the mechanisms that load the first and second Mcm2–7 complex in opposite orientations are unclear (reviewed in Yardimci and Walter, 2014Yardimci H. Walter J.C. Prereplication-complex formation: a molecular double take?.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Do the two Mcm2–7 complexes associate and load simultaneously or in an ordered fashion? Do the same or different ORC and Cdc6 proteins load each Mcm2–7 complex? To address these questions, we have developed single-molecule assays to monitor helicase loading. Single-molecule studies are a powerful tool to address questions of stoichiometry and dynamics during DNA replication events. Studies of this type have led to important insights including the dynamics and number of DNA polymerases acting at the replication fork (reviewed in Stratmann and van Oijen, 2014Stratmann S.A. van Oijen A.M. DNA replication at the single-molecule level.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2014; 43: 1201-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Extending these approaches to replication initiation has the potential for additional discovery. Unlike current ensemble helicase loading assays, which can only detect events that survive multiple washes, single-molecule approaches readily detect short-lived interactions during cycles of enzymatic function. Single-molecule approaches also allow stoichiometric determinations that are difficult with ensemble helicase loading assays due to DNA-to-DNA asynchrony and heterogeneity. Finally, although multi-step reactions are frequently asynchronous, post hoc synchronization of single-molecule data allows precise kinetic analysis of reaction pathways. We have developed single-molecule assays that monitor the DNA association of eukaryotic helicase-loading proteins using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) (Friedman et al., 2006Friedman L.J.

We show that the two Mcm2–7 hexamers are recruited and loaded in separate events that require distinct Cdc6 and Cdt1 molecules. In contrast, one ORC molecule directs loading of both Mcm2–7 complexes present in a double hexamer. Consistent with distinct mechanisms loading the two hexamers, we observe kinetic differences between events associated with loading the first and second helicase. By combining CoSMoS with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we demonstrate that formation of the Mcm2–7 double-hexamer interface precedes dissociation of Cdc6 and Cdt1, suggesting interactions with the first Mcm2–7, rather than ORC, drive recruitment of the second helicase. Our observations reveal both the complex protein coordination required to assemble Mcm2–7 double hexamers and the mechanisms ensuring the two Mcm2–7 molecules are loaded in the opposite orientations required for bidirectional replication initiation. To develop a single-molecule assay for eukaryotic helicase loading, we used CoSMoS to monitor the origin-DNA association of the proteins required for this process (ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, Mcm2–7). First, we immobilized origin-containing DNA by coupling it to microscope slides. We determined the location of surface-attached DNA on the slide using a DNA-coupled fluorophore (Figure 1A). We monitored associations of one or two proteins (labeled with distinguishable fluorophores) with origin DNA using colocalization of the protein- and DNA-associated fluorophores (Figure S1A). Fluorescent labeling of ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and Mcm2–7 was accomplished using a SNAP-tag or sortase-mediated coupling of fluorescent peptides (Gendreizig et al., 2003Gendreizig S. Kindermann M.

In each case, the fluorescent tags did not interfere with protein function in ensemble helicase-loading reactions (Figure S1B). After imaging the locations of slide-coupled DNA molecules, purified ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1/Mcm2–7 were added (one or two of which were fluorescently labeled), and the location of each DNA molecule was continuously monitored for labeled protein colocalization in 1-s intervals for 20 min.Figure S1Mcm2-7 Hexamers Associate with and Are Loaded on DNA in a One-at-a-Time Manner, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Whole microscope field of view showing AlexaFluor488-coupled DNA (left) and the Mcm2-74SNAP549 fluorescent spots (right) from the same experiment at time = 600 s.

Multiple observations indicated that Mcm2–7-DNA colocalizations represented events of helicase loading (Table S1; Movies S1, S2, and S3). First, colocalizations of Mcm2–7 with the DNA were dramatically reduced in the absence of ORC or Cdc6, proteins required for helicase loading (Yardimci and Walter, 2014Yardimci H. Walter J.C. Prereplication-complex formation: a molecular double take?.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, stable association (>30 s) of Mcm2–7 was dependent on the presence of the ORC DNA binding site (the ARS-consensus sequence, ACS). Third, ORC, Cdc6, origin DNA, and ATP hydrolysis were each required to form Mcm2–7 molecules that were resistant to a high-salt wash (Table S1), a biochemical test for loaded helicases encircling double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) independently of helicase-loading proteins (Donovan et al., 1997Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F.X. Cdc6p-dependent loading of Mcm proteins onto pre-replicative chromatin in budding yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sequential ATP hydrolysis by Cdc6 and ORC directs loading of the Mcm2-7 helicase.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Our initial studies monitored Mcm2–7 association with origin DNA. We performed CoSMoS helicase-loading experiments using Mcm2–7 containing SNAP-tagged Mcm4 labeled with 549 fluorophore (Mcm2–74SNAP549; Figure 1) and unlabeled ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Over the course of 20 min, we observed both single- and double-stepwise increases in Mcm2–7-associated fluorescence intensity at origin DNAs (Figures 1B and S1C). Mcm2–7 dwell-time distributions were multi-exponential with many short-lived (<30 s) and fewer longer-lived (>30 s) relative increases in fluorescent intensity, suggesting at least two distinct types of Mcm2–7 association with the DNA (Figure 1C). There are two possible explanations for the multiple stepwise increases in DNA-colocalized Mcm2–7-coupled fluorescence. The simplest interpretation of this data is that Mcm2–7 hexamers associate with origin DNA in a one-at-a-time manner, with multiple hexamers accumulating over time. Alternatively, it was possible that each increase in fluorescence was due to the simultaneous association of a Mcm2–7 multimer (e.g., a pre-formed dimer of two Mcm2–7 hexamers). To distinguish between these possibilities, we used photobleaching to count the number of DNA-associated Mcm2–7 hexamers. To this end, we first observed Mcm2–74SNAP549 associations with DNA and then washed the surface-tethered DNA molecules with reaction buffer, removing unbound proteins. Then, to promote photobleaching, we increased laser excitation power and removed oxygen scavengers. Comparison of the number of Mcm2–74SNAP549 photobleaching steps after the wash with the number of association steps that accumulated before the wash showed no single-step increase in fluorescence before the wash resulted in a two-step photobleaching afterward (Figure 1D, top). We confirmed that loss of fluorescence was due to photobleaching and not dissociation of Mcm2–7 by observing previously non-illuminated microscope fields of view. These data eliminate models in which multiple Mcm2–7 complexes are recruited simultaneously. We conclude that Mcm2–7 association occurs in a one-at-a-time manner. We next asked whether loading of salt-resistant Mcm2–7 hexamers around origin DNA occurred sequentially or simultaneously. We used the same photobleaching assay (described above) except a high-salt wash was used to remove any incompletely loaded Mcm2–7 complexes prior to photobleaching. If loading of both Mcm2–7 hexamers occurs simultaneously, we should observe only even numbers of high-salt-resistant hexamers. In contrast, if loading occurs sequentially, we should observe even and odd numbers of high-salt-resistant hexamers. At low protein concentrations, we observed both one- and two-step photobleaching events (Figures 1D, bottom, and 1E). Roughly half (79/160) of all single Mcm2–7-associated fluorophores that colocalized with origin DNA before the high-salt wash were high-salt resistant, and 67% (40/60) of the double-Mcm2–7-associated fluorophores were high-salt resistant. When we increased protein concentrations, we also observed DNA molecules with three and four origin-dependent, high-salt-resistant Mcm2–7 complexes (Figure S1D), indicating that more than one double-hexamer loading event occurred at a single origin. We considered the possibility that the apparent colocalization of odd numbers of loaded Mcm2–7 complexes was due to incomplete fluorescent labeling of Mcm2–7. For example, a single salt-resistant Mcm2–7-associated fluorophore could be the result of loading two Mcm2–7 complexes, only one of which is fluorescently labeled. To address this possibility, we purified Mcm2–7 complexes that were labeled on two subunits with different fluorophores (Mcm2–74SNAP549/7SORT649). Because the SNAP-tag and sortase labeling approaches are independent of each other, we could use single-molecule imaging to determine the efficiency of each labeling protocol (79% for SNAP and 77% for sortase). This labeling protocol also increased the proportion of Mcm2–7 complexes that have at least one coupled fluorophore to 95%. Using the measured labeling efficiencies, we determined the number of high-salt-resistant Mcm2–7 complexes with no more than one of each fluorophore that would be expected if only double hexamers were loaded (Figure S1E, model II). Assays with Mcm2–74SNAP549/7SORT649 yielded single, salt-resistant fluorophores in a proportion that is inconsistent with this model. Instead, our data are consistent with a model where both single and double hexamers are loaded (in a 52:48 ratio based on our data; Figure S1E, model I). We conclude that Mcm2–7 complexes are both recruited and loaded onto origin DNA in a sequential manner. We investigated the number of Cdt1 and Cdc6 molecules required for helicase loading and their relative times of DNA association. Both proteins are essential for loading but show little or no association with DNA in bulk assays (Coster et al., 2014Coster G. Frigola J. Beuron F. Morris E.P. Diffley J.F.X.

To detect these associations, we simultaneously monitored the binding of two different protein pairs labeled with distinguishable fluorophores: either Cdt1SORT549 with Mcm2–74SNAPJF646 or Cdc6SORT549 with Mcm2–74SNAPJF646. The associations of both fluorophores with origin DNA were monitored simultaneously, revealing relative times of arrival and departure for the two molecules in each pair. Consistent with being recruited to origins as a complex, we typically observed that Cdt1 and Mcm2–7 associated with origin DNA simultaneously (Figure 2A; Figures S2A–S2C). Uncommon instances where Cdt1 or Mcm2–7 are seen associating separately (Cdt1 alone: 11.4%, Mcm2–7 alone: 18.6%) are likely caused by incomplete dye labeling of the other protein because the frequencies of these events are similar to the fractions of unlabeled Mcm2–7 or Cdt1 (14% and 20%, respectively). Like Mcm2–7, Cdt1 dwell times followed a multi-exponential distribution, indicating the presence of at least two types of Cdt1-containing complexes on the DNA (Figure 2B). Consistent with this interpretation, we identified two classes of Mcm2–7/Cdt1 dwell-time and departure behaviors. In many instances, Cdt1 and Mcm2–7 were released simultaneously (i.e., within 1 s, see Figures S2B and S2C). This release pattern occurs whether or not the DNA molecule already had an associated Mcm2–7. These associations were typically short lived (Figure 2C) and represent non-productive binding events. Interestingly, these events were less frequent if the Mcm2–7/Cdt1 was the second (29%) rather than the first (53%) to arrive at the DNA. In the remaining cases, Cdt1 was typically longer lived (Figure 2D) and was released from origin DNA by itself, leaving behind an associated Mcm2–7. Clearly, only instances when Cdt1 is released independently of Mcm2–7 can be on the pathway for double-hexamer formation. Because Cdt1-associated fluorophore photobleaching was much slower than Cdt1 dissociation (Figure S2D; Table S2), nearly all loss of fluorescent colocalization was due to dissociations, not photobleaching.Figure S2Distinct Cdt1 Molecules Load the First and the Second Mcm2-7 Hexamer, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) Additional fluorescence intensity records of DNA-associated Mcm2-74SNAPJF646 and Cdt1SORT549.

https://openalex.org/W2071791968,"Mouse models have been indispensable for elucidating normal and pathological processes that influence learning and memory. A widely used method for assessing these cognitive processes in mice is the Morris water maze, a classic test for examining spatial learning and memory. However, Morris water maze studies with mice have principally been performed using adult animals, which preclude studies of critical neurodevelopmental periods when the cellular and molecular substrates of learning and memory are formed. While weanling rats have been successfully trained in the Morris water maze, there have been few attempts to test weanling mice in this behavioral paradigm even though mice offer significant experimental advantages because of the availability of many genetically modified strains. Here, we present experimental evidence that weanling mice can be trained in the Morris water maze beginning on postnatal day 24. Maze-trained weanling mice exhibit significant improvements in spatial learning over the training period and results of the probe trial indicate the development of spatial memory. There were no sex differences in the animals’ performance in these tasks. In addition, molecular biomarkers of synaptic plasticity are upregulated in maze-trained mice at the transcript level. These findings demonstrate that the Morris water maze can be used to assess spatial learning and memory in weanling mice, providing a potentially powerful experimental approach for examining the influence of genes, environmental factors and their interactions on the development of learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2066901047,"One of the exceptional properties of the brain is its ability to acquire new knowledge through learning and to store that information through memory. The epigenetic mechanisms linking changes in neuronal transcriptional programs to behavioral plasticity remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the epigenetic signature of the neuronal enhancers required for transcriptional regulation of synaptic plasticity genes during memory formation, linking this to Reelin signaling. The binding of Reelin to its receptor, LRP8, triggers activation of this cohort of LRP8-Reelin-regulated neuronal (LRN) enhancers that serve as the ultimate convergence point of a novel synapse-to-nucleus pathway. Reelin simultaneously regulates NMDA-receptor transmission, which reciprocally permits the required γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of LRP8, revealing an unprecedented role for its intracellular domain in the regulation of synaptically generated signals. These results uncover an in vivo enhancer code serving as a critical molecular component of cognition and relevant to psychiatric disorders linked to defects in Reelin signaling."

The graph matching problem is a special case of the quadratic assignment problem, and graph matching is increasingly important as graph-valued data is becoming more prominent. With the aim of efficiently and accurately matching the large graphs common in big data, we present our graph matching algorithm, the Fast Approximate Quadratic assignment algorithm. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm is faster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80% of the QAPLIB benchmark library, compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying our algorithm to our motivating example, matching C. elegans connectomes (brain-graphs), we find that it efficiently achieves performance."
https://openalex.org/W2133692827,"Insulin resistance is a major characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Recent studies have shown a metabolic role of capsaicin that may be mediated via the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channel. In this study, TRPV1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice (as controls) were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and metabolic studies were performed to measure insulin and leptin action. The TRPV1 KO mice became more obese than the WT mice after HFD, partly attributed to altered energy balance and leptin resistance in the KO mice. The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiment showed that the TRPV1 KO mice were more insulin resistant after HFD because of the ∼40% reduction in glucose metabolism in the white and brown adipose tissue, compared with that in the WT mice. Leptin treatment failed to suppress food intake, and leptin-mediated hypothalamic signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 activity was blunted in the TRPV1 KO mice. We also found that the TRPV1 KO mice were more obese and insulin resistant than the WT mice at 9 mo of age. Taken together, these results indicate that lacking TRPV1 exacerbates the obesity and insulin resistance associated with an HFD and aging, and our findings further suggest that TRPV1 has a major role in regulating glucose metabolism and hypothalamic leptin's effects in obesity."

PIP2 is generated by sequential phosphorylation of PI originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PI 4-kinases first phosphorylate PI to generate PI 4-phosphate (PI4P), which is a substrate for PI4P 5-kinases to synthesize PIP2. PM harbors PI 4-kinase and PI4P 5-kinases to generate PIP2 from PI and PI4P (1.Balla T. Phosphoinositides: tiny lipids with giant impact on cell regulation.Physiol.

In response to extracellular stimuli, receptor activation induces hydrolysis of PIP2 via phospholipase C (PLC) and generates inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG) that trigger downstream Ca2+ signaling and protein kinase C activation, respectively (1.Balla T. Phosphoinositides: tiny lipids with giant impact on cell regulation.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1019-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). DAG can be phosphorylated by DAG kinases (DGKs) to generate another signaling messenger, phosphatidic acid (PA) (6.Shulga Y.V. Topham M.K. Epand R.M. Regulation and functions of diacylglycerol kinases.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 6186-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PM PIP2 levels rapidly recover within minutes following receptor-induced hydrolysis (7.Creba J.A. Downes C.P. Hawkins P.T. Brewster G. Michell R.H. Kirk C.J.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying this feedback remain unclear. We have previously shown that a PITP Nir2 translocates to ER-PM junctions, where the ER forms close contacts with the PM and promotes PIP2 replenishment following receptor activation (8.Chang C.L. Hsieh T.S. Yang T.T. Rothberg K.G. Azizoglu D.B. Volk E. Liao J.C. Liou J.

Although Nir2 has been shown to transfer PI between membranes in vitro (9.Garner K. Hunt A.N. Koster G. Somerharju P. Groves E. Li M. Raghu P. Holic R. Cockcroft S.

In this study, we devise approaches to selectively manipulate PIP2 precursors at the ER and Golgi, and we demonstrate that Nir2-mediated PM PIP2 replenishment is dependent on PI at the ER membrane. We further demonstrate that Nir2 and its homolog, Nir3, sense PIP2 hydrolysis and translocate to ER-PM junctions by binding to PA. Finally, we demonstrate differential roles of Nir2 and Nir3 in regulating PIP2 homeostasis; Nir2 mediates substantial PIP2 replenishment during intense receptor stimulation to support cell signaling, whereas Nir3 preferentially sustains basal PM PIP2 levels by sensing subtle PA production in cells in the resting state. Together, our findings reveal feedback mechanisms that couple PIP2 hydrolysis to its replenishment via Nir2 and Nir3 at ER-PM junctions.

All constructs listed here were verified by sequencing. All oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. HeLa cells were cultured on Lab-Tek chambered no. 1 coverglass (NUNC, Rochester, NY). Before imaging, cells were washed with ECB. Live cell confocal and TIRF imaging experiments were performed at room temperature with 60× or 100× objectives and a confocal TIRF microscope custom-built using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Melville, NY). The microscope was controlled by Micro-Manager software (14.Edelstein A. Amodaj N. Hoover K. Vale R. Stuurman N. Computer control of microscopes using microManager.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2010Google Scholar). For inhibitor experiments, HeLa cells were pretreated with 1 μm U73122 or 25 μm R59022 for 1 h or with 5 μg/ml BFA for 10 min. To increase cytosolic Ca2+ levels, HeLa cells were loaded with 20 μm NP-EGTA in ECB containing 0.05% Pluronic F-127 and 0.1% of BSA at room temperature for 30 min. Loaded cells were washed with ECB containing 0.1% BSA and incubated in ECB for another 15–30 min before the experiments. To release Ca2+ from NP-EGTA, cells were exposed to a 405-nm laser pulse for 400–800 ms at rates of 6 or 10 s per frame. For the analyses of relative protein translocation to ER-PM junctions, puncta of Nir2, Nir3, or STIM1 from TIRF images were selected. The intensity traces of the selected puncta from the same cell were background-subtracted, normalized to time 0, and averaged. Maximal translocation of Nir2 and Nir3 to ER-PM junctions was determined by measuring the maximal values of the Nir2 and Nir3 translocation traces. Dynamic changes of PIP2 at the PM during receptor stimulation were determined by the relative intensity of GFP-PLCδ-PH monitored by TIRF microscopy in HeLa cells overexpressing histamine H1 receptor (H1R). An ND8 filter was introduced to the light path to prevent photobleaching. Basal PM PIP2 levels were determined by the ratio of the intensity of GFP-PLCδ-PH at the PM to that in the cytosol using confocal images of cells with similar adherent surfaces to prevent artifacts caused by the size and the shape of the cells. For direct measurements of PIP2 using immunostaining, monoclonal anti-PIP2 antibody (clone 2C11) was used following a previously described protocol (15.Hammond G.R. Schiavo G. Irvine R.F. Immunocytochemical techniques reveal multiple, distinct cellular pools of PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P(2).Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Confocal images of the stained cells were taken, and the intensity of PM regions was quantified and normalized to control cells before histamine treatment. For PIP2 mass analysis, HeLa cells on 6-well plates were labeled o-[32P]phosphate (20 μCi/ml) for 4 h in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. The labeling media were aspirated, and the reaction was terminated by addition of a 500-μl mixture of MeOH and 1 m HCl (1:1 v/v). Cells were then scraped and transferred into tubes, and 250 μl of chloroform was added to extract lipids. The samples were vortexed, centrifuged, and the phospholipids in the lower (organic) phase were obtained by removing the upper phase. The phospholipids were washed with a 250-μl mixture of MeOH and 1 m HCl (1:1). The extracted phospholipids were then separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in n-propyl alcohol/H2O/NH4Cl (65:20:15) solvent system as described previously (16.Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. A novel family of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases conserved from yeast to humans.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TLC plates were exposed to x-ray films. Radioactive PIP2 levels were quantified by densitometry analysis (ImageJ) and normalized to total 32P-labeled phospholipids. His-tagged C-terminal regions of Nir2 and Nir3 were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacterial cells. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, DNase I, and protease inhibitors. The expressed proteins were purified using Talon cobalt columns (Clontech). The buffer of the purified proteins was exchanged to PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl) using Amicon centrifugal filters (Millipore). Purified proteins were then centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove aggregates. To prepare liposomes, PC and PA (in chloroform) were mixed at the ratio as indicated, dried first under nitrogen, then desiccated overnight, and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Liposomes were generated by vortexing and freezing-sonicating the resuspended lipids until clear solutions were formed. Liposomes (20 μl) were mixed with proteins (5 μg in 50 μl in the buffer for liposomes) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Proteins bound to the liposomes were sedimented by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins in the pellets (liposome-bound) were resuspended in the initial volume of the sample, and equal volumes of the pellets and the supernatants were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by GelCode Blue Safe protein stain (Pierce). HeLa cells were loaded with 0.5 μm Fura-2 AM in ECB containing 0.05% pluronic F-127 and 0.1% of BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Loaded cells were then washed with ECB containing 0.1% BSA and incubated in ECB for another 15–30 min before the experiments. Single-cell Ca2+ images were taken with a 4× objective and an automated microscope custom built on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. Changes of intracellular Ca2+ levels were indicated by the change of ratio to 510 nm excited at 340 nm to those at 380 nm (F340/F380). For periodic histamine stimulation experiments, Fura-2 loaded cells were placed in a perfusion system built in the laboratory providing a constant ECB flow of 1.5 to 2 ml per min. Data were statistically analyzed by t test or one-way analysis of variance using SigmaPlot software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). PI originating from the ER is a precursor lipid for PIP2 synthesis at the PM. To determine whether PI at the ER membrane contributes to the rapid PIP2 replenishment following receptor-induced hydrolysis, we devised a rapamycin-inducible approach to acutely remove PI at the ER membrane using a bacterial PI-specific PLC (PI-PLC) (Fig. 1A). This PI-PLC selectively hydrolyzes PI to generate DAG, and its expression in the cytosol minimally affects cellular PI and PIP2 levels (12.Kim Y.J. Guzman-Hernandez M.L. Balla T.

CFP-FKBP-PI-PLC and CFP-FKBP-PI-PLC-H86A were generated by cloning PI-PLC or its catalytic inactive mutant PI-PLC-H86A into a backbone plasmid containing a cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) and an FK50-binding protein (FKBP) domain at the N terminus. The PI-depleting abilities of these two cytosolic fusion proteins were verified by co-expression with GFP-PKD-C1ab, a high affinity DAG sensor (12.Kim Y.J. Guzman-Hernandez M.L. Balla T.

Targeting PI-PLC to the cytosolic surface of ER has been shown to efficiently reduce cellular PI levels (12.Kim Y.J. Guzman-Hernandez M.L. Balla T.

We applied rapamycin to recruit CFP-FKBP-PI-PLC or CFP-FKBP-PI-PLC-H86A to the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane in cells co-transfected with ER-localized mCherry-TM-FRB (Fig. 1, A, D, and E), which contains an FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain in the cytosol (8.Chang C.L.

To selectively monitor PM PIP2 replenishment in cells with PI acutely depleted at the ER membrane, cells were co-transfected with FKBP-PI-PLC and TM-FRB, a PIP2 biosensor GFP-PLCδ-PH (17.Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Receptor-induced transient reduction in plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration monitored in living cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and H1R to augment PIP2 hydrolysis induced by histamine stimulation. In untreated (control) cells, a sharp drop in PM PLCδ-PH intensity, indicating PIP2 hydrolysis, was observed using TIRF microscopy immediately following histamine stimulation. The hydrolysis was followed by an initial recovery before reaching a new steady state reflecting equilibrium between receptor-induced hydrolysis and regeneration of PIP2 (Fig. 1F, black line). In cells treated with rapamycin to acutely remove PI at the ER membrane, the hydrolysis and the initial recovery of PIP2 after histamine stimulation were similar to that in control cells (Fig. 1F, red line). Remarkably, the level of PIP2 dropped again shortly after the initial recovery, suggesting that PI at the ER membrane supports the regeneration of PM PIP2. In contrast, rapamycin treatment did not affect PIP2 replenishment in cells transfected with FKBP-PI-PLC-H86A instead of FKBP-PI-PLC (Fig. 1G). We further employed immunostaining to detect PIP2 at the PM in cells co-transfected with FKBP-PI-PLC, TM-FRB, and H1R. Consistently, we observed a significant difference in PM PIP2 levels following histamine stimulation for 9 min in cells with rapamycin pretreatment as compared with control cells (Fig. 1, H and I). These results suggest that a delivery of PI from the ER to the PM occurs within minutes to support PIP2 replenishment. PI can be delivered from the ER to the PM indirectly via vesicular transport through the Golgi apparatus where it can be converted to PI4P before reaching the PM. To determine whether PI and PI4P delivered via vesicular transport is important for rapid PIP2 replenishment, we devised another rapamycin-inducible enzymatic chimera mRFP-FKBP-Sac1-PI-PLC to selectively remove PI and PI4P at the Golgi apparatus by modifying the Pseudojanin (Fig. 2A) (13.Hammond G.R. Fischer M.J. Anderson K.E. Holdich J. Koteci A. Balla T. Irvine R.F. PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 are essential but independent lipid determinants of membrane identity.Science. 2012; 337: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Golgi localization of mRFP-FKBP-Sac1-PI-PLC and its ability to deplete PI4P at the Golgi following rapamycin treatment were observed in cells co-transfected with Tgn38-FRB-CFP for Golgi targeting and GFP-P4M for PI4P detection (Fig. 2B) (18.Hammond G.R.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8225-8230Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Acute depletion of PI and PI4P at the Golgi by rapamycin-induced recruitment of mRFP-FKBP-Sac1-PI-PLC did not affect PM PIP2 replenishment (Fig. 2C). Consistently, inhibition of ER-to-Golgi transport by brefeldin A (BFA) disrupted the Golgi apparatus but not PIP2 replenishment (Fig. 2, D and E). In fact, BFA pretreatment resulted in a marked enhancement of PIP2 replenishment. It is plausible that nonvesicular PI delivery compensates the inhibition of vesicular transport by BFA, leading to the enhanced PIP2 replenishment. We have previously shown that a PITP, Nir2, promotes PM PIP2 replenishment likely through nonvesicular pathways at ER-PM junctions (8.Chang C.L. Hsieh T.S. Yang T.T. Rothberg K.G. Azizoglu D.B. Volk E. Liao J.C. Liou J. Feedback regulation of receptor-induced Ca2+ signaling mediated by E-Syt1 and Nir2 at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 813-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, disruption of vesicular transport by BFA pretreatment did not significantly affect receptor-induced Nir2 translocation to ER-PM junctions, as indicated by puncta formation monitored by TIRF microscopy (Fig. 2, F and G). Together with results from Fig. 1, these data suggest that the delivery of PI at the ER membrane to the PM for rapid PIP2 replenishment is mediated by nonvesicular transport mechanisms. Next, we applied the rapamycin-inducible approach described in Fig. 1A to examine whether PI at the ER membrane is required for PIP2 replenishment mediated by Nir2 at ER-PM junctions (Fig. 3A). Rapamycin-induced ER PI depletion did not prevent Nir2 translocation to ER-PM junctions (Fig. 3B). However, the enhanced PIP2 replenishment mediated by Nir2 overexpression was significantly suppressed in rapamycin-treated cells with acute depletion of PI at the ER membrane (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Nir2 mediates PIP2 replenishment at ER-PM junctions by transferring PI at the ER membrane to the PM for the regeneration of PIP2. It is unclear how Nir2 senses PIP2 hydrolysis and translocates to ER-PM junctions to mediate PIP2 replenishment following receptor stimulation. It has been recently shown that Nir2 targets to the PM via its C-terminal LNS2 domain that binds PA produced following growth factor-induced phospholipase D activation (20.Kim S. Kedan A. Marom M. Gavert N. Keinan O. Selitrennik M. Laufman O. Lev S. The phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein Nir2 binds phosphatidic acid and positively regulates phosphoinositide signalling.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PA can be generated from DAG phosphorylation by DGK following PLC-induced PIP2 hydrolysis (Fig. 4A). We hypothesize that Nir2 senses PIP2 hydrolysis by binding to PA, which enables Nir2 translocation to ER-PM junctions. To test this hypothesis, we applied U73122 (PLC inhibitor) or R59022 (DGK inhibitor) to disrupt receptor-induced PA production (Fig. 4A). We found that Nir2 translocation to ER-PM junctions was inhibited in cells treated with U73122 and R59022 (Fig. 4, B and C). Remarkably, addition of exogenous PA at 400 μm was sufficient to trigger Nir2 translocation to ER-PM junctions (Fig. 4D and supplemental Movie S1). We further generated the Nir2-D1128A mutant (Fig. 4E), which disrupts the ability of Nir2 to bind PA and target to the PM (20.Kim S. Kedan A. Marom M. Gavert N. Keinan O. Selitrennik M. Laufman O. Lev S. The phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein Nir2 binds phosphatidic acid and positively regulates phosphoinositide signalling.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This mutant showed defective translocation to ER-PM junctions as compared with the wild-type Nir2 (Fig. 4, F and G). These results suggest that PA produced following PLC-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis recruits Nir2 to ER-PM junctions by binding to the LNS2 domain of Nir2. We have previously shown that the Nir2-FFAT mutant (FM) with the ER-targeting motif disrupted can translocate to the PM but cannot concentrate at ER-PM junctions, resulting in a moderate reduction in the ability to mediate PIP2 replenishment (8.Chang C.L.

https://openalex.org/W2030017066,"Unravelling principles underlying neurotransmitter release are key to understand neural signaling. Here, we describe how surface mobility of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) modulates release probabilities (Pr) of synaptic vesicles (SVs). Coupling distances of <10 to >100 nm have been reported for SVs and VDCCs in different synapses. Tracking individual VDCCs revealed that within hippocampal synapses, ∼60% of VDCCs are mobile while confined to presynaptic membrane compartments. Intracellular Ca2+ chelation decreased VDCC mobility. Increasing VDCC surface populations by co-expression of the α2δ1 subunit did not alter channel mobility but led to enlarged active zones (AZs) rather than higher channel densities. VDCCs thus scale presynaptic scaffolds to maintain local mobility. We propose that dynamic coupling based on mobile VDCCs supports calcium domain cooperativity and tunes neurotransmitter release by equalizing Pr for docked SVs within AZs."
https://openalex.org/W1981086594,"Impulsive and aggressive behaviors are both modulated by serotonergic signaling, specifically through the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). 5-HT1BR knockout mice show increased aggression and impulsivity, and 5-HT1BR polymorphisms are associated with aggression and drug addiction in humans. To dissect the mechanisms by which the 5-HT1BR affects these phenotypes, we developed a mouse model to spatially and temporally regulate 5-HT1BR expression. Our results demonstrate that forebrain 5-HT1B heteroreceptors expressed during an early postnatal period contribute to the development of the neural systems underlying adult aggression. However, distinct heteroreceptors acting during adulthood are involved in mediating impulsivity. Correlating with the impulsivity, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is elevated in the absence of 5-HT1BRs and normalized following adult rescue of the receptor. Overall, these data show that while adolescent expression of 5-HT1BRs influences aggressive behavior, a distinct set of 5-HT1B receptors modulates impulsive behavior during adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2151376090,"Neural activity contributes to the regulation of the properties of synapses in sensory systems, allowing for adjustment to a changing environment. Little is known about how synaptic molecular components are regulated to achieve activity-dependent plasticity at central synapses. Here, we found that after prolonged exposure to natural ambient light the presynaptic active zone in Drosophila photoreceptors undergoes reversible remodeling, including loss of Bruchpilot, DLiprin-α, and DRBP, but not of DSyd-1 or Cacophony. The level of depolarization of the postsynaptic neurons is critical for the light-induced changes in active zone composition in the photoreceptors, indicating the existence of a feedback signal. In search of this signal, we have identified a crucial role of microtubule meshwork organization downstream of the divergent canonical Wnt pathway, potentially via Kinesin-3 Imac. These data reveal that active zone composition can be regulated in vivo and identify the underlying molecular machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1967189500,"Our aim is to verify if oocyte developmental potential is related to the timing of meiotic progression and to mitochondrial distribution and activity using prepubertal and adult oocytes as models of low and high developmental capacity respectively. Prepubertal and adult oocytes were incorporated in an in vitro maturation system to determine meiotic and developmental competence and to assess at different time points kinetic of meiotic maturation, 2D protein electrophoresis patterns, ATP content and mitochondria distribution. Maturation and fertilization rates did not differ between prepubertal and adult oocytes (95.1% vs 96.7% and 66.73% vs 70.62% respectively for prepubertal and adult oocytes). Compared to adults, prepubertal oocytes showed higher parthenogenesis (17.38% vs 2.08% respectively in prepubertals and adults; P<0.01) and polispermy (14.30% vs 2.21% respectively in prepubertals and adults; P<0.01), lower cleavage rates (60.00% vs 67.08% respectively in prepubertals and adults; P<0.05) and blastocyst output (11.94% vs 34.% respectively in prepubertals and adults; P<0.01). Prepubertal oocytes reached MI stage 1 hr later than adults and this delay grows as the first meiotic division proceeds. Simultaneously, the protein pattern was altered since in prepubertal oocytes it fluctuates, dropping and rising to levels similar to adults only at 24 hrs. In prepubertal oocytes ATP rise is delayed and did not reach levels comparable to adult ones. CLSM observations revealed that at MII, in the majority of prepubertal oocytes, the active mitochondria are homogenously distributed, while in adults they are aggregated in big clusters. Our work demonstrates that mitochondria and their functional aggregation during maturation play an active role to provide energy in terms of ATP. The oocyte ATP content determines the timing of the meiotic cycle and the acquisition of developmental competence. Taken together our data suggest that oocytes with low developmental competence have a slowed down energetic metabolism which delays later development."
https://openalex.org/W2012107742,"Abstract Ribonucleotide monophosphates (rNMPs) are among the most frequent form of DNA aberration, as high ratios of ribonucleotide triphosphate:deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate pools result in approximately two misincorporated rNMPs/kb of DNA. The main pathway for the removal of rNMPs is by RNase H2. However, in a RNase H2 knock-out yeast strain, a topoisomerase I (Top1)-dependent mutator effect develops with accumulation of short deletions within tandem repeats. Proposed models for these deletions implicated processing of Top1-generated nicks at rNMP sites and/or sequential Top1 binding, but experimental support has been lacking thus far. Here, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of the Top1-induced short deletions at the rNMP sites by generating nicked DNA substrates bearing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates at the nick sites, mimicking the Top1-induced nicks. We demonstrate that a second Top1 cleavage complex adjacent to the nick and subsequent faulty Top1 religation led to the short deletions. Moreover, when acting on the nicked DNA substrates containing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates, Top1 generated not only the short deletion, but also a full-length religated DNA product. A catalytically inactive Top1 mutant (Top1-Y723F) also induced the full-length products, indicating that Top1 binding independent of its enzymatic activity promotes the sealing of DNA backbones via nucleophilic attacks by the 5′-hydroxyl on the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate. The resealed DNA would allow renewed attempt for repair by the error-free RNase H2-dependent pathway in vivo. Our results provide direct evidence for the generation of short deletions by sequential Top1 cleavage events and for the promotion of nick religation at rNMP sites by Top1."

Using rapidly dividing human prostate cancer cell lines, we identified mitotically quiescent subpopulations (<1%), which we compared with the rapidly dividing populations for patterns of gene expression and for their ability to migrate to the skeletons of athymic mice. The study used 2-photon microscopy to map the presence/distribution of fluorescently labeled, quiescent cells and luciferase expression to determine the presence of growing bone metastases. We showed that the mitotically quiescent cells were very significantly more tumorigenic in forming bone metastases than fast-growing cells (55 vs. 15%) and had a unique gene expression profile. The quiescent cells were not uniquely stem cell like, with no expression of CD133 but had the same level expression of other putative prostate stem cell markers (CD44 and integrins α2/β1), when compared to the rapidly proliferating population. In addition, mitotic quiescence was associated with very high levels of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) production. Inhibition of CXCR4 activity altered the homing of quiescent tumor cells to bone. Our studies suggest that mitotic dormancy is a unique phenotype that facilitates tumor cell colonization of the skeleton in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2023548852,"Hemocytes in the circulation and kidney islets, as well as their phagocytic responses to microorganisms and fluorescent beads, have been studied in Pomacea canaliculata, using flow cytometry, light microscopy (including confocal laser scanning microscopy) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Three circulating hemocyte types (hyalinocytes, agranulocytes and granulocytes) were distinguished by phase contrast microscopy of living cells and after light and electron microscopy of fixed material. Also, three different populations of circulating hemocytes were separated by flow cytometry, which corresponded to the three hemocyte types. Hyalinocytes showed a low nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, and no apparent granules in stained material, but showed granules of moderate electron density under TEM (L granules) and at least some L granules appear acidic when labeled with LysoTracker Red. Both phagocytic and non-phagocytic hyalinocytes lose most (if not all) L granules when exposed to microorganisms in vitro. The phagosomes formed differed whether hyalinocytes were exposed to yeasts or to Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria. Agranulocytes showed a large nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and few or no granules. Granulocytes showed a low nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and numerous eosinophilic granules after staining. These granules are electron dense and rod-shaped under TEM (R granules). Granulocytes may show merging of R granules into gigantic ones, particularly when exposed to microorganisms. Fluorescent bead exposure of sorted hemocytes showed phagocytic activity in hyalinocytes, agranulocytes and granulocytes, but the phagocytic index was significantly higher in hyalinocytes. Extensive hemocyte aggregates ('islets') occupy most renal hemocoelic spaces and hyalinocyte-like cells are the most frequent component in them. Presumptive glycogen deposits were observed in most hyalinocytes in renal islets (they also occur in the circulation but less frequently) and may mean that hyalinocytes participate in the storage and circulation of this compound. Injection of microorganisms in the foot results in phagocytosis by hemocytes in the islets, and the different phagosomes formed are similar to those in circulating hyalinocytes. Dispersed hemocytes were obtained after kidney collagenase digestion and cell sorting, and they were able to phagocytize fluorescent beads. A role for the kidney as an immune barrier is proposed for this snail."
https://openalex.org/W1979217947,"Invasive arthropods pose unique management challenges in various environments, the first of which is correct identification. This apparently mundane task is particularly difficult if multiple species are morphologically indistinguishable but accurate identification can be determined with DNA barcoding provided an adequate reference set is available. Scirtothrips dorsalis is a highly polyphagous plant pest with a rapidly expanding global distribution and this species, as currently recognized, may be comprised of cryptic species. Here we report the development of a comprehensive DNA barcode library for S. dorsalis and seven nuclear markers via next-generation sequencing for identification use within the complex. We also report the delimitation of nine cryptic species and two morphologically distinguishable species comprising the S. dorsalis species complex using histogram analysis of DNA barcodes, Bayesian phylogenetics, and the multi-species coalescent. One member of the complex, here designated the South Asia 1 cryptic species, is highly invasive, polyphagous, and likely the species implicated in tospovirus transmission. Two other species, South Asia 2, and East Asia 1 are also highly polyphagous and appear to be at an earlier stage of global invasion. The remaining members of the complex are regionally endemic, varying in their pest status and degree of polyphagy. In addition to patterns of invasion and endemism, our results provide a framework both for identifying members of the complex based on their DNA barcode, and for future species delimiting efforts."
https://openalex.org/W1973548035,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the primary target for organophosphates (OP). Several mutations have been reported in AChE to be associated with the reduced sensitivity against OP in various arthropods. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such reports are available for Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to determine the association of AChE(s) gene(s) with resistance against OP. We screened the AChE genes (L. salmonis ace1a and ace1b) in two salmon lice populations: one sensitive (n=5) and the other resistant (n=5) for azamethiphos, a commonly used OP in salmon farming. The screening led to the identification of a missense mutation Phe362Tyr in L. salmonis ace1a, (corresponding to Phe331 in Torpedo californica AChE) in all the samples of the resistant population. We confirmed the potential role of the mutation, with reduced sensitivity against azamethiphos in L. salmonis, by screening for Phe362Tyr in 2 sensitive and 5 resistant strains. The significantly higher frequency of the mutant allele (362Tyr) in the resistant strains clearly indicated the possible association of Phe362Tyr mutation in L. salmonis ace1a with resistance towards azamethiphos. The 3D modelling, short term survival experiments and enzymatic assays further supported the imperative role of Phe362Tyr in reduced sensitivity of L. salmonis for azamethiphos. Based on all these observations, the present study, for the first time, presents the mechanism of resistance in L. salmonis against azamethiphos. In addition, we developed a rapid diagnostic tool for the high throughput screening of Phe362Tyr mutation using High Resolution Melt analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2085925405,"Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathologic aggregation of human brain Tau protein. Neuronal Tau is involved in microtubule (MT) formation and stabilization. We showed previously that the immunophilin FK506-binding protein of MW ∼52 kDa (FKBP52) interferes with this function of full-length Tau and provokes aggregation of a disease-related mutant of Tau. To dissect the molecular interaction between recombinant human FKBP52 and Tau, here, we study the effect of FKBP52 on a functional Tau fragment (Tau-F4, Ser(208)-Ser(324)) containing part of the proline- rich region and MT-binding repeats. Therefore, we perform MT assembly and light-scattering assays, blue native PAGE analysis, electron microscopy, and Tau seeding experiments in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We show that FKBP52 (6 µM) prevents MT formation generated by Tau-F4 (5 µM) and induces Tau-F4 oligomerization and aggregation. Electron microscopy analyses show granular oligomers and filaments of Tau-F4 after short-time FKBP52 incubation. We demonstrate that the terminal parts of Tau interfere with the effects of FKBP52. Finally, we find that FKBP52-induced Tau-F4 oligomers cannot only generate in vitro, direct conformational changes in full-length Tau and that their uptake into neuronal cells can equally lead to aggregation of wild-type endogenous Tau. This suggests a potential prion-like property of these particular Tau-F4 aggregates. Collectively, our results strengthen the hypothesis of FKBP52 involvement in the Tau pathogenicity process."
https://openalex.org/W1976169850,"This paper details a methodology which, when applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, is capable of measuring the spatio-temporal dynamics of ‘disorder’ in the human brain. Our method, which is based upon signal entropy, shows that spatially separate brain regions (or networks) generate temporally independent entropy time-courses. These time-courses are modulated by cognitive tasks, with an increase in local neural processing characterised by localised and transient increases in entropy in the neural signal. We explore the relationship between entropy and the more established time-frequency decomposition methods, which elucidate the temporal evolution of neural oscillations. We observe a direct but complex relationship between entropy and oscillatory amplitude, which suggests that these metrics are complementary. Finally, we provide a demonstration of the clinical utility of our method, using it to shed light on aberrant neurophysiological processing in schizophrenia. We demonstrate significantly increased task induced entropy change in patients (compared to controls) in multiple brain regions, including a cingulo-insula network, bilateral insula cortices and a right fronto-parietal network. These findings demonstrate potential clinical utility for our method and support a recent hypothesis that schizophrenia can be characterised by abnormalities in the salience network (a well characterised distributed network comprising bilateral insula and cingulate cortices)."
https://openalex.org/W2320542046,"Congenital heart disease (CHD), the most common type of birth defect, is still the leading non-infectious cause of infant morbidity and mortality in humans. Aggregating evidence demonstrates that genetic defects are involved in the pathogenesis of CHD. However, CHD is genetically heterogeneous and the genetic components underpinning CHD in an overwhelming majority of patients remain unclear. In the present study, the coding exons and flanking introns of the PITX2 gene, which encodes a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2essential for cardiovascular morphogenesis as well as maxillary facial development, was sequenced in 196 unrelated patients with CHD and subsequently in the mutation carrier’s family members available. As a result, a novel heterozygous PITX2 mutation, p.Q102X for PITX2a, or p.Q148X for PITX2b, or p.Q155X for PITX2c, was identified in a family with endocardial cushion defect (ECD) and Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS). Genetic analysis of the pedigree showed that the nonsense mutation co-segregated with ECD and ARS transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance. The mutation was absent in 800 control chromosomes from an ethnically matched population. Functional analysis by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system revealed that the mutant PITX2 had no transcriptional activity and that the mutation eliminated synergistic transcriptional activation between PITX2 and NKX2.5, another transcription factor pivotal for cardiogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of PITX2 loss-of-function mutation with increased susceptibility to ECD and ARS. The findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning ECD and ARS, suggesting the potential implications for the antenatal prophylaxis and personalized treatment of CHD and ARS."
https://openalex.org/W1993199029,"Objective The primary aim of this study was to examine the self-reported, routine clinical practice behaviors of Australian optometrists with respect to advice regarding smoking, diet and nutritional supplementation. The study also sought to assess the potential influence of practitioner age, gender, practice location (major city versus regional), therapeutic-endorsement status and personal nutritional supplementation habits upon management practices in these areas. Methods A survey was electronically distributed to Australian optometrists (n = 4,242). Respondents anonymously provided information about their personal demographics and lifestyle behaviors (i.e., age, gender, practice location, therapeutic-endorsement status, smoking status, nutritional supplement intake) and routine patient management practices with respect to advice across three domains: smoking, diet and nutritional supplementation. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess for potential effects of the listed factors on practitioner behavior. Results A total of 283 completed surveys were received (completed survey response rate: 6.7%). Fewer than half of respondents indicated routinely asking their patients about smoking status. Younger practitioners were significantly (p < 0.05) less likely to enquire about patients’ smoking behaviors, but this did not extend to counseling for smoking cessation. Almost two-thirds of respondents indicated routinely counseling patients about diet. About half of practitioners specified routinely asking their patients about nutritional supplement intake; this form of questioning was significantly more likely if the respondent was female (p < 0.05). Practitioners who recommended nutritional supplements most commonly did so for age-related macular degeneration (91.2%) and dry eye disease (63.9%). The primary source of evidence used to guide practitioners’ nutrition-related patient management was reported to be peer-reviewed publications. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that there are no clear predictors of practitioner behavior across the three domains. Overall, this study suggests that there is scope for Australian optometrists to improve their routine engagement by questioning patients, as well as providing evidence-based clinical advice, about smoking status, diet and nutritional supplement behaviors, being key modifiable lifestyle risk factors with long-term implications for eye health."
https://openalex.org/W2032677697,"Fibrosis in the old mouse heart arises partly as a result of aberrant mesenchymal fibroblast activation. We have previously shown that endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the aged heart are markedly resistant to TGF-β signaling. Fibroblasts originating from these MSCs retain their TGF-β unresponsiveness and become inflammatory. In current studies, we found that these inflammatory fibroblasts secreted higher levels of IL-6 (3-fold increase, P < 0.05) when compared with fibroblasts derived from the young hearts. Elevated IL-6 levels in fibroblasts derived from old hearts arose from up-regulated expression of Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 1 (RasGrf1), a Ras activator (5-fold, P < 0.01). Knockdown of RasGrf1 by gene silencing or pharmacologic inhibition of farnesyltransferase (FTase) or ERK caused reduction of IL-6 mRNA (more than 65%, P < 0.01) and decreased levels of secreted IL-6 (by 44%, P < 0.01). In vitro, IL-6 markedly increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-driven monocyte-to-myeloid fibroblast formation after transendothelial migration (TEM; 3-fold, P < 0.01). In conclusion, abnormal expression of RasGrf1 promoted production of IL-6 by mesenchymal fibroblasts in the old heart. Secreted IL-6 supported conversion of monocyte into myeloid fibroblasts. This process promotes fibrosis and contributes to the diastolic dysfunction in the aging heart."
https://openalex.org/W2063728994,"Humans everywhere cooperate in groups to achieve benefits not attainable by individuals. Individual effort is often not automatically tied to a proportionate share of group benefits. This decoupling allows for free-riding, a strategy that (absent countermeasures) outcompetes cooperation. Empirically and formally, punishment potentially solves the evolutionary puzzle of group cooperation. Nevertheless, standard analyses appear to show that punishment alone is insufficient, because second-order free riders (those who cooperate but do not punish) can be shown to outcompete punishers. Consequently, many have concluded that other processes, such as cultural or genetic group selection, are required. Here, we present a series of agent-based simulations that show that group cooperation sustained by punishment easily evolves by individual selection when you introduce into standard models more biologically plausible assumptions about the social ecology and psychology of ancestral humans. We relax three unrealistic assumptions of past models. First, past models assume all punishers must punish every act of free riding in their group. We instead allow punishment to be probabilistic, meaning punishers can evolve to only punish some free riders some of the time. This drastically lowers the cost of punishment as group size increases. Second, most models unrealistically do not allow punishment to recruit labor; punishment merely reduces the punished agent’s fitness. We instead realistically allow punished free riders to cooperate in the future to avoid punishment. Third, past models usually restrict agents to interact in a single group their entire lives. We instead introduce realistic social ecologies in which agents participate in multiple, partially overlapping groups. Because of this, punitive tendencies are more expressed and therefore more exposed to natural selection. These three moves toward greater model realism reveal that punishment and cooperation easily evolve by direct selection—even in sizeable groups."
https://openalex.org/W1978324781,"Emerging evidence has demonstrated the critical roles for both androgen and Wnt pathways in prostate tumorigenesis. A recent integrative genomic analysis of human prostate cancers (PCas) has revealed a unique enrichment of androgen and Wnt signaling in early-onset PCas, implying their clinical significance in the disease. Additionally, interaction between the androgen receptor (AR) and β-catenin has long been detected in PCa cells. However, the consequence of this interaction in prostate tumorigenesis is still unknown. Because mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli, β-catenin and other components of the destruction complex are generally rare in PCas, other mechanisms of aberrant Wnt signaling activation have been speculated. To address these critical questions, we developed Ctnnb1L(ex3)/+/R26hARL/+:PB-Cre4 mice, in which transgenic AR and stabilized β-catenin are co-expressed in prostatic epithelial cells. We observed accelerated tumor development, aggressive tumor invasion and a decreased survival rate in Ctnnb1L(ex3)/+/R26hARL/+:PB-Cre4 compound mice compared with age-matched Ctnnb1L(ex3)/+:PB-Cre4 littermate controls, which only have stabilized β-catenin expression in the prostate. Castration of the above transgenic mice resulted in significant tumor regression, implying an essential role of androgen signaling in tumor growth and maintenance. Implantation of the prostatic epithelial cells isolated from the transgenic mice regenerated prostate intraepithelial neoplasias and prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions. Microarray analyses of transcriptional profiles showed more robust enrichment of known tumor- and metastasis-promoting genes: Spp1, Egr1, c-Myc, Sp5, and Sp6 genes, in samples isolated from Ctnnb1L(ex3)/+/R26hARL/+:PB-Cre4 compound mice than those from Ctnnb1L(ex3)/+:PB-Cre4 and R26hARL/+:PB-Cre4 littermate controls. Together, these data demonstrate a confounding role of androgen signaling in β-catenin-initiated oncogenic transformation in prostate tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1976137909,"Poa pratensis L. is a forage and turf grass species well adapted to a wide range of mesic to moist habitats. Due to its genome complexity little is known regarding evolution, genome composition and intraspecific phylogenetic relationships of this species. In the present study we investigated the morphological and genetic diversity of 33 P. pratensis accessions from 23 different countries using both nuclear and chloroplast molecular markers as well as flow cytometry of somatic tissues. This with the aim of shedding light on the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the collection that includes both cultivated and wild materials. Morphological characterization showed that the most relevant traits able to distinguish cultivated from wild forms were spring growth habit and leaf colour. The genome size analysis revealed high variability both within and between accessions in both wild and cultivated materials. The sequence analysis of the trnL-F chloroplast region revealed a low polymorphism level that could be the result of the complex mode of reproduction of this species. In addition, a strong reduction of chloroplast SSR variability was detected in cultivated materials, where only two alleles were conserved out of the four present in wild accessions. Contrarily, at nuclear level, high variability exist in the collection where the analysis of 11 SSR loci allowed the detection of a total of 91 different alleles. A Bayesian analysis performed on nuclear SSR data revealed that studied materials belong to two main clusters. While wild materials are equally represented in both clusters, the domesticated forms are mostly belonging to cluster P2 which is characterized by lower genetic diversity compared to the cluster P1. In the Neighbour Joining tree no clear distinction was found between accessions with the exception of those from China and Mongolia that were clearly separated from all the others."
https://openalex.org/W2027527435,"The present study compared the thermal responses of the finger to 0 and 8°C water immersion, two commonly used temperatures for cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) research. On two separate and counterbalanced occasions 15 male and 15 female participants immersed their index finger in 20°C water for 5 min followed by either 0 or 8°C water for 30 min. Skin temperature, cardiovascular and perceptual data were recorded. Secondary analyses were performed between sexes and comparing 0.5, 1 and 4°C CIVD amplitude thresholds. With a 0.5°C threshold, CIVD waves were more prevalent in 8°C (2 (1 – 3) than in 0°C (1.5 (0 – 3)), but the amplitude was lower (4.0 ± 2.3 v 9.2 ± 4.0°C). Mean, minimum and maximum finger temperatures were lower in 0°C during the 30 min immersion, and CIVD onset and peak time occurred later in 0°C. Thermal sensation was lower and pain sensation was higher in 0°C. There were no differences between males and females in any of the physiological or CIVD data with the exception of SBP, which was higher in males. Females reported feeling higher thermal sensations in 8°C and lower pain sensations in 0°C and 8°C compared to males. Fewer CIVD responses were observed when using a 4°C (1 (0 – 3)) threshold to quantify a CIVD wave compared to using a 1°C (2 (0 – 3)) or 0.5°C (2 (0 – 3)) amplitude. In conclusion, both 0 and 8 °C can elicit CIVD but 8°C may be more suitable when looking to optimise the number of CIVD waves while minimising participant discomfort. The CIVD response to water immersion does not appear to be influenced by sex. Researchers should consider the amplitude threshold that was used to determine a CIVD wave when interpreting previous data."
https://openalex.org/W2019877561,"Radioadaptive response (RAR) in mammalian cells refers to the phenomenon where a low-dose ionizing irradiation alters the gene expression profiles, and protects the cells from the detrimental effects of a subsequent high dose exposure. Despite the completion of numerous experimental studies on RAR, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to have a comprehensive investigation on the RAR induced in the AG01522 human fibroblasts first exposed to 5 cGy (priming dose) and then followed by 2 Gy (challenge dose) of X-ray through comparisons to those cells that had only received a single 2 Gy dose. We studied how the priming dose affected the expression of gene transcripts, and to identify transcripts or pathways that were associated with the reduced chromosomal damages (in terms of the number of micronuclei) after application of the challenging dose. Through the mRNA and microRNA microarray analyses, the transcriptome alteration in AG01522 cells was examined, and the significantly altered genes were identified for different irradiation procedures using bioinformatics approaches. We observed that a low-dose X-ray exposure produced an alert, triggering and altering cellular responses to defend against subsequent high dose-induced damages, and accelerating the cell repair process. Moreover, the p53 signaling pathway was found to play critial roles in regulating DNA damage responses at the early stage after application of the challenging dose, particularly in the RAR group. Furthermore, microRNA analyses also revealed that cell communication and intercellular signaling transduction played important roles after low-dose irradiation. We conclude that RAR benefits from the alarm mechanisms triggered by a low-dose priming radation dose."

This suppression of DRA is associated with diarrheal phenotype. Therefore, current studies were undertaken to examine the effects of ATRA on DRA expression. DRA mRNA levels were significantly elevated (∼4-fold) in response to ATRA with induction starting as early as 8 h of incubation. Similarly, ATRA increased DRA protein expression by ∼50%. Furthermore, DRA promoter activity was significantly increased in response to ATRA indicating transcriptional activation. ATRA effects on DRA expression appeared to be mediated via the RAR-β receptor subtype, as ATRA remarkably induced RAR-β mRNA levels, whereas RAR-β knockdown substantially attenuated the ability of ATRA to increase DRA expression. Results obtained from agonist (CH-55) and antagonist (LE-135) studies further confirmed that ATRA exerts its effects through RAR-β.

https://openalex.org/W2033984184,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, previously associated only with infection of macaques, is now known to infect humans as well and has become a significant public health problem in Southeast Asia. This species should therefore be targeted in vaccine and therapeutic strategies against human malaria. Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), which plays a role in Plasmodium merozoite invasion of the erythrocyte, is currently being pursued in human vaccine trials against P. falciparum. Recent vaccine trials in macaques using the P. knowlesi orthologue PkAMA1 have shown that it protects against infection by this parasite species and thus should be developed for human vaccination as well. Here, we present the crystal structure of Domains 1 and 2 of the PkAMA1 ectodomain, and of its complex with the invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody R31C2. The Domain 2 (D2) loop, which is displaced upon binding the Rhoptry Neck Protein 2 (RON2) receptor, makes significant contacts with the antibody. R31C2 inhibits binding of the Rhoptry Neck Protein 2 (RON2) receptor by steric blocking of the hydrophobic groove and by preventing the displacement of the D2 loop which is essential for exposing the complete binding site on AMA1. R31C2 recognizes a non-polymorphic epitope and should thus be cross-strain reactive. PkAMA1 is much less polymorphic than the P. falciparum and P. vivax orthologues. Unlike these two latter species, there are no polymorphic sites close to the RON2-binding site of PkAMA1, suggesting that P. knowlesi has not developed a mechanism of immune escape from the host’s humoral response to AMA1."

The flexible C-terminal residues of GroEL, which are invisible in the x-ray crystal structure, have recently been suggested to play a key role in the efficient encapsulation of substrates. These C-terminal regions have also been suggested to separate the double rings of GroEL at the bottom of the cavity. To elucidate the role of the C-terminal regions of GroEL on the efficient encapsulation of substrate proteins, we herein investigated the effects of C-terminal truncation on GroE-mediated folding using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a substrate. We demonstrated that the yield of in-cage folding mediated by a single ring GroEL (SR1) was markedly decreased by truncation, whereas that mediated by a double ring football-shaped complex was not affected. These results suggest that the C-terminal region of GroEL functions as a barrier between rings, preventing the leakage of GFP through the bottom space of the cage. We also found that once GFP folded into its native conformation within the cavity of SR1 it never escaped even in the absence of the C-terminal tails. This suggests that GFP molecules escaped through the pore only when they adopted a denatured conformation. Therefore, the folding and escape of GFP from C-terminally truncated SR1·GroES appeared to be competing with each other.

https://openalex.org/W2325531102,"The effects of water depth, seasonal exposure, and substrate orientation on microbioerosion were studied by means of a settlement experiment deployed in 15, 50, 100, and 250 m water depth south-west of the Peloponnese Peninsula (Greece). At each depth, an experimental platform was exposed for a summer period, a winter period, and about an entire year. On the up- and down-facing side of each platform, substrates were fixed to document the succession of bioerosion traces, and to measure variations in bioerosion and accretion rates. In total, 29 different bioerosion traces were recorded revealing a dominance of microborings produced by phototrophic and organotrophic microendoliths, complemented by few macroborings, attachment scars, and grazing traces. The highest bioerosion activity was recorded in 15 m up-facing substrates in the shallow euphotic zone, largely driven by phototrophic cyanobacteria. Towards the chlorophyte-dominated deep euphotic to dysphotic zones and the organotroph-dominated aphotic zone the intensity of bioerosion and the diversity of bioerosion traces strongly decreased. During summer the activity of phototrophs was higher than during winter, which was likely stimulated by enhanced light availability due to more hours of daylight and increased irradiance angles. Stable water column stratification and a resulting nutrient depletion in shallow water led to lower turbidity levels and caused a shift in the photic zonation that was reflected by more phototrophs being active at greater depth. With respect to the subordinate bioerosion activity of organotrophs, fluctuations in temperature and the trophic regime were assumed to be the main seasonal controls. The observed patterns in overall bioeroder distribution and abundance were mirrored by the calculated carbonate budget with bioerosion rates exceeding carbonate accretion rates in shallow water and distinctly higher bioerosion rates at all depths during summer. These findings highlight the relevance of bioerosion and accretion for the carbonate budget of the Ionian Sea."
https://openalex.org/W1985681231,"p73 is a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family, which mediates genotoxic stress response by triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Similar to p53, p73 is maintained at very low levels, but it gets rapidly induced upon genotoxic stress. Mounting evidences demonstrate that p73 is primarily regulated posttranslationally. However, the molecular mechanisms which determine its stability and activity discerningly under normal and stress conditions are still not well understood. Here, we employed a proteomics approach to identify differential interactors of p73 under normal and genotoxic stress conditions. We report here that TRIM28, an E3 ligase, interacts with p73 and targets it for proteasomal degradation under normal conditions. Genotoxic stress-induced phosphorylation of p73 at tyrosine 99 residue by c-abl kinase leads to abrogation of this interaction thereby promoting p73 stabilization. Furthermore, the phosphorylated form of p73 specifically interacts with MED15, which serves as a transcriptional coactivator and leads to activation of proarrest, proapoptotic and anti-metastatic genes. RNAi-mediated abrogation of TRIM28 expression facilitates p73-mediated tumor suppression in mouse tumor models, whereas disruption of MED15 expression abrogates p73 tumor suppressor and anti-metastatic functions. These findings provide new insights into the pivotal role of Tyr99 phosphorylation in determining p73 levels and functions."

https://openalex.org/W2052578252,"Microtubule severing is a biochemical reaction that generates an internal break in a microtubule and regulation of microtubule severing is critical for cellular processes such as ciliogenesis, morphogenesis, and meiosis and mitosis. Katanin is a conserved heterodimeric ATPase that severs and disassembles microtubules, but the molecular determinants for regulation of microtubule severing by katanin remain poorly defined. Here we show that the non-catalytic domains of Drosophila katanin regulate its abundance and activity in living cells. Our data indicate that the microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain and adjacent linker region of the Drosophila katanin catalytic subunit Kat60 cooperate to regulate microtubule severing in two distinct ways. First, the MIT domain and linker region of Kat60 decrease its abundance by enhancing its proteasome-dependent degradation. The Drosophila katanin regulatory subunit Kat80, which is required to stabilize Kat60 in cells, conversely reduces the proteasome-dependent degradation of Kat60. Second, the MIT domain and linker region of Kat60 augment its microtubule-disassembly activity by enhancing its association with microtubules. On the basis of our data, we propose that the non-catalytic domains of Drosophila katanin serve as the principal sites of integration of regulatory inputs, thereby controlling its ability to sever and disassemble microtubules."

Many studies on TEL-AML1 describe specific properties of the fusion protein, but a thorough understanding of its function is lacking. We exploited a pluripotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell line, EML1, and generated a cell line (EML-TA) stably expressing the TEL-AML1 fusion protein. EML1 cells differentiate to mature B-cells following treatment with IL7; whereas EML-TA display an impaired differentiation capacity and remain blocked at an early stage of maturation. Global gene expression profiling of EML1 cells at different stages of B-lymphoid differentiation, compared with EML-TA, identified the interferon (IFN)α/β pathway as a primary target of repression by TEL-AML1. In particular, expression and phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was decreased in EML-TA cells; strikingly, stable expression of IRF3 restored the capacity of EML-TA cells to differentiate into mature B-cells. Similarly, IRF3 silencing in EML1 cells by siRNA was sufficient to block B-lymphoid differentiation. The ability of TEL-AML1 to block B-cell differentiation and downregulate the IRF3-IFNα/β pathway was confirmed in mouse and human primary hematopoietic precursor cells (Lin− and CD34+ cells, respectively), and in a patient-derived cell line expressing TEL-AML1 (REH). Furthermore, treatment of TEL-AML1 expressing cells with IFNα/β was sufficient to overcome the maturation block.

https://openalex.org/W2044203472,"Excitotoxicity due to glutamate receptor over-activation is one of the key mediators of neuronal death after an ischemic insult. Therefore, a major function of astrocytes is to maintain low extracellular levels of glutamate. The ability of astrocytic glutamate transporters to regulate the extracellular glutamate concentration depends upon the hyperpolarized membrane potential of astrocytes conferred by the presence of K+ channels in their membranes. We have previously shown that TREK-2 potassium channels in cultured astrocytes are up-regulated by ischemia and may support glutamate clearance by astrocytes during ischemia. Thus, herein we determine the mechanism leading to this up-regulation and assess the localization of TREK-2 channels in astrocytes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. By using a cell surface biotinylation assay we confirmed that functional TREK-2 protein is up-regulated in the astrocytic membrane after ischemic conditions. Using real time RT-PCR, we determined that the levels of TREK-2 mRNA were not increased in response to ischemic conditions. By using Western blot and a variety of protein synthesis inhibitors, we demonstrated that the increase of TREK-2 protein expression requires De novo protein synthesis, while protein degradation pathways do not contribute to TREK-2 up-regulation after ischemic conditions. Immunohistochemical studies revealed TREK-2 localization in astrocytes together with increased expression of the selective glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, in brain 24 hours after transient middle cerebral occlusion. Our data indicate that functional TREK-2 channels are up-regulated in the astrocytic membrane during ischemia through a mechanism requiring De novo protein synthesis. This study provides important information about the mechanisms underlying TREK-2 regulation, which has profound implications in neurological diseases such as ischemia where astrocytes play an important role."

Background Cardiac biomarker testing is standard in high-income countries, but little is known about the availability and use of cardiac biomarker testing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as China. Methods Based on a nationally representative sample of Chinese hospitals in 2001, 2006 and 2011, we describe the temporal trends and regional differences in the hospital capability and rates of use of cardiac biomarker testing, as well as the variation in use across hospitals with testing capability, for patients labeled with the diagnosis of AMI. Results We sampled 175 hospitals (162 participated in the study) and 18,631 AMI admissions. 14,370 patients were included in analysis of biomarker use. The proportion of hospitals with biomarker testing capability was 57.4% in 2001 (25.0% troponin and 32.4% creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) only) and 96.3% (81.4% troponin and 14.9% CK-MB only) in 2011. The proportion of hospitals with troponin testing capability in 2011 was significantly higher in urban compared with rural hospitals (96.8% vs. 71.4%, p< 0.001). In 2011, only 55.9% of hospitals with troponin testing capability (71 out of 127 hospitals) used the assay for more than 80% of their patients with AMI. Among hospitals with either biomarker testing capability, there was marked variation in use in both rural (from 7.1% to 100.0% of patients) and urban hospitals (from 57.9% to 100.0% of patients). In 2011, 36.1% of the patients with AMI did not have troponin tested and 4.9% did not have either biomarker measured. Conclusions The recommended biomarker tests for AMI diagnosis are not universally available and the testing is not consistently applied when it is available in China.

Our results showed that mealybug colony growth rate and percentage parasitism were significantly affected by ant tending, parasitoid presence, and initial mealybug density separately. However, there were no interactions among the independent factors. There were also no significant interactions between ant tending and parasitoid density on either mealybug colony growth rate or percentage parasitism. Mealybug colony growth rate showed a negative linear relationship with initial mealybug density but a positive linear relationship with the level of ant tending. These results suggest that benefits to mealybugs are density-independent and are affected by ant tending level."

Methods Twenty-three healthy male subjects were enrolled. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood. The genotype of 5-HTTLPR was determined using polymerase chain reaction. Subjects with the s/s genotype (n = 13) were compared to those with the l allele (genotypes l/s, l/l, n = 10). Controlled rectal distension from 0 to 40 mmHg was delivered in random order using a barostat. Radioactive H2[15-O] saline was injected at time of distension followed by positron emission tomography (PET). Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) and structural equation modeling (SEM).

The crystal structure of the nucleotide-binding domain of an SMC protein in complex with the adenylate kinase bisubstrate inhibitor P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′) pentaphosphate (Ap5A) suggests that AMP binds to the conserved Q-loop glutamine during the adenylate kinase reaction. Therefore, we hypothesized that mutating the corresponding residue in CFTR, Gln-1291, selectively disrupts adenylate kinase-dependent channel gating at physiologic nucleotide concentrations. We found that substituting Gln-1291 with bulky side-chain amino acids abolished the effects of Ap5A, AMP, and adenosine 5′-monophosphoramidate on CFTR channel function. 8-Azidoadenosine 5′-monophosphate photolabeling of the AMP-binding site and adenylate kinase activity were disrupted in Q1291F CFTR.

Background: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels have ATPase and adenylate kinase activity. Results: Mutating Gln-1291 disrupts adenylate kinase- but not ATPase-dependent gating, and it reduces channel activity in airway epithelia. Conclusion: Normal CFTR function in airway epithelia may depend on its adenylate kinase activity. Significance: Adenylate kinase activity is important for the function of an ATP-binding cassette transporter."

However, the data on their pharmacokinetics in animals is limited, especially after repeated administration. Evidence exist that in chickens (Gallus gallus) salicylate (SA) may induce its own elimination. The aim of this study was to investigate salicylate pharmacokinetics and egg residues during repeated administration of sodium salicylate (SS) to laying hens. Pharmacokinetics of SA was assessed during 14 d oral administration of SS at daily doses of 50 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight to laying hens. On the 1st, 7th and 14th d a 24 h-long pharmacokinetic study was carried out, whereas eggs were collected daily. Salicylate concentrations in plasma and eggs were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and pharmacokinetic variables were calculated using a non-compartmental model. Mean residence time (MRT), minimal plasma concentration (Cmin, C16h) and elimination half-life (T1/2el) of SA showed gradual decrease in layers administered with a lower dose. Total body clearance (ClB) increased. Layers administered with the higher dose showed a decrease only in the T1/2el. In the low dose group, SA was found only in the egg white and was low throughout the experiment. Egg whites from the higher dose group showed initially high SA levels which significantly decreased during the experiment. Yolk SA levels were lower and showed longer periods of accumulation and elimination. Repeated administration of SS induces SA elimination, although this effect may differ depending on the dose and production type of a chicken. Decreased plasma drug concentration may have clinical implications during prolonged SS treatment."

However, much of the literature on fan loyalty has paid little attention to the topic from the perspective of youth pop culture. The present study explored the meaning of fan loyalty in the context of China. Data were collected by the method of in-depth interviews with 16 young Chinese people aged between 19 and 25 years who currently or once were pop fans. The results indicated that fan loyalty entails three components: involvement, satisfaction, and affiliation. These three components regulate the process of fan loyalty development, which can be divided into four stages: inception, upgrade, zenith, and decline. This model provides a conceptual explanation of why and how young Chinese fans are loyal to their favorite stars. The implications of the findings are discussed."
