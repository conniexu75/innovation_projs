https://openalex.org/W2041967294,"Dynamic modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on Ser/Thr residues is ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes and is analogous to protein phosphorylation. The enzyme for the addition of this modification, O-GlcNAc transferase, has been cloned from several species. Here, we have cloned a human brain O-GlcNAcase that cleaves O-GlcNAc off proteins. The cloned cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 916 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 103 kDa and a pI value of 4.63, but the protein migrates as a 130-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cloned O-GlcNAcase has a pH optimum of 5.5–7.0 and is inhibited by GlcNAc but not by GalNAc.p-Nitrophenyl (pNP)-β-GlcNAc, but notpNP-β-GalNAc or pNP-α-GlcNAc, is a substrate. The cloned enzyme cleaves GlcNAc, but not GalNAc, from glycopeptides. Cell fractionation suggests that the overexpressed protein is mostly localized in the cytoplasm. It therefore has all the expected characteristics of O-GlcNAcase and is distinct from lysosomal hexosaminidases. Northern blots show that the transcript is expressed in every human tissue examined but is the highest in the brain, placenta, and pancreas. An understanding of O-GlcNAc dynamics and O-GlcNAcase may be key to elucidating the relationships between O-phosphate and O-GlcNAc and to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration.

Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a myriad of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in all metazoans have been found to carry this modification. Such proteins cover a broad range, including many transcription factors, RNA polymerase II, oncogenes, nuclear pore proteins, viral proteins, and tumor repressors (for details, see Refs.2Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar and 3Snow D.M. Hart G.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 181: 43-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and citations within). Unlike classic O- orN-linked protein glycosylations, the O-GlcNAc modification involves only a single GlcNAc moiety linked to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr residues, generally is not elongated, and is found exclusively in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Protein O-GlcNAcylation is highly dynamic, and the cycle of addition/removal of the sugar moiety is rapid, analogous to protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases (2Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Indeed, existing evidence suggests that this modification has a “yin-yang” relationship with protein phosphorylation in some cases (4Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Many O-GlcNAcylation sites have been mapped to phosphorylation sites or adjacent sites (5Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Cole R.N. Hart G.W. J.

Such spatial localization indicates that O-GlcNAc may regulate the target protein by competing with protein kinases (4Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Recent studies using phosphatase and kinase inhibitors have provided direct evidence for a general reciprocal relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation on some proteins (8Griffith L.S. Schmitz B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Lefebvre T. Alonso C. Mahboub S. Dupire M.J. Zanetta J.P. Caillet-Boudin M.L. Michalski J.C. Biochim.

Most transcription factors examined so far, including Sp1, AP1, AP2, AP4 (10Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 also controls its degradation by the proteasome (15Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia-induced superoxide production increases Sp1 glycosylation resulting in the activation of genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes (16Du W.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which transfers GlcNAc from the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc to target proteins, has been purified and cloned from several species including human, rat, andCaenorhabditis elegans (17Haltiwanger R.S.

It does not share any significant homology with any other known proteins, including glycosyltransferases, and is highly conserved from C. elegans to human. Disruption of the ogt gene is lethal in mouse embryonic stem cells, further underscoring the importance ofO-GlcNAc modification in cellular functions (20Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from such proteins, was purified several years ago from rat spleen (21Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a neutral cytosolic β-glucosaminidase or hexosaminidase C (EC 3.2.1.52). To further study the function of this modification, we have now extensively purified O-GlcNAcase from bovine brain, sequenced the protein by mass spectrometry, and cloned the cDNA. The O-GlcNAcase is evolutionarily conserved, distinct from lysosomal acidic hexosaminidases A and B. The recombinant protein has all the expected characteristics of O-GlcNAcase, including the ability to cleave O-GlcNAc from glycopeptides. All chromatographic materials were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Purification procedure is substantially modified from that of Dong and Hart (21Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were conducted at 4 °C or on ice. Three bovine brains (∼1 kg) were frozen in liquid N2 and shipped on dry ice from Pel Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR) and stored at −80 °C until use. The brains were smashed into smaller pieces and homogenized in 5 volumes (v/w) of homogenization buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 15 mm 2-mecaptoethanol, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA) in a Hamilton Beach blender with 5 × 20-s bursts. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded, and the cytosolic supernatant was pooled in a 5-liter beaker. The cytosolic supernatant was subjected to 30–50% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of buffer A (20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged to clarify the solution. The solution was then thoroughly dialyzed against buffer A and centrifuged again to eliminate any insoluble materials that had resulted from dialysis. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a DE52 column (900-ml bed vol) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using a peristaltic pump. After washing the column with 3 liters of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 4 liters of buffer A at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The protein profile was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions (16 ml) enriched in O-GlcNAcase activity were pooled. MgCl2 was added to the pooled fractions at a final concentration of 1 mm. The preparation was then applied to a ConA column (60 ml) equilibrated in ConA buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm2-mercapoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2). The column was washed with 200 ml of ConA buffer. The flow-through and the wash were combined. The enzyme solution from Step 4 was concentrated by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialyzed, and applied three times to a Blue A-Sepharose column (25 ml) equilibrated in buffer A. Again the activity was present in the flow-through fraction. The protein was pooled and clarified by centrifugation. The sample from Step 5 was injected to the DE52 cellulose column (same size as above), and protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–350 mmNaCl in 4 liters of buffer A. Activity was recovered as in Step 3 and precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of Mono-Q buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitor mixture (22Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and 1 mm PMSF), dialyzed, and clarified by centrifugation. Native PAGE was performed using a preparative Prepcell apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The sample from Step 6 was divided into three equal volumes (45 mg of protein each) and loaded batch-wise onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel (5-cm-long separating gel). The gel was run for 24 h at 12 watts of constant power. Protein was eluted in Mono-Q buffer at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. 5-min fractions were collected and assayed for protein content and enzyme activity. TheO-GlcNAcase-containing fractions from each native PAGE run was resolved on a Mono-Q column (HR10/10) with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 450 ml of Mono-Q buffer at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Fractions (4.5 ml) rich inO-GlcNAcase activity were pooled and then separated for a second time on the Mono-Q column. The final preparation was concentrated using Millipore concentrators to a final volume of 0.4 ml. Glycerol (40% final) and 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture were added to the preparation. The enzyme was stored at −20 °C. The final preparation from Step 8 was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 or with silver. The desired protein bands were excised individually, reduced, alkylated, and digested in-gel with modified trypsin (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) as described previously (23Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides from each protein were analyzed by capillary reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography with in-line tandem MS/MS on a Finnigan LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer. Proteins were identified by the SEQUEST algorithm with sequencing of at least seven tryptic peptides for each protein (24Ducret, A., Van, O.ostveen, I., Eng, J. K., Yates, J. R., and Aebersold, R. (1998) Protein Sci. 7, 706–719.Google Scholar). A putative O-GlcNAcase with a theoretical length of 916 amino acids in human was identified by the above proteomic approach. A cDNA fragment, KIAA0679 (GenBank™ accession number AB014579), which contains the coding sequence for 767 amino acids of the C terminus of the humanO-GlcNAcase and a 2.0-kb 3′-untranslated region, was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan, in the vector pBluescript. The coding sequence of this fragment was subsequently transferred to pcDNA3.1His A using XhoI andXbaI, which were located within the polycloning cloning site of pBluescript and in the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA, respectively. The missing 5′-end fragment of the full-length coding cDNA (447 bp) was amplified by PCR from a human brain Marathon cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the forward primer GGATGGTGCAGAAGGAGAGTCAAGCGAC and the reverse primer TAGAAACCTCTTCGATGGACTCTACTGG. The forward primer sequence was based on published data (25Heckel D. Comtesse N. Brass N. Blin N. Zang K.D. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1859-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the reverse primer was located in the KIAA0679 clone. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min for 30–35 cycles. A second round of PCR using the first PCR product as template and a forward primer incorporating a NotI site (CCGGGCGGCCGCGGATGGTGCAGAAGGAGAG) and the same reverse primer was performed. The product was digested with NotI andHindIII (unique site in the PCR product) and ligated in-frame into the pcDNA3.1His A-KIAA0679 construct. This gave rise to a full-length cDNA in the vector pcDNA3.1His A. The final construct was sequenced. Unless stated otherwise,O-GlcNAcase activity was assayed as described in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm pNP-β-GlcNAc, 50 mm GalNAc (21Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified bovine kidney lysosomal β-hexosaminidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) activity was assayed in citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm pNP-β-GlcNAc. To test the ability of recombinant O-GlcNAcase to cleave O-GlcNAc from glycopeptides, two glycopeptides, CTD-GlcNAc (N-YSPTS(GlcNAc)PSK-C) or CTD-GalNAc (N-YSPTS(GalNAc)PSK-C), were synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptides were purified on a C18 column under reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography conditions and used as a substrate for cloned O-GlcNAcase. The reaction products were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). A plasmid of pcDNA3.1His A containing the full-lengthO-GlcNAcase cDNA was prepared using a Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfection was mediated by LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) using 50–90% confluent Cos-7 cells. Cells were harvested 2 days post-transfection and sonicated for 2 × 12 s in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture, and clarified by centrifugation. For characterizations, the recombinant protein was purified over a nickel affinity column. After transfection withO- GlcNAcase, Cos-7 cells were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as described (26Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with one modification: The 25- to 50-μl nuclear pellet was carefully washed in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer A to minimize cross-contamination. Immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies recognizing the nuclear protein retinoblastoma (Rb) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), cytoplasmic protein α-tubulin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), or with anti-Xpress antibody, which is specific for the sequence DLYDDDDK located at the N terminus of the overexpressed O-GlcNAcase fusion protein (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Northern blot analyses were performed on a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) using the manufacturer's protocol. To prepare anO-GlcNAcase-specific probe, the full-length coding sequence (2.75 kb) was amplified by PCR and labeled by random primer using [α-32P]dCTP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After stripping in 0.5% SDS at 100 °C for 10 min, the blot was reprobed for β-actin. Historically,O- GlcNAcase, or neutral hexosaminidase C, has been difficult to purify. For example, an early report described a purification of only 25- to 40-fold from bovine brain despite the extensive use of chromatographic steps (27Overdijk B. van der Kroef W.M.J. van Steijn G.J. Lisman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, in rat brain, the enzyme has been purified over 2000-fold to a major band (28Izumi T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6991-6999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, renewed effort has gone into its purification from rat spleen and bovine brain in the pursuit to cloning the cDNA (21Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hanover J.A. Lai Z. Lee G. Lubas W.A. Sato S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have taken an approach, partly based on published literature (21Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but yet incorporating some novel steps in the purification ofO-GlcNAcase from bovine brain. Notably, we have discovered that the enzymatic activity survives the harsh conditions of native PAGE (high pH and high ionic strength) and migrates more slowly (RF = 0.28 in 6% native gel) than most other proteins in the gel (data not shown). This property allows the effective separation of O-GlcNAcase from other proteins with higher RF values on a preparative scale native gel (Fig. 1 b). This step, in conjunction with other chromatographic steps outlined in the protocol, purified the protein ∼1500-fold, with a specific activity of 1840 nmol/min/mg of protein. The final preparation still shows seven well defined bands on SDS-PAGE following silver staining, even after extensive purification (Fig.2). We do not understand the basis for this difficulty, but we have observed that the peaks forO-GlcNAcase activity are very broad throughout the purification procedure (Fig. 1). One example of this is illustrated in the Mono-Q step, where the general protein peaks are sharp but yet the activity peak spreads over 50 ml (Fig. 1 c). We have also tried ion exchange on Superose Q and hydroxylapatite columns or hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose column. They, too, give poor separations or the enzyme binds very tightly to phenyl-Sepharose resulting in >50% activity loss (data not shown). The seven bands on the silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel were excised individually, digested with trypsin, and sequenced by electrospray MS/MS. The fragmentation data were used to search protein and DNA data bases. This approach identified six proteins with known functions in six of the bands (Fig. 2). Another protein, which runs as a 130-kDa band on SDS-PAGE, is a hypothetical protein without any clearly defined functions (GenBank, KIAA0679). BLAST searches indicated that the hypothetical protein shared significant homology with a protein from C. elegans called “similar to hyaluronoglucosaminidase” (GenBank, AAA68333.1). Because hyaluro- noglucosaminidase degrades hyaluronic acid, which is a GlcNAcβ1–4GlcUA polymer, it was possible that a hyaluronoglucosaminidase may share some homology withO-GlcNAcase. Furthermore, careful comparisons ofO-GlcNAcase activity and protein patterns on the SDS gels of different pools during the purification procedure indicated that this protein was one of only two bands that corresponded with activity (the other band was Protein 1 in Fig. 2, data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that this may be the O-GlcNAcase, and cloned the cDNA. Further characterization of the expression product of the cDNA confirmed that band 2 on Fig. 2 was, indeed,O-GlcNAcase (see below). BLAST searches of data bases reveal that O-GlcNAcase is conserved in higher eukaryotic species, and the homologue is absent in yeast or prokaryotes. The sequences and alignment of O-GlcNAcase from human, C. elegans, and Drosophila are shown in Fig. 3. In a pairwise alignment, the human sequence shares 55 and 43% homology with that ofDrosophila and C. elegans, respectively, whereasDrosophila and C. elegans are 43% similar. Close inspection of the sequences indicates that the N-terminal ∼400 and the C-terminal ∼350 amino acids in the human sequence are conserved to a higher degree. These two domains are separated by a highly variable region of ∼150 amino acids. Another feature is that most of the aromatic residues are conserved among the species. For example, out of the 13 Trp residues found in the human sequence, 9 are invariant in Drosophila and C. elegans, two are conservative (substituted by Tyr or Phe), and only two are variable. The O-GlcNAcase sequence is conserved at a strikingly higher level in mammals. Four overlapping EST sequences from cow, which cover 46% of the human protein, show that these two species are 100% identical in these regions (BE481597, BE588694, BF043559, andAW463869). Five EST entries for mouse, most of which are overlapping, show that human and mouse are 97.8% identical (AW907793, AW324047,AI530529, AW762257, and AA240394). In the case of zebrafish, two overlapping EST sequences covering 33.8% of the human protein indicate that zebrafish and human are 85% identical and 92% similar (AI882982and AI722710). Apart from the above-described homologues, O-GlcNAcase does not show significant homology with any other proteins, including known glycosidases. Short stretches of ∼200 amino acids of the polypeptide do show loose homology to a number of proteins such as hyaluronidase (AAA23259.1), a putative acetyltransferase (AL158057), eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1γ (Z11531, S26649), and the 11-1 polypeptide (X07453, S00485). Sequence analyses by a computer program PSORT II (available on the Web) show thatO-GlcNAcase does not possess any known signal peptides, domains, or motifs. The analyses do, however, suggest that the endogenous protein is localized in the cytoplasm (p = 0.522) and the nucleus (p = 0.391). To ascertain that the cloned cDNA indeed encoded O-GlcNAcase, we subcloned the entire coding region in-frame into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1His and overexpressed for activity in Cos-7 cells. Transient transfection resulted in a 6-fold increase inO-GlcNAcase activity over endogenous activity in the cells (Fig. 4 a). After nickel affinity purification, the activity from theO-GlcNAcase-transfected cells was 230 nmol/min/mg of protein but was not detectable from control transfected cells (Fig.4 b). These data show that the activity is due to overexpression from the plasmid. Fig. 4 c shows that a distinct band of the correct molecular mass (135 kDa) was isolated after nickel purification from transfected cells. This band was immunoreactive with the Xpress antibody, which was specific for a peptide sequence in the overexpressed protein. We further characterized the properties of the cloned O-GlcNAcase and compared them with those of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase purified from bovine kidney. As expected, the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase had an acidic pH optimum (pH 3.5–5.5) with little activity at pH 7.0 or above (Fig.5 a). On the other hand, the cloned O-GlcNAcase had a pH optimum of 5.7–7.0 and retained significant activity (∼30%) at pH 7–8. This pH profile is consistent with the expected localization of O-GlcNAcase in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The two enzymes also responded differently to inhibitors. GalNAc, a widely used inhibitor of acidic β-hexosaminidase, inhibited the lysosomal enzyme 50% at 5.0 mm and 88% at 50 mm. The cloned O-GlcNAcase was not inhibited at all by GalNAc up to 50 mm (Fig. 5 b). GlcNAc and its synthetic analogue PUGNAc inhibited both enzymes but were more potent with the O-GlcNAcase (Fig. 5, c andd). O-GlcNAcase also differed from lysosomal β-hexosaminidase in substrate requirements. In the in vitro assays, purified recombinant O-GlcNAcase cleaved only pNP-β-GlcNAc, but not pNP-β-GalNAc orpNP-α-GlcNAc (Fig. 6). The activity using the latter two compounds as substrates was not detectable. This substrate specificity was in contrast to the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase, which also cleaved pNP-β-GalNAc, albeit with slightly lower efficiency compared withpNP-β-GlcNAc. A trueO-GlcNAcase should cleave O-GlcNAc attached to proteins or peptides. We synthesized two glycopeptides containing one repeat of the (CTD) C- terminaldomain of RNA polymerase II linked to β-GlcNAc or α-GalNAc through the hydroxyl group of a serine residue (CTD-GlcNAc or CTD-GalNAc). The design of these glycopeptides is based on earlier information that this serine residue is glycosylated in vivo(13Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides were tested as substrates for the purified recombinant O-GlcNAcase, and the product peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Cleavage of GlcNAc or GalNAc from the peptides should result in a downshift of 203 in the molecular weight (the weight of GlcNAc or GalNAc minus 18). O-GlcNAcase did not cleave GalNAc from the peptide (Fig. 7, a andb) but did successfully cleave GlcNAc from the peptide, as judged by the expected shift in molecular weight (1069.8 to 866.6, 1091.8 to 888.6) (Fig. 7, c and d). As stated earlier, sequence analyses suggest that O-GlcNAcase is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This is consistent with the localization of the O-GlcNAc modification. To obtain direct evidence on its localization, we performed cellular fractionation and assayed O-GlcNAcase activity in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The data show that, in nontransfected cells,O-GlcNAcase activity was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, when O-GlcNAcase was overexpressed, it was predominantly found in the cytoplasm (Fig.8 a). We also probed for its localization by Western blots (Fig. 8 b). Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and α-tubulin, which were exclusively localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, were used as markers. In agreement with activity assays, overexpressed O-GlcNAcase protein was only detected in the cytoplasm of overexpressed cells. To estimate the number of transcripts of O-GlcNAcase and their levels of expression, we performed Northern analyses using a human multiple tissue blot consisting of RNA from eight different tissues. Labeled PCR product of the entire coding region of the O-GlcNAcase cDNA was used as a probe. The Northern blot analysis showed only one transcript of ∼5.5 kb for O-GlcNAcase (Fig.9). Exposing the film for extended time (32 h) did not reveal any additional bands (data not shown). The gene was expressed in every tissue on the blot but was the highest in the brain, followed by placenta, and pancreas. Lung and liver had the lowest expression (Fig. 9). This pattern of expr"
https://openalex.org/W2107865650,"The recent characterization of human homologues of Toll may be the missing link for the transduction events leading to NF-kappaB activity and proinflammatory gene transcription during innate immune response. Indeed, CD14 is not thought to participate directly in the cell signaling, but rather one or more of the mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) acts in concert with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor to discriminate between microbial pathogens or their products and initiate transmembrane signaling. Mammalian cells may express as many as 10 distinct TLRs, although the importance of TLR4 in response to gram-negative bacteria and LPS is now supported by the fact that TLR4-mutated mice are LPS resistant. We investigated the expression of TLR4 across the rat brain under basal conditions and in response to systemic LPS and IL-1beta injection. We first cloned the rat TLR4 cDNA via RNA isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with a proofreading polymerase. Total RNA was isolated from the rat liver tissue using Tri-Reagent and reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and an oligonucleotide primer with a degenerate 3' end of sequence 5'-T12(GAC)N-3'. Positive hybridization signal was found in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus (chp), subfornical organ, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, median eminence, and area postrema. Scattered small cells also displayed a convincing hybridization signal within the brain parenchyma. Few well-defined nuclei exhibited positive TLR4 transcript: the supramamillary nucleus, cochlear nucleus, and the lateral reticular nucleus. The circumventricular organs, the leptomeninges, and chp also exhibited constitutive expression of the LPS receptor mCD14. In contrast to the strong up-regulation of the gene encoding mCD14 during endotoxemia, neither LPS nor IL-1beta caused a convincing increase in the TLR4 mRNA levels across the CNS. A down-regulation of the gene encoding TLR4 was found in the cerebral tissue of immune-challenged animals. The constitutive expression of both mCD14 and TLR4 may explain the innate immune response in the brain, which originates from the structures devoid of blood-brain barrier in presence of circulating LPS."

The relative extent of JNK, p38, or ERK activation has been proposed to determine cell fate after injury. A mouse model was established in which prior exposure to ischemia protected against a second ischemic insult imposed 8 or 15 days later. In contrast to what was observed after 30 min of bilateral ischemia, when a second period of ischemia of 30- or 35-min duration was imposed 8 days later, there was no subsequent increase in plasma creatinine, decrease in glomerular filtration rate, or increase in fractional excretion of sodium. A shorter period of prior ischemia (15 min) was partially protective against subsequent ischemic injury 8 days later. Unilateral ischemia was also protective against a subsequent ischemic insult to the same kidney, revealing that systemic uremia is not necessary for protection. The ischemia-related activation of JNK and p38 and outer medullary vascular congestion were markedly mitigated by prior exposure to ischemia, whereas preconditioning had no effect on post-ischemic activation of ERK1/2. The phosphorylation of MKK7, MKK4, and MKK3/6, upstream activators of JNK and p38, was markedly reduced by ischemic preconditioning, whereas the post-ischemic phosphorylation of MEK1/2, the upstream activator of ERK1/2, was unaffected by preconditioning. Pre- and post-ischemic HSP-25 levels were much higher in the preconditioned kidney. In summary, post-ischemic JNK and p38 (but not ERK1/2) activation was markedly reduced in a model of kidney ischemic preconditioning that was established in the mouse. The reduction in JNK and p38 activation can be accounted for by reduced activation of upstream MAPK kinases.

The post-ischemic activation patterns of MAPKs may explain the remarkable protection against ischemic injury observed in this model. Ischemic injury to brain, heart, and kidney is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Improving the ability of these organs to tolerate ischemic injury would have important implications. Ischemic insults are often recurrent in patients. In the setting of loss of renal blood flow autoregulation that characterizes the post-ischemic kidney (1Conger J. Adv. Renal Replace. Ther. 1997; 4 Suppl. 1: 25-37Google Scholar), it might be expected that the post-ischemic patient would be more susceptible to a second insult. It has been reported in animals, however, that prior acute renal failure induced by toxins can confer resistance to subsequent insults, although this is not a universal finding (2Honda N. Hishida A. Ikuma K. Yonemura K. Kidney Int. 1987; 31: 1233-1238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Zager et al. (3Zager R.A. Baltes L.A. Sharma H.M. Jurkowitz M.S. Kidney Int. 1984; 26: 689-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have focused on early time points after an initial ischemic exposure and have concluded that the rat is not more susceptible to a second ischemic episode when timed at or near the peak of functional deficit after the first. The authors further concluded that “a modicum of protection appears to exist, possibly due to renal failure-induced increments in solute load.” Proximal tubules isolated 24 h (but not 15 min or 4 h) after an ischemic episode are protected against hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, or calcium ionophore in vitro (4Zager R.A. Burkhart K.M. Gmur D.J. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 592-600PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zager R.A. Iwata M. Burkhart K.M. Schimpf B.A. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1760-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The lack of protection at 4 h and the induction of protection by inducing azotemia in vivo or adding urine to the tubulesin vitro led the authors to conclude that the protection is due to the uremic environment. Subsequently protection was found in tubules obtained from obstructed kidneys even when the tubules had not been exposed to a uremic environment (6Zager R.A. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 628-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a recent study (7Lee H.T. Emala C.W. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F380-F387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), four cycles of 8 min (but not 4 or 6 min) of ischemia, separated by 5 min of reperfusion, conferred protection against a subsequent 45-min ischemic exposure immediately after the four cycles. In another recent study, four cycles of 4 min of ischemia, separated by 11 min of reperfusion, followed 5 min later by 45 min of ischemia, resulted in fewer dead renal cells, but no difference in creatinine at 6 h post-ischemia with this preconditioning protocol (8Jefayri M.K. Grace P.A. Mathie R.T. Br. J. Urol. Int. 2000; 85: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It had previously been shown that there were no morphological differences with this preconditioning protocol if the time delay between the cycles and the prolonged ischemia was 30 min (9Islam C.F. Mathie R.T. Dinneen M.D. Kiely E.A. Peters A.M. Grace P.A. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 79: 842-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, controversy remains as to the conditions under which preconditioning occurs in the kidney in response to prior ischemia. In addition, the reported experiments are limited to the study of short intervals of time between the preconditioning protocol and the tested period of subsequent ischemia. One approach to the design of therapies to protect the kidney against ischemic injury is to establish a model in which endogenous mechanisms result in protection and then identify those processes. A model in mice would be particularly useful given the plethora of transgenic models that exist, which would facilitate exploration of the role of a particular protein in the protection. Furthermore, we wanted to establish a model in which the acute cellular and molecular response to the initial event had subsided, reducing the “background” genetic response so that it would be more possible to identify an endogenous protective factor or factors. Our experiments demonstrate that 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia, resulting in significant increases in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, leads to protection of the mouse kidney against a subsequent ischemic insult 8 or 15 days later, even when the second ischemic period is extended to 35 min. Graded levels of time of initial ischemia resulted in graded levels of protection 8 days later. This protection is unrelated to systemic effects of transient uremia since unilateral ischemia is also associated with protection under conditions in which there is very little increase in systemic blood urea nitrogen or creatinine. Preconditioning results in prevention of medullary congestion. With varying times of initial ischemia, the protection afforded 8 days later correlates with the level of sustained elevations in HSP-251 (HSP-27 in rat) protein levels prior to the second ischemic period, but not superoxide dismutase or HSP-72 levels. The MAPKs have been implicated in post-ischemia/reperfusion cell survival, necrosis, and apoptosis (10Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26545-26551Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 11Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar, 12Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). MAPKs mediate the response of cells to a wide variety of physiological and stress-related stimuli, including ultraviolet light, heat shock, ischemia, oxygen free radicals, and hyperosmolality. It has been proposed that activation of JNK and p38 kinases contributes to cell death, whereas activation of ERK1/2 contributes to protection against cell injury in multiple organs (11Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar, 13Safirstein R. DiMari J. Megyesi J. Price P. Semin. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 519-522PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether the effect of ischemic preconditioning to protect the kidney is associated with corresponding changes in stress kinases and ERKs as well as their upstream activating kinases, which might account for the functional protection observed. Post-ischemic activation of JNK and p38 is markedly mitigated in the preconditioned kidneys, as is the post-ischemic activation of the MAPK kinases MKK7, MKK4, and MKK3/6, upstream activators of JNK and p38. By contrast, the post-ischemic activation of MKK3/4, the MAPK kinases responsible for activating ERK1/2, is unaltered by preconditioning. All experiments were performed with male BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 20–25 g. Mice were allowed free access to water and standard mice chow. Blood was drawn, and base-line levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were determined 2 days before surgery. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and administered 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl (37 °C) on the day of surgery (day 0). Body temperature was maintained at 36.0–37.5 °C. Animals were divided into 13 (I–XIII) groups (Table I). Kidneys were exposed through flank incisions. Mice in Groups II–IV, VI, and VII were subjected to bilateral renal ischemia by clamping both renal pedicles with nontraumatic microaneurysm clamps (Roboz Surgical Instrument Co., Inc.). Animals in Groups I, V, and VIII underwent sham surgery. The incisions were temporarily closed during ischemia or sham surgery. After 5 (Group II), 15 (Group III), or 30 (Groups IV, VI, and VII) min, the clamps were removed, and reperfusion of the kidneys was visually confirmed. Animals were exposed to 30 (Groups I–IV) or 35 (Groups V and VI) min of bilateral ischemia on day 8 or 30 min of ischemia on day 15 (Groups VII and VIII).Table IAnimal groups and treatmentsGroupInitial procedure (day 0)Second or third procedureI (5)Sham bilateral ischemiaBilateral ischemia (day 8)II (8)Bilateral ischemia, 5 minBilateral ischemia (day 8)III (8)Bilateral ischemia, 15 minBilateral ischemia (day 8)IV (10)Bilateral ischemiaBilateral ischemia (day 8)V (8)Sham bilateral ischemiaBilateral ischemia, 35 min (day 8)VI (6)Bilateral ischemiaBilateral ischemia, 35 min (day 8)VII (10)Bilateral ischemiaBilateral ischemia (day 15)VIII (8)Sham bilateral ischemiaBilateral ischemia (day 15)IX (5)Left kidney ischemia; right kidney removed on day 2Left kidney ischemia (day 8)X (5)Left kidney ischemia; right kidney removed on day 8Left kidney ischemia (day 8)XI (4)Left kidney ischemia; right kidney removed on day 8Left kidney ischemia (day 15)XII (5)Left kidney ischemia; left kidney removed on day 8Right kidney ischemia (day 15)XIII (5)Left kidney ischemia; right kidney ischemia on day 8Bilateral ischemia (day 15)Except as indicated, all times of ischemia were 30 min.

Numbers in parentheses indicate number of mice in each group. Mice in Groups IX–XIII underwent unilateral ischemia for 30 min. In Group IX, the contralateral kidney was removed on day 2, whereas in Group X, the contralateral kidney was removed on day 8, at the time of the second ischemia. In Group XI, the left kidney was made ischemic on day 0; the contralateral kidney was removed on day 8; and the left kidney was made ischemic again on day 15. In Group XII, the left kidney was made ischemic for 30 min on day 0. On day 8, that kidney was removed, and the right kidney was made ischemic on day 15. In Group XIII, ischemia to one kidney on day 0 was followed by ischemia to the contralateral kidney on day 8, and bilateral ischemia was imposed on day 15. Kidneys of experimental groups were harvested on day 1, 2, or 8 after the first surgery or 24 or 48 h after the second ischemic period. Kidneys were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently used for Western analysis or were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis. Seventy microliters of blood were taken from the retrobulbar vein plexus at the times indicated in the figures. Plasma and urine sodium, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen concentrations were measured using a flame photometer, a Beckman Creatinine Analyzer II, or a spectrophotometer (blood urea nitrogen). To determine glomerular filtration rate and fractional excretion of sodium, urine was collected for 24 h. Proteins were extracted from kidneys as previously described (10Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26545-26551Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated on either a 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to an Immobilon membrane. Membranes were incubated with antibodies against active phospho-JNK(Thr183/Tyr185), active phospho-p38(Thr180/Tyr182), active phospho-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-SEK1/MKK4, phospho-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, phospho-MKK3/6, and MKK3 (Cell Signaling); JNK1, ERK1/2, and p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phospho-MKK7 (provided by A. Nelsbach, Cell Signaling); HSP-72 (Stressgen Biotech Corp.); HSP-27 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); and superoxide dismutase (Chemicon International, Inc.). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were detected by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Supernatants from mouse kidney lysates were matched for protein concentration prior to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antiserum against JNK expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli.Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads, and kinase assays were performed as described (10Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26545-26551Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun-(1–135) as substrate. After 20 min at 30 °C, the kinase reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The bands corresponding to glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun-(1–135) were cut out of the gel. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Kidneys were perfused via the left ventricle with phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C and then with paraformaldehyde lysine periodate (14Abbate M. Brown D. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F454-F463PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 min. In some cases, the tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 6-μm thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. A p value <0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Each group consisted of 4–10 animals as indicated in Table I. Animals were exposed to 0 (Group I) or 5, 15, or 30 min (Groups II–IV) of bilateral renal ischemia (Fig.1 A). Plasma levels of creatinine increased 5–8-fold over base-line levels 24 h post-ischemia only when the ischemic period was 30 min. By day 5 after ischemia, creatinine levels were indistinguishable from those at base line in all groups. On day 8 after the initial ischemia or sham procedure, a subsequent 30 min of bilateral ischemia was induced. The increase in creatinine measured 24 h later was inversely correlated with the length of time of the prior ischemia. There was no significant increase in serum creatinine at 24 and 48 h after the second ischemic period in animals that were previously exposed to 30 min of ischemia. The patterns of change in blood urea nitrogen after the first and second ischemic periods closely paralleled those in creatinine in these and all subsequent experiments (Fig.1 B). The glomerular filtration rate was markedly decreased during the first day after 30 min of ischemia, but returned to normal within 7 days of reperfusion (Fig. 1 C). Likewise, fractional excretion of sodium was markedly increased during the first day of reperfusion, but returned to normal levels by 7 days of reperfusion (Fig. 1 D). A subsequent second 30-min ischemic period resulted in no decrease in glomerular filtration rate or increase in fractional excretion of sodium. Necrosis was found in kidneys from Group IV 48 h after 30 min of bilateral ischemia. Neutrophils were found in the outer medulla. The kidneys of sham-operated animals were normal. On day 8, the repair of injured tubules was almost complete. Regenerated tubules were seen, and some tubules were dilated and cystic. When kidneys were examined 48 h after the second ischemia, the “preconditioned” kidneys (Group IV) had no significant outer medullary congestion, whereas there was very significant congestion in the outer medulla of sham-pretreated animals examined after their first exposure to ischemia (Group I) (Fig.2 A). Microscopic examination revealed much less necrosis of proximal tubule cells, obstruction, and red cell trapping in the outer medulla of ischemia-pretreated preconditioned animals (Group IV) compared with Group I controls (Fig.2, B and C). When the first ischemic period was 30 min and the second was extended to 35 min (Group VI), serum creatinine did not increase after the initiation of reperfusion (Fig. 3). When the length of time between bilateral ischemic exposures was lengthened to 15 days (Group VII), serum creatinine increased by 24 h after the second ischemic insult (Fig. 4); however, the increase was significantly lower than that observed in animals that had been previously sham-operated on day 0 (Group VIII).Figure 4Effect of prior ischemia for 30 min on serum creatinine after 30 min of a second period of ischemia on day 15.On day 0, animals were subjected to either surgery sham (S; Group VIII) or 30 min of ischemia (I; Group VII).

We considered that the presence of a normal contralateral kidney might influence mechanisms contributing to protection against a subsequent ischemic exposure to a kidney rendered unilaterally ischemic (15Finn W.F. Fernandez-Repollet E. Goldfarb D. Iaina A. Eliahou H.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1984; 103: 193-203PubMed Google Scholar). Two (Group IX) or 8 (Group X) days later, the contralateral right kidney was removed; and at 8 days, the left kidney was again rendered ischemic for 30 min (Fig.5). Prior unilateral ischemia protected that kidney against subsequent ischemia even in the absence of an increase in serum creatinine (Fig. 5). If the contralateral kidney was left in for 8 days, however, the protection was less than was seen when the contralateral kidney was removed at 2 days post-ischemia. In Group XIII, the left kidney was rendered ischemic on day 0; the right kidney was made ischemic for 30 min on day 8; and both kidneys were made ischemic on day 15. There was protection against ischemic injury under these conditions, with no increase in serum creatinine 24 h after the bilateral ischemia (Fig.6). To evaluate whether unilateral ischemia confers protection on the contralateral kidney, in Group XII, the left kidney was made ischemic for 30 min on day 0 and subsequently removed on day 8, and the right kidney was made ischemic for 30 min on day 15. Twenty-four hours later, the mean serum creatinine was markedly elevated (Fig. 6), indicating that unilateral ischemia did not confer protection on the contralateral kidney. We evaluated whether HSPs or superoxide dismutase protein levels correlate with the development of resistance to subsequent ischemia. The levels of HSP-25 at 8 days post-ischemia increased with time of ischemia (Fig.7 A), correlating well with the extent of protection against functional deficits after the second ischemic period (Fig. 1). After the second ischemic period, HSP-25 levels markedly increased to higher levels than in the preconditioned kidneys (Fig. 7 B), whereas HSP-72 levels were no different whether the first procedure was ischemia or sham surgery (Fig.7 A). The tissue protein levels of superoxide dismutase (15-kDa subunit) were not markedly changed at 8 days post-ischemia (data not shown). The JNK family of MAPKs (also known as SAPKs) is markedly activated as early as 5 min after ischemia/reperfusion, peaks at 20 min, but remains at relatively high levels up to 2 h post-ischemia (10Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26545-26551Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In these studies, we have found that JNK activity remained above control levels at 48 h of reperfusion (Fig.8 A). In animals previously exposed to ischemia, subsequent ischemia on day 8 or 15 resulted in much less activation of JNKs than was seen in post-ischemic kidneys not previously exposed to ischemia (Fig. 8 A). When activation was determined by immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-JNK antibody, a similar pattern was seen, with marked reduction of the ischemia-induced increase in phospho-JNK at 0.5 and 1.5 h post-ischemia in the animals exposed to ischemia 8 days previously (Fig. 8 A,lower panel). Likewise, post-ischemic p38 activation was markedly reduced in kidneys previously exposed to ischemia (Fig.8 B). ERK1/2 activation persisted 8 days after the initial ischemic exposure; but in contrast to JNK and p38, there was no effect of prior ischemia on post-ischemic ERK phosphorylation on day 8 (Fig.8 C). To evaluate whether activation of JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 is potentially explained by changes in activation patterns of upstream regulators of these kinases, we compared the response to ischemia of MKK7 (which activates JNK), MKK4 (which activates JNK and possibly p38), MKK3/6 (which activate p38), and MEK1/2 (which activate ERK1/2) in kidneys previously exposed to ischemia or sham surgery (Fig.9). The post-ischemic increase in phosphorylation of MKK7, MKK4, and MKK3/6 was much less in the preconditioned kidney than in the non-preconditioned kidney. By contrast, post-ischemic phosphorylation of MEK1/2 was not decreased by preconditioning. Whereas phosphorylation of MKK7 peaked at 1.5 h after ischemia, phosphorylation of MKK4, MKK3/6, and MEK1/2 peaked at 0.5 h. Ischemic preconditioning may lead to important insight into how an organ uses endogenous mechanisms to protect itself against injury. To utilize the powerful genomic and proteomic technologies for identification of proteins that might be implicated in this protection, it is necessary to establish a mouse model in which that protection is very reproducible and robust. We purposely sought to establish a model that minimizes the number of residual nonspecific responses to the initial intervention at the time when we study the mechanisms of protection. This minimizes the problems associated with sorting through the functional significance of up-regulation of hundreds of genes that occurs within days of ischemia. Using RNA profiling techniques, we have found many fewer genes altered in expression at 8 days post-ischemia (data not shown). Understanding mechanisms of protection afforded by tissue responses to injury may lead to strategies for mimicking these responses therapeutically to prevent ischemic injury. Whether ischemic preconditioning exists in the kidney has been somewhat controversial. Zager et al. (3Zager R.A. Baltes L.A. Sharma H.M. Jurkowitz M.S. Kidney Int. 1984; 26: 689-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that 40 min of bilateral ischemia in the rat did not confer enhanced predisposition to a second ischemic insult imposed at the peak of functional deficit after the first ischemia. In a subsequent paper (16Zager R.A. Jurkowitz M.S. Merola A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: F148-F159PubMed Google Scholar), this group reported that 25 min of renal ischemia “can significantly decrease renal resistance to a subsequent ischemic event.” Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells isolated from rats 24 h after 35 min of ischemia were protected against hypoxic injury as manifested by lactate dehydrogenase release (5Zager R.A. Iwata M. Burkhart K.M. Schimpf B.A. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1760-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Proximal tubules were not protected if they were isolated from rats sustaining 15 min of bilateral ischemia when uremia was not present. Furthermore, the presence of a normal contralateral kidney markedly attenuated cytoprotection after unilateral ischemia, a condition in which uremia did not develop. Islam et al. (9Islam C.F. Mathie R.T. Dinneen M.D. Kiely E.A. Peters A.M. Grace P.A. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 79: 842-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that brief cycles of renal artery occlusion followed by reperfusion did not afford functional or morphological protection of rat kidney from a subsequent ischemic insult 30 min later. Cochrane et al.(18Cochrane J. Williams B.T. Banerjee A. Harken A.H. Burke T.J. Cairns C.B. Shapiro J.I. Renal Failure. 1999; 21: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) observed a lower serum creatinine level after 24 h of reflow in rats pretreated with ischemia for 2 min or three successive 2-min periods of ischemia (separated by 5 min each), but not three periods of ischemia of 5-min duration. Our experiments indicate that mice that had recovered from 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia were protected against subsequent ischemia imposed 8 or 15 days after the first ischemic challenge. The protection against functional injury 8 days after ischemia was quite profound. As a very sensitive measure of tubular injury, fractional excretion of sodium was unaffected by 30 min of ischemia. By contrast, it increased to ∼7% in post-ischemic kidneys not previously exposed to ischemia. The preconditioning protocol described is the most effective way to protect the mouse kidney against ischemic injury. Protection is not dependent on the presence of a uremic systemic environment since 15 min of initial ischemia resulted in protection against subsequent ischemia without causing an increase in blood urea nitrogen. A local effect within the kidney is likely responsible for protection against subsequent ischemia since protection was observed in the same kidney that sustained unilateral ischemia, but not in the contralateral kidney. Our finding that the protection was greater when the contralateral kidney was removed on day 2 compared with day 8 is compatible with prior observations of the adverse effects of the presence of the contralateral kidney on the functional recovery of a unilaterally ischemic kidney (15Finn W.F. Fernandez-Repollet E. Goldfarb D. Iaina A. Eliahou H.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1984; 103: 193-203PubMed Google Scholar). In the heart, although preconditioning is a very effective way to reduce post-ischemic infarct size, the protective effects of preconditioning are transient and initially last only for a short period of time, i.e. <2 h. A so-called “second window of protection” has been observed in some species (19Schwarz E.R. Whyte W.S. Kloner R.A. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 1997; 12: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), occurring 24 h after the preconditioning stimulus in neurons and cardiomyocytes. In our study, the protection in the mouse kidney after ischemia was seen up to 15 days after the initial ischemic period, when most, but not all, of the metabolic and stress responses associated with ischemia have been resolved. The degree of protection against the second ischemic insult after a first ischemic period of varying time duration correlated positively with levels of heat shock protein expression at 8 days post-ischemia. HSPs may decrease production of cytokines (20Meng X. Banerjee A. Ao L. Meldrum D.R. Cain B.S. Shames B.D. Harken A.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 874: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), reducing leukocyte-endothelial interactions and mitigating congestion in the outer medulla, resulting in less hypoxic injury to the outer medullary tubules. It has been suggested that HSP-25 protects against oxidative or heat stress by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton (21Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton is markedly altered in the proximal tubule after ischemia (22Molitoris B.A. Dahl R. Geerdes A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F488-F495PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brown D. Lee R. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1003-F1012PubMed Google Scholar). Another potential important role of HSP-25 is that of a molecular chaperone efficiently trapping unfolding proteins in a folding-competent state, allowing refolding after restoration of physiological conditions post-ischemia (24Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). HSP-25 can also increase cellular levels of glutathione (25Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), which can protect the cell against oxidative stress, reduce stress kinase activation (13Safirstein R. DiMari J. Megyesi J. Price P. Semin. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 519-522PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibit apoptosis (26Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). HSP-25 levels increase in the cortical and outer medullary proximal tubules of rat kidneys post-ischemia (27Smoyer W.E. Ransom R. Harris R.C. Welsh M.J. Lutsch G. Benndorf R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 211-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast to HSP levels, changes in manganese-superoxide dismutase protein levels, implicated in the delayed phase of preconditioning in the dog heart (28Yamashita N. Hoshida S. Taniguchi N. Kuzuya T. Hori M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1181-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), did not correlate with protection of the kidney in our experiments. Our demonstration of increases in JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 activation with ischemia is consistent with previous published results from our laboratory (10Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26545-26551Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and others (29Bogoyevitch M. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A. Fuller S. Ben-Levy R. Ashworth A. Marshall C. Sugden P. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) in the kidney and other organs. In the heart, some have argued that activation of p38 is important for preconditioning (30Nakano A. Baines C.P. Kim S.O. Pelech S.L. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas others have argued that activation is detrimental and that a reduced level of activation is important for preconditioning (31Saurin A.T. Martin J.L. Heads R.J. Foley C. Mockridge J.W. Wright M.J. Wang Y. Marber M.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It was previously not known how the upstream kinases responsible for activation of the MAPKs are affected by kidney ischemia. Our data indicate that ischemia/reperfusion results in the activation of MKK3/6 and MKK4. Both are activators of p38, although the physiological relevance of MKK4 as an activator of p38 is unclear. This ischemia-induced activation is reduced in kidneys previously exposed to ischemia in a pattern that parallels that of p38 activation. JNK is activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine by MKK4 and MKK7 (32Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). Ischemia/reperfusion results in MKK4 and MKK7 activation. This post-ischemic activation is reduced in kidneys previously exposed to ischemia in a pattern that parallels that of p38 and JNK activation. Interestingly, MKK7 activation peaks at 1.5 h after ischemia and persists longer than JNK activation. This suggests that post-ischemic JNK activation may be more dependent upon MKK4 than MKK7 activation. In contrast to the upstream activators of the stress kinases, post-ischemic MEK1/2 activation is not reduced in the preconditioned kidney. The increase in MEK1/2 with a resultant increase in ERK1/2 activation post-ischemia/reperfusion in the setting of reduced stress kinase activation may explain the protection seen with preconditioning in the kidney. It has been proposed in neurons (11Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar) and proximal tubule cells (33DiMari J.F. Davis R. Safirstein R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F195-F203PubMed Google Scholar) that the relative extent of JNK, p38, and ERK activation may determine cell fate, with JNK activation associated with cell death and ERK activity protective. JNK has recently been implicated in the mitochondrial death pathway (34Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar), and activation of the JNK cascade has been reported to be important for cardiomyocyte death in response to simulated ischemia (35He H. Li H.L. Lin A. Gottlieb R.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The functional protection we observed is associated with a marked reduction in outer medullary congestion post-ischemia, which may be related to decreased cytokine-induced leukocyte-endothelial interactions associated with the decrease in activation of JNK/SAPK and p38. JNK and p38 activation enhances the expression of adhesion molecules (36Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and cytokine production (17Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 37Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell.

Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which, in turn, can enhance leukocyte-endothelial adhesion interactions in the small vessels of the outer medulla with associated platelet activation and resultant obstruction, leading to S3 segment injury. The dramatic reduction in post-ischemic outer medullary congestion in the kidney previously exposed to ischemia argues for an important effect of preconditioning to prevent small vessel leukocyte- and perhaps platelet-endothelial interactions. In summary, we have demonstrated that the mouse kidney is profoundly protected against ischemia/reperfusion injury up to 15 days after an initial ischemic insult. This observation points to powerful endogenous mechanisms that can be evoked by the kidney to protect itself against ischemic injury. This protection is associated with prevention of outer medullary vascular congestion and mitigation of the increase normally seen in JNK and p38 activity, with no effect on ERK1/2 activation. The effects of remote ischemic pre-exposure on MAPK kinase activation can explain the changes observed in MAPK activation patterns. Since protection is present long after many of the initial consequences of the ischemia/reperfusion have subsided, it is likely that a genomic or proteomic approach to mechanisms, involving identification of “protective” proteins that are up-regulated or “detrimental” proteins that are down-regulated, will be tractable. This will then hopefully lead to therapies that will be effective in preventing and/or treating ischemic acute renal failure. heat shock protein mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK kinase SAPK/ERK kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase stress-activated protein kinase"

We and others have shown that P2X<sub>7</sub> is nonfunctional both in lymphocytes and monocytes from some subjects. To study a possible genetic basis we sequenced DNA coding for the carboxyl-terminal tail of P2X<sub>7</sub>. In 9 of 45 normal subjects a heterozygous nucleotide substitution (1513A→C) was found, whereas 1 subject carried the homozygous substitution that codes for glutamic acid to alanine at amino acid position 496. Surface expression of P2X<sub>7</sub> on lymphocytes was not affected by this E496A polymorphism, demonstrated both by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescent staining. Monocytes and lymphocytes from the E496A homozygote subject expressed nonfunctional receptor, whereas heterozygotes showed P2X<sub>7</sub> function that was half that of germline P2X<sub>7</sub>. Results of transfection experiments showed that the mutant P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor was nonfunctional when expressed at low receptor density but regained function at a high receptor density. This density dependence of mutant P2X<sub>7</sub> function was also seen on differentiation of fresh monocytes to macrophages with interferon-γ, which up-regulated mutant P2X<sub>7</sub> and partially restored its function. P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes was impaired in homozygous mutant P2X<sub>7</sub> compared with germline (8.6<i>versus</i> 35.2%). The data suggest that the glutamic acid at position 496 is required for optimal assembly of the P2X<sub>7</sub>receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1972659631,"Liddle's syndrome is a form of inherited hypertension linked to mutations in the genes encoding the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). These mutations alter or delete PY motifs involved in protein-protein interactions with a ubiquitin-protein ligase, Nedd4. Here we show that Na+ transporting cells, derived from mouse cortical collecting duct, express two Nedd4 proteins with different structural organization and characteristics of ENaC regulation: 1) the classical Nedd4 (herein referred to as Nedd4-1) containing one amino-terminal C2, three WW, and one HECT-ubiquitin protein ligase domain and 2) a novel Nedd4 protein (Nedd4-2), homologous to Xenopus Nedd4 and comprising four WW, one HECT, yet lacking a C2 domain. Nedd4-2, but not Nedd4-1, inhibits ENaC activity when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and this property correlates with the ability to bind to ENaC, as only Nedd4-2 coimmunoprecipitates with ENaC. Furthermore, this interaction depends on the presence of at least one PY motif in the ENaC complex and on WW domains 3 and 4 in Nedd4-2. Thus, these results suggest that the novel suppressor protein Nedd4-2 is the regulator of ENaC and hence a potential susceptibility gene for arterial hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1999975964,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), a platelet-derived bioactive lysophospholipid, is a regulator of angiogenesis. However, molecular mechanisms involved in SPP-induced angiogenic responses are not fully defined. Here we report the molecular mechanisms involved in SPP-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion and migration. SPP-induced HUVEC migration is potently inhibited by antisense phosphothioate oligonucleotides against EDG-1 as well as EDG-3 receptors. In addition, C3 exotoxin blocked SPP-induced cell attachment, spreading and migration on fibronectin-, vitronectin- and Matrigel-coated surfaces, suggesting that endothelial differentiation gene receptor signaling via the Rho pathway is critical for SPP-induced cell migration. Indeed, SPP induced Rho activation in an adherence-independent manner, whereas Rac activation was dispensible for cell attachment and focal contact formation. Interestingly, both EDG-1 and -3 receptors were required for Rho activation. Since integrins are critical for cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis, we examined the effects of blocking antibodies against αvβ3, β1, or β3 integrins. SPP induced Rho-dependent integrin clustering into focal contact sites, which was essential for cell adhesion, spreading and migration. Blockage of αvβ3- or β1-containing integrins inhibited SPP-induced HUVEC migration. Together our results suggest that endothelial differentiation gene receptor-mediated Rho signaling is required for the activation of integrin αvβ3 as well as β1-containing integrins, leading to the formation of initial focal contacts and endothelial cell migration.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP)1 is a bioactive lipid produced by metabolism of the membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin. Activation of the sphingomyelinase enzyme followed by sequential catalysis by ceramidase and sphingosine kinase results in the formation of SPP (1Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J... 2000; 349: 385-402Google Scholar). Although the site of synthesis and mechanisms involved in secretion of SPP are not well understood, it is clear that one mechanism by which SPP acts is via the interaction with plasma membrane-localized G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) of the EDG family (2Goetzl E.J.

These GPCRs are stimulated by nanomolar concentrations of SPP and couple to different G-proteins, which may form the basis for their differential signal transduction properties (5An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol Pharmacol... 1998; 54: 881-888Google Scholar, 6Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 18997-19002Google Scholar, 10Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J.

Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 27351-27358Google Scholar). Downstream of the heterotrimeric G-proteins, small GTPases of the Rho family, namely Rho and Rac, are activated by SPP (11Wang F. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Spiegel S. Biochem.

Rho and Rac regulate cytoskeletal changes such as stress fiber assembly and cortical actin formation, respectively (13Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell.. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar). Based on changes in actin dynamics and using antisense oligonucleotides to block the expression of EDG-1 and -3, we proposed that EDG-1 is required for cortical actin assembly (a Rac-regulated event) and EDG-3 for stress fiber formation (a Rho-regulated event) (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell... 1999; 99: 301-312Google Scholar). However, complex cross-regulatory mechanisms appear to be involved since dominant negative Rac also blocks stress fiber assembly in endothelial cells (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N.

Direct measurements of Rho and Rac activity induced by SPP in endothelial cells has not been reported. SPP acts in a variety of cell systems to regulate cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and death (1Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J... 2000; 349: 385-402Google Scholar, 2Goetzl E.J. An S.

Although controversy exists regarding its mode of action, i.e.whether SPP is a second messenger that acts intracellularly or a first messenger that acts extracellularly, many of the aforementioned actions are likely to be due to activation of EDG family of receptors (1Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J... 2000; 349: 385-402Google Scholar, 2Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J... 1998; 12: 1589-1598Google Scholar, 3Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Thangada S. Thompson B.D. Kluk M.

FEBS Lett... 2000; 476: 55-57Google Scholar). Furthermore, physiological functions of SPP are poorly understood. EDG-1, the prototypical SPP receptor, was originally isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an inducible gene (3Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Thangada S. Thompson B.D. Kluk M. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1999; 58: 201-207Google Scholar, 16Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 9308-9313Google Scholar). SPP treatment of HUVECs results in activation of EDG-1 and -3 receptors, stimulation of the Gi-dependent cell survival pathway, Rac- and Rho-dependent adherens junction assembly, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, which ultimately results in the morphogenesis of HUVECs into capillary-like networks (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell... 1999; 99: 301-312Google Scholar). Indeed, SPP synergized with polypeptide angiogenic factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial cell growth factor to induce mature neovessels in vivo (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell... 1999; 99: 301-312Google Scholar). Recent data on the deletion of the Edg-1 gene in the mouse indicate that SPP/Edg-1 interaction is necessary for embryonic vascular maturation (17Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita R. Mi Y. Deng C-X.

Interestingly, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis occurred in the Edg-1 −/− embryos, suggesting that Edg-1 is dispensible for these processes during embryonic development. Interestingly, genetic studies in zebrafish indicate that an EDG-5-like receptor (termed as Miles Apart) controls myocardial progenitor cell migration and heart development (18Kupperman E. An S. Osborne N. Waldron S. Stainier D.Y. Nature.. 2000; 406: 192-195Google Scholar). These data suggest that a physiological function of SPP is to regulate the development, growth, and maintenance of the cardiovascular system. Recently, several studies reported that SPP is a potent migration inducer of vascular endothelial cells (19Lee O.H. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M. Moon E.J. Lee D.J. Kim J.H. Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G. Biochem. Biophys.

Previously, however, SPP has been shown to both stimulate and inhibit chemotactic responses in a variety of cell types. CHO cells expressing EDG-1 or EDG-3 showed better migration toward SPP, whereas Edg-5-expressing cells did not (24Kimura T. Watanabe T. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Tamama K. Kuwabara A. Kanda T. Kobayashi I. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J... 2000; 348: 71-76Google Scholar). On the other hand, SPP inhibited chemoinvasiveness of MDA-MB-231, a human breast cancer cell line (25Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Edsall L. Nava V.E. Spiegel S. Cancer Res... 1999; 59: 6185-6191Google Scholar). Moreover, chemotactic motility of mouse melanoma has been shown to be inhibited by SPP in a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-independent way (26Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 9686-9690Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of SPP-induced endothelial cell migration have not been defined. Here we investigated the mechanisms involved in SPP-induced migration and morphogenesis of HUVECs. Data in this report show that SPP is effective in stimulating the migration and lumen formation of HUVECs. This involves rapid assembly of the initial focal contacts through αvβ3 and β1 family of integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of Rho by SPP through EDG-1 and EDG-3 in HUVECs is required for this process. HUVECs (Clonetics) were cultured in M199 medium (Cellgro, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and heparin-stabilized endothelial cell growth factor, as previously described (16Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 9308-9313Google Scholar). CHO cell transfectants (pCDNA, EDG-1, EDG-3) were maintained in F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mg/ml G418. Transfection of antisense oligonucleotides to block the expression of EDG-1 and EDG-3 was performed using NovaFECTOR™ reagent (VennNova, LLC, Pompano Beach, FL). HUVECs were plated the day before transfection in complete growth medium. 18-mer phosphothioate oligonucleotides (PTO; antisense EDG-1, 5′-GAC GCT GGT GGG CC C CAT-3′; sense EDG-1, 5′-ATG GGG CCC ACC AGC GTC-3′; antisense EDG-3, 5′-CGG GAG GGC AGT TGC CAT-3′; sense EDG-3, 5′-ATG GCA ACT GCC CTC CCG-3′) were mixed with NovaFECTOR™ in 200 μl of OPTI-MEM® I and left for 5 min to allow DNA-lipid complex formation. Cells were rinsed three times with pre-warmed OPTI-MEM®1, and the DNA-lipid complex was layered over cells at the final concentration of 400 nm. After 4 h of transfection, medium was removed and replaced with complete growth medium. Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs using the RNA-STAT 60 (Tel-test) following the manufacturer's instructions. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were resolved on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and the integrity of the RNA was monitored by ethidium bromide staining. RNA was capillary-transferred onto Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad), UV-cross-linked by Stratalinker (Stratagene), and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes. The human EDG-1, EDG-3, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs were radioactively labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by a random primer labeling system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The hybridized membranes were washed as described (16Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 9308-9313Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. The bands were quantified using Image Quant (Molecular Dynamics). HUVECs were grown on fibronectin-coated glass bottom dishes and microinjected using an Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171 and Transjector 5246. Approximately 500 cells were microinjected cytoplasmically with 0.1 μg/μl C3 exoenzyme (Calbiochem) or 0.8 μg/μl dominant-negative N17Rac protein (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell... 1999; 99: 301-312Google Scholar) with Femtotips (Eppendorf) at 100 hectopascals/0.2 s. Injected cells were marked by coinjecting of 5 mg/ml Texas Red®-labeled dextran (Molecular Probes) (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell... 1999; 99: 301-312Google Scholar). Cell migration assays were performed using 24-well chemotaxis chambers (Nalgene). Polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 μm (Nalgene) were coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin, 200 μg/ml Matrigel (Becton Dikinson), or 5 μg/ml bovine vitronectin (Life Technologies) at 4 °C overnight in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dried under sterile air. SPP and/or inhibitors were diluted to appropriate concentrations in M199 supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 600 μl of the final dilution was placed in the lower chamber of a modified Boyden chamber. HUVECs were washed with PBS and trypsinized for the minimum time required to achieve cell detachment. Approximately 5 × 104 cells suspended in 100 μl of M199 with 0.5% bovine serum albumin were placed in the upper compartment. The cells were allowed to migrate for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. After the incubation period, the filter was removed, and the nonmigrated cells on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. The filters were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin. Migration was quantified by counting cells in three random high power fields (100×) for each filter. Alternatively, filters were stained in 0.1% crystal violet and eluted with 10% acetic acid in 96-well plates. Quantification was done based on absorbance (A) at 575 nm by a Spectramax 340 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. Antibodies against integrins were purchased from Chemicon. Ninety-six well plates were coated with FN (5 μg/ml), VN (5 μg/ml, Life Technologies), or MG (200 μg/ml, Beckton Dickinson) at 4 °C overnight. Plates were blocked with 10 mg/ml heat-denatured fatty acid free bovine serum albumin for 30 min. HUVECs (5 × 105 cells/ml in M199 with 0.1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin) were incubated with function-inhibiting anti-integrin antibodies (β1, β1, LM609, Chemicon) or other reagents for 10 min before plating. Then 100 μl of the cell suspension/well was added onto plates and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 with the lid off. After incubation, nonspecifically attached and unattached cells were removed by rinsing with PBS. Attached cells were fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Stains were dissolved in 10% acetic acid, and plates were read atA 575 nm by a Spectramax 340 plate reader. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Anti-paxillin antibody (1: 100, Transduction Laboratories) in PBS was incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The primary antibody staining was visualized with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:200, Jackson Laboratories). Actin cytoskeleton was stained with either FITC- or tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-phalloidin (0.05 μg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Images were observed with a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope and captured by a SPOT™ digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc). HUVECs were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture), and cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of lysates were incubated with GST-C21 (Rho binding domain of Rhotekin quanine nucleotide exchange factor, kindly provided by Dr. Shuh Narumiya, Kyoto University, Japan) or GST-PAK (Rac binding domain of p21 activated kinase, kindly provided by Dr. Martin Schwartz, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 × protease inhibitor mixture). Bound proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against Rho (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Rac1 (Transduction Labs). Equal loading was confirmed by blotting against Rho, Rac, or β-actin (Sigma). This assay was performed as described in Bayless et al. (27Bayless K.J. Salazar R. Davis G.E. Am. J. Pathol... 2000; 156: 1673-1683Google Scholar) with minor modifications. HUVECs were rinsed with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Cellgro) with 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and resuspended at a density of 3 × 106/ml. Fibrinogen was added as a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and polymerization was achieved by adding 1unit/ml thrombin. Fibrin gel was covered with a volume of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 20% charcoal-stripped serum, heparin-stabilized endothelial cell growth factor, and different concentrations of SPP along with integrin antagonists. After an 18-h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, medium was removed, and gels were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Pictures were taken from several random fields of each well. Gels were embedded into paraffin block and sectioned for hematoxylin staining. SPP was previously shown to induce endothelial cell migration; however, mechanisms involved are not clearly defined (19Lee O.H. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M. Moon E.J. Lee D.J. Kim J.H. Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G.

J... 2000; 348: 71-76Google Scholar). To define the role of SPP receptors in endothelial cell migration, we utilized the antisense PTOs, which block the expression of EDG-1 and -3 GPCRs (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell... 1999; 99: 301-312Google Scholar). HUVECs were transfected with sense or antisense PTOs against EDG-1 or -3 using the lipid-mediated method. Expression of EDG-1 and -3 receptors was assayed by Northern analysis. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment with EDG-1 antisense PTO specifically reduced the steady-state mRNA levels for EDG-1 and not EDG-3. Likewise, antisense EDG-3 PTO blocked expression of EDG-3 mRNA in a specific manner. Quantitative analysis indicated that antisense PTO for EDG-1 (αs1) showed >90% suppression of EDG-1 mRNA levels. Antisense PTO for EDG-3 (αs3) had almost 60% reduction of EDG-3 mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A), whereas sense counterparts for αs1 and αs3 had no effect. These data indicate that the antisense EDG-1 and -3 PTOs are efficacious and selective in inhibiting the expression of respective receptors. When treated with SPP, HUVECs migrated on different extracellular matrices (ECMs) such as FN, VN, and MG. SPP induced ∼6-fold (FN), ∼ 22 fold (VN), ∼25 fold (MG) stimulation of migration above the base-line rate in all three matrices (Fig. 1 B). However, the basal rate of cell migration was higher in FN-coated dishes, even though SPP stimulated further chemotaxis. SPP-induced HUVEC migration was dramatically inhibited by the antisense EDG-1 and -3 PTOs, suggesting that each of these GPCRs for SPP is required for chemotaxis. SPP induced a dose-dependent increase of HUVEC migration over the range of 10 nm∼0.5 μm (data not shown). Cell migration responses were inhibited by pretreatment with C3 exotoxin (4 days, 5 μg/ml), which inhibits the small GTPase Rho (Fig.2 A). These data suggest that EDG receptor signaling via the Rho pathway is essential for SPP-induced endothelial cell migration. The Rho GTPase is activated by extracellular mediators and regulates the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion sites (28Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar, 13Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell.. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar). When HUVECs were plated on FN, VN, or MG and treated with SPP for 15 min, both focal adhesion sites and stress fibers were induced (Fig.2 B and data not shown). Thus, cell matrix adhesion and spreading were induced by SPP. FN supported basal adhesion of HUVECs in the absence of stimulation and further enhanced adhesion, stress fiber formation, and focal contact site assembly after SPP addition (data not shown). Although VN did not support basal adhesion in the absence of the ligand, SPP strongly induced adhesion, spreading, and focal contact assembly on cells plated on VN (Fig. 2 B). Although these events occurred on Matrigel, a complex extracellular matrix enriched in laminin (29Grant D.S. Tashiro K. Segui-Real B. Yamada Y. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Cell.. 1989; 58: 933-943Google Scholar), only small focal contact sites and stress fibers were induced by SPP (data not shown). Treatment of cells with C3 exotoxin strongly inhibited SPP-induced focal contact site assembly and stress fiber formation (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, microinjection of C3 exotoxin also blocked focal contact site assembly (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, microinjection of dominant negative Rac (N17Rac) protein did not inhibit SPP-induced focal contact formation and cell spreading (Fig. 2 C). These data suggest that SPP/EDG receptor signaling induces a Rho signal that is essential for initial focal contact assembly and ultimately for cell migration. To directly measure the effect of SPP on Rho and Rac activation, we utilized the GST pull-down assays for Rho and Rac GTPases (28Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar, 30Del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 2008-2014Google Scholar, 31Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 147: 1009-1022Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, strong activation of Rho by SPP was observed in HUVECs plated on both VN and FN. Rac was also induced, although the magnitude of stimulation was less than that of Rho. Interestingly, basal Rac activity was enhanced in FN, which supports better HUVEC adhesion under basal conditions. SPP effect was more pronounced in HUVECs plated on VN than FN. These data indicate that SPP directly stimulates Rho and Rac GTPases in HUVECs. Since SPP induced focal contact formation in nonadherent HUVECs in a C3-inhibitable manner, we tested the effect of SPP on Rho and Rac activation in nonadherent conditions. HUVECs were detached from the culture dish and held in suspension with 100 nm SPP for 0–60 min at 37 °C. At each time point, cells were harvested and analyzed for the level of active Rho and Rac. As shown in Fig.3 B, SPP strongly stimulated Rho activity of HUVECs in suspension within 10–20 min (upper panel). In contrast, SPP did not significantly affect Rac activity (Fig. 3 B,lower panel) of nonadherent HUVECs. These data indicate that SPP induces Rho activity in an adherence-independent manner, which is required for initial focal contact assembly. We next addressed the involvement of EDG-1 and -3 receptors in the activation of Rho and Rac by SPP. Cells were pretreated with the antisense PTO of EDG-1 or EDG-3 and then stimulated with 100 nm SPP. As shown in Fig. 4, antisense PTO against EDG-3 strongly inhibited the SPP-induced Rho activation. However, antisense PTO against EDG-1 also inhibited Rho activation, suggesting that both receptors contribute to Rho activation. Similarly, antisense EDG-1 and EDG-3 blocked Rac. These data suggest that both EDG-3 and -1 receptors contribute to SPP-induced Rho and Rac activation. To confirm the antisense PTO blockage data, we utilized the CHO cell system, which exhibited a very low endogenous SPP receptor activity and expression (23Gonda K. Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yatomi Y. Okazaki H. Sakurai T. Kimura S. Sillard R. Harii K. Takuwa Y. Biochem. J... 1999; 337: 67-75Google Scholar, 32Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K. Ishizuka T. Murata N. Kanda T. Kobayashi I. Ohta H. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 23940-23947Google Scholar). CHO cells stably transfected with EDG-1 or -3 receptors or vector-transfected controls were stimulated with SPP, and Rho and Rac activity was directly measured. As shown in Fig. 4 D, both Rho and Rac were activated in both EDG-1 and -3-transfected CHO cells. These data confirm the antisense PTO inhibition experiments in HUVECs and suggest that both EDG-1 and -3 are capable of activating Rho as well as Rac-dependent signaling pathways. Focal contact sites are formed by activation and clustering of various integrins and associated molecules (33Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1999; 11: 274-286Google Scholar). It is known that β3- and β1-containing integrins, namely, αvβ3, α5β1, and α2β1are critical for endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and morphogenesis (34Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin.

Osmundsen H. Numa S. Fatty Acid Metabolism and Its Regulation. Elsevier Science Publisher, Amsterdam1984: 113-154Google Scholar). In ruminant animals, AceCS plays a key role in the catabolism of acetate produced by microorganisms in the rumen. In nonruminant mammals, acetate production occurs in the liver from ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA hydrolase (2Crabtree B. Souter M.-J. Anderson S.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AceCS is postulated to play a key role in the recycling of acetate released by acetylcholine esterase for the formation and release of acetylcholine in cholinergic nerve terminals (3Sterri S.H. Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Carroll P.T. Brain Res. 1997; 753: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). AceCS from various microorganisms has revealed that the enzyme belongs to the firefly luciferase superfamily (5Toh H. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1990; 3: 517-521PubMed Google Scholar, 6Toh H.

All enzymes in this superfamily contain a common sequence motif of Ser-Gly-(small hydrophilic residue)2-Gly-(any residue)-Pro-Lys-Gly and catalyze common two-step reactions: adenylation of substrates and subsequent thioester formation (5Toh H. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1990; 3: 517-521PubMed Google Scholar,6Toh H. Protein Sequences Data Anal. 1991; 4: 111-117PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of AceCS, we purified AceCS from bovine heart and cloned bovine and murine cDNAs encoding this enzyme. In addition to the cardiac enzyme, we also obtained a cDNA for hepatic type enzyme. The murine cDNAs encoding cardiac and hepatic types of AceCSs were introduced into COS cells, and the resulting enzymes were purified and characterized. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the hepatic type enzyme (termed AceCS1) is a cytosolic enzyme, whereas the cardiac enzyme (termed AceCS2) is located in the mitochondrial matrix. During the preparation of this paper, Luong et al. (12Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) published a molecular characterization of AceCS which is identical to murine AceCS1. Here, we provide evidence that AceCS2 provides acetyl-CoA that is utilized mainly for oxidation under ketogenic conditions. Standard molecular biology and immunochemical techniques were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and Harlow and Lane (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), respectively. cDNA clones were subcloned into pBluescript vectors and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method with a Bigdye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer (model 310; PE Biosystems). Total RNA was prepared using standard guanidinium thiocyanate lysis buffer and centrifugation over a cesium chloride cushion. For Northern blotting, total RNA was denatured with 1m glyoxal and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, fractionated in a 1.5% agarose gel, and transferred to a Zeta Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). To analyze RNA in murine tissues, commercially available Northern blots (CLONTECH) were used for Northern blot analysis. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by priming with random hexanucleotides. The probes used for Northern blots included the murine AceCS1 cDNA nucleotides 154–1318 and the murine AceCS2 cDNA nucleotides 160–1696. Quantitative analysis was performed with a bioimage analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo). For immunoblotting, polyclonal antibodies against murine AceCS1 and AceCS2 (see below) were used as first antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) kit. Bovine AceCS was purified from heart as described previously (15Ishikawa M. Fujino T. Sakashita H. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1995; 175: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme (specific activity 45 μmol/min/mg at 37 °C) was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting peptides were separated by a C8 reverse phase column using a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and sequenced by automated Edman degradation using a peptide sequencer (model 470 A, PE Biosystems). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to obtain a partial cDNA for bovine AceCS. 1 μg of poly(A) RNA prepared by oligo(dT)-Latex™ (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) was used to prime cDNA synthesis with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamers. The resulting cDNA was then amplified with a set of degenerate primers corresponding to the amino acid residues 289–296 and 471–478: 5′-GGN GTN GTN CA(C/T) ACN CA(A/G) GCN GG-3′ and 5′-CT NCC NCC (C/T)TC NAG NAC (A/G)TT NCC-3′. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was carried out under the conditions recommended for Ex Taq™ (Takara Shuzo Corp.). Three cDNA libraries were constructed using poly(A) RNA from bovine and murine hearts, and murine livers using an Okayama-Berg vector (16Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 2: 161-170Crossref Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Bovine and murine cardiac cDNA libraries were screened with partial cDNA for the bovine enzyme. We also screened a murine hepatic cDNA library under reduced conditions. After screening of ∼105 clones from each library, we obtained several clones. Representative clones encoding near full-length cDNAs were further characterized. COS-7 cells were grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran procedure (17Takai T. Ohmori H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 3e days after DNA transfection, the cells were harvested for purification and [14C]acetate incorporation (see below). AceCS activity was determined at 37 °C by either an isotopic or by a spectrophotometric method, which is based on the formation of AMP using adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (18Tanaka T. Hosaka K. Numa S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The latter was used only for the purified enzyme. The standard reaction mixture for the isotopic method contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm CoA, and 10 mm [14C]acetate (940 dpm/nmol) in a total volume of 0.2 ml. After 1 min of preincubation at 37 °C, the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme solution. After a 30-min incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of ice-cold glacial acetic acid. The reaction product ([14C]acetyl-CoA) was isolated by spotting onto a piece of chromatography media (ITLC-SG type, Gelman Sciences) and extensive washing with water-saturated ether/formic acid (7:1) for measurement of radioactivity. The standard reaction mixture for the spectrophotometric method contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mmATP, 0.25 mm potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm acetate, 0.3 mm NADH, 80 units of adenylate kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 17 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 6 units of pyruvate kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 1 ml. After a 1-min preincubation at 37 °C, the reactions were started by adding 24 μl of 25 mm CoA. The oxidation of NADH was measured at 340 nm on a recording spectrophotometer. The formation of 1 mol of AMP corresponds to the oxidation of 2 mol of NADH. All assays were carried out within the range where the reaction proceeded linearly with time, and the initial rate of reaction was proportional to the amount of enzyme added. The protein content was determined as described (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C, and the results are summarized in TableI.Table IPurification of AceCS1 and AceCS2Enzyme and stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoverymgμmol/minμmol/min/mg%AceCS1230,000 ×g1363672.710060% (NH4)2SO472.42663.772.7DEAE-Sepharose FF23.01988.653.9Phenyl-Sepharose FF6.313020.735.4Blue Sepharose FF1.019.620.75.3Sephacryl S-2000.410.426.82.8AceCS2230,000 ×g13687.30.810060% (NH4)2SO430.367.62.377.4Q-Sepharose FF1.06.36.67.2Phenyl-Sepharose FF0.85.78.76.5Blue Sepharose FF0.33.811.24.32nd Q-Sepharose FF0.22.011.92.3Crude sonicated extracts were prepared from COS cells transfected with either AceCS1 or AceCS2. Enzyme activities were measured at 37 °C by the isotopic method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Crude sonicated extracts were prepared from COS cells transfected with either AceCS1 or AceCS2. Enzyme activities were measured at 37 °C by the isotopic method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” COS-7 cells (80 dishes, 100-mm diameter) transfected with either murine AceCS1 or AceCS2 were suspended in 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 230, 000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used for purification. For purification of AceCS1, the following purification steps were carried out. Protein in the 230, 000 × g supernatant was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 at 60% saturation and centrifugation at 16, 000 × g for 15 min. The resulting precipitate was suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (w/v)), dialyzed against buffer A, and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with buffer A, the column was eluted with an increasing gradient of 0–0.25 m KCl containing buffer A. Active fractions were combined, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to give 30% saturation and then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 30% (NH4)2SO4. After washing with buffer A containing 30% (NH4)2SO4, the column was eluted with a decreasing gradient of 30–0% (NH4)2SO4 containing buffer A. Active fractions were collected and dialyzed against buffer A and then applied to a blue Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.0 × 3 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with an increasing gradient of 0–1m KCl containing buffer A. The fractions exhibiting enzyme activities were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration with Amicon Centriplus 10 (Amicon Inc.), and then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (1.6 × 60 cm). The column was eluted with 150 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. Active fractions were collected, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −80 °C. For purification of AceCS2, a similar procedure was followed except DEAE-Sepharose FF and Sephacryl S-200 were replaced by Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After dialyzing against buffer A, the enzyme solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column (1.5 × 2 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with an increasing gradient of 0–0.25 m KCl containing buffer A. The purified enzyme from the second Q-Sepharose FF step was dialyzed against buffer A and stored at −80 °C. To obtain an anti-murine AceCS1, a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein with murine AceCS1 was used to immunize rabbits. To produce the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 456–600 of murine AceCS1 was ligated in-frame to a pGEX-4T bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was induced inEscherichia coli DH5α with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was digested with thrombin and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resulting thrombin-cleaved 16-kDa fragment was used as an antigen. For the production of an anti-murine AceCS2, a 15-residue peptide corresponding to the C terminus of murine AceCS2 (CSAFQKYEEQRAATN) was synthesized by Nippon Gene Research Laboratories (Sendai, Japan). The amino acid composition and sequence were confirmed by the supplier. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into New Zealand White rabbits as described (20Iijima H. Fujino T. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Kang M.J. Yamamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). IgG fractions were prepared by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse kidneys (8 g) were suspended in 30 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, and 0.2 mm EDTA) and homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged (1, 000 × g, 10 min) to remove cell debris and nuclear pellets. A heavy mitochondrial fraction was prepared from the 1,000 × g supernatant by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 10 min and then washed twice with buffer A. The 3, 300 × g supernatant was centrifuged further at 12, 500 × g for 20 min to obtain a crude mitochondrial fraction containing a light mitochondria fraction, peroxisomes, and lysosomes. The 12,500 × g supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation (120,000 × gfor 1 h) to yield a microsomal and a cytosolic fraction. The crude mitochondrial fraction was suspended in 20 ml of buffer B and fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to obtain a light mitochondrial and a peroxisomal fraction (21Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Yokota S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 98: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The pellet of each spin was suspended in a volume of buffer B equal to the volume of the supernatant from the same spin. Male C57BL/6J mice (age 10 weeks, individually caged) were purchased from Clea Japan (Tokyo) and housed at the animal laboratory of Tohoku University Gene Research Center under protocols in accord with the institutional guidelines for animal experiments at Tohoku University. Animals had free access to the commercial stock diet (Clea CE2) and water. Fasted mice were deprived of food for 48 h. Zucker diabetic fatty rats (14-week-old males) and their normal littermate males were obtained from Nippon Experimental Animal Co. 3 days after transfection, COS cells were scraped, suspended with 5 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm glucose and 1 mm [14C]acetate (940 dpm/nmol), and incubated at 37 °C in a tightly sealed flask. After a 2-h incubation, 500 μl of 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added immediately into the flask, and [14C]CO2 was trapped into ethanolamine in a counting vial connected with the flask by constant flow of N2 gas. Incorporation of 14C in lipids was determined by extracting the cells with chloroform-methanol (2:1). In the previous study, we purified and characterized AceCS from bovine heart (15Ishikawa M. Fujino T. Sakashita H. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1995; 175: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To clone a cDNA encoding AceCS, we determined the partial amino acid sequence of the bovine enzyme: the purified enzyme was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and several peptides were obtained after separation on a C8 reverse phase column (data not shown). Based on two peptide sequences (amino acid residues 286–296 and 471–478) derived from the purified enzyme, we designed a set of degenerate primers to amplify a cDNA fragment encoding the bovine enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of bovine cardiac poly(A) RNA with the degenerate primers resulted in amplification of a major fragment of 576 base pairs encoding a partial cDNA for the bovine enzyme. Using the amplified 576-base pair fragment as a probe, we obtained a near full-length cDNA for bovine cardiac AceCS (Fig.1). We also isolated a near full-length cDNA for a murine ortholog 83.5% identical to the bovine cardiac AceCS. In addition, a near full-length cDNA encoding an AceCS distinct from the cardiac enzyme was obtained by screening a murine hepatic cDNA library using reduced hybridization conditions. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding the hepatic enzyme is completely identical to that described by Luong et al. (12Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The hepatic and cardiac type enzymes were designated AceCS1 and AceCS2, respectively. Although Luong et al. abbreviated the enzyme name to ACS, we prefer to refer to it as AceCS because we have already designated long chain acyl-CoA synthetase as ACS and characterized five enzymes, ACS1–5 (7Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Fujino T. Kang M.J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol.

( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the deduced primary amino acid sequences of bovine and murine AceCS2 compared with that of murine AceCS1. There is only 45.8% amino acid identity between murine AceCS1 and AceCS2, and the phylogenetic tree of AceCSs of various origins indicates that AceCS1 and AceCS2 belong to completely different groups (Fig.1 B). Bovine and murine AceCS2 consist of 675 and 682 amino acids with calculated molecular weights of 74,309 and 74,662, respectively. Sequence analysis by the PSORT program (22Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar) predicted that AceCS2 contains a potential mitochondrial targeting signal at the N terminus (Fig. 1 A). To compare the enzymatic properties of the two enzymes, murine AceCS1 and AceCS2 cDNAs were individually introduced into COS cells, and the resulting enzymes were purified to homogeneity using the 230, 000 × gsupernatant fractions of the sonicated extracts. The overall purification and yields of AceCS1 and AceCS2 were 9.9-fold with a yield of 2.8% and 15-fold with a yield 2.3%, respectively. The specific activities of the purified AceCS1 and AceCS2 were, respectively, 26.8 and 11.9 μmol/min/mg when assayed with acetate as a substrate. The specific activity of the purified AceCS1 was 18-fold higher than that purified by Luong et al. using an expression plasmid containing six consecutive histidines at the N terminus and nickel column chromatography (12Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The two purified enzymes were essentially homogenous when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the purified AceCS1 estimated by SDS-PAGE was ∼78 kDa, in good agreement with that calculated molecular mass from the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA. The purified AceCS2 exhibited a molecular mass of 71 kDa, which agrees well with the purified enzyme from bovine heart but is ∼3.7 kDa smaller than the calculated molecular mass deduced from the cDNA. This suggests that the putative mitochondrial targeting signal is cleaved during the transportation of the enzyme into the mitochondria matrix (see below). Using the purified preparation, the fatty acid chain length preferences of AceCS1 and AceCS2 were determined. As shown in Fig.3 A, acetate is the most preferred substrate among short and medium chain fatty acids with 2–5 carbon atoms. The enzymes can also utilize propionate but with lower affinities (Fig. 3 B). The calculated Kmvalues for acetate of both AceCS1 and AceCS2 are similar to that of the purified histidine-tagged AceCS1 described by Luong et al. Both AceCS1 and AceCS2 require ATP and CoA for their activities (data not shown). When adenylate kinase was omitted from the reaction mixture for the spectrophotometric assay, no oxidation of NADH occurred, indicating that AMP was a reaction product (data not shown). Northern blotting of RNA from various mouse tissues (Fig. 4) revealed hybridization to major transcripts of 4.4 kilobases for AceCS2, expressed in a wide range of tissues with the highest level in heart, relatively high levels in spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis and lower levels in the brain (middle panel). No AceCS2 transcripts were detected in the liver, in contrast to AceCS1 transcripts (12Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, top panel). We also analyzed AceCS1 and AceCS2 mRNAs in 3T3-L1 cells. Although marked induction of AceCS1 mRNA and protein were seen during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, neither AceCS2 mRNA nor protein was detected in undifferentiated or differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). Luong et al. (12Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the expression of AceCS1 is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins in parallel with fatty acid synthesis in animal cells. Because AceCS2 is highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle, we analyzed the effects of starvation. Northern blotting was carried out to analyze the levels of mRNAs in the heart and skeletal muscle of adult male mice because the available antibodies were not sufficiently sensitive to detect AceCS1 and AceCS2 proteins in these tissues by immunoblotting. After 48 h of fasting, a marked induction of AceCS2 mRNA was seen in the heart (2-fold, p < 0.01, Fig.5 A, right panel), and skeletal muscle (6.5-fold, p < 0.01, Fig.5 B, right panel). In contrast, the AceCS1 mRNA level in the skeletal muscle decreased by ∼50% (p < 0.05, Fig. 5 B, left panel), whereas no significant changes were seen in the heart (Fig.5 A, left panel). We also analyzed the levels of the two AceCS mRNAs in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. As shown in Fig.5 C, the levels of AceCS2 mRNA in the skeletal muscle of Zucker diabetic fatty rats were ∼3-fold higher than those in the normal littermates (p < 0.05, right panel), whereas no changes were found in the levels of AceCS1 mRNA (left panel). These data indicate that the AceCS2 transcripts are induced in the heart and skeletal muscle under ketogenic conditions. To determine the subcellular distributions of AceCS1 and AceCS2, a subcellular fractionation was performed on mouse kidney homogenate. The tissue homogenate was fractionated into a light and heavy mitochondrial, a peroxisomal, a microsomal, and a cytosolic fraction. Among these fractions, anti-AceCS1 antibody detected an immunoreactive band of 78 kDa exclusively in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.6, top panel). In contrast, a 71-kDa protein detected by an anti-AceCS2 antibody was present mainly in the light and heavy mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 6, middle panel). Together with the solubility in hypotonic buffer of AceCS2 in transfected COS cells and the presence of a CoA pool in the mitochondrial matrix, the cell fractionation data indicate that AceCS2 is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme. An approximately 55-kDa band detected with anti-AceCS2 antibody (Fig. 6, middle panel) may be a degradation product of AceCS2 because it was colocalized with AceCS2, and proteolytic digestion of purified bovine AceCS2 with trypsin, subtilisin BPN′, and chymotrypsin generated a common 56-kDa fragment resistant to these proteases (15Ishikawa M. Fujino T. Sakashita H. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1995; 175: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of AceCS2, we incubated AceCS2-transfected COS cells with [14C]acetate and analyzed the incorporation of 14C into CO2 and lipids. As shown in Fig. 7 A, transfection of AceCS2 in COS cells resulted in an approximately 4-fold induction of AceCS activity. Consistent with the induction of AceCS activity, incorporation of 14C into CO2 in AceCS2-transfected cells increased approximately.5-fold over the relatively low incorporation by parental vector-transfected cells (Fig.7 B). In contrast, induction of 14C incorporation into lipids by AceCS2 transfection was only 1.6-fold. These data suggest that the major function of AceCS2 is to produce acetyl-CoA for oxidation through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to produce ATP and CO2 in the mitochondrial matrix. In the current study, we have isolated and characterized two cDNAs encoding functionally distinct AceCSs. One, designated AceCS1, is a cytosolic enzyme identical to that described by Luonget al. (12Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); the other, AceCS2, is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme, having a putative mitochondrial targeting signal at the N terminus of its primary amino acid sequence. Consistent with the presence of the putative signal sequence, subcellular fractionation indicated that AceCS2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix. Purification of murine AceCS1 and AceCS2 revealed that the two enzymes preferentially utilized acetate with similar affinity among C2–C5 short and medium chain fatty acids. Although there are numerous studies showing acetate utilization in the hepatic mitochondria, apparently no AceCS2 transcripts were detected in the liver. Hepatic carnitine acetyltransferase, which catalyzes the reversible transfer of short chain acyl groups between CoA and carnitine, may play a role in the transportation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA into the mitochondrial matrix. Although the two enzymes exhibit similar affinity for acetate, the regulation of the two enzymes is completely different. Luong et al. (12Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that AceCS1 is a cytosolic enzyme that provides acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. Consistent with the function of AceCS1, it is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, key transcriptional factors that mediate cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver (23Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). In contrast, AceCS2 is abundant in the heart and skeletal muscle and induced under ketogenic conditions. The [14C]acetate incorporation study revealed that AceCS2 produces acetyl-CoAs that are utilized mainly for oxidation. These results suggested that AceCS2 plays a role in the production of energy under ketogenic conditions, such as starvation and diabetes. Under ketogenic conditions, relatively large amounts of fatty acid-derived free acetate are released from the liver (24Seufert C.D. Graf M. Janson G. Kuhn A. Soling H.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increased production of acetate, plasma levels of acetate are also increased by starvation and in patients with diabetes (25Akanji A.O. Humphreys S. Thursfield V. Hockaday T.D. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 185: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Buckley B.M. Wiliamson D.H. Biochem. J. 1977; 166: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hepatic activity of cytosolic acetyl-CoA hydrolase is also induced under ketogenic conditions (27Matsunaga T. Isohashi F. Nakanishi Y. Sakamoto Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The acetate released from the liver under ketogenic conditions requires AceCS to be metabolized in extrahepatic tissues. Based on the abundant expression of AceCS2 in the heart and skeletal muscle, its absence from the liver, and its marked induction under ketogenic conditions, it is strongly suggested that AceCS2 plays a key role in the metabolism of acetate for energy production under ketogenic conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, AceCS2 is an abundant protein in the heart of ruminant mammals (15Ishikawa M. Fujino T. Sakashita H. Morikawa K. Yamamoto T. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1995; 175: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,28Webster Jr., L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 4010-4015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where large amounts of acetate are produced by microorganisms from plant fibers in the rumen (1Bremer J. Osmundsen H. Numa S. Fatty Acid Metabolism and Its Regulation. Elsevier Science Publisher, Amsterdam1984: 113-154Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which the expression of AceCS2 is induced under ketogenic conditions remains unclear, our current data provide evidence for the presence of two pathways for the metabolism of acetate in animals. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the precise function and regulation of the two enzymes and to determine any disorders caused by their absence. We thank Dr. Ian Gleadall for review of the manuscript and Yumiko Takei for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2077403992,"The identification of defects in ABCA1 as the molecular basis of Tangier disease has highlighted its crucial role in the loading with phospholipids and cholesterol of nascent apolipoprotein particles. Indeed the expression of ABCA1 affects apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-mediated removal of lipids from cell membranes, and the possible role of ABCA1 as an apoA-I surface receptor has been recently suggested. In the present study, we have investigated the role of the ABCA1 transporter as an apoA-I receptor with the analysis of a panel of transfectants expressing functional or mutant forms of ABCA1. We provide experimental evidence that the forced expression of a functional ABCA1 transporter confers surface competence for apoA-I binding. This, however, appears to be dependent on ABCA1 function. Structurally intact but ATPase-deficient forms of the transporter fail to elicit a specific cell association of the ligand. In addition the diffusion parameters of membrane-associated apoA-I indicate an interaction with membrane lipids rather than proteins. These results do not support a direct molecular interaction between ABCA1 and apoA-I, but rather suggest that the ABCA1-induced modification of the lipid distribution in the membrane, evidenced by the phosphatidylserine exofacial flopping, generates a biophysical microenvironment required for the docking of apoA-I at the cell surface.

These results do not support a direct molecular interaction between ABCA1 and apoA-I, but rather suggest that the ABCA1-induced modification of the lipid distribution in the membrane, evidenced by the phosphatidylserine exofacial flopping, generates a biophysical microenvironment required for the docking of apoA-I at the cell surface. high density lipoprotein ATP binding cassette Apolipoprotein A-I arbitrary units 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate cyanine 5 dimyristoyphosphatidylcholine enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence-activated cell sorter fluorescence correlation spectroscopy phosphatidylserine phospholipids relative fluorescence intensity The removal of cellular lipids is promoted by high density lipoproteins (HDL),1 the plasma shuttle mediating reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to the liver for further uptake and metabolism (1Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M.

However, whether the interaction of the lipid-poor apoA-I particle, protein core of the nascent HDL, with cell membranes is mediated by a specific receptor and how its loading with phospholipids and cholesterol occurs is still a matter of debate (2Fielding P.E.

Indeed a correlation between the cAMP-induced cell surface apoA-I binding and the expression of ABCA1 in macrophage-like cell lines has been reported (12Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H. Stoudt G.

Very recently, in addition, a direct molecular interaction between ABCA1 and apoA-I at the cell surface has been proposed on the basis of chemical cross-linking experiments (10Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 11Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into this issue, we developed an apoA-I binding assay based on the use of a fluorochrome-conjugated ligand. The analysis of apoA-I binding to a panel of transfectants expressing either functionally intact or defective ABCA1 proteins (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) led us to exclude that the transporter behaves as a bona fide receptor for apoA-I. Indeed, whereas surface binding increases with the expression of a functional ABCA1, the expression of structurally intact but functionally impaired ABCA1 proteins fails to elicit specific binding. Considering that, as previously demonstrated, ABCA1 promotes the transbilayer redistribution of phospholipids at the plasma membrane (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), we propose that ABCA1 favors the specific docking of apoA-I at the cell surface by providing a distinctive spatial arrangement of phospholipid species in the outer membrane leaflet. This model is supported by: (i) the colinear increase of apoA-I binding and exofacial PS exposure as a function of ABCA1 expression, and (ii) the mobility parameters of membrane-bound apoA-I. Indeed, the values of translational diffusion coefficients, assessed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are consistent with the molecular interaction of apoA-I with rapidly diffusing lipids rather than membrane-anchored receptors (14Schwille P. Korlach J. Webb W.W. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 15Schwille P. Haupts U. Maiti S. Webb W.W. Biophys.

RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were routinely maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm penicillin/streptomycin. ABCA1·EGFP, mutant ABCA1·EGFP, and control transfectants were obtained as described (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J.

Fluorescent-labeled apoA-I was testedversus native apoA-I for its ability to interact with dimyristoyphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles and analyzed by monitoring the decrease in optical density at 325 nm as a function of temperature as described (17Vanloo B.

Cells were then incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% fetal calf serum with or without 0.3 mm cpt-cAMP. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and effluxes were performed for 16 h in a 0.5% bovine serum albumin medium with or without 10 μg/ml apoA-I. Medium was separated from cells, and lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol (19Bligh E.G., D.W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the medium and cells was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of efflux is expressed as the number of counts in the medium divided by the total number of counts. Each value is the average of four points. Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed on 107 RAW 264.7 cells labeled overnight with 300 μCi/ml 35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation of ABCA1 with an ABCA1 antiserum (Ab16, 1:500) was performed as described (20Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recombinant apoA-I, carrying an N-terminal histidine tag was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (17Vanloo B. Demoor L. Boutillon C. Lins L. Brasseur R. Baert J. Fruchart J.C. Tartar A. Rosseneu M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1686-1696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This recombinant protein shows physicochemical properties similar to that of the native protein (21Bergeron J. Frank P.G. Emmanuel F. Latta M. Zhao Y. Sparks D.L. Rassart E. Denefle P. Marcel Y.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ApoA-I was conjugated to the fluorochrome with the fluorolinkTM Cy5 monofunctional dye 5-pack (PA25001, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For all experiments the labeled apoA-I (apoA-I/Cy5) was diluted to 100 μg/ml in binding buffer (1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and aggregates were removed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 ×g. Binding was performed in the presence of 10 μg/ml of apoA-I/Cy5 (or as indicated for saturation experiments) for 1 h at 4 °C on 5 × 105 cells detached by mild trypsinization (0.005% in phosphate-buffered saline). At the end of the incubation period, cells were rapidly washed prior to fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde. Annexin V (ann-V/Cy5) labeled as described (22Marguet D. Luciani M.F. Moynault A. Williamson P. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was diluted at 4 μg/ml in binding buffer, and aggregates were removed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Binding was performed in binding buffer for 10 min at 4 °C, in the presence of a final annexin V/Cy5 concentration of 4 μg/ml. The mean of the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) for annexin V/Cy5 was calculated for each subset of given EGFP RFI. Single or dual-channel flow cytometric recordings were performed on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed by Flowjow software (Tree Star Inc., San Carlos, CA). For each type of cells, the same settings were kept for all experiments. Cells were manually subdivided in function of their ABCA1 expression reflected by EGFP RFI. Binding data are calculated from the mean of Cy5 RFI on the selected cell populations. cAMP or ABCA1-induced binding was calculated as the point to point difference between cAMP-treated and -untreated RAW cells or the EGFP-positive and -negative cells. Saturation curves were fitted according to the equation,y = A + B(1−e−X/C) andKd and Bmax values were calculated from these (23Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors. Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York, Oxford1993: 9-72Google Scholar). Bmax values are given in arbitrary units (AU). Quantitation of cell surface-associated ABCA1 was calculated by the Optimas software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) on confocal images (Leica TCS4D) as the ratio between total cell RFI and membrane-associated RFI visually gated on single cells and on multiple sections. FCS measurements were carried out with a ConfoCor2 module/LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss SA, LePecq, France). For FCS excitation, 488- and 633-nm laser lines were used to illuminate a × 40 C-apochromat objective. In the image plane, a 70- and a 90-μm pinhole for the 488- and 633-laser line, respectively, defined the confocal volume. After the laser focal spot had been positioned on the top of the cell, a set of five FCS measurements of 10 s was recorded on that location and averaged for determination of the diffusion coefficients. Measurements were stepped in 1-μm increment from a z-stack of previously recorded EGFP images of an individual cell. FCS measurements were performed on AG cells after an incubation of 5 min at room temperature in the presence of 40 nm apoA-I/Cy5. The apparatus was calibrated by measuring the known three-dimensional diffusion of rhodamine-6G in solution (Dτ = 2.8 × 10−6cm2/sec−1). Data fitting was performed with a least squares algorithm. The apoA-I autocorrelation function (Gτ) was fitted taking into account the isomerization state of Cy5 dye, the free Brownian motion for unbound molecules, and two-dimensional motion for membrane-bound molecules (15Schwille P. Haupts U. Maiti S. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2251-2265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The ABCA1·EGFP autocorrelation function was fitted using the anomalous diffusion model (24Saxton M.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1250-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the forced expression of an ABCA1·EGFP chimera is able to induce an increased cellular release of choline-containing phospholipids and cholesterol to the specific acceptor apoA-I (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In the same experimental system, we also observed that a reduction of lipid effluxes tracks the progressive silencing of ABCA1 expression induced by tetracycline (not shown). To better characterize the functional effects of the graded ABCA1 expression in transfected cells, easily monitored by FACS analysis, we set out to develop a fluorescence-based assay of apoA-I binding. The assay was first validated by checking whether the fluorochrome conjugation altered the physiological properties of apoA-I. No significant difference in the behavior of labeled versus unlabeled apoA-I was detectable by a standard turbidimetric assay for phospholipid binding (Fig.1 A) nor by a classical phospholipid and cholesterol efflux assay from cAMP-treated RAW cells (Fig. 1 B). The flow cytometric analysis of apoA-I cellular binding was then performed on unstimulated RAW cells and showed a very low level of cell-associated fluorescence (Fig.2 A). In agreement with previously reported data (12Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H. Stoudt G. Hoppe K.L. Royer L.J. McNeish J. Francone O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28634-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 25Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the cell-associated fluorescence homogeneously increased after cAMP treatment (24 h at 37°, 0.3 mm), as shown by the right shift of the mean RFI (3.4 ± 0.4-fold increase over unstimulated cells, n = 4). As expected the cAMP-induced binding could be competed by a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled apolipoprotein. The increase in apoA-I surface binding was paralleled by an increased synthesis of ABCA1 protein as detected by immunoprecipitation from metabolically labeled RAW cells (Fig. 2 B). This is likely to result from a cAMP-mediated transcriptional activation of the ABCA1 gene, as suggested by Refs. 11Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 25Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S.

The saturation curves measured in the presence of increasing amounts of labeled ligand on cAMP-stimulated and -unstimulated RAW cells allowed the estimation of the parameters of specific cAMP-induced apoA-I binding in our assay (Kd of 1.44 ± 0.12 μg/ml/5.1 ± 0.4 × 10−8m, n = 3) (Fig. 2 C; Refs. 25Abe-Dohmae S.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To elucidate the link between ABCA1 expression and apoA-I binding, we carried out a set of experiments on macrophages derived from ABCA1-null animals (9McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G. Francone O.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), which showed a 2.1 ± 0.2-fold decrease in apoA-I surface labeling versus cells from wild-type controls (n = 2, not shown) and on AG cells, i.e.HeLa cells expressing a functional chimeric ABCA1 transporter under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The chimera consists of a C-terminal fusion of EGFP to the 2261 amino acid full-length mouse ABCA1 transporter (GenBankTM/EBI accession number X75926; nucleotides 84–6869, Ref. 28Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). By means of dual-channel flow cytometric recordings, we analyzed the behavior of apoA-I surface binding in these cells as a function of ABCA1 expression (Fig.3). The cell population was subdivided into EGFP-negative cells (i.e. cells that have lost the expression of the transporter) and EGFP-positive cells by manually gating below or above the threshold of autofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3 A, EGFP-negative AG cells demonstrated a very low binding, comparable with that of nonstimulated RAW or of control mock-transfected HeLa cells. Conversely, the whole population of EGFP-positive (RFI > 4 in the experiment shown) AG cells shows a significant increase in apoA-I-specific binding (3.2 ± 1.4-fold increase in mean RFI over negative cells, n = 10), similar to that induced by cAMP treatment on RAW cells. The specific binding showed an apparentKd of 24.3 ± 8 × 10−8m, 6.9 ± 2.4 μg/ml, n = 3 (Fig.3 B). In contrast to the macrophage cell line, no modification of binding was observed after 24 h of cAMP incubation or cholesterol loading of AG and mock-transfected cells (not shown). This indicates that both stimuli, at least under our experimental conditions, do not promote post-translational activation of the transporter, and this indirectly confirms previous reports locating its action to the transcriptional level. In addition, the lack of induction of apoA-I binding on mock-transfected HeLa cells supports a cell-restricted sensitivity of ABCA1 regulatory sequences to both the cAMP and cholesterol-mediated activation (27Sakr S.W. Williams D.L. Stoudt G.W. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To establish whether the physical presence of ABCA1 at the cell surface was sufficient to elicit apoA-I binding, we measured the interaction of labeled apoA-I to transfectants expressing mutant forms of ABCA1 (KM, MK, and MM). As already described, the mutations harbored by these proteins hamper ATP binding/hydrolysis at either or both the nucleotide-binding cassettes of the transporter without altering its folding or its intracellular routing (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). No specific apoA-I binding was detectable despite the presence of equivalent amounts of transporter at the cell surface, as indicated by similar intensity of EGFP fluorescence in the cell lines tested (Fig. 3, C and D). These data thus clearly indicate that an intact function of ABCA1 is essential to generate apoA-I binding competence at the plasma membrane. Because the expression of ABCA1 in transfectants is heterogeneous, as indicated by the broad distribution of EGFP fluorescence, we manually gated at discrete EGFP fluorescence intensity intervals to detail the behavior of apoA-I binding as a function of the expression of ABCA1 (Fig.4 A). The correlation between apoA-I (reflecting the density of surface binding sites) and EGFP fluorescent intensity (reflecting total cellular content in ABCA1), shown in Fig. 4 B, suggests that the surface binding of apoA-I is sensitive to the density of ABCA1 molecules at the cell surface. The latter cannot be assessed directly in our system but can be extrapolated from the total EGFP fluorescence. Indeed the digital quantification of fluorescence distribution on confocal microscopy recordings in low, medium, and high ABCA1-expressing cells showed that a stable fraction (35 ± 5%, n = 16) of total cell-associated fluorescence can be attributed to molecules at the plasma membrane. The saturation curve for apoA-I (Fig. 4 B) allowed to estimate that increasing amounts of ABCA1 at the cell surface affected maximum binding without altering binding affinity (in the experiment shown, values are: Kd, 27 × 10−8m and Bmax, 28 ± 2.6 for ABCA1+; 21 × 10−8mand Bmax, 78 ± 6.7 for ABCA++; 23 × 10−8m and Bmax, 114 ± 6 for ABCA1+++). By plotting the values of mean RFI for apoA-I (or the Bmax values) as a function of ABCA1 expression (Fig. 4 C, ▪), we observed that the correlation coefficient between the two parameters decreased sharply at high levels of ABCA1 expression. This apparent saturation indicates that the availability of ABCA1 molecules at the cell surface is not the sole parameter affecting the binding of the apolipoprotein. We then similarly tested the correlation between ABCA1 expression and the exposure of PS at the outer membrane, another ABCA1-elicited phenotype strictly dependent on the activity of the ABCA1 transporter (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). By plotting annexin V binding versus EGFP fluorescence, we detected again a bimodal behavior with a drop in the slope at high ABCA1 expression levels (Fig. 4 C, ♦). This suggests the possibility of a causal link between the two measured phenomena. To explore further whether apoA-I cell surface association is mediated via the interaction with a membrane-anchored receptor, we measured the mobility parameters of apoA-I and ABCA1·EGFP by FCS (Fig.4 D). This method allows the quantitation of the retardation in diffusion acquired by apoA-I after its interaction with the cell membrane of ABCA1-expressing AG cells. The translational diffusion coefficient Dτ for free apoA-I was 2.4 × 10−7cm2/sec−1 ± 0.6 on 13 independent measurements and for membrane-bound Dτ = 1.6 × 10−8 cm2/sec−1 ± 1.0 measured on 10 independent cells. The latter values are close to those measured for membrane lipids in fluid phase (15Schwille P. Haupts U. Maiti S. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2251-2265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 16Korlach J. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Feigenson G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The lateral diffusion parameters of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane could not be fitted by assuming a single population with uniform diffusion characteristics but were consistently fitted with the model of anomalous diffusion. The fitting of 13 different data sets from different cells allowed the estimation of a diffusion coefficient Γ of 1.1 × 10−10 cm2/secα ± 0.3 with an α of 0.47 ± 0.06. The different diffusional behavior of ABCA1·EGFP and apoA-I together with the lack of significance of the cross-correlation curves indicates that the two partners are not interacting in the time scale of the detection. In this study, we have described the development of a fluorescence-based assay for apoA-I binding, which we applied to the investigation of the ABCA1 transporter as a candidate apoA-I receptor. Based upon our results, we can conclude that the surface expression of ABCA1 is essential to the generation of specific cellular binding sites, but we ruled out ABCA1 as a molecular receptor for lipid-free apolipoproteins. We actually observed that the expression of similar amounts of correctly folded but functionally impaired ABCA1 molecules did not elicit any apoA-I binding and that increasing the number of expressed ABCA1 molecules did not colinearly increase the number of apoA-I binding sites. Several molecular interpretations are possible. The ATPase-deficient forms of ABCA1 may fail to adopt the molecular conformation required for apoA-I docking. This implies that alternative conformations of the transporter exist during the ATP cycle at both sites and that only one of the transition states is permissive for binding. This is conceivable, because it is known that ATP binding/hydrolysis is able to modify solvent accessibility of ABC transporters and could account for the similar loss of activity of the three mutant transporters (30Martin C. Berridge G. Mistry P. Higgins C. Charlton P. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11901-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the energy-dependent conformational change does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the lack of increase in apoA-I binding capacity at high expression of functional ABCA1. This rather suggests that even the presence of functional ABCA1 at the cell surface is not sufficient to generate apoA-I binding sites. We may, hence, envision that the activity of ABCA1 modulates the accessibility to apoA-I of a partner receptor, yet to be identified. Inactive forms of ABCA1 would not be able to interact with the receptor, and the availability of the molecule in the recipient HeLa cell may be rate-limiting and thus account for the observed saturation of surface binding at high expression of functional ABCA1. Alternatively, the specific docking of apoA-I may not be mediated by interaction with a unique protein receptor, but rather rely on a meticulous molecular arrangement of lipids at the cell surface (31Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Only the latter would support the interaction of the apolipoprotein with the membrane and the removal of phospholipids and cholesterol which follows. According to this model, apoA-I binding should be considered a consequence of the already demonstrated ability of the transporter to modulate the transbilayer arrangement of lipids (13Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P. Neish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The fact that a saturable behavior is also observed when plotting the expression of ABCA1 versus the exofacial PS exposure supports this hypothesis. In the latter case saturation is not surprising. It is conceivable that a cell tolerates only a limited amount of PS on the outer leaflet and that above this threshold a feedback response counteracts further membrane modifications potentially dramatic for cell viability. From a molecular standpoint, this may correspond to an overactivation of the aminophospholipid translocase, or other enzymatic activities able to flip inward the excess PS residues (34Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The safety feedback loop will thus concomitantly buffer further increases both of PS flop and apoA-I binding. This hypothesis, schematized in Fig.5, is reinforced by the diffusion parameters of both membrane-bound apoA-I and ABCA1·EGFP as assessed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The translational diffusion coefficient (Dτ) of apo A-I suggests its molecular interaction with lipids rather than with a protein receptor, which should theoretically retard its mobility to a Dτ in the range of 10−9 to 10−10 cm2/sec−1 (15Schwille P. Haupts U. Maiti S. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2251-2265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 16Korlach J. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Feigenson G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2000; 97: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ABCA1·EGFP behaves according to an anomalous diffusion model (24Saxton M.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1250-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This behavior has been previously reported for membrane proteins, like IgE receptor and the LDL receptor (24Saxton M.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1250-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and indicates obstruction in lateral diffusion likely to originate from the interaction with other cellular components. In addition, the cross-correlation analysis of diffusion parameters recorded for the ligand and the candidate receptor excludes their interaction in the time scale of the experimental detection. Our results are only apparently at odds with those of chemical cross-linking reported in (10Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 11Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

We propose hence that the role played by ABCA1 in promoting apoA-I binding is, in essence, a consequence of the ABCA1-orchestrated modification of the biophysical properties of the membrane. Whether the modification is homogeneously spread over the cell surface or generates only locally and transiently a favorable apoA-I docking environment remains still to be ascertained. The latter case can be reasonably surmised on the basis of the reported physical proximity of the two partners. We thank N. Duverger for discussion, P. Schwille and Carl Zeiss S.

https://openalex.org/W1976523980,"Tissue factor (TF) has been shown to be up-regulated in endothelial cells by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as well as by the main angiogenic factor VEGF. Since both stimuli induce the transcription factor EGR-1, which is critically involved in TF gene regulation, we used EGR-1-dependent TF induction as a model to identify potential cross-talks between the various signal transduction cascades initiated by VEGF and TNF-alpha. The data show that at the MAP kinase level, VEGF mainly activates ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases in human endothelial cells. TNF-alpha is able to activate all three MAP kinase cascades as well as the classical inflammatory IkappaB/NFkappaB pathway. Furthermore, the MEK/ERK module of MAP kinases appears to act as the convergence point of VEGF- and TNF-alpha-initiated signaling cascades, which lead to the activation of EGR-1 and subsequent TF expression, whereas the upstream signals are distinct. We found that induction of TF by VEGF via EGR-1 is strongly PKC dependent. The TNF-alpha-initiated MEK/ERK cascade connected to EGR-1 and TF expression is clearly less sensitive to PKC inhibition. TNF-alpha-mediated activation of MEK/ERK and EGR-1 can be blocked by adenoviral expression of a dominant negative mutant of IKK2, whereas the VEGF signaling pathway is unaffected. Thus, our data demonstrate a new link between the classical inflammatory IKK/IkappaB and the MEK/ERK cascades triggered by TNF-alpha. The additional finding that EGF induces ERK and EGR-1 in a PKC-independent manner and that this signal is not sufficient to up-regulate TF emphasizes the importance of a VEGF-specific signaling pattern for the induction of TF."
https://openalex.org/W2153024208,"Unilateral injection into the right substantia nigra of the catecholaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) produces extensive loss of dopaminergic cells ('hemi-parkinsonian rat'). The pineal hormone melatonin, which is a potent antioxidant against different reactive oxygen species and has been reported to be neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro, was evaluated for potential anti-Parkinson effects in this model. Imbalance in dopaminergic innervation between the striata produced by intranigral administration of 6-OHDA results in a postural asymmetry causing rotation away from the nonlesioned side. Melatonin given systemically prevented apomorphine-induced circling behavior in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Reduced activity of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation enzymes has been suggested in some neurodegenerative diseases; in particular, selective decrease in complex I activity is observed in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients. Analysis of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation enzyme activities in nigral tissue from 6-OHDA-lesioned rats by a novel BN-PAGE histochemical procedure revealed a clear loss of complex I activity, which was protected against in melatonin-treated animals. A good correlation between behavioral parameters and enzymatic (complex I) analysis was observed independent of melatonin administration. A deficit in mitochondrial complex I could conceivably contribute to cell death in parkinsonism via free radical mechanisms, both directly via reactive oxygen species production and by decreased ATP synthesis and energy failure. Melatonin may have potential utility in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders where oxidative stress is a participant."
https://openalex.org/W2003801493,"Production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells is regulated by direct interactions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with effector proteins such as Ca2+-calmodulin, by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation via protein kinase B, and by translocation of the enzyme from the plasma membrane caveolae to intracellular compartments. Reversible acylation of eNOS is thought to contribute to the intracellular trafficking of the enzyme; however, protein factor(s) that govern the translocation of the enzyme are still unknown. Here we have used the yeast two-hybrid system and identified a novel 34 kDa protein, termed NOSIP (eNOS interacting protein), which avidly binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of the eNOS oxygenase domain. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the specific interaction of eNOS and NOSIP in vitro and in vivo, and complex formation was inhibited by a synthetic peptide of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain. NO production was significantly reduced in eNOS-expressing CHO cells (CHO-eNOS) that transiently overexpressed NOSIP. Stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 induced the reversible translocation of eNOS from the detergent-insoluble to the detergent-soluble fractions of CHO-eNOS, and this translocation was completely prevented by transient coexpression of NOSIP in CHO-eNOS. Immunofluorescence studies revealed a prominent plasma membrane staining for eNOS in CHO-eNOS that was abolished in the presence of NOSIP. Subcellular fractionation studies identified eNOS in the caveolin-rich membrane fractions of CHO-eNOS, and coexpression of NOSIP caused a shift of eNOS to intracellular compartments. We conclude that NOSIP is a novel type of modulator that promotes translocation of eNOS from the plasma membrane to intracellular sites, thereby uncoupling eNOS from plasma membrane caveolae and inhibiting NO synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2087561238,"We report a detailed study of AQP4 expression in the neuromuscular system of mdx mice. Immunocytochemical analysis performed by double immunostaining revealed that mdx mice manifest a progressive reduction in AQP4 at the sarcolemmal level of skeletal muscle fast fibers and that type IIB fibers are the first to manifest this reduction in AQP4 expression. No labeling was observed in the cytoplasm of muscle fibers, indicating that the reduction in sarcolemma staining is not associated with an intracellular compartmentalization of mistargeted protein. By Western blot and RT-PCR analysis, we found that whereas the total content of AQP4 protein decreased (by 90% in adult mdx mice), mRNA levels for AQP4 remained unchanged. A similar age-related reduction in AQP4 expression was found in brain astrocytic end-feet surrounding capillaries of mdx mice. Morphometric analysis performed after immunogold electron microscopy indicated a reduction of approximately 85% in gold particles (32+/-2/microm vs. 4.7+/-0.61/microm). Western blot experiments conducted using membrane fractions from brain cortex revealed a strong reduction (of 70%) in AQP4 protein in adult mdx mice, and RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that the reduction was not at transcription level. More interesting was the finding that AQP4 reduction was associated with swelling of astrocytic perivascular processes whose ultrastructural modifications are commonly indicated as an important and early event in the development of brain edema. No apparent reduction in AQP4 was found in mdx stomach and kidney. Our data provide evidence that dystrophin deficiency in mdx mice leads to disturbances in AQP4 assembly in the plasma membrane of fast skeletal muscle fibers and brain astrocytic end-feet, suggesting that changes in the osmotic equilibrium of the neuromuscular apparatus may be involved in the pathology of muscular dystrophy."

High expression of ER-β in human brain, cardiovascular system, thymus, bone, kidney, lung, urogenital tract, and gastrointestinal tract suggests that ER-β has significant roles in cellular functions not previously thought to involve estrogens. Such ER-β-mediated functions might include effects on memory and reproduction, enhancement of T-cell immunity, vascular lesion protection, and colon cancer protection. In addition, ER-β appears to be the only estrogen receptor type expressed in the embryonic central nervous system, implying that ER-β is important to early embryonic development. Transgenic mice with only mER-β deleted (35Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Couse J.F. Enmark E. Warner M. Mahler J.F. Sar M. Korach K.S. Gustafsson J.A. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Female ER-β knockout mice develop follicular arrest and anovulation, indicating that both ER-β and ER-α are required for the maintenance of germ and somatic cells in the postnatal ovary.

Cole R.N. Zaia J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11609-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here, we report that these two alternative modifications play distinct roles in modulating mER-β degradation and function.DISCUSSIONSince the discovery of the O-GlcNAc modification, several functional roles have been postulated, such as modulation or mediation of protein·protein interactions, regulation of nuclear transport, transient regulation of phosphorylation site availability, and modulation of protein turnover (1Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that O-GlcNAc on mER-β has a reciprocal relationship with phosphorylation by capping a phosphorylation site that modulates mER-β degradation and is also important for the receptor's transactivational activity.Previous studies on eukaryotic initiation factor 2-associated protein p67 and on the transcription factor Sp1 showed that O-GlcNAc removal from both p67 and Sp1 targets them for rapid degradation by the proteasome (25Datta B.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Studies on the mutated forms of mER-β not only provide additional evidence for O-GlcNAc regulating protein degradation but also suggest that the saccharide may act by blocking the addition of phosphate, which itself targets the protein for rapid degradation. To further understand the relative roles ofO-GlcNAc versus O-phosphate at Ser16, we compared the wt mER-β to both the S16A and the S16E mutants, the latter of which mimics constitutive phosphorylation (40Liu Z.P.

The simplest interpretation of the data is that the S16E mutant behaved as the phosphorylated form of the protein resulting in accelerated degradation, whereas the S16A mutant behaved analogous to the “capped” glycosylated form of the protein that slowed degradation. Because many of the known O-GlcNAc sites are located near proline residues, glycosylation sites adjacent to acidic amino acids will have high intrinsic PEST scores, whereas others may be dependent upon phosphorylation to target PEST-mediated degradation (42Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar,43Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem.

It has been suggested that phosphorylation can change Ser or Thr residues into negatively charged residues so as to convert some imperfect PST sequences into PEST degradation signals. In contrast,O-GlcNAcylation could prevent these phosphorylation effects by either competing at the same hydroxyl directly or by changing the protein conformation indirectly to mask the charged regions, as has been suggested for p53 (52Shaw P.

These data suggest thatO-GlcNAc/O-phosphate at this site directly plays a role in modulating mER-β-mediated transactivation. Earlier studies suggested that O-GlcNAcylation modulates transactivation by mediating the appropriate protein·protein interactions of many transcription factors such as Sp1 (3Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

Recent in vivo studies showed that the concentration of these transcriptional activator proteins is regulated by the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway, and the rate of degradation of activators by the proteasome correlates with activation domain potencyin vivo (55Molinari E.

Consistent with these earlier reports on other transcription factors, the alternateO-GlcNAc/O-phosphorylation of mER-β appears to be involved in both degradation and transactivation functions of the molecule.Based on our in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling studies (data not shown), Ser16 is one of several phosphorylation sites on mER-β. It is likely that Ser16is a regulatory site with typically low occupancy and rapid cycling. Earlier studies on transcription factor Sp1 have suggested that, upon glucose starvation, Sp1 undergoes rapid deglycosylation and becomes more susceptible to proteasome degradation (49Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that ER-α is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome upon estrogen stimulation (56Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc transferase activity is exquisitely sensitive to concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc/UDP, which are in turn highly sensitive to energy metabolism (11Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Thus, in energy-rich conditions, O-GlcNAc levels would be expected to increase, in turn preventing degradation of certain proteins, such as ER-β.Our green fluorescence protein fusion results revealed that there is no significant redistribution of mER-β in mammalian cells induced by the mutations, excluding the possibility that nuclear localization requires either phosphorylation or O-GlcNAcylation at the Ser16 of mER-β. However, we did observe some minor nuclear pattern changes, such as a clustering of ER-β within the nucleus upon estrogen treatment (Fig. 6). This clustering phenomenon is similar to that seen for ER-α using a similar approach (57Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).The occurrence of O-GlcNAcylation sites in the key regulatory regions of some oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as c-Myc, p53, and SV-40 large T-antigen (18Medina L.

If a reciprocal relationship between O-GlcNAcylation andO-phosphorylation is found to be common, then it will be important to carefully evaluate the respective roles of these distinct modifications. Generally, this will not be possible by direct site-directed mutagenesis approaches but rather will require novel methods, such as the chemi-enzymatic synthesis of site-specifically modified glyco- and phospho-forms of these regulatory proteins (58Hecht S.M.

The interplay between O-GlcNAc andO-phosphate on mER-β Ser16 demonstrated in this study provides another excellent example where both of these modifications work in a coordinated manner to regulate the activity of a key regulatory protein. A large number of proteins, ranging from cytoskeletal components to nuclear proteins, are dynamically modified by O-linkedN-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)1 in virtually all higher eukaryotes, including plants and fungi (for reviews see Refs. 1Comer F.I.

O-GlcNAc sites resemble phosphorylation sites, and in some cases the two modifications are mutually exclusive (16Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in the case of estrogen receptor β (ER-β) (17Cheng X. Cole R.N. Zaia J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11609-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), SV-40 large T antigen (18Medina L. Grove K. Haltiwanger R.S.

Like phosphorylation,O-GlcNAcylation is responsive to the cell cycle (21Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar), extracellular signals (22Kearse K.P. Hart G.W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest thatO-GlcNAcylation plays important roles in the regulation of transcription and translation (16Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor (ER) is a central component of estrogen regulation (28Parker M.G. Vitam.

Recently ER-β, a homologue of ER-α, was discovered in various species (30Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4194) Google Scholar, 31Kuiper G.J.M. Gustafsson J.-A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 32Mosselman S. Polman J.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). ER-β not only shares many structural and functional features with ER-α but also has distinctive characteristics, such as different tissue distribution (31Kuiper G.J.M. Gustafsson J.-A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and differential ligand responsiveness (34Barkhem T. Carlsson B. Nilsson Y. Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). High expression of ER-β in human brain, cardiovascular system, thymus, bone, kidney, lung, urogenital tract, and gastrointestinal tract suggests that ER-β has significant roles in cellular functions not previously thought to involve estrogens. Such ER-β-mediated functions might include effects on memory and reproduction, enhancement of T-cell immunity, vascular lesion protection, and colon cancer protection. In addition, ER-β appears to be the only estrogen receptor type expressed in the embryonic central nervous system, implying that ER-β is important to early embryonic development. Transgenic mice with only mER-β deleted (35Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Couse J.F. Enmark E. Warner M. Mahler J.F. Sar M. Korach K.S. Gustafsson J.A. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 286: 2328-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) have been generated. Female ER-β knockout mice develop follicular arrest and anovulation, indicating that both ER-β and ER-α are required for the maintenance of germ and somatic cells in the postnatal ovary. Data from these mice further suggest that several specialized functions are mediated distinctly between ER-α and ER-β. However, because ER-β was only recently discovered (30Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4194) Google Scholar, 31Kuiper G.J.M. Gustafsson J.-A.

Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), much work remains toward elucidating its functions and relationships to ER-α. Previously, we mapped the major O-GlcNAc site to Ser16 near the amino terminus of mER-β and showed that this same hydroxyl moiety is alternatively modified byO-phosphate (17Cheng X. Cole R.N. Zaia J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11609-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here, we report that these two alternative modifications play distinct roles in modulating mER-β degradation and function. DISCUSSIONSince the discovery of the O-GlcNAc modification, several functional roles have been postulated, such as modulation or mediation of protein·protein interactions, regulation of nuclear transport, transient regulation of phosphorylation site availability, and modulation of protein turnover (1Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that O-GlcNAc on mER-β has a reciprocal relationship with phosphorylation by capping a phosphorylation site that modulates mER-β degradation and is also important for the receptor's transactivational activity.Previous studies on eukaryotic initiation factor 2-associated protein p67 and on the transcription factor Sp1 showed that O-GlcNAc removal from both p67 and Sp1 targets them for rapid degradation by the proteasome (25Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Wylie D.E. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20620-20624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Studies on the mutated forms of mER-β not only provide additional evidence for O-GlcNAc regulating protein degradation but also suggest that the saccharide may act by blocking the addition of phosphate, which itself targets the protein for rapid degradation. To further understand the relative roles ofO-GlcNAc versus O-phosphate at Ser16, we compared the wt mER-β to both the S16A and the S16E mutants, the latter of which mimics constitutive phosphorylation (40Liu Z.P. Galindo R.L. Wasserman S.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Chen D.S. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Ali S. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 10092-10097Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The interplay between O-GlcNAc andO-phosphate on mER-β Ser16 demonstrated in this study provides another excellent example where both of these modifications work in a coordinated manner to regulate the activity of a key regulatory protein. Since the discovery of the O-GlcNAc modification, several functional roles have been postulated, such as modulation or mediation of protein·protein interactions, regulation of nuclear transport, transient regulation of phosphorylation site availability, and modulation of protein turnover (1Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Hart G.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that O-GlcNAc on mER-β has a reciprocal relationship with phosphorylation by capping a phosphorylation site that modulates mER-β degradation and is also important for the receptor's transactivational activity. Previous studies on eukaryotic initiation factor 2-associated protein p67 and on the transcription factor Sp1 showed that O-GlcNAc removal from both p67 and Sp1 targets them for rapid degradation by the proteasome (25Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Wylie D.E. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20620-20624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Studies on the mutated forms of mER-β not only provide additional evidence for O-GlcNAc regulating protein degradation but also suggest that the saccharide may act by blocking the addition of phosphate, which itself targets the protein for rapid degradation. To further understand the relative roles ofO-GlcNAc versus O-phosphate at Ser16, we compared the wt mER-β to both the S16A and the S16E mutants, the latter of which mimics constitutive phosphorylation (40Liu Z.P. Galindo R.L. Wasserman S.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Chen D.S. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Ali S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1002-1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Jaffe L. Ryoo H.D. Mann R.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 51Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H.G. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of the data is that the S16E mutant behaved as the phosphorylated form of the protein resulting in accelerated degradation, whereas the S16A mutant behaved analogous to the “capped” glycosylated form of the protein that slowed degradation. Because many of the known O-GlcNAc sites are located near proline residues, glycosylation sites adjacent to acidic amino acids will have high intrinsic PEST scores, whereas others may be dependent upon phosphorylation to target PEST-mediated degradation (42Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar,43Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation can change Ser or Thr residues into negatively charged residues so as to convert some imperfect PST sequences into PEST degradation signals. In contrast,O-GlcNAcylation could prevent these phosphorylation effects by either competing at the same hydroxyl directly or by changing the protein conformation indirectly to mask the charged regions, as has been suggested for p53 (52Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R. Iggo R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of mER-β, which harbors the major O-GlcNAc site, mediates the receptor's a transactivation functions, which in turn activates target genes (53Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-164PubMed Google Scholar, 54Edwards D.P. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 165-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our luciferase reporter data show that the extent of transactivation is dependent upon the modification of the hydroxyl group of Ser16. These data suggest thatO-GlcNAc/O-phosphate at this site directly plays a role in modulating mER-β-mediated transactivation. Earlier studies suggested that O-GlcNAcylation modulates transactivation by mediating the appropriate protein·protein interactions of many transcription factors such as Sp1 (3Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 26Roos M.D. Su K.H. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell.

A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Recent in vivo studies showed that the concentration of these transcriptional activator proteins is regulated by the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway, and the rate of degradation of activators by the proteasome correlates with activation domain potencyin vivo (55Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier reports on other transcription factors, the alternateO-GlcNAc/O-phosphorylation of mER-β appears to be involved in both degradation and transactivation functions of the molecule. Based on our in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling studies (data not shown), Ser16 is one of several phosphorylation sites on mER-β. It is likely that Ser16is a regulatory site with typically low occupancy and rapid cycling. Earlier studies on transcription factor Sp1 have suggested that, upon glucose starvation, Sp1 undergoes rapid deglycosylation and becomes more susceptible to proteasome degradation (49Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that ER-α is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome upon estrogen stimulation (56Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc transferase activity is exquisitely sensitive to concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc/UDP, which are in turn highly sensitive to energy metabolism (11Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Han I. Oh E.-S. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, in energy-rich conditions, O-GlcNAc levels would be expected to increase, in turn preventing degradation of certain proteins, such as ER-β. Our green fluorescence protein fusion results revealed that there is no significant redistribution of mER-β in mammalian cells induced by the mutations, excluding the possibility that nuclear localization requires either phosphorylation or O-GlcNAcylation at the Ser16 of mER-β. However, we did observe some minor nuclear pattern changes, such as a clustering of ER-β within the nucleus upon estrogen treatment (Fig. 6). This clustering phenomenon is similar to that seen for ER-α using a similar approach (57Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The occurrence of O-GlcNAcylation sites in the key regulatory regions of some oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as c-Myc, p53, and SV-40 large T-antigen (18Medina L. Grove K. Haltiwanger R.S.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930PubMed Google Scholar), reinforces the potential regulatory significance of this modification. If a reciprocal relationship between O-GlcNAcylation andO-phosphorylation is found to be common, then it will be important to carefully evaluate the respective roles of these distinct modifications. Generally, this will not be possible by direct site-directed mutagenesis approaches but rather will require novel methods, such as the chemi-enzymatic synthesis of site-specifically modified glyco- and phospho-forms of these regulatory proteins (58Hecht S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2041794488,"A critical first-line antioxidant defense on the airway epithelial surface against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) is extracellular glutathione peroxidase (eGPx). Little is known about the regulation of eGPx or its role in ROS-mediated lung diseases such as asthma. Here we show that eGPx is increased in the asthmatic airway in comparison to healthy controls. Higher levels of eGPx mRNA in asthmatic airway epithelium verified bronchial epithelial cells as the source for the increased eGPx. The eGPx mRNA in bronchial epithelial cells in vitro increased eightfold after exposure to ROS and glutathione, an essential cofactor for eGPx activity. Alterations in intracellular and extracellular oxidized and reduced glutathione were temporally associated with eGPx induction, further supporting redox mechanisms in gene expression. Overexpression of superoxide dismutase, but not catalase, inhibited induction and identified superoxide as a key intermediary. The eGPx mRNA half-life was not affected by ROS, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism for eGPx regulation. Fusion genes of deletion fragments of the eGPx gene 5' flanking region driving a reporter gene conclusively identified the ROS-responsive region, which contained the consensus DNA binding site for the redox-regulated transcription factor, activator protein 1."

The role of each conserved amino acid residue in this pentapeptide motif in supporting complex formation with DLC8 was systematically studied using site-directed mutagenesis. Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based molecular motor that has been implicated in a wide variety of functions including retrograde organelle movement, nuclear migration, mitotic spindle alignment, and axonal transport (1Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science.. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Google Scholar, 2Hirokawa N. Science.. 1998; 279: 519-526Google Scholar, 3King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1496: 60-75Google Scholar). The enzyme is a multisubunit complex assembly containing two molecules of heavy chains (DHC1, ∼530 kDa), several intermediate chains (DIC, ∼74 kDa) and light intermediate chains (DLIC, 53–59 kDa), and a number of light chains (DLC, 8–22 kDa). The heavy chains of dynein contain ATPase activity essential for force generation and are also responsible for attaching the motor complex to microtubules. The divergent N-terminal one-third of DHC contains the DIC-binding site. DICs may function as linkers of cargoes to the dynein motor through direct binding to dynactin (4Vaughan K. Vallee R. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 131: 1507-1516Google Scholar). The functions of other dynein polypeptides are largely unknown. The 8-kDa light chain (DLC8) of cytoplasmic dynein was originally identified as a light chain of Chlamydomonas outer arm axonemal dynein (5Piperno G. Luck D.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1979; 254: 3084-3090Google Scholar, 6Pfister K.K. Fay R.B. Witman G.B. Cell Motil.. 1982; 2: 525-547Google Scholar, 7Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 1986; 6: 510-520Google Scholar). The protein was subsequently shown to be a stoichiometric component of cytoplasmic dynein and of actin-based motor myosin V (8King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 19358-19366Google Scholar). Mutational studies showed that DLC8 is required for proper functioning of cytoplasmic dynein including retrograde intraflagellar transport (9Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 141: 979-992Google Scholar), nuclear migration, and motor complex localization (10Beckwith S.M. Roghi C.H. Liu B. Ronald Morris N. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 143: 1239-1247Google Scholar). However, it is not known how DLC8 is assembled into the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex, although it was suggested that the protein is associated with DIC in the axonemal dynein complex (6Pfister K.K. Fay R.B. Witman G.B. Cell Motil.. 1982; 2: 525-547Google Scholar). DLC8 contains 89 amino acid residues and is highly conserved throughout evolution (>90% amino acid sequence identity fromCaenorhabditis elegans to humans). Other than binding to certain subunits of motor proteins, DLC8 has also been shown to interact with several cellular targets with diverse functions. DLC8 binds to neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (11Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science.. 1996; 274: 774-777Google Scholar, 12Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Li M. Tochio H. Yamazaki T. Shimizu M. Zhang M. J. Biol.

Neurosci... 2000; 20: 4524-4534Google Scholar). The DLC8-binding domain of nNOS was mapped to a short stretch of amino acid residues (12Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Li M. Tochio H. Yamazaki T. Shimizu M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 33472-33481Google Scholar, 17Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1999; 6: 735-740Google Scholar). The other known DLC8-binding proteins neither contain homologous DLC8-interacting sequences found in nNOS nor bear obvious amino acid sequence similarities among each other. Elucidation of the molecular basis of the interactions between DLC8 and its diverse target proteins represents an important step in understanding the function of this versatile protein. Structural studies showed that DLC8 contains two identical target-binding grooves located at opposite faces of the protein dimer interface (18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). DLC8 is capable of binding to short peptide fragments of ∼10 amino acid residues from its targets. The target peptides bind to DLC8 in an antiparallel β-strand structure by pairing with the β-strand located at the base of each target-accepting groove (17Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1999; 6: 735-740Google Scholar, 18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). We report here that DLC8 binds to a conserved (K/R)XTQT amino acid sequence motif in a wide variety of protein partners. Such a motif is present in DIC of cytoplasmic dynein and mediates association of DLC8 and DIC in the dynein complex. Yeast-two hybrid screening was performed as described previously (16Naisbitt S. Valtschanoff J. Allison D.W. Sala C. Kim E. Craig A.M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Neurosci... 2000; 20: 4524-4534Google Scholar). Briefly, DLC8 was subcloned into pBHA (LexA fusion vector) and used to separately screen ∼1 × 106 clones each from human and rat cDNA libraries constructed in pGAD10 (GAL4 activation vector; CLONTECH). The full-length mouse DIC gene was constructed by assembling three partially overlapping genomic clones using standard PCR and DNA ligation methods. The DIC fragments were generous gifts from Dr. L. C. Tsui (20Crackower M.A. Sinasac D.S. Xia J. Motoyama J. Prochazka M. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Genomics.. 1999; 55: 257-267Google Scholar). The full-length DIC coding DNA fragment was inserted into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of an in-house-modified pET32a plasmid vector (Novagen). Various truncation and point mutants of DICs were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard recombinant DNA methods. The plasmids harboring the full-length DIC gene and various mutant DIC genes were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) host cells for fusion protein production. The C-terminal fragment of c82 (gene product of clone 82 identified from a yeast two-hybrid screening for DLC8-binding proteins; see TableI) containing amino acid residues 119–199 of the native protein was amplified by PCR using the coding strand primer 5′-CCGGAATTCGAGAGATTGCAGGGTCTG-3′ and noncoding strand primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTAGAGGCTGGGTCTAC-3′. The PCR-amplified c82 fragment was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1. Various GST-fused c82 truncation mutants used in this study were generated using standard PCR techniques. The GST-fused BS69 fragment was prepared using a method similar to that described for c82, except that two primers specific for BS69 were used in the PCR amplification.Table IDLC8-binding proteins identified through yeast two-hybrid screeningProtein nameSpeciesBinding modeRemarkMyosin VHumanUnknownTransport via actin trackGKAPHuman, ratUnknownProtein transportBS69Rat(K/R)XTQTAdenovirus E1A-binding proteinc82Human(K/R)XTQTNovel proteinAIBC1Human, ratUnknownPotential oncogeneKIAA0710HumanUnknownUnknown functionc40RatUnknownNovel proteinc81HumanUnknownNovel protein Open table in a new tab Bacterial expression vectors of GST-fused BimL (long form) and BimS (short form), both lacking the hydrophobic transmembrane region and the BH3 domain, were constructed by PCR using full-length BimL and BimS (gifts from Dr. A. Strasser) as templates, respectively, using a pair of primers: 5′-CGGGGATCCATGGCCAAGCAAC-3′ (sense), and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTCCTGTGCGATCC-3′ (antisense). To express the full-length DIC and its truncated mutants, host cells transformed with the DIC expression plasmids were grown in LB medium at 37 °C until A600 reached ∼1.2. The expression of the proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of ∼0.5 mm. Protein expression continued for ∼3 h at 37 °C, and the cells were then harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C prior to protein purification. The full-length DIC containing a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus was expressed in inclusion bodies. The pelleted bacterial cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain prior to cell lysis using sonication. The inclusion bodies were then washed extensively using 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1m urea and 0.5% Triton X-100. The washed inclusion bodies were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 6m guanidine HCl at room temperature. The denatured protein was then passed through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Novagen) for proteins under denaturing conditions. Refolding of full-length DIC was achieved by a single step dialysis of the denatured protein against 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4). The refolded protein was recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation. Various GST-fused DIC (as well as c82 and BS69) truncated and point mutants were expressed in soluble forms and purified using GSH-Sepharose affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4) to remove GSH, and the protein samples were directly used for DLC8 binding assay experiments. To express GST·BimL and GST·BimS, host cells containing the Bim plasmid constructs were grown in LB medium at 37 °C, reaching anA600 of ∼1.0. The temperature of the bacterial cultures was then lowered to 25 °C before induction of GST·Bim expression. Purification of GST·Bim proteins followed the procedure described for the purification of the GST·DIC mutant proteins. Preparation of pure and untagged DLC8 was described in our earlier work (12Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Li M. Tochio H. Yamazaki T. Shimizu M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 33472-33481Google Scholar). Direct interactions between DLC8 and various GST-fused proteins were assayed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4). Equal molar amounts of DLC8 and one of the GST fusion proteins (0.6 nmol each) were mixed in 100 μl of the assay buffer. The GST fusion protein-DLC8 complexes were pelleted by 30 μl of fresh GSH-Sepharose beads. The pellets were washed three times with 0.5 ml of the assay buffer and subsequently boiled with 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The intensity of the DLC8 band on SDS-PAGE gels was used to judge the strength of the interaction between DLC8 and various GST fusion proteins. An 11-residue synthetic peptide (VSYSKETQTPL), corresponding to amino acid residues 147–157 of DIC, was commercially synthesized. To assay competition between the synthetic peptide and DIC for DLC8, increasing amounts of the peptide (from 0 to 200 molar ratio amounts of DIC) were included in the GST·DIC/DLC8 mixture. Residual GST·DIC-bound DLC8 was assayed using GSH-Sepharose affinity “pull-down” followed by SDS-PAGE as described above. 1H,15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled DLC8 complexed with various synthetic peptides were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient shielded triple resonance probe. All NMR spectra were recorded at 30 °C, with a protein concentration of ∼0.5 mm dissolved in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. To understand how DLC8 is assembled in cytoplasmic dynein, we set out to identify the binding partner of DLC8 within the dynein complex. Given the overall similarity between axonemal and cytoplasmic dynein complexes, we suspected that DLC8 may also bind to DIC in cytoplasmic dynein. The gene encoding full-length DIC was assembled from three overlapping genomic clones (corresponding to the long form of DIC, GenBankTM accession number AF063229). His-tagged full-length DIC was expressed in E. coli cells and purified in its denatured form. DIC was successfully refolded, and the refolded DIC was assayed for its binding to DLC8. Affinity pull-down assay indicates that the full-length DIC binds directly to DLC8 (Fig.1 B). The circular dichroism spectrum of the refolded, full-length DIC indicated that the protein has a well folded structure in solution (data not shown). To further define the DLC8-binding region, we created a series of truncation mutants of DIC as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A). The purified proteins were subsequently assayed for binding to DLC8 by simple mixing and GSH-Sepharose bead pull-down. The DLC8-binding region was mapped within the N-terminal domain of DIC (Fig. 1 C). An 11-residue fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 147–157 (VSYSKETQTPL) of DIC was sufficient to bind to DLC8 (Fig.1 C, lane 6). We verified the interaction between DLC8 and the 11-residue peptide fragment of DIC derived from the truncation mapping experiment using two different approaches. In the first experiment, we titrated15N-labeled DLC8 with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 147–157 of DIC (the DIC peptide). Fig.2, A and B show the1H,15N HSQC spectra of DLC8 before and after binding to the DIC peptide. The chemical shift changes of DLC8 resulting from the DIC peptide binding are summarized using the minimal shift perturbation approach (Fig. 2 C). These data show that the DIC peptide specifically binds to DLC8 and that the peptide-binding region is located at the target-binding groove formed by the β2, β3 strands, the loop linking β2 and β3, and part of the α2 helix (see “Discussion” for details). The observation of slow chemical exchange between the apo-DLC8 and peptide-bound DLC8 during titration indicates that the DIC peptide binds to DLC8 with a high affinity (data not shown). NMR titration experiments also showed that the DIC peptide binds to DLC8 with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In the second approach, we performed a binding competition experiment using the DIC peptide. Increasing molar amounts of the DIC peptide specifically competed with DIC protein for binding to DLC8 (Fig. 2 D). As a negative control, an 11-residue peptide containing a partial Tctex-1-binding domain of DIC (amino acid sequence LGRRLHKLGVS) was found not to compete with DIC for binding to DLC8 (data not shown and Ref. 28Mok Y.-K. Lo K.W.-H. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 14067-14074Google Scholar). The results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that the 11-residue peptide fragment (residues 147–157) of DIC is sufficient to bind to DLC8. Is this 11-residue fragment in DIC the only binding site for DLC8? To address this question, we disrupted the 11-residue DLC8-binding site by deleting residues 151–155 (KETQT) of DIC. This deletion mutant did not bind to DLC8, indicating that the 11-residue peptide fragment mapped in this study is the only DLC8-binding site in DIC (Fig. 3). To identify additional proteins that interact with DLC8, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using DLC8 as bait with both human and mouse brain cDNA libraries. A large number of specific interactors were isolated in the screen (see a partial list in TableI), many of which represent previously unidentified, potential DLC8-binding partners. We focus on a subset of the genes in Table I to study their interaction with DLC8. The first gene we chose was clone 82 (c82), because the full-length sequence of c82 was recently deposited in GenBankTM. The fragment isolated from the two-hybrid screen encodes the C-terminal half of the c82 protein (residues 119–199). The interaction between c82 and DLC8 was confirmed in vitro using purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 4). Using a series of deletion mutants, the DLC8-binding domain of c82 was mapped to a 14-residue peptide fragment with amino acid sequence159VGMHSKGTQTAKEE172 (Fig. 4). The cDNA fragment of BS69 isolated from the DLC8 two-hybrid screen encodes amino acid residues 396–424 of the protein. GST-fused BS69-(396–424) robustly bound to DLC8 in vitro, indicating that the DLC8-binding region in BS69 is contained within this 29-amino acid segment (Fig.5 A). A stretch of amino acids similar to the DLC8-binding regions of DIC and c82 was noted within this 29-residue fragment, as was410MLHRSTQTTN419. The proapoptotic protein Bim was previously shown to interact specifically with DLC8, and the DLC8-binding domain was mapped to a region of ∼30 amino acid residues that were absent in the short form (BimS) of the alternatively spliced gene product (13Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 3: 287-296Google Scholar). We confirmed this interaction between BimL and DLC8 in vitro using purified recombinant proteins (Fig.6 A). Additionally, we synthesized three overlapping peptides to map the minimal DLC8-binding domain of BimL (Fig. 6 B). NMR titration of15N-labeled protein showed that all three peptides bound to the protein in an essentially identical manner (data not shown). The shortest peptide used in this experiment contains only nine amino acid residues (MSCDKSTQT). The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of this 9-residue peptide-bound form of DLC8 is shown in Fig. 6 B; the data suggest that this 9-residue peptide forms a stable complex with DLC8 (18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). We aligned the amino acid sequences of the DLC8-binding domains of various targets mapped in this study (Fig.7). In this alignment, we also included putative DLC8-binding domains of Swallow and rabies virus P protein, two recently identified DLC8-binding proteins (14Schnorrer F. Bohmann K. Nusslein-Volhard C. Nat. Cell Biol... 2000; 2: 185-190Google Scholar, 21Raux H. Flamand A. Blondel D. J. Virol... 2000; 74: 10212-10216Google Scholar, 22Jacob Y. Badrane H. Ceccaldi P.E. Tordo N. J. Virol... 2000; 74: 10217-10222Google Scholar). The (K/R)XTQT motif was present in each of these DLC8 interactors and probably represents the consensus DLC8-binding sequence of these proteins (Fig. 7). To gain more insights into the interaction between DLC8 and the (K/R)XTQT motif, we mutated each consensus amino acid in the motif and assayed for the effect. To facilitate the binding assay, we fused the DLC8-binding domain of DIC with GST. In GST pull-down assays, mutation of the Gln residue in the (K/R)XTQT motif to either Ala or Gly completely abolished binding of the peptide to DLC8 (Fig.8 B). Mutation of either Thr residue in the motif to Gly also abolished interaction between the peptide and DLC8. Mutation of the first Thr (N-terminal to the Gln) to Ala greatly inhibited the binding, suggesting that the hydroxyl group of the Thr plays an active role in the complex formation. Mutation of the second Thr to Ser also significantly weakened the interaction, pointing to a possible role of the methyl group in the Thr side chain in peptide-DLC8 complex formation. Mutations of the Lys residue to a neutral Ala or a negatively charged Glu weakened the binding of the peptide to DLC8. However, the magnitude of the inhibition by the Lys mutations was lower than those observed with other point mutations. Taken together, the data in Fig. 8 indicate that all four consensus amino acid residues in the (K/R)XTQT motif play active roles in supporting productive complex formation between DLC8 and its target peptides. The data also indicate that the Thr-Gln-Thr tripeptide is likely to play a more dominant role in the peptide-DLC8 interaction. As a multicomponent macromolecular complex, precise organization of various subunits of the dynein complex is essential for the motor to function properly. Recent molecular analysis of the cytoplasmic dynein complex has provided a detailed picture of the assembly of the DHC, DIC, and DLIC subunits in the motor complex (23Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15447-15453Google Scholar, 24Tynan S.H. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 32769-32774Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the assembly of the light chains. Both cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins share the highly conserved DLC8. InChlamydomonas outer arm dynein, DLC8 was suggested to associate with the intermediate chains of the motor complex (7Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 1986; 6: 510-520Google Scholar). By analogy, it was suggested that DLC8 is also assembled into the cytoplasmic dynein by binding to DIC subunits of the motor complex (8King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 19358-19366Google Scholar), although the flagellar and cytoplasmic DICs share limited sequence identity (particularly in the N-terminal half of the proteins). Using purified recombinant proteins, we show here that DLC8 can indeed bind to the full-length intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein (Fig. 1). An 11-residue fragment in the N-terminal half of DIC is necessary and sufficient for binding to DLC8. Our data is consistent with an earlier observation that DLC8 and DIC exist at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio in cytoplasmic dynein (8King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 19358-19366Google Scholar). Mammalian DIC is encoded by two different genes, and each gene generates multiple protein products by alternative splicing (4Vaughan K. Vallee R. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 131: 1507-1516Google Scholar, 26Susalka S.J. Hancock W.O. Pfister K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1496: 76-88Google Scholar). The 11-residue DLC8-binding domain of mouse DIC mapped in this study contains the amino acid sequence148VSYSKETQTPL157, and this fragment is located C-terminal to the second alternative splicing site of DIC. Within this 11-residue fragment, the 5-residue KETQT motif is likely to be responsible for the interaction of DIC to DLC8 (Figs. 6 and 8; see also Ref. 18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). This 5-residue KETQT motif is present in all splice isoforms of both DIC gene products. Furthermore, the KETQT motif is highly conserved in cytoplasmic DICs throughout evolution (27Nurminsky D.I. Nurminskaya M.V. Benevolenskaya E.V. Shevelyov Y.Y. Hartl D.L. Gvozdev V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1998; 18: 6816-6825Google Scholar). Given the fundamental roles that DLC8 plays in dynein motor function (9Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 141: 979-992Google Scholar, 10Beckwith S.M. Roghi C.H. Liu B. Ronald Morris N. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 143: 1239-1247Google Scholar), it might be expected that the DLC8-binding site should always remain available in various forms of DIC (and hence the dynein complex). We further note that the DLC8-binding domain does not overlap with the dynactin- and Tctex-1-binding sites of DIC, because dynactin binds to the first 120-amino acid residue fragment of DIC (4Vaughan K. Vallee R. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 131: 1507-1516Google Scholar, 28Mok Y.-K. Lo K.W.-H. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 14067-14074Google Scholar). If DLC8 indeed acts as a dynein cargo adaptor, a single dynein complex may thus interact simultaneously with multiple cargoes. The amino acid sequence of DLC8 is highly conserved throughout evolution, and the protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. As such, DLC8 was proposed to be a multifunctional regulatory protein, in addition to functioning as a light chain of the dynein complex (11Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science.. 1996; 274: 774-777Google Scholar, 12Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Li M. Tochio H. Yamazaki T. Shimizu M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 33472-33481Google Scholar, 25Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 20929-20935Google Scholar). To gain more insights into the range of proteins that interact with DLC8, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using DLC8 as bait. No obvious amino acid sequence homology or functional relationship can be identified among the proteins listed in Table I or among other proteins previously identified as binding to DLC8. Given that DLC8 can bind to short peptide fragments of ∼10 amino acid residues (12Fan J.S. Zhang Q. Li M. Tochio H. Yamazaki T. Shimizu M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 33472-33481Google Scholar, 17Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1999; 6: 735-740Google Scholar, 18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar), we performed detailed mapping analysis of DLC8-binding domains in several additional DLC8-binding proteins either identified from our yeast two-hybrid screen (c82 and BS69) or previously discovered (Bim). The DLC8-binding domains of these proteins are contained within short stretches of amino acids (9–29 amino acid residues). Sequence alignment analysis of the DLC8-binding domains immediately suggests that the 5-residue (K/R)XTQT sequence is a common DLC8 recognition motif in target proteins (Fig. 7). We also predict that DLC8 is likely to bind to Swallow via the291KATQT295 sequence immediately C-terminal to the coiled-coil domain of Swallow. Our prediction is consistent with experimental data showing that the DLC8-binding domain lies within amino acid residues 197–295 of Swallow (14Schnorrer F. Bohmann K. Nusslein-Volhard C. Nat. Cell Biol... 2000; 2: 185-190Google Scholar). Recently, DLC8 was shown to interact with rabies virus P protein (the α subunit of RNA polymerase) via residues 138–172 of P protein (21Raux H. Flamand A. Blondel D. J. Virol... 2000; 74: 10212-10216Google Scholar, 22Jacob Y. Badrane H. Ceccaldi P.E. Tordo N. J. Virol... 2000; 74: 10217-10222Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of P proteins from various strains of rabies virus showed that all contain a conserved KSTQT motif at the center of the protein. We suggest that DLC8 binds to P protein via this KSTQT motif. In the protein data base there are a large number of additional viral proteins containing a potential DLC8-binding (K/R)XTQT motif. For example, poly(A) polymerase catalytic subunit from vaccinia virus contains a 84KQTQT88 motif. Human papillomavirus probable E4 protein contains a KQTQT motif in its N terminus. Several viral proteases (e.g. human adenovirus endoprotease and Haemophilus influenzaeimmunoglobulin A1 protease precursor) contain potential DLC8-binding KSTQT motifs. It is possible that DLC8 is responsible for dynein-mediated retrograde transport of these viral proteins along microtubules in infected cells (e.g. retrograde axonal transport of viral proteins in virus-infected neurons). It is important to point out that the (K/R)XTQT motif is not the only DLC8 recognition sequence in target proteins. For example, the amino acid sequence of the DLC8-binding domain of nNOS is clearly different from the (K/R)XTQT motif (Fig. 7). We were not able to find a (K/R)XTQT motif in a number of other known DLC8-binding proteins including myosin V, GKAP, AIBC1, and KIAA0710. We showed earlier that DLC8 binds to a (K/R)XTQT motif-containing peptide and a peptide encompassing the DLC8-binding domain of nNOS with remarkably similar mechanisms, although the two peptides share little amino acid sequence identity (18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). We have also shown that the structural and dynamic properties of the target-binding site of DLC8 is uniquely suited to bind to peptide fragments with diverse amino acid sequences without sacrificing target binding specificity and affinity. 2J.-S. Fan, Q. Zhang, H. Tochio, and M. Zhang, submitted for publication. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that DLC8 can bind a number of other target proteins, even though these proteins do not contain a (K/R)XTQT motif. We would also like to emphasize that the DLC8-binding proteins listed in Table I are only potential DLC8 targets, because we only used partial fragments of the proteins for binding studies. Further in vitro and in vivostudies are required to substantiate whether these proteins are genuine DLC8-binding targets under physiological conditions. Our earlier structural studies showed that the (K/R)XTQT motif forms a β-strand structure in the DLC8-target peptide complex (Fig. 8 C; see also Ref. 18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). To establish a better structure-function relationship of the (K/R)XTQT motif-mediated DLC8 binding, the four conserved residues in the motif were systematically mutated. The structure of the DLC8 complexed with a (K/R)XTQT motif-containing peptide suggested that the binding affinity of the peptide to DLC8 is due to a combination of backbone hydrogen bonding and a number of hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions between the side chains of the peptide and DLC8 (18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). For example, strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between the side chain of the Gln residue in the peptide and side chains of Glu35 and Lys36 of DLC8 were observed. Mutation of the Gln to Ala, which eliminates the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the side chain of this amino acid residue, completely abolished peptide binding to DLC8 (Fig. 8). We believe that the Gln residue plays a central role in promoting the formation of the peptide-DLC8 complex. Structure-based sequence alignment of the nNOS peptide and the (K/R)XTQT motif peptide showed that a Gln residue in the nNOS peptide occupies the same position as the Gln residue in the (K/R)XTQT peptide upon formation of complexes with DLC8 (18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). The total loss of the interaction observed in the individual Thr to Gly mutations is probably a combination of the loss of side chain interactions between the peptide and DLC8 and destabilization of the backbone β-strand structure of the peptide. Mutations of the Lys residue to either Ala or Glu lead to somewhat decreased binding affinity between the peptide and DLC8, suggesting that the Lys residue in this position has a relatively small contribution to the binding affinity of the peptide. The mutagenesis study reinforces our earlier conclusion that the interactions between DLC8 and the (K/R)XTQT motif-containing peptide are dominated by a combination of side chain and backbone hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions (18Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that DLC8 binds to the N-terminal domain of cytoplasmic DIC via a highly conserved (K/R)XTQT motif. The data firmly establish that DLC8 is assembled into the cytoplasmic dynein by binding to its intermediate chain located at the base of the motor complex. In addition, we further show that the (K/R)XTQT motif represents a general DLC8 recognition sequence in its diverse target proteins. The experimental data presented in this work, together with our earlier structural studies, reinforce the hypothesis that DLC8 probably acts as a multifunctional regulatory protein by binding to a large number of functionally unrelated proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2041097342,"The C terminus of the human V2 vasopressin receptor contains multiple phosphorylation sites including a cluster of amino acids that when phosphorylated prevents the return of the internalized receptor to the cell surface. To identify the step where the recycling process was interrupted, the trafficking of the V2 receptor was compared with that of the recycling V1a receptor after exposure to ligand. Initially, both receptors internalized in small peripheral endosomes, but a physical separation of their endocytic pathways was subsequently detected. The V1a receptor remained evenly distributed throughout the cytosol, whereas the V2 receptor accumulated in a large aggregation of vesicles in the proximity of the nucleus where it colocalized with the transferrin receptor and Rab11, a small GTP-binding protein that is concentrated in the perinuclear recycling compartment; only marginal colocalization of Rab11 with the V1a receptor was observed. Thus, the V2 receptor was sequestered in the perinuclear recycling compartment. Targeting to the perinuclear recycling compartment was determined by the receptor subtype and not by the inability to recycle, since the mutation S363A in the phosphorylation-dependent retention signal generated a V2 receptor that was recycled via the same compartment. The perinuclear recycling compartment was enriched in β-arrestin after internalization of either wild type V2 receptor or its recycling mutant, indicating that long term interaction between the receptors and arrestin was not responsible for the intracellular retention. Thus, the fully phosphorylated retention domain overrides the natural tendency of the V2 receptor to recycle and, by preventing its exit from the perinuclear recycling compartment, interrupts its transit via the “long cycle.” The data suggest that the inactivation of the domain, possibly by dephosphorylation, triggers the return of the receptor from the perinuclear compartment to the plasma membrane.

Vasopressin (1Krisch B. Feindt J. Mentlein R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is a small peptide hormone recognized by three different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 of which the V1a and V1b subtypes are coupled by Gq/11 and the V2 is coupled to Gs. Interaction with the agonist instantly leads to GPCR activation, phosphorylation, desensitization, and sequestration, followed by the return of the dephosphorylated receptors to the cell surface. In a few exceptions, the internalized receptor is degraded in the lysosomal compartment. The pathway by which GPCRs are recycled is under intense study, and an increasing number of elements specific for the receptor or the cell type have been identified, although little is known about how the different pathways and organelles are involved. The majority of GPCRs internalize via clathrin-coated pits, although some, such as the somatostatin 2 receptor, have been found mostly in uncoated vesicles (1Krisch B. Feindt J. Mentlein R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the case of the β2adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), the endothelin receptor, and the cholecystokinin receptor, an additional internalization mechanism has been described involving caveolin (2Raposo G. Dunia I. Delavier-Klutchko C. Kaveri S. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti E.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chun M. Liyanage U.K. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Once internalized in the different types of vesicles, different receptors can remain separate or join in endosomal compartments (see Refs. 5Gaudriault G. Nouel D. Dal Farra C. Beaudet A. Vincent J.P.

Proteins that are differentially distributed in the intracellular organelles and are present as different isoforms, such as dynamin, arrestins, and Rab GTPases (7Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), could be critical in establishing the traffic pattern followed by a given GPCR in a given cell type. Once endocytosed, trans-membrane proteins can return to the cell surface by at least two different ways: directly from sorting endosomes via the “short cycle” or indirectly traversing the perinuclear recycling endosomes that constitute the “long cycle” (8Trischler M. Stoorvogel W. Ullrich O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4773-4783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus of many GPCRs has been recognized as the major regulatory domain of the protein controlling the efficiency of internalization and other phenomena like desensitization. The human V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) contains multiple phosphorylation sites, since progressive truncations in this region gradually reduced the level of phosphorylation. Receptor desensitization, internalization, and recycling were affected differently, depending on which stretch of amino acids was missing. Phosphorylation sites between positions 345 and 361 (of the 371 V2R amino acids; see Fig.2) appear to regulate the interaction with the internalization machinery, since their removal modifies the extent of receptor internalization (9Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Eberle A.N. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2486-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation sites together with others further downstream, specifically serine and threonine from positions 345–364, create a signal regulating the traffic of the receptor back to the plasma membrane (10Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 2C. Le Gouill, G. Innamorati, and M. Birnbaumer, manuscript in preparation. Although the last three amino acids of the V2R (TSS) are also targets of phosphorylation, no functional changes were detected after their elimination, leaving the role of this cluster yet to be determined. The fate of the intracellularly retained V2R is not immediate lysosomal degradation, since the internalized receptor remains intact for several hours (11Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), creating a puzzle about the identity of the organelle accumulating the receptor. We previously postulated that a deficient phosphorylation step could be responsible for the lack of recycling; however, it remained unclear whether in HEK cells the receptor was deviated to an organelle that is not part of the recycling pathway or whether it was simply trapped somewhere along the route normally leading to the cell surface. The pathway followed by the V2R was compared using confocal microscopy to that of other receptors known to recycle in HEK 293 cells, such as the V1a and the β2-adrenergic receptors (12Innamorati G.

After 2 h at 37 °C, the solution was removed, and the cells were treated for 1 min at room temperature with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS), rinsed twice with D-PBS, and returned to the 37 °C incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7155-7161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). The clone expressing the V2R-S363A was obtained as previously described (10Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The clone expressing β2-AR was a generous gift from Dr. M. von Zastrow (University of California at San Francisco). To examine receptor recycling, cells were plated 24 h after transfection in polylysine-coated 24-well plates (1.5–2.5 × 105cells/well). The following day, cells were treated with 100 nm AVP (or vehicle) for 20 min at 37 °C to promote V2R sequestration. The hormone remaining on the cell surface was removed by two washes with D-PBS, two washes with 150 mm NaCl plus 5 mm acetic acid, and three washes with D-PBS, all at 4 °C. Fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were returned to the 37 °C incubator. Hormone binding was measured at the indicated time of recovery, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold D-PBS before adding 0.5 ml of an ice-cold binding mixture containing 25 nm [3H]AVP in D-PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 2 mmMgCl2. After a 2-h incubation in the cold room, the binding mixture was removed by aspiration, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold D-PBS, and 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH was added to extract bound radioactivity. After 30 min at 37 °C, the fluid from each well was transferred to a scintillation vial containing 3.5 ml of Ultima-Flo M scintillation fluid (Packard) for radioassay. Nonspecific binding was determined under the same conditions in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled AVP. Each experimental point was assayed in triplicate; the data presented are the mean ± S.E. of four experiments. Transfected cells were seeded on glass coverslips and treated as described in the figure legends. Receptors with an extracellular epitope were labeled by anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies unmodified or directly coupled to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) under nonpermeabilizing conditions. Treatments with antibodies or with hormone were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, at the temperatures indicated in the figure legends. Cells were fixed for 30 min with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde pH 7.4 in D-PBS. When necessary, nonpermeabilized cells were incubated with the primary polyclonal antibody for 2 h at room temperature, followed by a 30-min incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy utilizing the Carl Zeiss Laser Scanning System LSM 510. Previous experiments showed that serines located at the C terminus are essential for the existence of a domain retaining the internalized V2R inside the cell. Substituting the C terminus with the homologous portion of the V1a receptor (V1aR) resulted in a chimeric V2/V1a receptor that was still coupled to Gs (15Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After efficient ligand-promoted internalization, the chimeric receptor recycled to the cell surface with an even higher efficiency than the wild type V1aR (Figs. 2 and 10). The complementary V1a/V2R chimera, created by substituting the V2R C terminus for the tail of the V1aR, coupled to Gq and was internalized to the same extent as either wild type receptor; however, its return to the cell surface was greatly impaired, leaving the receptor trapped inside the cell as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, the predisposition of the V1a receptor to recycle was suppressed by a retention domain entirely confined to the C terminus. The exact amino acid composition of the signal remains to be defined; single point mutations like serine 357 to alanine also produced a fully recycling and partially (90% of WT) phosphorylated receptor,2 expanding the domain beyond the three serines (362) initially identified (10Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In general, preventing the full phosphorylation of the retention domain yields a recycling V2R that traffics in a manner that is indistinguishable from the V1aR or any other recycling receptor when analyzed by radioligand binding assay. To learn about the nature of the subcellular structures trapping the V2R, its intracellular course was examined by immunocytochemistry. The pathways followed by epitope-tagged V1aR and V2R were compared employing two previously characterized stably transfected HEK 293 clones (12Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7155-7161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, no endocytosis was observed at 4 °C for either AVP receptor in the absence or presence of hormone. As illustrated in Fig. 3, increasing the temperature to 16 °C allowed the formation of agonist-induced clusters of intense immunoreactivity likely to correspond to clathrin-coated pits filled with receptors still at the cell surface, as reported for the β2-AR (6Cao T.T. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The subsequent endocytic process was strictly temperature-dependent for the V1a and the V2 receptors, since it was blocked below 20 °C even in the presence of saturating concentrations of ligand. In the absence of AVP, increasing the temperature to 37 °C prompted a slow constitutive internalization component for both receptor subtypes as illustrated in the middle panel of Fig. 3 for the V1a receptor. This hormone-independent endocytosis was not triggered by the presence of the antibody, since the number of [3H]AVP binding sites on the cell surface remained unchanged before and after exposure of the cells to the monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 37 °C (data not shown). For the V1a and V2 receptors, the fraction internalized at 37 °C was dramatically increased by the presence of 100 nm AVP. After 60 min of hormone treatment, the majority of the V2R was concentrated in a very large endosomal compartment in close proximity to the nucleus, whereas the V1aR was distributed in smaller cytosolic endosomes as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The phenomenon was analyzed in further detail by time lapse confocal microscopy; the video showed the formation of small vesicles containing V2R that were initially dispersed throughout the periphery of the cell and later moved toward a single “aggregation point.” To directly compare the distribution of the recycling V1aR and the nonrecycling V2R in the same cell, both receptors were tagged with different epitopes, transiently cotransfected, and visualized after a 60-min treatment with 100 nm AVP at 37 °C. Fig.5 shows the images obtained with two representative cells. Similar to the results obtained with stable clones (shown above), the internalized V2R accumulated in a perinuclear vesicular aggregate. By overlaying the staining corresponding to the V1a and the V2 receptors, some degree of colocalization was observed at the plasma membrane and in a number of vesicles present only at the periphery of the perinuclear aggregate. The intracellular localization of the vasopressin receptors was compared with that of the transferrin (Tfn) receptor (TfnR), a membrane protein with a well characterized intracellular pathway. Stably transfected cells expressing the V1aR or the V2R were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, in the presence of fluorescently labeled Tfn and 100 nm AVP, fixed, and observed with the confocal microscope. As shown in Fig. 6, some staining corresponding to either the V1a or the Tfn receptors was scattered throughout the cytosol, while a small proportion of the V1aR was localized to the periphery of a bulky assembly in the proximity of the nucleus, where the majority of the TfnR was concentrated. The V1aR appeared excluded from the inner core of this compartment that could therefore represent a subsequent step reached by the TfnR after traversing common early endosomes, possibly the same endosomes where, as shown in Fig. 5, the V1aR merged with the V2R. In contrast, most of the V2R was found in the same compartment where the majority of TfnR accumulated. An endosomal subcompartment called the pericentriolar or perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC) has been described as an organelle formed by tubulo-vesicular structures that gather recycling molecules directed to the plasma membrane once they have been separated from their cargo headed for the lysosomes (16Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Rab11, a small GTP-binding protein, has been found mainly associated with the PNRC by Trischler et al. (8Trischler M. Stoorvogel W. Ullrich O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4773-4783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others. As illustrated in Fig.7, staining with a polyclonal antibody specific for Rab11 (17Ren M. Xu G. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) demonstrated an extensive colocalization with the V2R in the large juxtanuclear structure thus identified as the PNRC. In parallel experiments, the distribution of the V1a and the β2-adrenergic receptors was compared with that of Rab11. For the β2-AR, only marginal colocalization was observed in vesicles appearing as smaller endosomes surrounding the PNRC. The V1aR was practically absent from the PNRC. To examine whether trapping of the V2R inside the cell was related to targeting to the PNRC, the endocytic pathway of a recycling mutant V2R (V2R-S363A) was characterized. Compared with the WT receptor, this mutant was expressed at the same level, phosphorylated 90% as much, and fully active in terms of G protein coupling (10Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similarly to the V1a and V2 receptors, the V2R-S363A was constitutively internalized at a low rate when incubated at 37 °C in the absence of hormone (Fig. 8). Exposure to 100 nm AVP increased its internalization and resulted in an intracellular distribution that resembled the WT V2R rather than the V1a or the β2-adrenergic receptors. Most of the internalized V2R-S363A converged to a single large area in the proximity of the nucleus, where it colocalized with Rab11 in the PNRC. The staining of the V2R-S363A in the PNRC seemed less dense than the WT staining, possibly due to the continuous recycling of the protein. Likewise, the mutant receptor was also detected in many small peripheral fluorescent endosomes. It has been suggested that a strong and long term interaction with β-arrestin protects the phosphorylated sites from phosphatases and is responsible for the nonrecycling of the V2R (13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Thus, a lasting colocalization of the receptor with this adaptor protein would have been expected only with the WT and not with the recycling V2R-S363A mutant. To verify this prediction, a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of β-arrestin was used to examine its location after ligand-mediated internalization. An immunoblot against an HEK cell lysate, shown in Fig. 9 A, indicated that the antibody detected both isoforms of the endogenous protein. Surprisingly, as depicted in Fig. 9 B, after 60 min of hormone treatment, β-arrestin was present in the PNRC region, where it colocalized with both the WT and V2R-S363A receptors. In parallel experiments, the V1a and the β2-adrenergic receptors failed to colocalize with arrestin that was found dispersed throughout the cytosol, as previously described for many receptors (7Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Similar to the V1aR, most of the GPCRs expressed in HEK 293 cells return to the cell surface after ligand-induced internalization. This process is likely to involve repeated recycling as demonstrated under similar conditions for the β2-AR (18Morrison K.J. Moore R.H. Carsrud N.D. Trial J. Millman E.E. Tuvim M. Clark R.B. Barber R. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 692-699PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no recycling was observed for the human V2R expressed in the same cell line, as well as in COS M6, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and HeLa cells. Since the internalized protein remained intact for hours, direct targeting to lysosomes was excluded (11Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To compare the intracellular distribution of internalized V2R to a recycling receptor, epitope-tagged V1a and V2 vasopressin receptors expressed in HEK cells were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The spontaneous and the ligand-promoted internalization of both receptors were temperature-dependent processes. This is common among GPCRs, but it is not typical of all endocytic processes; for example, Cao et al. (6Cao T.T. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) reported receptor-mediated Tfn internalization in HEK 293 cells at 16 °C, while agonist-bound β2-AR remained on the cell surface. Ligand-mediated internalization at 37 °C induced the colocalization of the two AVP receptors only in small endosomes. After 1 h in the presence of hormone, a progressive accumulation of the proteins in different intracellular compartments was observed: the V1aR in vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm and the V2R in an agglomeration located in the vicinity of the nucleus. The partial colocalization was not surprising, since the V1a and the V2 receptors are likely to be internalized via the same endosomes by a process that is sensitive to dominant negative arrestins and to the GTPase-defective dynamin (13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The pits collecting the AVP receptors are therefore likely to be the same as those gathering the β2-AR. The latter has also been found in caveolae, like the vasoactive intestinal peptide 1 and the endothelin b receptors. However, internalization of the V2R via caveoli was unlikely, according to Pfeiffer et al. (19Pfeiffer R. Kirsch J. Fahrenholz F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), who failed to detect colocalization of the receptor with caveolin, and according to Chini et al., 3B. Chini, personal communication. who reported the susceptibility of the V2R to Triton X-100 extraction. Using fluorescent AVP as a marker, a previous study examined the intracellular traffic of naturally expressed rat V1aR in A10 cells and pig V2R in LLCPK1 cells. Despite the restrictions in interpretation imposed by the heterogeneity of the cell lines, the intracellular fluorescent pattern of the internalized receptors was also distinct, and the location of both receptors was strikingly similar to what we observed in HEK 293 cells (20Lutz W. Sanders M. Salisbury J. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6507-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Opposite to our observations, this study described a nonrecycling V1aR and a recycling V2R. This discrepancy could be caused by the absence of the serine triplet in this protein (21Gorbulev V. Buchner H. Akhundova A. Fahrenholz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), yet in tissues that naturally express the human V2R, specific factors or phosphatases could turn off the “switch” created by a transient phosphorylation-dependent retention signal (10Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and allow receptor recycling. Accordingly, dephosphorylation has recently been shown to be a requirement for the exocytosis of internalized β2-AR in human epidermoid carcinoma cells A431 (22Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and δ opioid receptor in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells (23Hasbi A. Allouche S. Sichel F. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Landemore G. Polastron J. Jauzac P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 237-247PubMed Google Scholar). By colocalizing the internalized human V2R expressed in HEK cells with TfnR, our experiments confirmed recent data reported by Fahrenholz and co-workers (19Pfeiffer R. Kirsch J. Fahrenholz F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, by utilizing the small GTPase Rab11 as a marker (24Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), our data established the identity of the organelle containing the receptor after AVP treatment as the PNRC. This compartment is known as an intermediate station for the recycling TfnR and other receptors like the EGF and insulin receptors. Thus, the two AVP receptors followed alternative pathways, previously described by other investigators as the “short cycle,” in which receptor molecules return to the plasma membrane directly from the sorting endosomes (25Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Miller K. Nature. 1990; 346: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and the “long cycle,” where the receptors appeared in large vesicles and tubules forming the PNRC in close proximity to the microtubule organizing center (16Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 26Daro E. van der Sluijs S.P. Galli T. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9559-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 27McGraw T.E. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Tooze J. Hollinshead M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 813-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 1, rather than parallel internalization pathways, functional and morphological data have suggested the existence of a complex endocytic network that internalizes different receptors by a variety of specialized vesicles following different routes that can converge or diverge at different points. Differential distribution of internalized GPCRs has been demonstrated in more than one case when comparing the degradative versus recycling pathways (29Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Reaching the PNRC did not assure to the V2R a passageway to the cell surface. As suggested earlier, this could be a consequence of the artificial expression system; however, expression in HEK cells did not induce “misrouting” of internalized V2R to an organelle from which it could not exit. The recycling V2R-S363A mutant proved indeed that the receptor could exit the PNRC once the anchoring domain had been inactivated by dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylation of the β2-AR is initiated in early endosomes (32Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) or perhaps even earlier at the plasma membrane (18Morrison K.J. Moore R.H. Carsrud N.D. Trial J. Millman E.E. Tuvim M. Clark R.B. Barber R. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 692-699PubMed Google Scholar, 32Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Channels. 1997; 5: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas the location of the phosphatases acting on the AVP receptors is unknown. The fact that the recycling mutants are dephosphorylated more efficiently than the wild type links the two events but does not provide a cause-effect relationship between them. If the recycling receptors encounter some of the phosphatases after the PNRC, the blockage will prevent the WT V2R from reaching these enzymes and completing the dephosphorylation process initiated earlier. Alternatively, the loss of phosphate at certain sites might be required, while still in the endosomal compartment, to facilitate the continuation of the process. The cleavage of multiple phosphate groups is unlikely to happen as a single step, and a hierarchical dephosphorylation could be mirroring the stepwise incorporation of phosphates that has been proposed for the reverse process driven by GRKs (35Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The wild type receptor would thus reach the PNRC after incomplete dephosphorylation. Vice versa, the mutants (already lacking phosphates at selected sites) would be better substrates for the phosphatases and, therefore, reaching the PNRC with few or no phosphates would pass through it and finally recycle to the cell surface. Either way, the retention signal acting as an anchor in the PNRC functions as an additional regulatory step at which phosphorylation controls the abundance of receptor available to the hormone and therefore the intensity of the tissue response to AVP. Phosphorylation enhanced the binding of β-arrestins to GPCRs, and it has been suggested that a high affinity interaction between V2R and β-arrestin protected the C terminus from phosphatases, offering a biochemical explanation for the trapping of the receptor (13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, two lines of experimental evidence support a distinction between the binding of the V2R to arrestin and recycling. The first is that the two domains, although partially overlapping, do not coincide; the domain sufficient to determine the lasting interaction with arrestin described by Oakley et al. (13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) did not include amino acids like Ser357 that are part of the retention domain (this report).2 The second is that only the wild type V2R should have manifested a lasting association with arrestin; instead, the recycling mutant V2R also concentrated arrestin in the PNRC, a phenomenon that was not detected with the V1a or the β2-AR. Thus, the translocation of arrestin from the plasma membrane to the organelle, rather than being the determining factor distinguishing recycling from nonrecycling receptors, was dependent on the identity of the receptor protein. In addition to dissociating the long lasting interaction with β-arrestin from the intracellular retention of the WT V2R, these results dispute the hypothesis that stable binding to β-arrestin directs internalized receptors to the lysosomes as proposed by Bremnes et al. (31Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The significance of the translocation of β-arrestin to the PNRC remains elusive and suggests that a better definition of the role of this protein is required, especially in view of its ubiquitous presence inside the cell, nucleus included (37Claing A. Perry S.J. Achiriloaie M. Walker J.K. Albanesi J.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In summary, the data demonstrate that the V1a and V2 receptors, although internalized by the same early endosomes, are routed via two distinct intracellular pathways, namely the short and the long cycle. The long term interaction of the V2R with arrestin was shown to be compatible with receptor recycling via a pathway that includes transit through the PNRC, a step apparently regulated by dephosphorylation of a specific C-terminal domain in the human V2R.

https://openalex.org/W2006783084,"By using the yeast two-hybrid system, we previously isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel member of the multivalent PDZ protein family called MUPP1 containing 13 PDZ domains. Here we report that the C terminus of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2C (5-HT2C) receptor selectively interacts with the 10th PDZ domain of MUPP1. Mutations in the extreme C-terminal SSV sequence of the 5-HT2C receptor confirmed that the SXV motif is critical for the interaction. Co-immunoprecipitations of MUPP1 and 5-HT2C receptors from transfected COS-7 cells and from rat choroid plexus verified this interaction in vivo. Immunocytochemistry revealed an SXV motif-dependent co-clustering of both proteins in transfected COS-7 cells as well as a colocalization in rat choroid plexus. A 5-HT2C receptor-dependent unmasking of a C-terminal vesicular stomatitis virus epitope of MUPP1 suggests that the interaction triggers a conformational change within the MUPP1 protein. Moreover, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B, sharing the C-terminal EX(V/I)SXV sequence with 5-HT2C receptors, also bind MUPP1 PDZ domains in vitro. The highest MUPP1 mRNA levels were found in all cerebral cortical layers, the hippocampus, the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, as well as the choroid plexus, where 5-HT2C receptors are highly enriched. We propose that MUPP1 may serve as a multivalent scaffold protein that selectively assembles and targets signaling complexes.

A 5-HT2C receptor-dependent unmasking of a C-terminal vesicular stomatitis virus epitope of MUPP1 suggests that the interaction triggers a conformational change within the MUPP1 protein. Moreover, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B, sharing the C-terminal EX(V/I)SXV sequence with 5-HT2C receptors, also bind MUPP1 PDZ domains in vitro. The highest MUPP1 mRNA levels were found in all cerebral cortical layers, the hippocampus, the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, as well as the choroid plexus, where 5-HT2C receptors are highly enriched. We propose that MUPP1 may serve as a multivalent scaffold protein that selectively assembles and targets signaling complexes. There is ample evidence suggesting that the function of a receptor is dependent on its specific subcellular localization. Sequence-specific interactions between proteins provide the basis for the structural and functional organization of receptors within cells. For a few members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, these interactions have been described to be mediated by C-terminal interactions with PDZ (PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain-containing proteins. The best investigated example is the β2-adrenergic receptor, which interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF/EBP50) 1The abbreviations used are:NHERFNa+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor5-HT2C5-hydroxytryptamine type 2CPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineVSVvesicular stomatitis virusCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (1Hall R.A.

Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The interaction of NHERF with the β2-adrenergic receptor is mediated via binding of the first PDZ domain of NHERF to the extreme C terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor in an agonist-dependent manner, thereby regulating Na+/H+ exchange (2Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). NHERF has also been described to link proteins with the actin cytoskeleton through association with ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) proteins (3Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In fact, the PDZ-mediated interaction of the β2-adrenergic receptor with NHERF family proteins has been shown to control recycling of internalized β2-adrenergic receptors. Disrupting the β2-adrenergic receptor-NHERF interaction perturbs the endocytic sorting of the β2-adrenergic receptor, resulting in lysosomal degradation (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2C polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline vesicular stomatitis virus 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid C-terminal interactions of G-protein-coupled receptors with PDZ domain-containing proteins extends to a member of the somatostatin receptor family (sst). The subtype sst2 interacts selectively with a highly homologous PDZ domain contained within the protein CortBP1/ProSAP1/Shank2 (5Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol.

Both proteins belong to a common family recently termed Shanks (7Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M.

Weed S.A. Xiong W.C. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). 5-HT2C receptors are broadly expressed in the central nervous system and in the choroid plexus (11Abramowski D. Rigo M. Hoyer D.

Ward H.R. Frazer A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar, 14Murphy D.L. Lesch K.P. Aulakh C.S. Pigott T.A. Pharmacol.

These receptors contain a C-terminal sequence, SSV* (where the asterisk indicates a carboxyl group), corresponding to the T/SXV* motif. This motif is potentially implicated in protein-protein interactions with PDZ domains as originally described for the C termini of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and K+ channel subunits (18Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 19Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The T/SXV* motif is also present in C termini of various other G-protein-coupled receptors, including the 5-HT2A (18Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar) and human 5-HT2B receptors. By virtue of its interaction with the C terminus of the 5-HT2C receptor, we recently isolated a novel cDNA encoding MUPP1, a protein with 13 PDZ domains (20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). MUPP1 belongs to the family of multi-PDZ proteins comprising CIPP (channel-interacting PDZ domainprotein) (21Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Simpson E.H. Suffolk R. Jackson I.J. Genomics. 1999; 59: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), INADL (INAD-like protein) (23Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and a putative Caenorhabditis eleganspolypeptide referred to as C52A11.4 (20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), containing 4, 7, or 10 PDZ domains, respectively, and no other obvious catalytic domain. PDZ domains highly similar to those of MUPP1 are arrayed in the same order in all four proteins, implying the requirement of a precise arrangement for the assembly into a functional macromolecular complex (20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The present work provides biochemical and immunohistochemical evidence that the 5-HT2C receptor interaction with MUPP1 takes placein vitro and in vivo. Among the 13 PDZ domains of MUPP1, 5-HT2C receptors exclusively interact with the 10th PDZ domain, emphasizing the high selectivity of PDZ domain interactions. Moreover, the interaction induces a conformational change in the MUPP1 molecule and a co-clustering that might trigger a downstream signal transduction pathway. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the CG1945 strain (24Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddel C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) harboring the HIS3and β-galactosidase reporter genes under the control of upstreamGAL4-binding sites (CLONTECH). The yeast culture was transformed using the polyethylene glycol/LiAc method (25Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Interactions between bait and prey were monitored by β-galactosidase activity in colonies transferred onto Hybond N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). To assemble the full-length clone pBSKSII-rMUPP1, a PCR fragment covering region −183 to 2000 with a silent mutation of C1979 to T to delete a BamHI site was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from rat femoral muscle cDNA that was prepared as described (26Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Kalkman H.O. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) using recombinant Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting 5′-end was ligated into the remainingBamHI site of the partial rat MUPP1 cDNA (pXMD1/rMUPP1) (20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). pBSKSII-rMUPP1 was sonicated to an average size of 500 base pairs, and blunt-ended DNA fragments were cloned into theSrfI site of pCR-Script (Stratagene). The inserts of 20,000 recombinant plasmids retrieved by NotI and EcoRI digestion were directionally cloned into the XhoI andEcoRI sites of pACT-2 using NotI/XhoI adapter oligonucleotides. The resulting library was transformed into yeast strain CG1945 carrying pAS2-1/hu2C. pAS2-1/hu2C was described previously (20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid fuses amino acids 369–458 of human 5-HT2C receptors to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) of yeast Gal4 in the yeast expression vector pAS2-1 (CLONTECH). Transformants selected for HIS3 expression were picked after 5 days. Plasmid DNA was extracted, and inserts were retrieved by PCR with plasmid-specific primers, sequenced, and aligned with the rat MUPP1 cDNA sequence. The 90-amino acid C-terminal fragment of the human 5-HT2C receptor was mutagenized by PCR using reverse primers harboring nucleotide exchanges and by using pAS2-1/hu2C as template. The amplified DNA was directionally subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript KSII (Stratagene) and sequenced. The inserts were transferred into either pAS2-1 (BamHI and SalI) or pGEX-3X (BamHI and EcoRI; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mutant plasmid pRK5/h5-HT2C-SSA was obtained by PCR using a reverse primer encoding the V458A mutation by a GCG codon using pRK5/h5-HT2C as template. The partial cDNA of human MUPP1 was amplified by PCR from pACT-2/huMUPP1 (clone 1) (20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and inserted directionally into the HindIII andEagI sites of pBAT (27Annweiler A. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro translation of [35S]methionine-labeled MUPP1 was performed using T3 RNA polymerase with the TNT coupled reticulolysate lysate system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The C-terminal tails of the 5-HT2A (residues 380–471), 5-HT2B (residues 414–481), and 5-HT2C(residues 368–458) receptors were subcloned into pGEX-3X, giving rise to plasmids pGEX2A92, pGEX2B67 and pGEX2C90, respectively. Synthesis of recombinant proteins (GST-2A92 and GST-2C90) in BL21 cells (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was induced by 0.25 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. GST-2B67 was induced by 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C. Cells were sonicated in buffer S (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and pelleted in buffer S, 1% Triton, and 10% glycerol. GST proteins were purified on bulk glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception of using buffer S instead of PBS. GST proteins were eluted with buffer S, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm glutathione and dialyzed against buffer S and 10% glycerol (2 × 3 h at 4 °C).35S-Labeled MUPP1 was incubated in buffer S, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads saturated with 10 μg of GST fusion protein or GST for 3.5 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 1.5 mm synthetic peptide VVSERISSV or control peptide VVSERIASA (B&G Biotech GmbH, Freiburg). Beads were washed four times for 10 min in buffer S, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. pBSKSII-rMUPP1 was cut withEcoRI and XhoI and ligated with a PCR product containing a C-terminal VSV tag flanked by two XhoI sites into pXMD1 (28Kluxen F.W. Bruns C. Lübbert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4618-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), generating pXMD1/rMUPP-VSV. pBSKSII-rMUPP1 was cut with NdeI and SalI and ligated into pCI-neo (Promega) EcoRI and SalI sites using adapter oligonucleotides containing the VSV tag (YTDIEMNRLGK) DNA sequence (TACACCGATATCGAGATGAACAGGCTGGGAAAGTGA). The resulting plasmid, pCI-neo/VSV-ΔMUPP1, fuses the N-terminal VSV tag and amino acids 1337–2055 of the rat MUPP1 protein. pRK5/h5-HT2C was directionally subcloned from pXMD1/h5-HT2C (29Schmuck K. Ullmer C. Probst A. Kalkman H.O. Lübbert H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) by releasing the cDNA insert with the restriction digest enzymesEcoRI and XbaI. Using PCR, the human 5-HT2C receptor cDNA was N-terminally tagged with a stretch of nucleotides (ATGGAACAAAAGCTTATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTG) encoding a 10-amino acid epitope (EQKLISEEDL) of the human c-Myc protein (30Ramsay G. Evan G.I. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA was directionally subcloned into theEcoRI and XbaI sites of pRK5, yielding pRK5/c-Myc-hu5-HT2C. Expression plasmids were introduced into COS-7 cells by electroporation as described (31Claeysen S. Sebben M. Journot L. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in electroporation buffer (50 mmK2HPO4, 20 mmCH3CO2K, 20 mm KOH, and 26.7 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.4)) with 1 μg of pRK5/h5-HT2C and 1.5 μg of pXMD1/rMUPP-VSV. The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 15 μg by filling up with pRK5 DNA. After 15 min at room temperature, 107 cells were transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) and pulsed using a Gene Pulser apparatus (setting at 1000 microfarads and 280 V). Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and plated on 10-cm Falcon Petri dishes or into 12-well clusters. The production, characterization, and purification of the rabbit polyclonal 522 antibody raised against the mouse 5-HT2C receptor have been described (32Abramowski D. Staufenbiel M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody was a gift from B. Mouillac. Rabbit polyclonal anti-MUPP1 antiserum was raised against GST fusion protein containing the third PDZ domain of rat MUPP1 (residues 318–451) (antibody 2324) or amino acids 780–1063 of human MUPP1, containing the region between the fourth and fifth PDZ domains (antibody 2526). 2S. Poliak and E. Peles, manuscript in preparation. The mouse monoclonal anti-VSV antibody was purchased from Sigma. The secondary antibodies used were Oregon green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Rat choroid plexus or COS-7 cells were briefly centrifuged (3 min at 200 ×g), and pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (2.5 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain and 0.5 mm benzamidine (pH 7.4))), homogenized 20 times with a glass-Teflon homogenizer at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. Each membrane pellet was resuspended in CHAPS extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.05 mm EDTA, 10 mm CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture (see above)) for 2 h in rotation at 4 °C. After centrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g), CHAPS-soluble proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μl of anti-5-HT2C receptor 522 antibody, anti-VSV antibody, or anti-MUPP1 antiserum for the immunoprecipitation. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was then rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. After five washes in CHAPS-free buffer, the immunoprecipitates and co-immunoprecipitates were dissociated in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), probed with rabbit anti-5-HT2C receptor antibody or anti-MUPP1 antiserum (1:500), and then detected by enhanced the chemiluminescence method (Renaissance Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 6 h after transfection, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (17 Ci/mol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total inositol phosphate accumulation in response to serotonin in the presence of 10 mm LiCl for 10 min at 37 °C was determined as described (33Berg K.A. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1017-1023PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of [3H]inositol phosphate formed was separated according to the ion exchange method (34Berridge M.J. Dawson C.P. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves, EC50 values, and Scatchard analysis were calculated with Synergy software. Membranes were prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 cells. 6 h after transfection, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were washed twice in PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, harvested in PBS, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 4 min at 200 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.32 msucrose and homogenized 10 times with a glass-Teflon homogenizer at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and stored at −80 °C until used. 5-HT2C receptor densities were estimated using the specific radioligand [N6-methyl-3H]mesulergine at a saturating concentration of 4 nm. Mianserin (1 μm) was used to determine nonspecific binding. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cells were grown on 35-mm dishes, fixed 24 h after transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times in 0.1 mglycine buffer (pH 7.4), and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were washed in 0.2% gelatin and PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted 1:500 in 0.2% gelatin and PBS. Cells were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 0.2% gelatin and PBS. Cultures were washed, mounted on glass slides using Gel Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), and viewed on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 105 cells/well on a 12-well plate, fixed 24 h after transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 4 °C, and washed three times in 0.1 mglycine buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were incubated for 5 min in 3% H2O2 and PBS to minimize endogenous peroxidase activity. The anti-c-Myc antibody (diluted 1:500 in PBS and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) was applied for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Plates were rinsed five times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:250 in PBS and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Plates were rinsed seven times with PBS, and the reaction was developed by adding the substrate ABTS. Absorbance was measured at 410 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Control plates without cells were included to determine background activity, which was subtracted from theA410 readings. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicates. Rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with a fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4). Brains were removed, post-fixed at 4 °C for 2 h in the same fixative solution, and stored overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Sections of 10 μm were cut with a cryostat (Microm HM500), collected on slides, and then stored at −80 °C. Prior to the experiment, sections were rinsed serially for 5 min once with PBS containing 20% sucrose, 10% sucrose, and without sucrose, respectively. Preincubation was performed in 0.25% Triton X-100, 20% horse serum, and PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with either the rabbit polyclonal anti-5-HT2C receptor 522 antibody or affinity-purified anti-MUPP1 2324 or 2526 antibody diluted 1:500 in 1% horse serum and PBS overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in PBS, sections were incubated with donkey Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in 1% horse serum and PBS at 4 °C for 3 h. Sections were rinsed with PBS and mounted on slides, which were coverslipped with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Rats (10-week-old Wistar male adult) were killed by decapitation, and their brains were removed and frozen immediately on dry ice. Microtome cryostat sections (20 μm) were thaw-mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, and kept at −20 °C until used. Hybridization was performed at 60 °C essentially as described (35Bartsch S. Bartsch U. Döries U. Faissner A. Weller A. Ekblom P. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 736-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using radioactive [α-33P]UTP-labeled riboprobes that were prepared as follows. The plasmid pXMD1/rMUPP1 (20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was cut with SmaI to release a fragment of 2669 base pairs covering the region from 4653 to the 3′-end of the rat MUPP1 cDNA, which was ligated into the SrfI site of pCR-Script. For in vitrotranscription, both sense and antisense constructs were linearized withXhoI and transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase. RNA synthesis was performed in a 20-μl reaction with 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, 1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm UTP, 70 μCi of [α-33P]UTP, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), and 20 units of RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Synthesis was continued with the addition of 20 units of RNasin and 20 units of RNA polymerase for 1 h. DNA was digested with 10 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with 5 μl of EDTA (0.5m) and applied to a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RNA was hydrolyzed in 20 mmNaHCO3 and 30 mm NaCO3 for 20 min and neutralized in 3.3 mm HCl. It is evident that PDZ domains display sufficient variability to allow distinct protein-protein interactions (36Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C.

Since rat MUPP1 has 13 PDZ domains, we analyzed the interaction of all parts of MUPP1 with the C terminus of the 5-HT2C receptor. A library of fusion proteins with the Gal4 activation domain was constructed through a random generation of ∼500-base pair DNA fragments by sonication of pBSKSII-rMUPP1. This tagged fragment library was cotransfected into yeast with the vector encoding the C terminus of the 5-HT2Creceptor attached to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and resultant yeast colonies were selected by histidine starvation. DNAs from 13 selected colonies were amplified by PCR with plasmid-specific primers, and the amplified DNAs were sequenced. All sequences shared the entire MUPP1 PDZ10 coding region (Fig. 1), indicating a selective interaction of the 5-HT2C receptor C terminus with PDZ10. The complete PDZ10 domain seems to be required since PDZ10 was complete in all selected clones. Ion channels such as theN-methyl-d-aspartate and Shaker-type K+ channels share a C-terminal T/SXV* motif known to interact with PDZ domains (18Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 19Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The 5-HT2Creceptor has a similar C-terminal SSV* sequence that may define a part of the critical motif for interaction. To determine whether the 3 C-terminal amino acid residues in the 5-HT2C receptor are essential for binding to the PDZ10 domain of MUPP1, mutational analysis was performed in which the residue at each position was replaced with an alanine, and interactions with MUPP1 were tested in the yeast two-hybrid assay. A partial human MUPP1 clone (clone 1) (see Ref. 20Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lübbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) encoding the C-terminal 454 amino acids including PDZ10–13 served as bait. Substitution of Ser456 and Val458 with Ala abolished the interaction with MUPP1 (TableI). In contrast, the conservative mutation of Ser456 to Thr and the mutation of Ser457 to Ala were tolerated, although the resultant yeast clones displayed reduced growth on histidine-lacking medium. To independently demonstrate the interaction of MUPP1 with the 5-HT2C receptor C terminus, fusion proteins of either the wild-type form or various mutants of C-terminal 5-HT2Creceptor sequences (90 amino acids) fused to GST were bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Fig.2A) and incubated within vitro translated 35S-labeled MUPP1 (clone 1, PDZ10–13).

https://openalex.org/W2087018289,"Several observations suggest the existence of potent endogenous suppressors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) production, and inhibitors of serine proteases may participate in this effect. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is the most abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor. Physiological AAT concentrations inhibited HIV-1 production in chronically infected U1 monocytic cells, reduced virus replication in freshly infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and blocked infection of permissive HeLa cells. In U1 cells, AAT suppressed activation of the HIV-1-inducing transcription factor NF-kappaB. Similar results were obtained using CE-2072, a synthetic inhibitor of host serine proteases. HIV-1 did not replicate in blood obtained from healthy volunteers, but marked replication was observed in blood from individuals with hereditary AAT deficiency. These results identify AAT as a candidate circulating HIV-1 inhibitor in vivo. Two different mechanisms of AAT-induced HIV-1 inhibition were identified, including reduced HIV-1 infectivity and blockade of HIV-1 production. A novel host-pathogen interaction is suggested, and an alternative strategy to treat HIV-1-related disease may be possible."
https://openalex.org/W2158383230,"Eotaxin is a potent eosinophil chemoattractant that contributes to the eosinophilia seen in asthma and other allergic disorders. Recent studies have identified human airway smooth muscle (HASM) as a rich source of eotaxin, but the factors regulating its production are poorly understood. Here we describe for the first time that beta2-agonists can inhibit cytokine-induced eotaxin release. We found that TNF-alpha stimulated eotaxin release (assayed by ELISA) from HASM cells and that the release was partially inhibited by salbutamol and salmeterol. The effect of beta2-agonists was mimicked by forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP and potentiated by the cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram, suggesting that it is cAMP dependent. We also found that the cAMP inhibition was likely at the transcription stage, although experiments with the PKA inhibitors H-89 and Rp-cAMP or the PKG inhibitor KT5823 suggested that none of these kinases was involved. Partial inhibition of eotaxin release was also seen with the corticosteroids dexamethasone and fluticasone. The combined use of beta2-agonists, rolipram, and steroids abolished TNF-alpha-induced eotaxin release. These results suggest that the combination of a beta2-agonist, PDE inhibitor, and a corticosteroid may have additive beneficial effects in the treatment of the eosinophilia associated with asthma and other allergic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1979296460,"Leptin resistance has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related complications involving abnormalities of lipid metabolism that resemble those of old age. To determine whether development of leptin resistance in advancing age might account for such abnormalities, we compared the effects of hyperleptinemia (>40 ng/ml) induced in 2-month-old and 18-month-old lean wild-type (+/+) Zucker diabetic fatty rats by adenovirus gene transfer. The decline in food intake, body weight, and body fat in old rats was only 25%, 50%, and 16%, respectively, of the young rats. Whereas in young rats plasma free fatty acids fell 44% and triacylglycerol (TG) 94%, neither changed in the rats. In hyperleptinemic young rats, adipocyte expression of preadipocyte factor 1 increased dramatically and leptin mRNA virtually disappeared; there was increased expression of acyl CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, and their transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, accounting for the reduction in body fat. These hyperleptinemia-induced changes were profoundly reduced in the old rats. On a high-fat diet, old rats consumed 28% more calories than the young and gained 1.5x as much fat, despite greater endogenous hyperleptinemia. Expression of a candidate leptin resistance factor, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), was compared in the hypothalamus and white adipocytes of young and old rats before and after induction of hyperleptinemia; hypothalamic SOCS-3 mRNA was approximately 3x higher in old rats before, whereas it was 3x higher in WAT after, hyperleptinemia. We conclude that the anorexic and antilipopenic actions of leptin decline with age, possibly through increased SOCS-3 expression, and that this could account for the associated abnormalities in lipid metabolism of the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2040213449,"The neuroprotective mechanisms of the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) signaling pathway were studied in primary cerebellar neurons in vitro. When switched from depolarizing culture conditions HK (extracellular K+ 30 mM) to LK (K+ 5 mM), these neurons rapidly undergo nuclear fragmentation, a typical feature of apoptosis. We present evidence that blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels (nifedipine sensitive) but not N/P/Q-type Ca2+ channels (omega-conotoxin MVIIC sensitive) triggered apoptosis and CPP32/caspase-3-like activity. The entry into apoptosis was associated with a progressive caspase-3-dependent cleavage of CaMKIV, but not of CaMKII. CaMKIV function in neuronal apoptosis was further investigated by overexpression of CaMKIV mutants by gene transfer. A dominant-active CaMKIV mutant inhibited LK-induced apoptosis whereas a dominant-negative form induced apoptosis in HK, suggesting that CaMKIV exerts neuroprotective effects. The transcription factor CREB is a well-described nuclear target of CaMKIV in neurons. When switched to LK, the level of phosphorylation of CREB, after an initial drop, further declined progressively with kinetics comparable to those of CaMKIV degradation. This decrease was abolished by caspase-3 inhibitor. These data are compatible with a model where Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels prevents caspase-dependent cleavage of CaMKIV and promotes neuronal survival by maintaining a constitutive level of CaMKIV/CREB-dependent gene expression."

Proteins to be imported into the nucleus contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which interacts with a specific NLS receptor, usually importin-α (16Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Importin α binds to importin-β, which docks the NLS-containing cargo·importin-α/β complex at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore (17Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.

In the present work we show that STAT1 and STAT2 have a structural arginine/lysine-rich element involved in IFN-induced nuclear import. The structural element situates in the DNA-binding domain of the molecule, and two of these elements, one in each monomer, are required for nuclear import, because nuclear import-defective mutant STAT1 proteins inhibit the nuclear accumulation of STAT2 and vice versa.

FITC- and TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were used as secondary Abs (1:200 dilution, Cappel, Organon Teknika Co., West Chester, PA). In Western blotting secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:2000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were used.

The oligonucleotides were annealed, and the resulting double-stranded DNA fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of the pCDNA 3.1(+), to create a vector pCDNA 3.1(+)-FLAG-tag. All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols, and the newly created gene constructs were partially sequenced. Point mutations to the arginine/lysine-rich elements of STAT1 and STAT2 (FLAG-tagged STAT1 and STAT2) in the modified pCDNA 3.1(+)-FLAG-tag expression vector were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

Molecular weight standards were obtained from Sigma. For indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy, transiently transfected HuH7 cells were grown on glass coverslips, either treated with IFN-α (1000 IU/ml) for 45 min or left untreated and performed as described previously (35Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cells positive for FLAG tag were visualized and photographed on a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope or a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope. In some experiments, to better visualize STAT and p48 proteins in immunofluorescence, the cells were primed with IFN-γ (10 IU/ml for 24 h), which is known to up-regulate their expression (34Lehtonen A. Matikainen S. Julkunen I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 794-803PubMed Google Scholar,36Koster M. Hauser H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The transport kinetics of endogenous STAT1 and STAT2 was analyzed by treating HuH7 cells with 1000 IU/ml of IFN-α. As detected by confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 1), nuclear import of both STAT1 and STAT2 could be seen starting at 10 min after IFN-α treatment. The nuclear accumulation was at its maximum within 30–60 min, and the cytoplasmic recycling was completed within 3 h. The kinetics of nuclear transport of STAT1 and STAT2 was dependent on IFN dose, because low doses of IFN-α (1–10 IU/ml) resulted to reduced transport kinetics (not shown). As visualized by confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 2, a andb), in untreated HuH7 cells STAT1 was located evenly in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas STAT2 was predominantly cytoplasmic and no colocalization with STAT1 could be seen in the cell nucleus. 30 min after IFN-α treatment both STAT1 and STAT2 translocated effectively to the cell nucleus and showed marked nuclear colocalization (Fig. 2, c and d). To study the intracellular location of p48 protein, we carried out double-staining experiments in HuH7 cells (Fig. 3). p48 protein was predominantly nuclear already in untreated HuH7 cells, and no detectable change in intracellular distribution was seen after IFN-α treatment. STAT1, instead, was effectively imported into the nucleus and showed marked colocalization with p48 protein 30 min after IFN-α treatment (Fig. 3).Figure 2Confocal images of indirect immunofluorescence staining for STAT1 and STAT2 proteins in untreated and IFN -α-treated HuH7 cells. a, HuH7 cells were left untreated or treated (c) with 1000 IU/ml IFN-α for 30 min and double stained with monoclonal anti-STAT1 Abs, followed with TRITC-labeled anti-mouse Abs (red) and polyclonal anti-STAT2 Abs, followed with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit Abs (green). a andc, focus was adjusted through the center of the nucleus.b, staining profiles of STAT1 and STAT2 in untreated HuH7 cells (white line in a). d, staining profiles of STAT1 and STAT2 in IFN-α-treated HuH7 cells (white line in c).

Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we reasoned that STATs are likely to contain an arginine/lysine-rich element that would be involved in their nuclear import. In most DNA-binding proteins the NLS overlaps or is immediately adjacent to the DNA-binding domain (37LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although STATs do not contain a classic NLS, computer analysis of the STAT1 structure (38Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) revealed a cluster of basic amino acids in the DNA-binding domain of the molecule within the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 4, aand c). This element includes amino acids Arg-378, Lys-379, Lys-410, Lys-413, and Arg-418. All of these amino acids are conserved in STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4 proteins and are mostly conserved in STAT2 (human and pig), which is lacking the lysine corresponding to K410 of STAT1. STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6 are more distantly related to the other STAT molecules (Fig. 4 b), and they lack the basic residues corresponding to Arg-378 and Lys-379 of STAT1. Instead, they have two additional arginine or lysine residues further downstream (Fig. 4 a). To analyze whether this structural site rich in basic amino acids is involved in nuclear import of human STAT1 and STAT2, we made a series of double point mutations and studied the nuclear import of the FLAG-tagged, mutated STAT proteins in transiently transfected HuH7 cells by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.5). HuH7 cells were selected, because they were effectively transfected and possessed excellent cellular morphology in microscopic studies. Although HuH7 cells had their own functional STAT1 and STAT2 proteins, using FLAG-tagged gene constructs, we were able to follow the transport of transfected mutant proteins. To rule out the possibility that the FLAG-tag affected the transport, we also carried out the experiments with influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged STAT gene constructs with identical results (not shown). Weak basal nuclear accumulation of intrinsic (Fig. 1) as well as of transiently expressed (Fig. 5) STAT1 and to a lesser extent of STAT2 was observed in HuH7 as well as in several other cell lines studied. Although FLAG-tagged transiently expressed wild-type STAT1 protein was readily transported into the nucleus after IFN-α or IFN-γ stimulation, all arginine/lysine mutant STAT1 proteins showed impaired IFN-induced nuclear import (Fig. 5). Fig.6 shows the nuclear import of the corresponding STAT forms in a quantitative manner. In STAT1 R378A,K379A and K413A,R418A mutant proteins nuclear import was partially inhibited, whereas STAT1 K410A,K413A protein appeared to be fully nuclear transport incompetent after stimulation with either IFN type (Fig. 5,j, k, l). A revertant, where residues 413 and 418 where mutated back to those of the wild-type STAT1, showed normal IFN-induced nuclear translocation (Fig. 5,p, q, r and Fig. 3). Mutation in tyrosine 701 of STAT1 (STAT1 Y701A in Fig. 5), which has previously been shown to result in lack of tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization (39Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 259: 1808-1812Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar), rendered the protein cytoplasmic. The corresponding mutations in STAT2 molecule showed similar effects to those seen in STAT1 (Figs. 5 and 6). IFN-α-induced nuclear import of STAT2 R374A,K375A and STAT2 R409A,K415A proteins were partially and completely blocked, respectively (Fig. 5, u, v,w, x). It is unlikely that p48 protein, which together with STAT1 and STAT2 proteins forms the ISGF3 complex (4Fu X.-Y. Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8555-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), would be involved in STAT1·STAT2 heterodimer transport, because both transfected as well as intrinsic p48 protein was always found in the nucleus and its cellular distribution was not altered by IFN treatment (Fig. 3). Although the tyrosine phosphorylation site is far from the arginine/lysine-rich element of STAT proteins (Fig. 4 c), we considered the possibility that mutations in the arginine/lysine-rich element of STAT1 or STAT2 proteins would affect their tyrosine phosphorylation properties. Therefore, we transfected HuH7 cells with wt or mutantSTAT genes for 48 h, followed by stimulation with IFN-α for 1 h. Cells were collected, and transgene STAT protein expression was analyzed by anti-FLAG Abs. All STAT1constructs were equally well expressed, and in response to IFN-α stimulation there was a clear increase in the molecular weight of all tested STAT1 proteins except Y701A mutant construct (Fig.7 a). Immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting with anti-P-Tyr Abs, revealed that all STAT forms except STAT1 Y701A were readily tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 7 b). This result suggests that point mutations in the arginine/lysine-rich element do not affect IFN-induced phosphorylation status of STAT proteins. Because STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerize after stimulation with IFN-α, we studied whether the transport-defective STATs inhibit the nuclear import of heterologous STAT molecules. wt and transport-defective STAT proteins were transiently expressed in HuH7 cells, and colocalization of STAT1, STAT2, and p48 proteins was analyzed. IFN-α-induced nuclear import of STAT2 in wt STAT1 transfected cells was readily seen (Fig.8 a), and it was comparable to that seen in Figs. 1 and 5. Instead, the cytoplasmic FLAG-STAT1 K410A,K413A mutant effectively blocked the nuclear import of endogenous STAT2, functioning as a dominant negative molecule in IFN-α-treated cells (Fig. 8 a). To analyze the possible effect of STAT2 expression on IFN-γ induction in HuH7 cells both wt and nuclear transport-defective STAT2 were transiently expressed, and colocalization of STAT1 and STAT2 was detected. Overexpression of both wt and nuclear transport-defective FLAG-STAT2 blocked IFN-γ induction in transiently transfected HuH7 cells (Fig. 8 b). Transiently transfected FLAG-STAT1 Y701A did not inhibit IFN-α-induced nuclear import of endogenous STAT2, suggesting that mutant STAT1 Y701A is incapable of forming dimers with endogenous STAT2 and thus does not block its nuclear import. It is likely that the weak nuclear accumulation of STAT2 was due to the endogenous STAT1 in HuH7 cells (Fig. 8 a). Transiently transfected transport-defective FLAG-STAT2 R409A,K415A, instead, completely blocked IFN-α-induced nuclear import of endogenous STAT1. This suggests that FLAG-STAT2 R409A,K415A mutant protein and endogenous STAT1 formed complexes in the cytoplasm but they were not translocated into the cell nucleus after IFN-α induction (Fig. 8 a). The results suggest that in a heterodimer both arginine/lysine-rich elements, one in each STAT, have to be intact before IFN-induced nuclear import of STAT dimers can take place. To study STAT dimerization and DNA binding in a system lacking intrinsic human STAT proteins we reconstituted STAT activation and DNA binding analysis using a baculovirus expression system. We infected Sf9 cells with STAT1, STAT2, p48, and JAK2 protein-expressing recombinant baculoviruses. Sf9 cells and a baculovirus expression system is selected, because JAK2 kinase has earlier been shown to tyrosine-phosphorylate and activate STAT1 protein (32Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthun B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20775-20780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9 (a and b), wtSTAT1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated, dimerized, and exhibited DNA binding to the GAS oligonucleotide probe in the presence of wtJAK2 kinase, but not with that of knJAK2, as analyzed by gel filtration, anti-phosphotyrosine blotting, and EMSA, respectively. The nuclear import-"

However, no clear link to the insulin signaling events has been identified. Using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that TZD rapidly and markedly increased IRS-2 gene expression. This effect was specific for PPARgamma agonists and was not seen with PPARalpha agonists. It was rapidly induced (within 4 h) and maintained throughout the observation period of 48 h. It was also concentration dependent (EC50 approximately 50 nM) and not inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting a direct effect on the IRS-2 promoter. There was no evidence that TZD altered IRS-2 mRNA stability, supporting that the increased mRNA levels were due to an increased gene transcription. IRS-2 protein expression was increased approximately 30% after 48 h and approximately 50% after 96 h. No effects of TZD were seen on IRS-1, PKB/Akt, or GLUT4 gene expression. TZD also increased IRS-2 mRNA levels in cultured human adipose tissue. These data show the first direct link between TZD and a critical molecule in insulin's signaling cascade in both 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes, and indicate a novel mode of action of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2028650329,"Cystinosis is a lysosomal transport disorder characterized by an accumulation of intra-lysosomal cystine. Biochemical studies showed that the lysosomal cystine transporter was distinct from the plasma membrane cystine transporters and that it exclusively transported cystine. The gene underlying cystinosis,CTNS, encodes a predicted seven-transmembrane domain protein called cystinosin, which is highly glycosylated at the N-terminal end and carries a GY-XX-Φ (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue) lysosomal-targeting motif in its carboxyl tail. We constructed cystinosin-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins to determine the subcellular localization of cystinosin in transfected cell lines and showed that cystinosin-green fluorescent protein colocalizes with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) to lysosomes. Deletion of the GY-XX-Φ motif resulted in a partial redirection to the plasma membrane as well as sorting to lysosomes, demonstrating that this motif is only partially responsible for the lysosomal targeting of cystinosin and suggesting the existence of a second sorting signal. A complete relocalization of cystinosin to the plasma membrane was obtained after deletion of half of the third cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 280–288) coupled with the deletion of the GY-DQ-L motif, demonstrating the presence of the second signal within this loop. Using site-directed mutagenesis studies we identified a novel conformational lysosomal-sorting motif, the core of which was delineated to YFPQA (amino acids 281–285).

Using site-directed mutagenesis studies we identified a novel conformational lysosomal-sorting motif, the core of which was delineated to YFPQA (amino acids 281–285). Lysosomes are a principal site of intracellular digestion in mammalian cells. Extracellular biological materials destined for degradation in the lysosomes are endocytosed and shuttled to the lysosomes via early and late endosomes (1Schekman R. Orci L. Science.. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Google Scholar). In contrast, endogenous cellular structures which are to be degraded in the lysosome are either selectively (chaperon-mediated) or nonselectively (macro- or micro-) transported independently of the endosomes via a process called autophagy (2Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1990; 15: 305-309Google Scholar, 3Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia ( Basel ).. 1992; 48: 158-172Google Scholar). The lysosomal membrane, due to the presence of a H+ pump, is responsible for acidification of the interior and for sequestration of the lysosomal enzymes responsible for the degradation process (4Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1986; 55: 663-700Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lysosomal membrane contains transport proteins that mediate the transport of degradation products such as amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol, where they are excreted or reused by the cell. A defect in either the degradation or transport process can result in an accumulation of the undegraded substrate or the degradation product within the lysosomes, impairing the physiology of the cell and leading to a lysosomal storage disorder. Several such disorders have been described and are usually classified according to the molecule that has accumulated intra-lysosomally (5Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1991; 60: 257-280Google Scholar). Most of these disorders are due to a defect in one of the lysosomal hydrolases; however, a subset exists that arises from a defect in one of the membrane transporters (6Mancini G.M. Havelaar A.C. Verheijen F.W. J. Inherited Metab. Dis... 2000; 23: 278-292Google Scholar). One such example is the autosomal recessive disorder cystinosis (MIM 21980), which is characterized by an accumulation of intra-lysosomal cystine (7Gahl W.A. Bashan N. Tietze F. Bernardini I. Schulman J.D. Science.. 1982; 217: 1263-1265Google Scholar). Various biochemical studies over the years show that cystine transport across the lysosomal membrane is carrier-mediated, that the carrier is located in the membrane itself, and that it is distinct from the plasma membrane cystine transporters (8Gahl W.A. Tietze F. Bashan N. Bernardini I. Raiford D. Schulman J.D. Biochem. J... 1983; 216: 393-400Google Scholar), which in contrast do not exclusively transport cystine (9Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem... 1980; 255: 2372-2376Google Scholar, 10Tate S.S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 1-5Google Scholar). Moreover, the lysosomal cystine transporter is stimulated by the acid pH of the lysosome, which is ATP-dependent (11Gahl W.A. Schneider J.A. Aula P.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease.McGraw-Hill Inc. 1995; : 3763-3797Google Scholar). Cystine is the disulfide of the amino acid cysteine, and cysteine has been found to exit the lysosome freely in cystinotic cells, implying that the cysteine transporter is independent of the cystine transporter (12Pisoni R.L. Acker T.L. Lisowski K.M. Lemons R.M. Thoene J.G. J. Cell Biol... 1990; 110: 327-335Google Scholar). This finding has been exploited for the treatment of cystinosis as the currently used drug, cysteamine, is an aminothiol that reacts with cystine to form cysteine and a cystein-cysteamine mixed disulfide that can also readily exit the cystinotic lysosome (13Thoene J.G. Oshima R.G. Crawhall J.C. Olson D.L. Schneider J.A. J. Clin. Invest... 1976; 58: 180-189Google Scholar). Thus, cysteamine, if used early and in high doses, delays the progression of cystinosis in affected individuals by reducing intra-lysosomal cystine levels (14Markello T.C. Bernardini I.M. Gahl W.A. N. Engl. J. Med... 1993; 328: 1157-1162Google Scholar). We recently identified the gene underlying cystinosis, CTNS, (15Town M. Jean G. Cherqui S. Attard M. Forestier L. Whitmore S.A. Callen D.F. Gribouval O. Broyer M. Bates G.P. van't Hoff W. Antignac C. Nat. Genet... 1998; 18: 319-324Google Scholar) which is composed of 12 exons and extends over 23 kilobases of genomic sequence. The identification of mutations in theCTNS-coding sequence of affected individuals, the most common of which is a 57-kilobase deletion (15Town M. Jean G. Cherqui S. Attard M. Forestier L. Whitmore S.A. Callen D.F. Gribouval O. Broyer M. Bates G.P. van't Hoff W. Antignac C. Nat. Genet... 1998; 18: 319-324Google Scholar, 16Touchman J.W. Anikster Y. Dietrich N.L. Maduro V.V. McDowell G. Shotelersuk V. Bouffard G.G. Beckstrom-Sternberg S.M. Gahl W.A. Green E.D. Genome Res... 2000; 10: 165-173Google Scholar), confirmed this gene as underlying cystinosis. Three allelic clinical forms have been defined based on the severity of symptoms and age of onset (11Gahl W.A. Schneider J.A. Aula P.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease.McGraw-Hill Inc. 1995; : 3763-3797Google Scholar); the infantile form is the most severe and is characterized initially by the appearance of a proximal renal tubule dysfunction at 6–8 months, leading to end-stage renal failure by 10 years of age, and, eventually, by damage to most tissues due to widespread cystine accumulation. The juvenile form is less severe and characterized by a glomerular renal impairment appearing at a later age. Finally, the ocular nonnephropathic form is characterized by the presence of corneal cystine-crystal deposits without renal anomalies. The 2.6-kilobase CTNS transcript encodes a novel 367 amino acid protein named cystinosin, which shows homology with a 55.5-kDaCaenorhabditis elegans protein (C41C4.7) and a yeast transmembrane protein, ERS1 (15Town M. Jean G. Cherqui S. Attard M. Forestier L. Whitmore S.A. Callen D.F. Gribouval O. Broyer M. Bates G.P. van't Hoff W. Antignac C. Nat. Genet... 1998; 18: 319-324Google Scholar). Computer-aided sequence analysis of cystinosin predicts that it is composed of seven transmembrane domains, suggesting that it also is a membrane protein. These domains are preceded by seven potential glycosylation sites at the N-terminal end, characteristic of lysosomal membrane proteins that are highly glycosylated to help protect them from the lysosomal proteases in the lumen (17Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 21327-21330Google Scholar). Finally, following the seventh transmembrane domain is a 10-residue C-terminal tail. Within this tail lies a 5-residue sequence, GY-DQ-L. This sequence is reminiscent of the tyrosine-based sorting motif, GY-XX-Φ (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue), which was identified in the 10–20 amino acid carboxyl tails of lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP)1 -1, -2, and -3 and in lysosomal acid phosphatase and shown to be responsible for their correct targeting to the lysosome (for review see Ref. 18Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays.. 1996; 18: 379-389Google Scholar). Taken together these results suggest that cystinosin is a lysosomal membrane protein. We constructed cystinosin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins and cystinosin-c-Myc epitope-tagged proteins to study the subcellular localization of cystinosin in vitro by transient and stable transfections of various cell lines. This study allowed the determination of the subcellular localization of cystinosin and resulted in the identification of a novel motif required for lysosomal sorting. To create a fusion construct with the CTNS sequence at the 5′ end of and in-frame with theGFP sequence, the CTNS cDNA sequence was polymerase chain reaction-amplified (Advantage cDNA polymerase mix, CLONTECH) using a forward primer situated in the 5′-non-coding region (5′-AGT CTA GCC GGG CAG GGG AA-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GGG GTA CCC CGT TCA GCT GGT CAT ACC C-3′) situated at the end of the coding region, which deleted the stop codon and added a KpnI restriction site. The amplified product was digested by XhoI (situated 250 base pairs upstream of the ATG initiator codon) and KpnI and inserted into theXhoI/KpnI-digested pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) (creating the construct pCTNS-EGFP). Clones containing the CTNS insert were checked by sequencing (Applied Biosystems 373XL). To generate a fusion construct containing the CTNS sequence at the 3′ end of the GFPsequence, the CTNS-coding sequence was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using a forward primer (5′-CCG CTC GAG GGA TAA GGA ATT GGC TGA CTA T-3′), which added an XhoI site and deleted the ATG start codon, and a reverse primer situated in the arm of the λgt10 phage clone containing the CTNS cDNA. The amplified cDNA insert was digested by XhoI andHindIII (situated 303 base pairs downstream of the stop codon) and inserted into theXhoI/HindIII-digested pEGFP-C1 (creating pEGFP-CTNS). As a first step toward fusion of the c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) to the 3′ end of the CTNS sequence, theCTNS cDNA-coding region was amplified using theBamHI-containing forward primer 5′-GGG GAT CCT GAG CTC TGC CTC TTC C-3′ and the XbaI-containing reverse primer 5′-GCT CTA GAG CCA GCC CTG TGT GCC AG-3′, restriction enzyme-digested, and subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA 3.1 Zeo+ (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene) to introduce the c-Myc tag was then carried out on this construct using the primer 5′-TAT GAC CAG CTG AAC GAA CAA AAA CTT ATT TCT GAA GAA GAT CTG TAG CAC CCA GGG ACC-3′ coupled with its reverse complement (creating pCTNS-cMyc). All the modifications of pCTNS-EGFP listed under “Results” were carried out using the Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations and verified by sequencing the region surrounding the introduced mutation. Primers used are not listed here but are available upon request. MDCK and HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Vabliotek), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Confluent cells were passaged the day before transient transfection, and 2 × 105 cells were distributed into 35-mm wells containing 3 sterile glass coverslips. Once cells reached 60% confluency, the supplemented MEM media was replaced by 1 ml of OPTIMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Transfections were carried out with 5 μg of DNA using 12.5 μg of DAC 30 (Eurogentec) in 1 ml of OPTIMEM, and the cells were incubated with the DNA-liposome complex for a minimum of 6 h. Transfected cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), overlaid with supplemented MEM, and left to incubate for 48 h. For the stable transfections, cells were distributed into 35-mm wells without coverslips and treated as above. After the 48-h incubation, the culture medium was supplemented with 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Merck) for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 10 mm NH4Cl for 10 min, washed, and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min. Coverslips were then either RNase-treated for 10 min and the cell nuclei stained with 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for 3 min or incubated with the first antibody for 1 h, washed in PBS, and incubated with the second antibody for 1 h. Finally, coverslips were washed in PBS, incubated with 100 mg/ml diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) for 10 min to maintain the fluorescence, and mounted using Glycergel (DAKO). Stained coverslips were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope equipped with LSM 510 version 2.5 software and Ar/Kr (458 and 488 nm) and 2× He/Ne (543 and 633 nm) lasers with a 100× oil immersion objective. All images correspond to a 1-μm cell section. Photographs were processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.5. For the transferrin internalization studies, transiently transfected HeLa cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 4 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated human transferrin (Molecular Probes) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed, mounted, and visualized as above. The mouse monoclonal antibodies used were as follows: AC17, directed against canine LAMP-2 (19Nabi I.R. Le Bivic A. Fambrough D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol... 1991; 115: 1573-1584Google Scholar), was kindly provided by A.

Secondary donkey anti-mouse antibodies for the immunofluorescence studies conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate or tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and used at a dilution of 1:200. Western blots were prepared from whole cell lysates. 293 cells, non-transfected or transiently transfected with the construct pCTNS-EGFP, were scraped in PBS, centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm at 4 °C, and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mmTris HCl (pH 8), 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mmphenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptine). Cells were lysed for 20 min on ice and centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli's sample buffer and loaded directly without boiling onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. The separated proteins were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad) and, after blocking for 1 h in 0.05% Tween/PBS + 1% polyvinylpyrolidane (Sigma), the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1/1000 dilution of the anti-GFP antibody. After three washes in 0.05% Tween/PBS, the filter was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1/12000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The final detection was performed using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations. TheCTNS-coding region was cloned 5′ to the GFP cDNA in the plasmid pEGFP-N1, generating pCTNS-EGFP. In this orientation, the GFP end of the fusion protein was extra-lysosomal (Fig.1). pCTNS-EGFP was transiently transfected into MDCK and HeLa cells, and the GFP fluorescence signal was observed 48 h post-transfection. In both cell types, cystinosin-GFP was localized to small, discrete intracellular vesicles and occasionally to large vesicular structures (Fig.2 A). No signal could be detected at the plasma membrane or in the nucleus. The same results were obtained upon stable transfection of MDCK cells (data not shown). Immunofluorescence studies using the anti-GFP antibody confirmed that the fluorescent signal did indeed correspond to cystinosin-GFP (data not shown). Moreover, western blot analysis was used to confirm the production of the cystinosin-GFP fusion protein. A major band with an apparent size of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 3) was detected that was higher than the expected size of 67 kDa (cystinosin was predicted to be 40 kDa) and could be explained by the glycosylation of cystinosin via the 7 putative N-terminal glycosylation sites; a smaller band with an apparent size of ∼70 kDa could also be seen that could presumably correspond to the unglycosylated form of the protein. Alternatively, this band could arise from proteolytic cleavage of cystinosin, although no known cleavage sites were detected. These same bands were not detected in nontransfected 293 cells (Fig. 3).Figure 2Subcellular localization of wild-type cystinosin. A, 48 h after transient transfection of MDCK cells with the pCTNS-EGFP construct, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with propidium iodide. The fluorescent signal from the cystinosin-GFP fusion protein can be seen to be localized to small discrete intracellular vesicles and to large vesicular structures. B, MDCK cells transiently transfected with pCTNS-cMyc were treated as above and then incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the c-Myc epitope followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody. The same fluorescence labeling of intracellular vesicles can be seen. Scale bar, 10 μm for all figures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Western blot analysis. Non-transfected 293 cells (lane 1) and 293 cells transiently transfected with the pCTNS-EGFP construct (lane 2) were lysed, and the cleared lysate was loaded on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. After electro-transfer, the filter was incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the GFP tag and subsequently with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody. After immunodetection of the filter and a 10-s exposure to autoradiographic film, two bands could be observed in lane 2, a major band with an apparent size of ∼80 kDa (large arrow), probably corresponding to the glycosylated form of cystinosin, and a smaller band with an apparent size of ∼70 kDa (small arrow). Neither of these bands is detected in lane 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To verify that the fusion of the GFP to the C terminus of cystinosin did not interfere with its native localization, two additional constructs were made. First, the CTNS-coding region was subcloned downstream of the GFP gene in the plasmid pEGFP-C1 (pEGFP-CTNS) such that the GFP of the fusion protein would be predicted to lie intra-lysosomal. However, no fluorescence could be observed upon transfection of this construct presumably due to its quenching by the acidic lysosomal pH (20Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Sharif W.D. Kain S.R. Piston D.W. Biophys. J... 1997; 73: 2782-2790Google Scholar). Second, by site-directed mutagenesis, a c-Myc tag was added to the 3′ end of CTNS in the plasmid pcDNA 3.1 Zeo+ (pCTNS-cMyc), and immunofluorescence analysis with the anti-epitope c-Myc antibody, 9E10, showed the same labeling of intracellular vesicles (Fig. 2 B) as the construct pCTNS-EGFP. To determine whether the labeled vesicles were indeed lysosomes, transfected cells were immunofluorescently labeled using antibodies directed against the late endosomal and lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2. As seen in Fig. 4, in both MDCK (Fig. 4, A–C) and HeLa (Fig. 4, D–F) cells, the cystinosin-GFP signal colocalized with that of AC17, directed against canine LAMP-2, and H4B4, directed against human LAMP-2, respectively. The exact overlap between the LAMP-2 and cystinosin localization patterns demonstrates that cystinosin is a lysosomal protein. Interestingly, the above-mentioned large vesicular structures were also labeled by antibodies directed to LAMP-2 in cystinosin-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that these large vesicles are also lysosomal structures; immunostaining of nontransfected cells with the same antibodies did not reveal the presence of these structures (data not shown). Finally, colocalization studies using fluorescently labeled transferrin uptake ruled out the possibility that cystinosin also localizes to the early endosomes (Fig.4, G–I). Previous studies on other lysosomal membrane glycoproteins have delineated one of the lysosomal-targeting signals as GY-XX-Φ (21Honing S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 128: 321-332Google Scholar). Such a five-residue targeting sequence, GY-DQ-L, exists in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of cystinosin (amino acids 362–366), and it is followed by an N residue. To confirm that the lysosomal targeting of cystinosin is indeed encoded by this signal, we deleted this motif (ΔGY-DQ-L) from the pCTNS-EGFP construct. Although transfection of this construct still resulted in the sorting of cystinosin-GFP to the lysosomes, both to small discrete vesicles as well as to abundant large vesicular structures, as shown by colocalization studies using AC-17 (Fig.5, A–C), a significant signal was also found at the plasma membrane that colocalized with that of the epithelial membrane antigen antibody, EMA (Fig. 5, D–F). These results confirm that the GY-DQ-L motif is involved in targeting cystinosin to the lysosomes. By site-directed mutagenesis, each codon of the lysosomal-targeting sequence was individually mutated to an A residue to determine the critical residues of this sequence. Substitution of the Gly, Asp, or Gln residues for an Ala residue did not alter the lysosomal localization of cystinosin (Fig. 6,A, C, and D). In contrast, mutation of the Tyr or Leu residues resulted in the same localization profile as that obtained when the entire lysosomal-targeting sequence was deleted (Fig. 6, B and E). The Asn residue after the lysosomal-targeting motif was also mutated to Ala to ensure that this amino acid was not part of the targeting sequence. This substitution resulted in the same localization pattern as that seen with the wild type (Fig. 6 F). Taken together these results demonstrate that it is the Tyr and Leu residues of the tyrosine-based sorting motif that are critical for the targeting of cystinosin to the lysosomes. Our mutation analysis of the GY-DQ-L motif demonstrated that it is only partially responsible for the targeting of cystinosin. These data strongly suggested the presence of a second lysosomal-targeting signal. In the first instance, to determine whether the remainder of the cytoplasmic tail, which is not included in the defined targeting signal, may also play a role in lysosomal targeting, the entire cytoplasmic tail was deleted (amino acids 358–367) from the pCTNS-EGFP construct. This resulted in the same subcellular localization of cystinosin-GFP as obtained after deletion of the lysosomal-targeting signal (data not shown). A sequence analysis of the other three cytoplasmic domains was then performed to identify a possible motif resembling one of the documented lysosomal-targeting signals. The third cytoplasmic loop, located between the fifth and sixth potential transmembrane domains, is tyrosine-rich and, hence, seemed to be a good candidate for containing a lysosomal-targeting signal. In the first instance, we deleted the first nine amino acids (amino acids 280–288) of this 19-residue cytoplasmic domain (ΔA) from the construct pCTNS-EGFP and observed the same cystinosin-GFP localization pattern as when the GY-DQ-L motif was deleted alone, with the exception that no large labeled vesicles were seen (data not shown). Subsequently, the remaining 10 amino acids (amino acids 289–298) were deleted (ΔB) from pCTNS-EGFP, resulting in a localization of cystinosin-GFP to the lysosomes but, again, not to the large lysosomal structures without an obvious signal at the plasma membrane (data not shown). Each of these deletions, ΔA and ΔB, was then included with ΔGY-DQ-L in pCTNS-EGFP. Transfection of the ΔA/ΔGY-DQ-L construct resulted in the exclusive localization of cystinosin-GFP to the plasma membrane (Fig.7 A). In contrast, transfection of the ΔB/ΔGY-DQ-L construct gave a similar pattern (Fig.7 B) to that obtained using ΔGY-DQ-L alone, with the exception of the large labeled vesicles. In MDCK and HeLa cells transfected with the construct containing ΔA/ΔGY-DQ-L, there was no longer a colocalization between cystinosin-GFP and LAMP-2 (Fig.8, A–C), whereas there was a colocalization between cystinosin-GFP and epithelial membrane antigen (Fig. 8, D–F). In contrast, in cells transfected with the construct containing ΔB/ΔGY-DQ-L, the cystinosin-GFP signal colocalized with both that of AC17 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), demonstrating that this double deletion still directed the fusion protein to the lysosomes (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the third cytoplasmic loop, in particular the first half, plays a role in the targeting of cystinosin to the lysosome.Figure 8Colocalization studies of cystinosin carrying the deletion of the first nine amino acids of the third cytoplasmic loop and of the GY-DQ-L motif. A and B, MDCK cells transiently transfected with the pCTNS-EGFP construct carrying the deletions ΔA and ΔGY-DQ-L (visualized in green) were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with AC17 (visualized inred). C, a superimposition of A andB shows that the deleted cystinosin-GFP fusion protein and LAMP-2 do not colocalize in canine cells. D andE, HeLa cells transiently transfected with the same construct (visualized in green) were incubated with EMA (visualized in red). F, a superimposition ofD and E shows that the deleted cystinosin-GFP fusion protein colocalizes with the epithelial membrane antigen, demonstrating that this double deletion entirely directs the fusion protein to the plasma membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As seen here and reported by others (22Williams M.A. Fukuda M.

Each of these mutations coupled with ΔGY-DQ-L resulted in the same localization pattern (data not shown) as that observed with ΔGY-DQ-L alone (Fig. 2 A), indicating that this loop does not play a role in lysosomal targeting via a tyrosine-based motif. Subsequently, blocks of four and five amino acids beginning at each of the aforementioned tyrosine residues were either deleted (designated Δa and Δb, respectively, see Fig. 1) or mutated (μa and μb, respectively) and assayed with ΔGY-DQ-L. Transfection of the Δa/ΔGY-DQ-L construct resulted in the same plasma membrane localization of cystinosin-GFP as seen with the ΔA/ΔGY-DQ-L construct (Fig. 9 A), whereas transfection of the μa/ΔGY-DQ-L construct resulted in the appearance of a distinct labeling of the lyso"

However, rather little is known about biological partners of the protein core. The major goal of this study was to identify novel proteins that interact with the protein core of perlecan. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and domain III of perlecan as bait, we screened ∼0.5 106cDNA clones from a keratinocyte library and identified a strongly interactive clone. This cDNA corresponded to FGF-binding protein (FGF-BP), a secreted protein previously shown to bind acidic and basic FGF and to modulate their activities. Using a panel of deletion mutants, FGF-BP binding was localized to the second EGF repeat of domain III, a region very close to the binding site for FGF7. FGF-BP could be coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody against perlecan and bound in solution to recombinant domain III-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed colocalization of FGF-BP and perlecan in the pericellular stroma of various squamous cell carcinomas suggesting a potential in vivo interaction.

Notably, the basement membranes are normally formed in the homozygous null animals, but vascular and cephalic abnormalities are generated in areas of increased pressure, suggesting that perlecan is required for maintaining basement membrane integrity (35Olsen B.R.

Thus, we hypothesized that perlecan deposition in the newly formed tumor stroma may act as a scaffold on which capillaries proliferate to generate new vascular anastomoses (14Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Suppression of perlecan expression blocks autocrine and paracrine activities of FGF2 in human melanoma cells (46Aviezer D. Iozzo R.V. Noonan D.M. Yayon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1938-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and halts melanoma cell proliferation and invasion (47Adatia R. Albini A. Carlone S. Giunciuglio D. Benelli R. Santi L. Noonan D.M. Ann. Oncol. 1998; 8: 1257-1261Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fibrosarcoma cells, however, perlecan appears to act as a negative regulator of growth and invasion (48Mathiak M. Yenisey C. Grant D.S. Sharma B. Iozzo R.V. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2130-2136PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the specific cellular context may play a cardinal role in perlecan's biological function. We have recently discovered (49Sharma B. Handler M. Eichstetter I. Whitelock J. Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Inv. 1998; 102: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that antisense targeting of the perlecan gene correlates with a reduced colon carcinoma cell growth and a markedly attenuated responsiveness to mitogenic FGF7. FGF7 binds specifically to domains III and V of perlecan (50Mongiat M. Taylor K. Otto J. Aho S. Uitto J. Whitelock J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and exogenous perlecan efficiently reconstitutes FGF7 mitogenic activity in perlecan-deficient cells (49Sharma B. Handler M. Eichstetter I. Whitelock J. Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Inv. 1998; 102: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The major goal of this study was to identify novel proteins that interact with the protein core of perlecan. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and domain III of perlecan as bait, we identified a strongly interactive clone that corresponded to HBp17 (51Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also known as FGF-BP (52Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a protein previously shown to modulate the activity of FGF1 and FGF2 to enhance the tumorigenicity of A431 squamous carcinoma cells (51Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to act as a potent angiogenic stimulus (52Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-BP bound specifically to domain III within the second EGF repeat, a region very close to the major binding site for FGF7 (50Mongiat M. Taylor K. Otto J. Aho S. Uitto J. Whitelock J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). FGF-BP could be coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody against perlecan and bound in solution to recombinant domain III-alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion protein. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a significant up-regulation of FGF-BP in various squamous cell carcinomas with a distribution similar to that of perlecan, suggesting a potential in vivo interaction. Therefore, FGF-BP should be considered a novel biological ligand for perlecan, an interaction that could influence cancer growth and tissue remodeling. Media and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). 125I and Hybond ECL membranes were purchased from Amersham. Monoclonal antibodies 7B5 against perlecan domain III (15Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or monoclonal C9 against human FGF-BP (51Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously described. The Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was used to screen a human keratinocyte cDNA library constructed in pGAD10 (complexity ∼5 × 106recombinants) with perlecan domain III. The full-length domain III and the deletion constructs were cloned into pGBT9 and pGAD424 (50Mongiat M. Taylor K. Otto J. Aho S. Uitto J. Whitelock J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and further deletion fragments were generated by endonuclease digestion of the constructs. Competent HF7c cells were prepared and combined with 50 μg each of the library DNA and the domain III construct. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking (200–250 rpm) and then heat-shocked for 15 min at 42 °C and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1 ml of Trp−/Leu−medium with constant shaking. The transfected cells were plated in medium lacking Trp and Leu to obtain an indication of the primary transformation efficiency and on plates lacking Trp, Leu, and His to select for colonies expressing interacting hybrid proteins. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 8 days. The His+ colonies were isolated and screened by PCR for the inserts in the activation domain vector using primers specific for the GAL4 activation domain plasmid. FGF-BP was cloned in the yeast two-hybrid plasmids by PCR amplification, digestion of the PCR product with EcoRI/SalI, and ligation intoEcoRI/SalI-digested pGBT9 and pGAD424 plasmids. Both constructs were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Transformation of the yeast reporter strain SFY526 with all the combinations of hybrid constructs, using FGF-BP and perlecan domain III as both prey and bait and utilizing the various deletion constructs of domain III to specifically map the site of interaction, was performed as described previously (50Mongiat M. Taylor K. Otto J. Aho S. Uitto J. Whitelock J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were plated in Trp−/Leu− and Trp−/Leu−/His− agar plates to check for interactions, analyzed initially by growth in the triple minus media compared visually with that of the positive control. For qualitative β-galactosidase assays, cells grown in Trp−/Leu− plates were transferred onto Whatman No. 3MM paper filters and soaked in Z buffer/X-gal solution (0.1 m Na2HPO4, 45 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, and 3.3 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). Yeast cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 10 s, thawed, transferred onto a filter, and incubated at 30 °C for ∼8 h to visualize the appearance of blue colonies. In addition, the two-hybrid interactions were verified and quantified by liquid assays of β-galactosidase activity using the Luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (CLONTECH). This system uses a chemiluminescent substrate (Galacton-StarTM), and the light emission can be used as a quantitative measure of β-galactosidase activity. Five-ml overnight cultures in Trp−/Leu−medium were transferred to 8 ml of YPD medium and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h with shaking (250 rpm). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 s, and the pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of buffer and subjected to two consecutive freeze/thaw cycles. 25-μl aliquots of each cell lysate were incubated with 200 μl of Galacton-StarTM reaction mixture at room temperature for 60 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were transferred to luminometer tubes. The light emission (measured in relative light units) was recorded at 5-s intervals, and the β-galactosidase activity was normalized on the relative OD, and expressed as relative light units /A600 unit of cell culture. The TNT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) was used for in vitro transcription and translation of FGF-BP and the positive luciferase control. FGF-BP was subcloned from pGAD424 into pcDNA3.1 downstream from the T7 promoter by EcoRI/SalI digestion followed by ligation into anEcoRI/XhoI-digested pCDNA3.1. One μg of the plasmid DNA, 40 μl of the TNT Quick Master Mix, and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine were combined and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. A 5-μl aliquot was resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and loaded on a 6–12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was incubated with fixing solution (40% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid) for 1 h, dried, and exposed on Kodak X-Omat AR film for 6–15 h at room temperature. Perlecan domain III was subcloned by PCR (ExpandTM Template PCR kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGCAATTGCCCTGCCCTGACGGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAATTGTGGGGCTTGGTTTGTCTC-3′, which introduced anMfeI site. The purified digested fragment was ligated into an engineered pcDNA3.1 vector linearized with EcoRI containing the sequence of the human placental AP preceded by the BM-40 signal peptide. The construct was sequenced, and 10 μg of the purified plasmid were used to transfect A431 cells by electroporation (375 V, 490 microfarads, 1 ms). Cells were cultured in G418 (400 μg/ml), and clones were isolated by ring cloning and expanded. Conditioned media from confluent cells were collected after 2 days and assayed for AP enzymatic activity using a SEAP (secreted alkaline phospatase) Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (CLONTECH). The expression of the recombinant RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting and the chimeric protein detected in Western immunoblotting employing a specific antibody directed against domain III. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots of the media containing domain III-AP fusion proteins were brought to 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 200 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, 1 μg of monoclonal antibodies against domain III or FGF-BP was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose-A/G beads (1:1 v/v) were added and incubated for 1 h with shaking, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and washed three times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 200 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The final pellet was boiled in Laemli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Additional details are provided in the text and and the figure legends. Subconfluent cultures of COS-1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 4 μg of perlecan domain III/AP and FGF-BP, both cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing the sequence of the BM-40 signal peptide. After 72 h of incubation, the serum-free conditioned medium was collected and filtered, and various protease inhibitors were added (see above). Two μg of either anti-domain III or anti-FGF-BP antibody were added to 1 ml of medium of transfected and untransfected COS-1 cells, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 18 h with continuous rocking. The immunocomplexes were captured with protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). Samples were analyzed in a 3–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gel under nonreducing conditions and transferred into nitrocellulose. The membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. The lower portion of the membrane (proteins <40 kDa) was then incubated with the anti-FGF-BP antibody and the upper portion with the anti-domain III antibody for 1 h. Membranes were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After three washes, the immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). A survey of normal and neoplastic frozen human tissues, obtained from the Tumor Bank of Thomas Jefferson University, was investigated using monoclonal antibodies C9 against FGF-BP (51Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 7B5 against perlecan domain III (15Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A total of 38 samples was investigated including normal samples of skin, colon, kidneys, brain, tongue, pharynx, and lung. In addition we stained several samples of squamous cell carcinomas from skin, esophagus, tongue, lung and cervix, as well adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder, lung, and kidney. Immunohistochemistry was done essentially as previously described (15Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with minor variations. Routinely, we used primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution and secondary antibodies conjugated with either AP or horseradish peroxidase at 1:2000 dilution. In all cases, the frozen sections were blocked with either lovamisole or H2O2 before the immunohistochemical reaction. Images were captured with a Pixera digital camera and assembled using Adobe Photoshop version 5.0. The yeast two-hybrid system (53Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was used to identify candidate proteins that interact with perlecan domain III in vivo. Before proceeding with the screening, the bait plasmid harboring domain III was tested for its inability to activate the prototrophic reporter gene HIS3. As a control for possible interactions, all constructs were also tested as either bait or prey. In addition, all of the constructs were assayed for growth in double minus (Trp−/Leu−) media as a control for transfection efficiency. The screening of ∼0.5 × 106 cDNAs from a human keratinocyte library resulted in the isolation of 50 independent clones identified as large colonies growing in triple minus (Trp−/Leu−/His−) plates. Of these, 40 clones grew back and 38 clones showed inserts ranging between 0.4 and 1.6 kilobase pair. To minimize the number of false positives and to increase the likelihood of obtaining pure clones, the initial isolates were regrown in triple minus media and subjected to direct PCR screening using flanking primers specific for the pGAD plasmid. All of the bands were isolated and sequenced, and DNA homology searches using the NCBI BLAST program of the Genetics Computing Group package led to the elimination of many false positives, the majority of which were nuclear proteins that could themselves activate the transcription of the HIS3 reporter gene. A highly interacting clone contained a 1.2-kilobase pair insert (Fig. 1 A) that encoded a small protein, named HBp17 (Fig. 1 B) because it binds heparin-binding growth factors 1 and 2 (51Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (also called FGF-BP, for FGF-binding protein (52Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The cDNA was in frame with the activating domain of the plasmid and coded for the full-length FGF-BP, further supporting the concept of a real protein-protein interaction. The full-length FGF-BP cDNA is 1163 base pairs, and the primary structure of the encoded protein consists of 234 amino acids, including a 21-residue signal peptide sequence and a single putativeN-linked glycosylation site. Computer searches revealed that homologues of human FGF-BP have been cloned previously from bovine, rat, and mouse tissues (54Kurtz A. Wang H.-L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A.

https://openalex.org/W1974176915,"Purines such as adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine are known to have potent antiinflammatory effects. These effects generally are believed to be mediated by cell surface adenosine receptors. Here we provide evidence that purines protect against oxidant-induced cell injury by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Upon binding to broken DNA, PARP cleaves NAD+ into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose and polymerizes the latter on nuclear acceptor proteins such as histones and PARP itself. Overactivation of PARP depletes cellular NAD+ and ATP stores and causes necrotic cell death. We have identified some purines (hypoxanthine, inosine, and adenosine) as potential endogenous PARP inhibitors. We have found that purines (hypoxanthine > inosine > adenosine) dose-dependently inhibited PARP activation in peroxynitrite-treated macrophages and also inhibited the activity of the purified PARP enzyme. Consistently with their PARP inhibitory effects, the purines also protected interferon gamma + endotoxin (IFN/LPS) -stimulated RAW macrophages from the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and inhibited nitrite production from IFN/LPS-stimulated macrophages. We have selected hypoxanthine as the most potent cytoprotective agent and PARP inhibitor among the three purine compounds, and investigated the mechanism of its cytoprotective effect. We have found that hypoxanthine protects thymocytes from death induced by the cytotoxic oxidant peroxynitrite. In line with the PARP inhibitory effect of purines, hypoxanthine has prevented necrotic cell death while increasing caspase activity and DNA fragmentation. As previously shown with other PARP inhibitors, hypoxanthine acted proximal to mitochondrial alterations as hypoxanthine inhibited the peroxynitrite-induced mitochondrial depolarization and secondary superoxide production. Our data imply that purines may serve as endogenous PARP inhibitors. We propose that, by affecting PARP activation, purines may modulate the pattern of cell death during shock, inflammation, and reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2037093616,"Cell surface ecto-nucleotidases are considered the major effector system for inactivation of extracellular adenine nucleotides, whereas the alternative possibility of ATP synthesis has received little attention. Using a TLC assay, we investigated the main exchange activities of 3H-labeled adenine nucleotides on the cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Stepwise nucleotide degradation to adenosine occurred when a particular nucleotide was present alone, whereas combined cell treatment with ATP and either [3H]AMP or [3H]ADP caused unexpected phosphorylation of 3H-nucleotides via the backward reactions AMP --> ADP --> ATP. The following two groups of nucleotide-converting ecto-enzymes were identified based on inhibition and substrate specificity studies: 1) ecto-nucleotidases, ATP-diphosphohydrolase, and 5'-nucleotidase; 2) ecto-nucleotide kinases, adenylate kinase, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Ecto-nucleoside diphosphate kinase possessed the highest activity, as revealed by comparative kinetic analysis, and was capable of using both adenine and nonadenine nucleotides as phosphate donors and acceptors. The transphosphorylation mechanism was confirmed by direct transfer of the gamma-phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP to AMP or nucleoside diphosphates and by measurement of extracellular ATP synthesis using luciferin-luciferase luminometry. The data demonstrate the coexistence of opposite, ATP-consuming and ATP-generating, pathways on the cell surface and provide a novel mechanism for regulating the duration and magnitude of purinergic signaling in the vasculature."

The unique thiol metabolism of trypanosomatids in which the nearly ubiquitous glutathione reductase is replaced by a trypanothione reductase prompted us to study the nature of thiols providing reducing equivalents for the parasite synthesis of DNA precursors. Here we show that the dithiol trypanothione (bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), in contrast to glutathione, is a direct reductant of T. bruceiribonucleotide reductase with a Km value of 2 mm.

The genes encoding theTrypanosoma brucei R1 and R21 proteins have been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Class I enzymes are tetrameric proteins composed of two R1 and R2 molecules each. The large R1 protein harbors the active site, as well as regulatory sites, and the small R2 protein contains a μ-oxo-bridged diiron cluster, which represents the Fe(III)–O2−–Fe(III) cofactor in all eukaryotic ribonucleotide reductases, and a tyrosyl radical essential for catalysis (1Jordan A.

Reduction of the 2′-OH group of ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxynucleotides requires external electron donors. For class I enzymes, small thiol proteins with an active site CXXC motif like thioredoxin (CGPC) and glutaredoxin (CPYC) are well known hydrogen donors (7Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Oxidized thioredoxin is subsequently reduced by thioredoxin reductase at the expense of NADPH (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dithiol form of glutaredoxin is spontaneously regenerated by glutathione. Glutathione disulfide formed in the reaction is then reduced by NADPH and glutathione reductase (9Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Trypanosomatids are the causative agents of tropical diseases such as South American Chagas' disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), African sleeping sickness (T. brucei rhodesiense and T. brucei gambiense), Nagana cattle disease (T. congolense andT. brucei brucei), and the three manifestations of Leishmaniasis. All these parasitic protozoa have in common that the ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase system is replaced by a trypanothione/trypanothione reductase system. Monoglutathionylspermidine (Gsp) and trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine; T(SH)2) are the main low molecular mass thiols and are responsible for the redox balance of the cell (11Fairlamb A.H.

Tryparedoxin functions as a trypanothione-dependent thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase with catalytic properties intermediate between those of classical thioredoxins and glutaredoxin (20Lüdemann H.

The known dependence of eukaryotic ribonucleotide reductases on external thiols prompted us to study whether trypanothione is able to provide the electrons for the parasite synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. Here we will show that the trypanosomatid-specific dithiol trypanothione, in contrast to the monothiol glutathione, is a direct donor of reducing equivalents forT. brucei ribonucleotide reductase and that the reaction is catalyzed by tryparedoxin.

Human glutathione reductase was a kind gift of Dr. R. Heiner Schirmer, Biochemie-Zentrum Heidelberg. Ribonucleotide reductase activity was determined from the rate of conversion of [3H]GDP into [3H]dGDP essentially as described for CDP reduction (23Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained, in a total volume of 200 μl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 500 μm GDP (including 1.25 μCi [3H]GDP), 100 μm dTTP, 100 mm KCl, 6.4 mm MgCl2, and variable concentrations of thiols and tryparedoxin. In the standard assay 1 unit of T. bruceiR1 (about 40 μg of protein ≈ 0.4 nmol) with a 5-fold molar excess of R2 was used (1 unit corresponds to 1 nmol of dGDP formation/min). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 and 20 min, respectively, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 10 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The reaction components were dephosphorylated by 45-min incubation with 10 units of alkaline phosphatase. Guanosine, deoxyguanosine, and guanine were separated isocratically by HPLC on an Aminex A9 column (250 × 4 mm) in 100 mm ammonium borate, pH 8.3, and quantified by scintillation counting (24Willing A. Follmann H. Auling G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The thiols were generated in situ in the ribonucleotide reductase reaction mixture containing all components except R1, R2, and radiolabeled GDP. Glutathione disulfide was reduced by 200 milliunits of human glutathione reductase, glutathionylspermidine disulfide, and trypanothione disulfide by 200 milliunits of T. cruzi TR in the presence of a 2.5-fold molar excess of NADPH. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the ribonucleotide reductase reaction was started by adding R1, R2, and [3H]GDP. 10 mm trypanothione disulfide in 1 ml of water was incubated on ice with 100 mm NaBH4 for 1 h. The solution was acidified with 1 m HCl to pH 3.0 to prevent reoxidation of the thiol after decomposition of excess hydride. A C18 cartridge was washed with 4 ml of acetonitrile followed by 10 ml of water. The reaction mixture was applied, and the cartridge was washed with 3 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Trypanothione was eluted with 1.5 ml of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, lyophilized, dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, to a final concentration of 25 mm and, used immediately. The concentration of free thiols was determined by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; see Ref. 25Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar). In a final volume of 100 μl 50 μm tryparedoxin were incubated with 1 mm T(SH)2 in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, for 15 min under argon atmosphere. 3 μl of 200 mmiodoacetamide in water were added. After a 60-min incubation at room temperature in the dark, the reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of 200 mm DTE in water. A control reaction contained tryparedoxin and iodoacetamide but no T(SH)2 and was not stopped by DTE. The low molecular mass components were removed by centrifugation in a Centricon 3 concentrator (Millipore), and the modified protein was washed several times with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6. This procedure resulted in a homogeneous protein sample (see below) that represents tryparedoxin specifically modified at the first cysteine residue (Cys-40) of the WCPPC motif as described forCrithidia fasciculata tryparedoxin (19Gommel D.U. Nogoceke E. Morr M. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For the alkylation of both active site cysteinyl residues, the reaction was carried out in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride. Oxidized, reduced, mono-, and bis-carboxamidomethylated tryparedoxin were separated by HPLC on a VYDAAC 208 TP column at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min by a linear gradient from 38.5 to 45.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid within 1 h. The proteins were detected at 214 nm. The content of free thiol groups was determined with DTNB (25Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar). The thiol content of unmodified tryparedoxin was determined after reduction with NaBH4 at room temperature for 5 min. HCl was added to destroy excess NaBH4, and an aliquot of the sample was immediately analyzed for free thiol groups. Formation of [3H]dGDP from [3H]GDP by T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase was followed in the presence of trypanothione, glutathionylspermidine, glutathione, and the nonphysiological dithiol DTE. T(SH)2, Gsp, and GSH were generated and kept reduced by NADPH/TR and NADPH/glutathione reductase, respectively. Control assays revealed that the activity of ribonucleotide reductase is only slightly affected by millimolar concentrations of NADPH and NADP (data not shown). Trypanothione is an efficient reductant of the parasite enzyme. At a fixed concentration of 2 mm thiol groups, the activity of ribonucleotide reductase with trypanothione amounts to 30% of that observed with DTE (Fig. 1, light gray columns). In contrast, the monothiol Gsp showed very low activity, and GSH was completely inactive at this concentration. TheKm values of T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase for T(SH)2 and DTE were determined by varying the concentration of the dithiol from 0.5 to 4 mm and 2 to 12 mm, respectively. The reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and yielded Km values of 2.1 ± 0.4 mm for T(SH)2 and 6.9 ± 1.2 mm for DTE (Table I). Because the external electron donors for ribonucleotide reductase interact with the R1 protein (26Mao S.S. Holler T.P., Yu, G.X. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Booker S. Johnston M.I. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9733-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) the assays contained a molar excess of R2, and the specific activity refers to the amount of R1 protein. The maximum reaction rates were calculated by extrapolating to saturating concentrations of dithiol. The Vmax value of ribonucleotide reductase with DTE was about 6-fold higher than that with T(SH)2 (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of T. brucei ribonucleotide reductaseKmVmaxμmnmol/min · mgDTE6900 ± 120060T(SH)22100 ± 4009.6Tryparedoxin1-aThe assays contained a constant concentration of 2.5 mm trypanothione.3.7 ± 0.524The assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the kinetic data were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots.

Open table in a new tab The assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the kinetic data were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Mean values of at least three independent measurements, together with the standard deviations, are given. The activity of T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase with DTE, T(SH)2, Gsp, and GSH was followed in the absence and presence of T. brucei tryparedoxin. The protein stimulated the rate of dGDP formation in the presence of all four thiols. At 1 mm low molecular mass dithiol, the trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple yielded about 50% activity compared with DTE/tryparedoxin. With tryparedoxin in the reaction mixture, the monothiols glutathionylspermidine and glutathione also caused a pronounced dGDP formation (Fig. 1, dark gray columns). When the ribonucleotide reductase activities in the presence of thiol and tryparedoxin were corrected for the respective activity with the thiol alone, DTE (0.185 nmol/min), trypanothione (0.21 nmol/min), and glutathionylspermidine (0.205 nmol/min) resulted in nearly identical rates of GDP reduction. Only with GSH (0.1 nmol/min) the activity of ribonucleotide reductase was significantly lower in accordance with a weak reduction of tryparedoxin by GSH (20Lüdemann H. Dormeyer M. Sticherling C. Stallmann D. Follmann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, at millimolar concentrations, trypanothione is an efficient direct hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase. At lower T(SH)2 concentrations, stimulation of the reaction by tryparedoxin becomes pronounced. For instance, at 100 μmtrypanothione, 4 μm tryparedoxin increased dGDP formation by a factor of 14 (data not shown). The Km value of T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase for tryparedoxin was determined in the presence of a constant concentration of 2.5 mm T(SH)2. The dependence of the reaction rate on the tryparedoxin concentration showed saturation kinetics and yielded an apparent Km value of 3.7 ± 0.5 μm (Fig.2). Tryparedoxin was carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide under nondenaturing conditions that, in analogy toE. coli thioredoxin (28Kallis G.-B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and C. fasciculatatryparedoxin (19Gommel D.U. Nogoceke E. Morr M. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), should result in the exclusive modification of Cys-40, the first cysteine residue of the WCPPC motif. Analysis of the modified protein with Ellman's reagent yielded a total of 5 nmol of thiol groups per 6 nmol of protein whereas the control contained 8.6 nmol of free thiol groups per 5.6 nmol of protein. The relatively low thiol content of the control sample may be because of formation of covalent dimers that were observed when storing the NaBH4-reduced protein at pH 7.6 (not shown). HPLC analysis of the carboxamidomethylated protein revealed a single peak in accordance with the specific modification of one cysteine residue. As expected, the monoalkylated tryparedoxin did not catalyze the trypanothione-dependent reduction of GDP by ribonucleotide reductase (Table II).Table IIEffect of carboxamidomethylation of T. brucei tryparedoxin on ribonucleotide reductase activityRibonucleotide reductaserowsep=“1” nmol dGDP/minT(SH)20.04T(SH)2 + tryparedoxin0.33T(SH)2 + monoalkylated tryparedoxin0.06All reaction mixtures contained 250 μm trypanothione. The tryparedoxin concentration was 4 μm. The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab All reaction mixtures contained 250 μm trypanothione. The tryparedoxin concentration was 4 μm. The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of TS2 on the activity ofT. brucei ribonucleotide reductase was studied in the reaction with trypanothione as sole reductant and in the trypanothione/tryparedoxin system (Fig.3). Trypanothione disulfide showed only a minor effect on the activity of ribonucleotide reductase. At 1 mm trypanothione, 2.5 mm trypanothione disulfide diminished the rate of GDP reduction by about 40% (Fig.3 a). In contrast, the tryparedoxin-mediated reaction proved to be much more sensitive. 2.5 mm TS2 in the presence of 1 mm T(SH)2 and 10 μmtryparedoxin inhibited the rate of deoxyribonucleotide formation by 90% (Fig. 3 b). The residual activity of ribonucleotide reductase was identical with that observed with trypanothione alone indicating that it is tryparedoxin and not ribonucleotide reductase that is strongly regulated by the thiol/disulfide ratio of trypanothione. The IC50 value of tryparedoxin for trypanothione disulfide is about 50 μm in the presence of 1 mm T(SH)2. The pronounced sensitivity of tryparedoxin toward trypanothione disulfide also became evident when NADPH and trypanothione reductase were added to the assays (Fig. 3, a and b,second column). In the trypanothione/ribonucleotide reductase assay the rate of dGDP formation increased by only 10% whereas in the trypanothione/tryparedoxin/ribonucleotide reductase system the activity was doubled. The sample of trypanothione used in these experiments contained about 4% disulfide as revealed by an end point determination in a trypanothione reductase assay. This corresponds to a concentration of 40 μm TS2at the beginning, in addition to trypanothione disulfide formed during the reaction, and explains the pronounced effect of trypanothione reductase/NADPH. The discovery of the trypanothione system in Kinetoplastida raised the question as to the specific functions of the dithiol. The pivotal role of trypanothione in the antioxidant defense mechanisms of the parasites is well established (11Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 13Krieger S. Schwarz W. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Clayton C. Mol.

As shown here, trypanothione is also involved in the parasite synthesis of DNA precursors (Fig. 4). The dithiol serves as direct donor of reducing equivalents for T. bruceiribonucleotide reductase. In contrast, monoglutathionylspermidine and glutathione result in very low and no activity, respectively, in accordance with other ribonucleotide reductases where DTE and lipoate are hydrogen donors whereas monothiols are inactive (29Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The ability of trypanothione, but not of glutathione, to reduce ribonucleotide reductase directly is not related to the redox potentials of the thiols that are very similar (−242 and −230 mV for T(SH)2 and GSH, respectively; see Ref. 11Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pK values of the thiols differ significantly. A pK value of 7.4 has been reported for trypanothione, which is more than one pH unit lower than the pK value of 8.7 of GSH (30Moutiez M. Meziane-Sherif D. Aumercier M. Sergheraert C. Tartar A. Chem. Pharm. Bull. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 42: 2641-2644Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because second order rate constants for thiol-disulfide exchanges exhibit an optimum when the thiol pK value is equal to the pH value of the solution, T(SH)2 is expected to be much more reactive than GSH under physiological conditions. In addition, as reductants for intramolecular disulfides as in the R1 protein, dithiols are kinetically superior to monothiols (31Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). Trypanothione is the first example of a natural low molecular mass dithiol that is a direct reductant of ribonucleotide reductase. The trypanothione-dependent synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides by T. brucei ribonucleotide reductase is catalyzed by T. brucei tryparedoxin. This thioredoxin-like protein has been found exclusively in trypanosomatids, and its first elucidated role was as component of a trypanothione-dependent peroxidase cascade (17Nogoceke E. Gommel D.U. Kies M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 18Flohé L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The apparent Km value of T. bruceiribonucleotide reductase for T. brucei tryparedoxin (3.7 μm) is higher than those of E. coliribonucleotide reductase for glutaredoxins 1 and 3 (0.13 and 0.35 μm, respectively) (32Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is comparable with that for thioredoxin (1.3 μm) in the E. coli system (10Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximum activity of recombinant T. bruceiribonucleotide reductase in the trypanothione/tryparedoxin system is 24 nmol/min·mg R1. This value is in the same order of magnitude as the varying activities reported for the E. coli enzyme with thioredoxins 1 or 2 and glutaredoxin 1 (10Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and thus is significantly higher than that of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase with glutaredoxin 3 as hydrogen donor where theVmax is only 5% that of glutaredoxin 1 (32Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is not possible to determine the Km value of tryparedoxin for T(SH)2 using formation of dGDP as the indicator reaction. The reaction catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase is three orders of magnitude slower than the preceding reduction of the enzyme by tryparedoxin assuming that the latter reaction occurs at a rate similar to the reduction of tryparedoxin peroxidase by tryparedoxin (17Nogoceke E. Gommel D.U. Kies M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 34Montemartini M. Kalisz H.M. Hecht H.-J. Steinert P. Flohé L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Km values of different tryparedoxins for T(SH)2 between 30 and 150 μm have been estimated using the tryparedoxin peroxidase/hydroperoxide system or glutathione disulfide (oxidized glutathione) as the final electron acceptor (19Gommel D.U.

Chem. 1998; 379: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The trypanothione concentration in T. brucei is 400–800 μm (11Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), which should be adequate to keep tryparedoxin predominantly in the reduced state. In addition, tryparedoxin is a very abundant protein. In the insect parasite C. fasciculata, it represents 5% of the total soluble protein of the cell (17Nogoceke E. Gommel D.U. Kies M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that reduction of ribonucleotide reductase by the trypanothione/tryparedoxin system is not a limiting factor in the parasite synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. The tryparedoxin-mediated activity of ribonucleotide reductase was highest with DTE and trypanothione, but in the presence of tryparedoxin the monothiols Gsp and GSH, which fail as direct hydrogen donors, also yielded a significant dGDP formation. The increase of ribonucleotide reductase activity caused by tryparedoxin was comparable for trypanothione and monoglutathionylspermidine but much lower with GSH as the hydrogen donor. Because the glutathionylspermidine conjugates are the main low molecular mass thiols in the parasites (11Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) they are most probably the physiological electron donors in the parasite synthesis of DNA precursors. Trypanothione disulfide proved to be a powerful inhibitor of the tryparedoxin-mediated ribonucleotide reduction. At a T(SH)2/TS2 ratio of 10:1, the activity ofT. brucei ribonucleotide reductase is lowered by more than 60%. Inhibition of tryparedoxin by TS2 may be a physiological control mechanism. For E. coli glutaredoxin a respective observation has been made. Glutaredoxin is strongly inhibited in the presence of glutathione disulfide (oxidized glutathione) (10Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicating a relationship between the rate of DNA synthesis and the redox state of the cell. In the reaction with ribonucleotide reductase, tryparedoxin resembles mechanistically glutaredoxin. The ultimate reductant is a low molecular mass thiol, and the reaction is inhibited by the disulfide form of the respective thiol (10Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, with respect to the protein sequence, as well as thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, tryparedoxin is more similar to thioredoxins (20Lüdemann H. Dormeyer M. Sticherling C. Stallmann D. Follmann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Obviously, the parasite dithiol protein has properties intermediate between those of classical thioredoxins and glutaredoxins. In all organisms with class I ribonucleotide reductases investigated so far different hydrogen donor systems occur simultaneously. For instance, E. coli contains two thioredoxins and two glutaredoxins that are able to deliver electrons for ribonucleotide reductase (32Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Spyrou G. J. Biol.

Recently we have cloned the gene encoding a classical thioredoxin from T. brucei (36Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein is also a hydrogen donor for the trypanosomal ribonucleotide reductase when applied together with DTE or NADPH and human thioredoxin reductase. 2H. Schmidt and R. L. Krauth-Siegel, unpublished results. The thioredoxin gene is expressed throughout the life cycle of T. brucei, but the protein concentration in the parasites is unusually low. 3A. Schmidt and R. L. Krauth-Siegel, unpublished observations.

https://openalex.org/W2040098819,"Cellular injury induces an adaptive response whether the insult is physical (e.g., heat, radiation), chemical (e.g., reactive oxygen species), infectious (e.g., bacteria), or inflammatory (e.g., lipopolysaccharide). Recent data indicate that the interactions of these responses are not predictable and that sequence permutations can have opposite effects on outcome after injury. Our overarching hypothesis is that interactions among stress responses contribute to the fate of cells, tissues, and organisms and that modulation of these interactions can have important affects on both function and survival. For example, whereas it is well known that a prior heat shock stress can protect cells against inflammatory stress both in vitro and in vivo, we and others have shown that induction of a subsequent heat stress in cells 'primed' by inflammation can precipitate cell death by apoptosis. We call this seemingly paradoxical ability of heat shock to induce cytoprotection and cytotoxicity the heat shock paradox. The molecular mechanisms by which cells integrate responses to these and other stresses are poorly understood. We present data linking the heat shock paradox to the activity of the acute-phase transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (identifying an 'NF-kappaB paradox') and hypothesize that the mechanism is linked to the downstream effects of induction of NF-kappaB's endogenous inhibitor, IkappaBalpha, a putative heat shock protein."
https://openalex.org/W1979209535,"There is limited evidence that inhibition of the activity of the cytosolic cysteine protease calpain reduces ischemia/reperfusion injury. The multiple organ injury associated with hemorrhagic shock is due at least in part to ischemia (during hemorrhage) and reperfusion (during resuscitation) of target organs. Here we investigate the effects of calpain inhibitor I on the organ injury (kidney, liver, pancreas, lung, intestine) and dysfunction (kidney) associated with hemorrhagic shock in the anesthetized rat. Hemorrhage and resuscitation with shed blood resulted in an increase in calpain activity (heart), activation of NF-kappaB (kidney), expression of iNOS and COX-2 (kidney), and the development of multiple organ injury and dysfunction, all of which were attenuated by calpain inhibitor I (10 mg/kg i.p.), administered 30 min prior to hemorrhage. Chymostatin, a serine protease inhibitor that does not prevent the activation of NF-kappaB, had no effect on the organ injury/failure caused by hemorrhagic shock. Pretreatment (for 1 h) of murine macrophages or rat aortic smooth muscle cells (activated with endotoxin) with calpain inhibitor I attenuated the binding of activated NF-kappaB to DNA and the degradation of IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, and IkappaBvarepsilon. Selective inhibition of iNOS activity with L-NIL reduced the circulatory failure and liver injury, while selective inhibition of COX-2 activity with SC58635 reduced the renal dysfunction and liver injury caused by hemorrhagic shock. Thus, we provide evidence that the mechanisms by which calpain inhibitor I reduces the circulatory failure as well as the organ injury and dysfunction in hemorrhagic shock include 1) inhibition of calpain activity, 2) inhibition of the activation of NF-kappaB and thus prevention of the expression of NFkappaB-dependent genes, 3) prevention of the expression of iNOS, and 4) prevention of the expression of COX-2. Inhibition of calpain activity may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the therapy of hemorrhagic shock."

The assembly of Tctex-1 in the dynein complex and its function are largely unknown. Using partially deuterated, 15N,13C-labeled protein samples and transverse relaxation-optimized NMR spectroscopic techniques, the secondary structure and overall topology of Tctex-1 were determined based on the backbone nuclear Overhauser effect pattern and the chemical shift values of the protein. The data showed that Tctex-1 adopts a structure remarkably similar to that of the 8-kDa light chain of the motor complex (DLC8), although the two light chains share no amino acid sequence homology. We further demonstrated that Tctex-1 binds directly to the intermediate chain (DIC) of dynein. The Tctex-1 binding site on DIC was mapped to a 19-residue fragment immediately following the second alternative splicing site of DIC. Titration of Tctex-1 with a peptide derived from DIC, which contains a consensus sequence R/KR/KXXR/K found in various Tctex-1 target proteins, indicated that Tctex-1 binds to its targets in a manner similar to that of DLC8.

The experimental results presented in this study suggest that Tctex-1 is likely to be a specific cargo adaptor for the dynein motor complex. Tctex-1 (t-complextestis-expressed-1) was originally identified as a multigene family that maps to the t-complex, a large region of mouse chromosome 17 (known as t-haplotypes) containing four nonoverlapping inversions that suppress recombination (1Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell.. 1989; 58: 969-979Google Scholar). Male +/t-heterozygotes transmit the mutant chromosome at >99% frequency to their progeny, a non-Mendelian phenomenon known as transmission ratio distortion, and malet/t-homozygotes are completely sterile. The aberrant expression of Tctex-1 in the t-haplotype mice (4-fold overexpressed in +/t and 8-fold in t/t) was suggested to be functionally related to sterility and transmission ratio distortion (1Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell.. 1989; 58: 969-979Google Scholar). This Tctex-1-related meiotic drive hypothesis was supported by the finding that Tctex-1 is a light chain of cytoplasmic as well as flagellar inner arm dynein complexes (2King S.M. Dillman I.I.I., J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 32281-32287Google Scholar, 3Harrison A. Olds-Clarke P. King S.M. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 140: 1137-1147Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based molecular motor involved in various intracelluar motile events including retrograde vesicle transport, axonal transport, mitotic spindle positioning, and nuclear migration (4King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1496: 60-75Google Scholar, 5Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 1999; 11: 45-53Google Scholar, 6Hirokawa N. Science.. 1998; 279: 519-526Google Scholar, 7Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science.. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Google Scholar). The dynein motor is a multicomponent protein and contains two heavy chains (∼530 kDa), two intermediate chains (DIC1; ∼74 kDa), four light intermediate chains (∼50–60 kDa), and several light chains (DLC; 8, 14, and 22 kDa) (4King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1496: 60-75Google Scholar). Dynein heavy chains directly attach the dynein complex to microtubules and contain ATPase activity, which is required for force generation of the motor. DIC is involved in linking the motor to vesicle-based cargoes by mediating the interaction between dynein and dynactin (8Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 131: 1507-1516Google Scholar, 9Ma S. Trivinos-Lagos L. Graf R. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 147: 1261-1273Google Scholar, 10Susalka S.J. Hancock W.O. Pfister K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1496: 76-88Google Scholar). The functions of other dynein subunits are largely unknown because of the complexity of the motor complex. In addition to functioning as a stoichiometric subunit of the cytoplasmic dynein complex (2King S.M. Dillman I.I.I., J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 32281-32287Google Scholar, 11King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman I.I.I., J.F. Benashski S.E. Do K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Google Scholar), Tctex-1 was also found to interact with a number of cellular proteins of diverse function. Tctex-1 interacts with the N-terminal region of Doc2, and the interaction between these two proteins was suggested to be involved in the dynein-mediated vesicle transport (12Nagano F. Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Watanabe T. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30065-30068Google Scholar). Tctex-1 was also shown to interact with a 19-residue fragment located at the extreme N terminus of p59fyn Src family tyrosine protein kinase (13Campbell K.S. Cooper S. Dessing M. Yates S. Buder A. J. Immunol... 1998; 161: 1728-1737Google Scholar). Colocalization of Tctex-1 and Fyn at the cleavage furrow and mitotic spindles in T cell hybridomas undergoing cytokinesis points to possible roles of dynein in cell cycle control. Interaction of a lymphocyte surface glycoprotein CD5 with Tctex-1 was suggested to be linked to internalization of CD5 (14Bauch A. Campbell K.S. Reth M. Eur. J. Immunol... 1998; 28: 2167-2177Google Scholar). Additionally, Tctex-1 was recently reported to interact directly with the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin. This interaction was suggested to be responsible for the transport of rhodopsin-laden vesicles across the inner segment to the base of the connecting cilium (15Tai A.W. Chuang J.-Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.-H. Cell.. 1999; 97: 877-887Google Scholar). The discovery of a large number of functionally unrelated Tctex-1-binding proteins suggests that Tctex-1 is likely to function as an adaptor serving to link specific cargoes to the dynein motor. Because of limited biochemical and structural characterization of Tctex-1, the molecular mechanisms governing the interactions between the protein and its binding partners are unknown. In this work, we performed a detailed structural characterization of Tctex-1 by NMR spectroscopic techniques. Using purified recombinant proteins, we showed that Tctex-1 binds directly to the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein, and the Tctex-1 binding site was mapped to a short stretch of amino acid residues in the N-terminal region of DIC. We further demonstrate that Tctex-1 shares remarkable structural and target binding similarities with DLC8, although the two light chains share no amino acid sequence homology. The cDNA encoding mouse Tctex-1 was generously provided by Prof. Yoshimi Takai. The Tctex-1 expression plasmid was constructed by inserting polymerase chain reaction-amplified Tctex-1 gene fragment into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET3a vector (Novagen). The full-length mouse DIC gene was constructed by assembling three overlapping genomic clones as described in our earlier work (31Lo K.W.-H. Naisbitt S. Fan J.-S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of DIC (amino acids 1–213) was inserted into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for expression of a GST fusion protein. Various truncation, deletion, and point mutations of this DIC fragment were constructed using standard polymerase chain reaction and cloning techniques. The C-terminal WD repeats (amino acids 214–628) were constructed as an N-terminal His-tagged protein (31Lo K.W.-H. Naisbitt S. Fan J.-S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Google Scholar). Tctex-1 was expressed by transforming the pET3a vector containing the Tctex-1 gene intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) host cells. A single colony ofE. coli cells harboring the expression plasmid was inoculated into 50 ml of LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LBA). The cell culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C and then inoculated into 1 liter of fresh LBA medium. Tctex-1 expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 of the culture reached ∼0.6. Pelleted cells from 2 liters of culture were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm (Sorvall SS34 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 50-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with buffer A until the A280reading was steady, and the column was then eluted with 200 ml of buffer A with a linear NaCl gradient of 0–0.3 m. Fractions containing Tctex-1 were pooled and concentrated to about 8 ml before loading onto a Sephacryl-100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column preequilibrated with buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl. The eluted fractions containing Tctex-1 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A before loading onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Mono Q column was washed with buffer A, and Tctex-1 was eluted using 70 ml of the same buffer with an NaCl gradient of 0–0.35 m. The purified Tctex-1 was dialyzed against buffer A and stored at −80 °C. Various forms of GST-fused DIC mutant proteins were expressed inE. coli cells. In a typical purification procedure, cell pellet from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 25 ml of PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4) containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The GST fusion proteins were purified following the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified proteins were dialyzed extensively against PBS prior to binding experiments. All NMR samples were prepared by concentrating purified Tctex-1 using a Centriprep-3 (Amicon) ultrafiltration device. The protein was exchanged into the desired NMR sample buffer (50 mm Tris-d11, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol-d10, and 10% D2O), with or without 0.4 m KCl, using ultrafiltration. Preparation of the partially deuterated Tctex-1 followed a protocol described previously with slight modifications (16Rosen M.K. Gardner K.H. Willis R.C. Parris W.E. Pawson T. Kay L.E. J. Mol. Biol... 1996; 263: 627-636Google Scholar). Briefly, a single colony of E. coli cells harboring the Tctex-1 expression plasmid was inoculated into 50 ml of LBA and incubated overnight at 37 °C. About 4 ml of this overnight culture was inoculated into 200 ml of15N/H2O/[13C]glucose (for2H,15N,13C triple labeling) or15N/H2O/[12C]glucose (for2H,15N double labeling) M9 medium with an initial A600 value of ∼0.04. The cells were incubated at 37 °C until the A600 value reached ∼0.5. The cells were spun down at 4 °C and then gently resuspended into 200 ml of 15N, 80% D2O, [13C]glucose or 15N, 80% D2O, [12C]glucose M9 medium. The suspension was diluted five times into 800 ml of 15N, 80% D2O, [13C]glucose or 15N, 80% D2O, [12C]glucose M9 medium to give anA600 value of ∼0.1. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C until the A600 reading reached ∼0.5, and Tctex-1 expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The bacterial culture was incubated overnight at 16 °C before the cells were harvested. All NMR experiments were performed on a four-channel Varian Inova 750-MHz spectrometer equipped with az-axis pulsed field gradient unit and an actively shielded triple resonance probe. Sequential backbone assignment of Tctex-1 was completed using three pairs of TROSY-enhanced triple resonance experiments (17Pervushin K. Braun D. Fernandez C. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2000; 17: 195-202Google Scholar), namely HN(CA)CB and HN(COCA)CB; HNCA and HN(CO)CA; HNCO and HN(CA)CO (18Kay L.E. Gardner K.H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Trends Biotechnol... 1998; 16: 22-34Google Scholar) on an 15N,13C uniformly, 80% 2H-partially labeled Tctex-1 sample. An1H-15N HSQC-NOESY experiment (21Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Shortle D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1997; 9: 181-200Google Scholar) recorded on an 15N-lableled Tctex-1 sample with a mixing time of 90 ms was used to confirm the sequential assignment. Backbone HN-HN NOEs were obtained using a 1H-15N HSQC-NOESY-HSQC experiment (22Ikura M. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 1990; 112: 9020-9022Google Scholar) recorded on an15N-uniformly, 80% 2H-partially labeled Tctex-1 sample with a mixing time of 150 ms. The protein concentrations of all NMR samples were ∼1.0 mm. For each pull-down assay, 15 μl of a 75% slurry of GST-Sepharose 4B was first washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS for equilibration. About 0.1 mg of the GST fusion proteins (250 μl) was added, and the suspension was agitated at 4 °C for 1 h. The GST-protein-loaded beads were washed four times with 0.5 ml of PBS to remove any unbound protein. A total of 100 μl of Tctex-1 (35 μm) solution was added, and the suspension was agitated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The beads were then washed four times with 0.5 ml of PBS to remove any unbound Tctex-1 and subsequently boiled with 20 μl of 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer. The intensities of the Tctex-1 bands on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were used to judge the strength of the interaction between Tctex-1 and various GST-DIC fusion proteins. Competition between DLC8 and Tctex-1 for DIC binding was examined by adding 100-μl aliquots of DLC8 solutions of increasing concentration to suspensions of Tctex-1 premixed with GST-DIC-loaded GSH-Sepharose beads (at a 1:1 molar ratio of Tctex-1 to GST-DIC). The mixtures were agitated for an additional 2 h, and the beads were subsequently washed four times with 0.5 ml of PBS. The relative amounts of Tctex-1 and DLC8 pelleted by the GSH-Sepharose beads were used to judge possible competition between Tctex-1 and DLC8 for DIC binding. To uncover the molecular basis of Tctex-1's cellular function, we characterized the structure of the protein in solution by NMR spectroscopic techniques. An efficient Tctex-1 production and purification procedure was developed, and large quantities of various forms of stable isotope-labeled Tctex-1 were obtained for NMR structural studies. The1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled Tctex-1 showed that the majority of the backbone resonances of the protein were extraordinary broad at various protein concentrations tested (0.1–1 mm). The severe line broadening is likely to be a combined effect of slow to intermediate time scale conformational exchange and nonspecific protein aggregation (for more detail, see below). An array of triple resonance experiments on15N,13C-labeled Tctex-1, aiming to obtain the backbone assignment of the protein, failed. Both 15N- and13C-separated three-dimensional NOESY experiments of Tctex-1 showed unusually low amounts of NOE cross-peaks. To circumvent sample aggregation and conformational exchange-induced T2 shortening, partial deuteration (23Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Ren H. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 1993; 115: 4369-4370Google Scholar, 24Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith C.H. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 1994; 116: 11655-11666Google Scholar) of the protein (∼80%) together with TROSY techniques (17Pervushin K. Braun D. Fernandez C. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2000; 17: 195-202Google Scholar) were used for NMR characterization of Tctex-1 in solution. Using a combination of TROSY-based HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CB, and HN(COCA)CB triple resonance experiments on a2H,13C,15N-triple labeled Tctex-1 sample, we were able to obtain essentially complete backbone resonance assignment of the protein. A 15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY experiment recorded on a15N-labeled Tctex-1, and an HSQC-NOESY-HSQC experiment recorded on a 2H,15N-labeled protein sample were used to confirm the assignment obtained by the triple resonance experiments. Fig. 1 A shows the TROSY-HSQC spectrum of Tctex-1 with each backbone amide resonance labeled with amino acid residue name and number. The completion of the backbone chemical shift assignment allowed us to determine the secondary structure of Tctex-1 using a slightly modified chemical shift index approach (25Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Google Scholar). As both 13Cα and 13Cβ shifts are sensitive to secondary structure, and as they shift to opposite fields in a given secondary structure, a combined13Cα/13Cβ secondary shift presented by subtracting the 13Cβ secondary shift of a residue from its 13Cα secondary shift enhances secondary structure-induced chemical shift changes of the protein (Fig.1 B). Presentation of the secondary structure chemical shifts using combined 13Cα/13Cβ shifts has the additional advantage of canceling potential secondary shift errors resulted from chemical shift referencing. Based on the data in Fig.1 B, we conclude that Tctex-1 is composed of two long N-terminal α-helices (α1 and α2, with starting and ending residues labeled in Fig. 1 B) followed by four β-strands (β1 to β4). The secondary structure of Tctex-1 derived from the chemical shift data was supported by the backbone NOE patterns of the protein derived from the two three-dimensional 15N-NOESY experiments (HSQC-NOESY-HSQC and 15N-separate NOESY, data not shown). The chemical shift values of the residues (Asp-3 to Thr-10) N-terminal to α1 indicate that this fragment of Tctex-1 appears to assume a random coil-like structure. The random coil structure of the N-terminal fragment inferred from chemical shift data is also supported by the exceptionally narrow line widths of these residues and the lack of detectable long range backbone NOE of the region. The secondary structure of Tctex-1 shown in Fig. 1 B is remarkably similar to that of another dynein light chain, DLC8 (26Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1999; 6: 735-740Google Scholar, 27Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 306: 97-108Google Scholar), although the two light chains have very limited amino acid sequence homology. Next, we determined the overall topology of Tctex-1. To obtain maximal backbone amide resolution, we used an HSQC-NOESY-HSQC experiment recorded on 2H,15N-labeled Tctex-1 to detect backbone HN-HN NOEs. Large numbers of long range, inter-β-strand NOEs were used to determine the folding topology of the Tctex-1 β-strands (Fig. 2). The four β-strands of Tctex-1 form an antiparallel β-sheet structure with a β3-β4-β1-β2 arrangement (Fig. 2). Several unambiguous inter-α-helical HN-HN NOEs spanning the entire helices (e.g. backbone amide NOEs between Asp-15 and Thr-55, Ile-20 and Thr-50, and Gly-30 and Val-39) indicate that the two α-helices of Tctex-1 are antiparallel to each other. The detection of long range backbone amide NOEs between amino acid residues from the α-helices and β-strands (e.g.NOEs between Ala-28 and Cys-104, Asn-32 and Trp-97, Asn-45 and Cys-67, and Leu-54 and Asp-86) indicate that the two helices pack against the antiparallel β-sheet of the protein (see Fig. 6, inset). The overall topology of Tctex-1 is again very similar to that of DLC8 (26Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1999; 6: 735-740Google Scholar, 27Fan J.-S. Zhang Q.

The figure shows an overlay plot of TROSY-HSQC spectra of Tctex-1 at the starting (blue) and end (red) points of titration with an 11-residue peptide (LGRRLHKLGVS) corresponding to the N-terminal part of the Tctex-1 binding domain of DIC. The concentration of Tctex-1 (15N-, 80% 2H-labeled) is 0.4 mm, and the protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-d11, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol-d10. The molar ratio of the DIC peptide to Tctex-1 at the final point of the titration is 2:1. The residues that show significant chemical shift changes upon the addition of the DIC peptide are marked with open boxes, and these amino acid residues are mapped to the topology structure of Tctex-1 shown as an inset in the figure. The dashed lines in the topology diagram of Tctex-1 are used to indicate the uncertainty of the connections of the β-strands due to potential domain swapping of the Tctex-1 dimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier biochemical experiments showed that Tctex-1 and DIC cofractionated from a KI-treated cytoplasmic dynein complex preparation, suggesting that Tctex-1 and DIC might interact directly with each other (2King S.M. Dillman I.I.I., J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 32281-32287Google Scholar, 11King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman I.I.I., J.F. Benashski S.E. Do K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Google Scholar). We used purified recombinant proteins to test direct interaction between Tctex-1 and DIC. A GST-fused fragment spanning residues 1–213 of DIC was found to interact robustly with Tctex-1 in the GSH-Sepharose pull-down assay (Fig.3 B, lane 3), indicating that Tctex-1 and DIC can indeed interact with each other directly. As expected, purified, recombinant full-length DIC was also able bind to Tctex-1 (data not shown). In contrast, the C-terminal part of DIC which contains the highly conserved Trp-Asp repeats failed to bind to Tctex-1 (data not shown). We then mapped the exact Tctex-1 binding site of DIC by creating a series of DIC truncation mutations (Fig. 3 A). A 19-residue fragment (residues 124–142) of DIC was identified as sufficient for binding to Tctex-1 (for the amino acid sequence of the peptide fragment, see Fig. 3 A). Given the overall structural similarities between Tctex-1 and DLC8, we suspected that Tctex-1 might also bind to a short peptide fragment, as does DLC8 (27Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). To localize the precise Tctex-1 binding site further, we deleted a positive charged, 5-residue fragment (RRLHK) located at the N-terminal end of the 19-residue Tctex-1 binding fragment of DIC (Fig. 4). Deletion of the 5-residue fragment completely abolished the interaction between DIC and Tctex-1, indicating that this 5-residue cassette plays an important role in supporting the Tctex-1·DIC complex formation. However, this 5-residue fragment alone is not sufficient for effective binding to Tctex-1 because a GST fusion peptide containing this 5-residue fragment plus a few amino acid residues at both ends was not able to pull down Tctex-1 (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). These data indicate that both the N- and C-terminal parts of the 19-residue DIC fragment are required for the Tctex-1·DIC complex formation. We next set out to identify the DIC binding region in Tctex-1. To simplify the experiment, we used a synthetic peptide corresponding to the full-length Tctex-1 binding domain of DIC to titrate with partially deuterated 15N-labeled Tctex-1. Unfortunately, the 1H-15N HSQC of Tctex-1 in the presence of this peptide became exceedingly broad and beyond interpretation, suggesting a severe aggregation of the protein-peptide complex (data not shown). Inspection of the amino acid sequences of a number of Tctex-1 binding regions in various targets revealed a short stretch of consensus sequence of R/KR/KXXR/K (Fig.5). Although an 11-residue DIC peptide containing the consensus sequence fused to GST was not able to pull down Tctex-1 (the assay requires high affinity binding between the two proteins; Fig. 3), we anticipated that NMR titration of Tctex-1 with the same 11-residue peptide would allow us to detect the possible interaction between the protein and peptide (even if the interaction were relatively weak). To test this possibility, we titrated15N-labeled Tctex-1 with the 11-residue synthetic peptide (LGRRLHKLGVS from residue 124 to 134 of DIC, Fig. 4). Significant chemical shift changes of a number of backbone amide cross-peaks of Tctex-1 were observed during the titration, indicating that the 11-residue DIC peptide can indeed bind to the protein. Fig.6 shows an overlay plot of the HSQC spectra of Tctex-1 at the start (blue) and end (red) points of the titration. The amino acid residues that display significant chemical shift changes are labeled, and these amino acid residues are likely to be those involved in the peptide binding. The inset of Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the amino acids that undergo significant peptide-induced chemical shift changes, and these residues are found mainly at the end of β2 (Cys-83, Phe-84, Trp-85, and Asp-86) and the β2/β3-loop (Thr-89, Asp-90, and Gly-91) of Tetex-1. In addition, several residues that are in close proximity to this region (e.g. Thr-55 and Lys-56 at the end of α1, and Phe-61 and Lys-62 at the start of β1) also experience some chemical shift changes. Based on the data in Fig. 6, we conclude that the β2-strand and the β2/β3-loop are the main DIC binding region in Tctex-1. To assess the potential roles of the conserved amino acids in the consensus R/KR/KXXR/K sequence of DIC in Tctex-1 binding, we performed a systematic mutational analysis. The data indicate that no single residue in the consensus sequence (RRLHK) plays a dominant role in supporting the Tctex-1·DIC complex formation (Fig. 7). The second arginine residue in the consensus sequence appears to make a slightly larger contribution to the complex formation (Fig. 7 B, lane 5). However, deletion of the whole consensus sequence resulted in complete disruption of the Tctex-1·DIC complex (Fig. 4), suggesting that these amino acid residues may function additively in binding to Tctex-1. The DIC truncation experiment showed that residues C-terminal to the consensus RRLHK sequence (i.e. LGVSKVTQVDFL) are also involved in Tctext-1 binding (Fig. 4). Consistent with this, mutation of Leu-131 to Asn greatly diminished the interaction between Tctex-1 and DIC (Fig. 8, lane 9). However, a combination of the consensus RRLHK sequence and Leu-131 is not sufficient for strong binding because the GST-fused peptide containing both the consensus sequence and Leu-131 was not able to form a stable complex with Tctex-1 (Fig. 5, lane 5). Further mutational analysis will be required to identify the structural features that are essential for Tctex-1 binding. The Tctex-1 binding site (residues 124–142, LGRRLHKLGVSKVTQVDFL) identified in this study and the DLC8 binding site (151–155, KETQT) in DIC are immediately next to each other in the amino acid sequence of DIC (Fig. 9, and Ref. 31Lo K.W.-H. Naisbitt S. Fan J.-S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Google Scholar). Additionally, the Tctex-1 binding site contains a KVTQV sequence that is similar to the KETQT DLC8 binding motif (31Lo K.W.-H. Naisbitt S. Fan J.-S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that the binding of Tctex-1 and DLC8 on DIC are mutually exclusive. To test this possibility, we performed a binding competition experiment as shown in Fig. 8. In this experiment, equal molar amounts of GST-DIC and Tctex-1 were mixed with increasing molar ratio amounts of DLC8 (Fig. 8). The GST-DIC·Tctex-1·DLC8 ternary complex was pelleted by GSH-Sepharose beads and subsequently analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Data in Fig. 8clearly demonstrate that excess DLC8 does not displace Tctex-1 from DIC, indicating that Tctex-1 and DLC8 can bind simultaneously to DIC. In a reverse experiment, we found that excess Tctex-1 does not compete with DLC8 for binding to DIC, consistent with our conclusion that the Tctex-1 binding site and the DLC8 binding site on DIC are mutually independent (data not shown). As a part of our continuing effort to understand the structure and function of cytoplasmic DLCs, we performed a detailed structural analysis of Tctex-1 in this study. Using multidimensional TROSY-enhanced NMR spectroscopic techniques, we determined the secondary structure and the topology of Tctex-1 in solution. Tctex-1 shares a remarkably similar structure with DLC8 both at the secondary structure and folding topology levels (26Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1999; 6: 735-740Google Scholar, 27Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 306: 97-108Google Scholar), although the two proteins display very limited amino acid sequence homology. Analogous to DLC8, both gel filtration and chemical cross-linking studies showed that Tctex-1 can exist as a dimer in solution (data not shown). A full structural determination of Tctex-1 and/or its complex with a target peptide is required to answer how the Tctex-1 dimer is assembled in solution. Detailed comparisons of the structures of Tctex-1 and DLC8, both in apo- and target-bound forms, will help to elucidate how the two structurally similar light chains distinguish their respective targets. In DLC8, target peptides bind to the protein by augmenting the β-sheet via the β2-strand in an antiparallel fashion (26Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1999; 6: 735-740Google Scholar, 27Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). Our NMR studies indicated that Tctex-1 binds a target peptide derived from DIC using a mechanism similar to that of DLC8 (i.e. the β2-strand and the β2/β3-loop are the major target binding regions for both proteins) (Fig. 6). It is possible that the short DIC peptide (LGRRLHKLGVS) used in the NMR titration experiment may also bind to Tctex-1 by pairing with the β2-strand of the protein. However, we also notice significant differences between Tctex-1 and DLC8 in their respective target bindings. For example, DLC8 is capable of binding to a KXTQT motif-containing peptide, which is as short as 9 residues, with high affinity and specificity (27Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 306: 97-108Google Scholar, 31Lo K.W.-H. Naisbitt S. Fan J.-S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Google Scholar). In contrast, the Tctex-1-binding peptide is likely to be significantly longer. An 11-residue DIC peptide containing a consensus R/KR/KXXR/K sequence with a few amino acid residue extensions at both ends was not able to bind to Tctex-1 with high affinity (Fig. 5). To achieve high affinity binding, an additional ∼10 amino acids C-terminal to the RRLHK sequence of DIC are required. Given the length of the Tctex-1-binding peptide, the target binding site on Tctex-1 is likely to involve regions other than the β2-strand and the β2/β3-loop of the protein. Unfortunately, because of the poor behavior of Tctex-1 complexed with a synthetic peptide containing the complete Tctex-1 binding region of DIC in solution, we were not able to determine the exact regions of Tctex-1 which are involved in target binding. Although the amino acid residues downstream of the consensus R/KR/KXXR/K sequence are necessary for effective binding of Tctex-1 and its targets, sequence alignment analysis shows that no obvious homology can be observed in these regions (Fig. 6). The sequence downstream of the consensus R/KR/KXXR/K sequence in DIC is a mix of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (LGVSKVTQV). The same region in CD5 is composed mainly of hydrophilic residues; only one hydrophobic residue occurs (KFRQKKQRQ). It seems that Tctex-1 is capable of binding to a number of targets with diverse amino acid sequences, a phenomenon that was also observed for DLC8 (27Fan J.-S. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 306: 97-108Google Scholar). Mutational analysis indicated that polar/charged interactions between the positively charged consensus sequence R/KR/KXXR/K and negatively charged amino acids from Tctex-1 are likely to play important roles in binding specificity because deletion of all three positively charged residues of DIC abolished its binding to Tctex-1. Hydrophobic interactions between amino acid residues downstream of the consensus sequence and Tctex-1 are also expected to provide favorable binding energy for complex formation, as mutation of Leu-131 of DIC to Asn greatly reduced its affinity for Tctex-1 (Fig. 7). Because of alternative splicing of the two DIC genes, there at least five different isoforms of DIC in mammals (8Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 131: 1507-1516Google Scholar, 10Susalka S.J. Hancock W.O. Pfister K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1496: 76-88Google Scholar, 28Nurminsky D.I. Nurminskaya M.V.

Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Genomics.. 1999; 55: 257-267Google Scholar). Fig. 9 shows a schematic diagram of the domain organization of DIC. The function of the C-terminal Trp-Asp repeats is still unknown. The high amino acid sequence homology of the Trp-Asp repeats domain of DICs from both cytoplasmic and axonemal DICs suggests that this domain is likely to be responsible for attaching DICs to the heavy chains of the motor complex. The N-terminal ∼120 residues (including the two alternative splicing sites and the Ser-rich region) of DIC was identified to interact with dynactin. The discovery of the interaction between DIC and dynactin suggested that DIC functions as the adaptor to link the motor complex to its vesicle-based cargoes (8Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 131: 1507-1516Google Scholar). Following the dynactin binding region of DIC are the Tctex-1 and DLC8 binding regions. Because both light chains are capable of binding a large number of functional unrelated proteins, it is likely that the light chains function as motor adaptors for transporting various specific cargoes. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the two target binding sites of DLC8 (and also likely Tctex-1) can simultaneously bind to DIC and one of its target proteins. 2K. W.-H. Lo, and M. Zhang, unpublished results. Unlike kinesins and myosins that contain a large number of isoforms, cytoplasmic dynein contains two copies of identical heavy chains with motor activities. It is likely that a combination of various light chains and light intermediate chains as well as intermediate chains allows a single cytoplasmic dynein complex to move a vast number of molecular cargoes along microtubules. The dynactin binding region of DIC contains alternative splicing sites and potential protein phosphorylation sites within the Ser-rich region (Fig. 9). The dynein light chain binding domains in DIC are situated immediately C-terminal to the second alternative splicing region. This means that neither alternative splicing nor phosphorylation of DIC would have any effect on Tctex-1 and DLC8 binding on DIC. A competition binding assay of Tctex-1 and DLC8 on DIC showed that the bindings of Tctex-1 and DLC8 on DIC are mutually independent (Fig. 8), suggesting that both Tctex-1 and DLC8, together with their unique cargoes, can bind to DIC simultaneously. Cytoplasmic dynein contains another light chain called RP3, which shares 52% amino acid identity to Tctex-1. However, RP3 displays distinct target binding properties when compared with Tctex-1. In contrast to what was observed for Tctex-1, RP3 does not interact with rhodopsin (15Tai A.W. Chuang J.-Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.-H. Cell.. 1999; 97: 877-887Google Scholar) or Doc2 (12Nagano F. Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Watanabe T. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30065-30068Google Scholar). Tctex-1 and RP3 are regulated differentially in both a developmental and tissue-specific manner. Functionally distinct populations of cytoplasmic dynein may contain different Tctex-1 family light chains. Subcellular localization of specific light chains, including Tctex-1, may also contribute to the functional differences of dynein complexes (30Tai A.W. Chuang J.-Z. Sung C.-H. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 19639-19649Google Scholar). We do not know whether RP3 directly binds to DIC, or if it does, whether Tctex-1 and RP3 bind to DIC in a mutually exclusive manner. Further work is required to address these questions. We further note that although the amino acid sequence of the DLC8 and Tctex-1 binding region shown in Fig. 9 is highly conserved in cytoplasmic DIC, these sequences are not clearly identifiable in axonemal DICs, suggesting a possible difference in the assembly of the light chains between axonemal and cytoplasmic dyneins.

https://openalex.org/W2055847923,"The study aimed to 1) quantify oxidative stress in spinal cord after crush injury at T6, 2) determine whether the administration of the procysteine compound L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTC) would up-regulate glutathione (GSH) synthesis and decrease oxidative stress, and 3) determine whether decreased oxidative stress results in better tissue and function retention. We demonstrate that spinal cord compression (5 s with a 50 g aneurysm clip) at T6 in rats results in oxidative stress that is extensive (significant increases in oxidative stress seen at C3 and L4) and rapid in onset. Indices of oxidative stress used were GSH content, protein carbonyl content, and inactivation of glutathione reductase. Administration of OTC resulted in a marked decrease in oxidative stress associated with a sparing of white matter at T6 (16+/-1.9% retained in OTC-treated animals vs. less than 1% in saline-treated). Behavioral indices in control, saline-treated, and OTC-treated animals after 6 wk were respectively: angle board scores (59 degrees, 32 degrees, and 42 degrees ), modified Tarlov score (7, 2.4, and 4.1), and Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score (21, 5.3, and 12.9). We conclude that administration of OTC after spinal cord trauma greatly decreases oxidative stress and allows tissue preservation, thereby enabling otherwise paraplegic animals to locomote."
https://openalex.org/W2088869602,"Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is present in many tissues with relevance to fuel metabolism, and its expression is increased in fat and muscle in response to elevated circulating free fatty acids resulting from fasting and high fat feeding. We proposed a role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) as a mediator of these physiological changes in UCP2, because thiazolidinediones also increase expression of UCP2 in these cell types (1Aubert J. Champigny O. Saint-Marc P. Negrel R. Collins S. Ricquier D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 238: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular basis for this regulation, we isolated the 7.3-kilobase promoter region of the mouse UCP2 gene. The −7.3-kilobase/+12-base pair fragment activates transcription of a reporter gene by 50–100-fold. Deletion and point mutation analysis, coupled with gel shift assays, indicate the presence of a 43-base pair enhancer (−86/−44) that is responsible for the majority of both basal and PPARγ-dependent transcriptional activity. The distal (−86/−76) part of the enhancer specifically binds Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 and is indistinguishable from a consensus Sp1 element in competition experiments. Point mutation in this sequence reduces basal activity by 75%. A second region (−74/−66) is identical to the sterol response element consensus and specifically binds ADD1/SREBP1. However, deletion of this sequence does not affect basal transcriptional activity or the response to PPARγ. The proximal portion of the enhancer contains a direct repeat of two E-Box motifs, which contributes most strongly to basal and PPARγ-dependent transcription of the UCP2 promoter. Deletion of this region results in a 10–20-fold reduction of transcriptional activity and complete loss of PPARγ responsiveness. Point mutations in either E-Box, but not in the spacer region between them, eliminate the stimulatory response to PPARγ. However, gel shift assays show that PPARγ does not bind to this region. Taken together, these data indicate that PPARγ activates the UCP2 gene indirectly by altering the activity or expression of other transcription factors that bind to the UCP2 promoter.

Nature Genetics. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Like UCP1, which is able to dissipate caloric energy as heat by uncoupling mitochondrial respiration from ATP production, UCP2 can similarly uncouple respiration, at least in vitro (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H.

This fact, coupled with other significant features, including tissue distribution and genetic location in a strong quantitative trait locus for hyperinsulinemia and leptin levels, made UCP2 an attractive candidate for regulation of resting metabolic rate and as an obesity/diabetes susceptibility gene. However, we recently reported that targeted disruption of the UCP2 gene does not lead to spontaneous or diet-induced obesity and diabetes (3Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S.

Collins, unpublished observations. 2H. Onuma, R. S. Surwit, S. Collins, unpublished observations.Thus, the relationship between energy metabolism and UCP2 remains unclear. Transcripts and protein expression of UCP2 are found in many tissues with relevance to fuel metabolism such as pancreatic β-cells, white and brown fat, skeletal muscle, and hypothalamus. In response to high fat diets, we have previously reported adipose-specific increases in expression of UCP2 in obesity-resistant mouse strains such as A/J and C57BL/Kalis, which are absent from the obesity-prone C57BL/6J strain of mice (2Fleury C.

Of mechanistic importance, blockade by nicotinic acid of both the fasting-induced rise in free fatty acids, as well as fatty acid transport into mitochondria (5Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1693-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), prevented the fasting-induced increase in UCP2 mRNA in muscle. The importance of changes in fat metabolism for regulation of UCP2 expression was further supported by the observation that fasting-induced increases in circulating free fatty acids led to a stimulation of UCP2 expression in adipose tissue and muscle, whereas subsequent refeeding suppressed UCP2 expression (6Boss O. Samec S. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 142: 111-114Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 7Millet L. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Larrouy D. Riou J. Ricquier D. Laville M.

However, this down-regulation of UCP2 was not observed when the post-fasting diet contained a high percentage of calories from fat (9Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although these findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of fatty acids in regulation of UCP2 expression, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. However, a PPAR-dependent pathway is one of the possible mechanisms that can be considered to mediate the response of UCP2 to fatty acids, because it has been shown that at least some fatty acids can bind PPARγ specifically and may act as natural ligands for this transcription factor (10Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PPARγ plays an important role in the control of the expression of many genes involved in energy metabolism by binding specific elements consisting of a direct repeat (DR-1) of a consensus sequence (AGGTCA) separated by one base, although functional peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements (PPREs) can deviate significantly from the consensus (13Brun R.

To further understand the mechanisms regulating transcription of the UCP2 gene, as well as a role of PPARγ in its regulation, we report here cloning and analysis of the transcriptional activity of a 7.3-kb fragment of mouse UCP2 promoter. A mouse genomic library (129 SVJ mouse DNA digested by Sau3A DNA and inserted into lambda FIX II vector, catalog number 946306; Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA) was screened using a 1,304-bp PCR probe encompassing intron 1 and exon II of the mouse UCP2 gene. The PCR probe was generated using sense 5′-TGCACTCCTGTGTTCTCCTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GACTCTGGAGTTTCGTCGGA-3′ primers and corresponding to intron 1 and exon II. The cloned genomic fragment (made of 7,452 bp) was inserted into the NotI site of pSPORT plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) and entirely sequenced (18Pecqueur C. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Raimbault S. Miroux B. Fleury C. Gelly C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based upon this sequence from the 129 SVJ mouse gene, the same region was isolated from the A/J, C57BL/6J, and C57Ks/J strains and entirely sequenced. To construct luciferase reporter plasmids, fragments of the A/J mouse UCP2 promoter (GenBankTM accession number AF115319) were cloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega) using restriction fragments or amplified by PCR and cloned using the primer-introduced MluI andNheI restriction sites.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 267-276PubMed Google Scholar) on RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection experiments cells were plated into 6-well dishes and grown overnight to 50–60% of confluence. In cotransfection experiments plasmid pGEM3z was used to equalize amount of DNA per well. All transfections included a reporter plasmid containing a 2-kb promoter region of human β-actin and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as an internal control (20Miyamoto N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Prior to transfection, cells were washed twice with calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 1 ml/well of transfection mixture, which contained 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1.5 μg of total amount of DNA prepared in serum-free, antibiotic-free F-12 medium according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h of incubation, transfection mixture was removed, and cells were supplemented with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For CAT and luciferase assays cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Whole cell extracts were prepared according to CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used in both CAT and luciferase assays. Luciferase activity of the UCP2 reporter constructs is normalized for CAT activity of the control plasmid. Where indicated, cells were treated with BRL49653 (GL237310x). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected into microtubes, and centrifuged for 15 s in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold, low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. The cell suspension was vigorously vortexed for 20 s followed by centrifugation for 30 s in a microcentrifuge to collect the nuclei. The nuclei were resuspended in 10 volumes of high salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mmEDTA, 0.42 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 20 min followed by a 10-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Oligonucleotides for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase New England Biolabs and purified with MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 0.2 ng (50,000 cpm) of the oligonucleotide probe and 0.5 μg of nuclear extract were routinely used in the binding reaction in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. To minimize nonspecific binding, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were included in the reaction. The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 25 min. To determine specificity and relative affinity, the reactions may contain a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides as competitors. DNA-protein complexes were separated by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at room temperature in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager plates for imaging (Storm680; Molecular Dynamics). Total cellular RNA was prepared by the Tri reagent method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc). For Northern blot hybridization, RNA was denatured by the glyoxal procedure, fractionated through 1.2% agarose gels, and blotted onto Biotrans (ICN) nylon membranes (22Collins S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9067-9070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were prepared by random primer extension (Prime-It RmT; Stratagene) of the purified DNA fragments in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity > 2 × 109 dpm/μg DNA. The DNA fragments that were used as probes were obtained from the following sources. A fragment specific for the mouse UCP2 was prepared as described in Ref. 2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nature Genetics. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar. A rat cDNA probe for cyclophilin was used as an internal hybridization/quantitation standard. Blots were hybridized and washed as previously described (23Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar, 24Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of hybridization signals was quantified by a phosphorimager (ImageQuant/Storm) and normalized to the values for cyclophilin. We and others have previously shown that PPARγ agonists are able to increase UCP2 mRNA levels in adipocytes and muscle cells (1Aubert J. Champigny O. Saint-Marc P. Negrel R. Collins S. Ricquier D.

Fig. 1 Ashows that UCP2 mRNA is present at relatively high levels in HIB-1B brown and D1 white preadipocyte and C2C12 myoblast cell lines. Treatment of these cells for 24 h with the thiazolidinedione BRL49653, a PPARγ ligand, and agonist (26Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar) results in a 2-fold increase of UCP2 mRNA in all cell lines. Note that these results in HIB-1B cells recapitulate our previously reported findings (1Aubert J. Champigny O. Saint-Marc P. Negrel R. Collins S. Ricquier D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 238: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To analyze the mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the mouse UCP2 gene, and to test whether PPARγ affects the activity of the UCP2 promoter, a fragment of the mouse UCP2 promoter region from position −7359 to +12 was isolated, sequenced, and subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector. This DNA fragment spans the entire region between the last exon of UCP3 and the first exon of UCP2 (4Surwit R.S. Wang S. Petro A.E. Sanchis D. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4061-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, and consistent with the Northern blot data of Fig. 1 A, BRL49653 was able to stimulate transcriptional activity of the 7.3-kb fragment of the UCP2 promoter in all cell lines tested. Moreover, cotransfection of the 7.3-kb UCP2 promoter construct with an expression vector containing PPARγ (Fig. 1 B) led to a similar 2-fold increase in UCP2 promoter activity. However, simultaneous agonist treatment and cotransfection with PPARγ-expressing vector did not produce a significant cumulative effect, possibly indicating saturation of PPARγ-dependent stimulatory activity on the UCP2 promoter. Such agonist-independent responses to PPARγ have been observed by others (27Werman A. Hollenberg A. Solanes G. Bjorbaek C. Vidal-Puig A.J. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20230-20235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To identify regulatory sequences that are important for transcriptional control of the UCP2 gene, including the response to PPARγ, we created a series of deletion constructs of the UCP2 promoter as shown in Fig.2 A. The transcriptional activity of these constructs was analyzed by transient transfection in D1, HIB-1B, and C2C12 cells (Fig. 2, B–D). Fig. 2 shows that the largest fragment of the UCP2 promoter (−7.3 kb/+12 bp) is able to increase luciferase activity of the reporter construct by 50–150-fold depending on the cell line, whereas the activity of a minimal promoter (−44/+12 bp) is only 1.5–2-fold above empty vector. Deletion of the region between −7.3 and −5 kb reduces promoter activity by 2–3-fold in HIB-1B and C2C12 (Fig. 2, B andD) but had no effect in D1 cells (Fig. 2 C) or in C3H10T1/2 cells (data not shown). Although further deletions between positions −5 kb and −86 bp had no significant effect on activity, deletion of the region between positions −86 and −44 led to a dramatic 25–50-fold depression of activity, indicating that this region is indeed a major contributor to the overall expression of the UCP2 gene in all cell lines. Having established the pattern of basal activity of these deletion fragments, we next examined the activity of these regions in cells treated with BRL49653, as well as cotransfected with PPARγ. As shown in TableI, deletion of the sequence up to −86 bp still retained PPARγ-dependent stimulation of UCP2 promoter activity equivalent to the −7.3-kb fragment. However, deletion of the region between −86 and −44 bp resulted in a total loss of PPARγ-dependent activity, indicating that this region of the UCP2 gene is necessary not only for basal activity but also for regulation by PPARγ.Table IEffect of thiazolidinediones and PPARγ on UCP2 promoter deletions−7.3 kb−5.0 kb−86 bp−44bpBRL2.40 ± 0.23**p < 0.001; significantly different from basal activity by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Newman-Keuls test.

Open table in a new tab Because our data establish that the −86/−44 region of the mouse UCP2 promoter is a major locus of control in cell lines of fat and muscle origin, in this series of experiments we focused on identifying the elements and transcription factors involved in regulation of this region. Examination of the sequence of the −86/−44 region of the UCP2 promoter of mouse revealed that this region has no significant homology with any known PPARγ response element (see Fig. 4). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, PPARγ does not bind to the −86/−44 fragment in HIB-1B nuclear extracts, and this region does not compete for PPARγ binding versus a bona fide PPRE from the acyl-CoA oxidase promoter (AGGACAAAGGTCA) (28Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The inability of this −86/−44 UCP2 region to bind PPARγ indicates that stimulation of the UCP2 promoter by PPARγ must be indirect, utilizing other transcription factors or/and cofactors interacting with this region. As Fig. 4 shows, the −86/−44 region of the mouse UCP2 promoter contains several putative regulatory elements that are also found in active promoter regions of other genes involved in energy metabolism. These elements include Sp1 (−86/CTCCGCCTC/−76), sterol response element (SRE) (−74/TCACGCCAC/−66), and a double E-Box-like motif (CACGCC) separated by 5 bases found in several genes critical for energy metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 29Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and that can also be recognized by SRE-binding proteins (SREBPs) (30Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).Figure 3PPAR γ does not bind to the −86/−44 region of the mouse UCP2 promoter. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HIB-1B cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In gel shift assays [32P]-radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing PPRE of the ACOX gene (GGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACG) or the −86/−44 region of the UCP2 promoter (see Fig. 4) were incubated with HIB-1B nuclear extract for 25 min at room temperature. Anti-PPARγ antibody (PPAR-AB) (SC-7196X; Santa Cruz) or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added to the reaction at the same time as labeled probe. The dark arrowshows the PPARγ-specific band, and the open arrow shows antibody supershift. Lanes 1–4 contain radiolabeled ACOX PPRE, and lanes 5–8 contain the radiolabeled −86/−44 region of the UCP2 promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether these putative elements were capable of binding transcription factors we performed a series of gel shift assay experiments with in vitro-translated transcription factors or nuclear extracts. The results in Fig.5 A show that the −84/−76 element has transcription factor binding activity similar to an Sp1 consensus element. An oligonucleotide containing this region (−86/GGCTCCGCCTCGTCACG/−70) is able to compete efficiently with an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (CGCCCCGCCCCGATCGA), whereas mutation of the core region (−86/GGCTCTACCTCGTCACG/−70) disrupts this binding. Fig.5 B shows that antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 are able to supershift bound proteins, and a mixture of all three antisera resulted in complete supershift of this major binding species. The transcription factor ADD1/SREBP1 has been shown to have the unique ability to bind two distinct regulatory elements, SRE and E-Box (31Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The SRE (consensus sequence, 5′-TCACNCCAC-3′; reviewed in Ref. 30Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) is found in the promoter regions of several genes involved in lipid metabolism, including fatty acid synthase and the low density lipoprotein receptor (see Fig. 4). The −78/−62 region of the mouse UCP2 promoter, containing a putative SRE (−74/TCACGCCAC/−66), is able to specifically bind ADD1/SREBP1 as confirmed by the ability of anti-SREBP1 antibody to supershift the binding species (Fig.6 B). Surprisingly, the region −71/−44 containing two E-Box motifs does not show significant affinity for ADD1/SREBP1. Several studies have established that double E-Box elements are associated with the so-called insulin/glucose response region of such genes as spot 14 (S14) and liver-specific pyruvate kinase and are recognized by upstream stimulatory factor (USF) family transcription factors (29Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, an oligonucleotide comprising this region of the UCP2 promoter (−71/−44) specifically binds in vitro-translated USF1 and USF2 transcription factors and binds USF1 protein in the nuclear extracts from HIB-1B cells.Figure 7Region −71/−44 specifically binds USF1 and USF2 transcription factors. A, USF1 and USF2 werein vitro-translated with the TnT® coupled transcription/translation system (Promega).

B, the −86/−44 and −71/−44 oligonucleotides bind USF1 in HIB-1B nuclear extract. Specified oligonucleotides were incubated with HIB-1B nuclear extract as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For supershift analysis antibodies against USF1 (sc-8983X; Santa Cruz) or USF2 (sc-861X; Santa Cruz) were added to the reaction, together with the labeled probe.Arrows indicate USF1- and USF2-specific bands (filled) or antibody supershift (open).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having shown that these three motifs are capable of binding their factors in gel shift experiments, we next proceeded to determine which of these regions might be important for transcriptional activity of the UCP2 enhancer. Therefore, we introduced further deletions, as well as point mutations, in the −86/−44 region of the UCP2 promoter and used these constructs in transient transfection assays. TableII depicts the specific mutations made, and Fig. 8 A presents these schematically. When transfected into all cell lines, deletion of the sequence between positions −86 and −76, containing the Sp1 motif, or a point mutation of two bases in this region (−86M1) reduces activity of the reporter gene by 70% (Fig. 8 B). Further deletion of five more bases to position −71 disrupts SRE located between −76 and −67, but this mutation did not affect transcriptional activity of the UCP2 promoter. The region between −71 and −44 contains a direct repeat of two imperfect E-Boxes separated by five bases (see Fig. 4). Fig. 8 shows that point mutations in either the upstream or downstream E-Box motifs result in a significant loss of transcriptional activity. Complete deletion of the upstream E-Box to position −58 reduced activity to the level of the minimal UCP2 promoter (−44/+12) indicating that both E-Boxes are necessary for promoter activity. Interestingly, mutations replacing two bases in the spacer region between the E-Boxes do not affect transcriptional activity. However, insertion of three additional bases between E-Boxes again reduces promoter activity, highlighting the importance of the precise positioning of the two parts of the repeat relative to each other.Table IIDeletion and point mutations in the −86/−44 enhancer region of the UCP2 promoterSequencePositionNameGGCTCCGCCTCGTCACGCCACGCCCCGACCACGCCCTCTAGA86–44−86GGCTCTACCTCGTCACGCCACGCCCCGACCACGCCCTCTAGA86–44−86M1CGTCACGCCACGCCCCGACCACGCCCTCTAGA76–44−76CGCCACGCCCCGACCACGCCCTCTAGA71–44−71CGCCTAGCCCCGACCACGCCCTCTAGA71–44M1CGCCACGCCCCGACCTAGCCCTCTAGA71–44M2CGCCACGCCCCTTCCACGCCCTCTAGA71–44M3CGCCACGCCCCGTTTACCACGCCCTCTAGA71–44MI3CCACGCCCTCTAGA58–44−58 Open table in a new tab Given our results in Table I that PPARγ responsiveness is retained within this small proximal promoter region, and the complex multipartite character of this enhancer, we next sought to narrow down which of these sequences might be important for PPARγ-dependent stimulation. We again used our series of point mutations and deletions of the −86/−44 region. Fig.9 demonstrates that despite deletion of the −86/−72 region, PPARγ-dependent stimulation was retained, indicating that PPARγ acts through elements in the −71/−44 region. However, point mutations disrupting either of the E-Boxes (mutants M1 and M2) led to a complete loss of UCP2 promoter responsiveness to PPARγ. Identical results were obtained when the activity of these deletions was examined in the absence/presence of BRL49653 (data not shown). Thus, from these data we conclude that stimulation of the UCP2 gene by PPARγ requires transcription factors or coactivators interacting with the double E-Box-containing region. PPARγ is best known as a key transcriptional regulator of adipocyte differentiation, stimulating transcription of many genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Adipocyte differentiation is considered to be regulated by the interplay of three families of transcription factors, PPARγ, C/EBPα, and ADD1/SREBP1 (32Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and like most tissues (33Arnone M.I. Davidson E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1851-1864PubMed Google Scholar) it is characterized by a cascade activation of genes that includes other transcription factors and their targets. However, the powerful role of PPARγ to regulate other transcription factors is highlighted by the fact that PPARγ-specific agonists alone can induce adipose differentiation and the expression of C/EBPs even in fibroblasts ectopically expressing PPARγ (34Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar, 35El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that PPARγ activation leads to increased UCP2 expression, and we defined the −86/−44 region of the promoter as responsible for stimulation by PPARγ. However, as we show, PPARγ does not bind to this −86/−44 region, suggesting that its role is indirect and likely involves other transcription factors. Parenthetically, PPARγ lacking its DNA-binding domain was unable to stimulate UCP2 promoter activity (data not shown), indicating that at some level DNA binding of PPARγ is required. Instead, the −86/−44 region is composed of three overlapping putative elements, Sp1, SRE, and a double E-Box. Each of these sequences is capable of binding multiple proteins in nuclear extracts, including Sp1 members, SREBP, and the USFs, respectively. Our point mutation analysis showed that the E-Box motif is required for PPARγ responsiveness. The ability of USF1 and USF2 to bind to the E-Box-containing region (−71/−44) in our experiments makes these transcription factors likely candidates for mediating the effect of PPARγ on the UCP2 gene. However, we cannot rule out a role for SREBP because of the known dual specificity of SREBP to interact with both the SRE and E-Boxes (30Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Another possibility that we must consider in future work is that the SRE frequently requires the presence of other active elements such as Sp1 or NF-Y in close proximity. For example, mutation of the Sp1 element, positioned next to the SRE site in the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter, abolished the response of this gene to sterol regulation (36Bennett M.K. Ngo T.T. Athanikar J.N. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13025-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the double E-Box element of the mouse S14 gene is regulated by glucose through as yet unidentified factor(s) that were clearly not USFs (38Koo S.H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, coactivators must also be considered as candidate mediators of the PPARγ response on the UCP2 gene. Wu et al. (41Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) showed that over-expression of PGC1 led to increased expression of endogenous UCP2, along with increased oxygen consumption and uncoupled respiration. In the cells we have studied, expression of PGC1 is rapidly increased in response to PPARγ stimulation. Our preliminary studies, together with the data of Monsalve et al. (39Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), indicate that PGC1 increases expression of the UCP2 promoter. Considering the ability of PGC-1 to interact with a number of other nuclear receptors and coactivators (40Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar, 41Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) it is possible that PGC1, together with (an)other transcription factor(s), serves to mediate the PPARγ response on the UCP2 promoter. All of these possibilities remain to be explored.

https://openalex.org/W2000390556,"In acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with t(8;21), the transcription factor AML1 is juxtaposed to the zinc finger nuclear protein ETO (Eight-Twenty-One), resulting in transcriptional repression of AML1 target genes. ETO has been shown to interact with corepressors, such as N-CoR and mSin3A to form complexes containing histone deacetylases. To define regions of ETO required for maximal repressor activity, we analyzed amino-terminal deletions in a transcriptional repression assay. We found that ETO mutants lacking the first 236 amino acids were not affected in their repressor activity, whereas a further deletion of 85 amino acids drastically reduced repressor function and high molecular weight complex formation. This latter mutant can still homodimerize and bind to N-CoR but shows only weak binding to mSin3A. Furthermore, we could show that a “core repressor domain” comprisingnervy homology region 2 and its amino- and carboxyl-terminal flanking sequences recruits mSin3A and induces transcriptional repression. These results suggest that mSin3A and N-CoR bind to ETO independently and that both binding sites cooperate to maximize ETO-mediated transcriptional repression. Thus, ETO has a modular structure, and the interaction between the individual elements is essential for the formation of a stable repressor complex and efficient transcriptional repression. In acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with t(8;21), the transcription factor AML1 is juxtaposed to the zinc finger nuclear protein ETO (Eight-Twenty-One), resulting in transcriptional repression of AML1 target genes. ETO has been shown to interact with corepressors, such as N-CoR and mSin3A to form complexes containing histone deacetylases.

Coactivator complexes containing histone acetyl transferases, such as p300/CBP and P/CAF, play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and facilitate transcriptional activation by acetylating conserved lysine residues of the amino-terminal tails of core histones (1Imhof A.

Similarly, high molecular weight complexes consisting of histone deacetylases and corepressors such as N-CoR/SMRT, mSin3 and ETO1(Eight-Twenty-One or MTG8) induce transcriptional repression when recruited by transcription factors (3Glass C.K.

Apart from the association of ETO with transcriptional repression, the physiological role of the nuclear protein ETO is still largely unknown. ETO was first identified in a frequent form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation t(8;21) (13Erickson P. Gao J. Chang K.S. Look T. Whisenant E. Raimondi S. Lasher R. Trujillo J. Rowley J. Drabkin H. Blood. 1992; 80: 1825-1831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the AML1/ETO fusion gene, which occurs in about 40% of cases of acute leukemia with the M2 French-American-British subtype (14Nucifora G. Rowley J.D. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1994; 14: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Nucifora G. Rowley J.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the AML1/ETO translocation product, the transactivation domain of transcription factor AML1, which would normally bind to the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP (16Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), is replaced by almost the entire ETO protein. Thus, the fusion protein recruits a corepressor complex containing HDAC activity instead of the coactivators p300/CBP. The translocation partner ETO, normally expressed in brain, shows strong homology with theDrosophila nervy gene, especially in four regions named nervy homology regions (NHR 1–4). The highly conserved NHR4 region contains two zinc finger motifs and has been reported to be essential for the interaction between ETO and N-CoR/SMRT (10Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B.

Westendorf J.J. Linggi B. Patten A. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Huynh K.D. Bardwell V.J. Lavinsky R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C. Seto E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell.

Another conserved element is the amphipathic helix structure, NHR2 (20Mao S. Frank R.C. Zhang J. Miyazaki Y. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which induces homodimerization and binding to homologous family members, such as MTGR1 (21Kitabayashi I. Ida K. Morohoshi F.

Recent reports indicate that the oncogenic potential and transcriptional repressor activity of the translocation product AML1/ETO requires NHR2-induced dimerization and oligomerization (22Minucci S. Maccarana M. Cioce M. De Luca P. Gelmetti V. Segalla S. Di Croce L. Giavara S. Matteucci C. Gobbi A. Bianchini A. Colombo E. Schiavoni I. Badaracco G. Hu X. Lazar M. Landsberger N. Nervi C.

Despite the insight into the function of the oncogeneAML1/ETO, the precise physiological role of ETO and its family members is not yet clear, because they show no DNA binding activity. However, they can potentiate transcriptional repression induced by other transcription factors, such as the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein, by synergistically recruiting corepressors and histone deacetylase (23Melnick A.M. Westendorf J.J. Polinger A. Carlile G.W. Arai S. Ball H.J. Lutterbach B. Hiebert S.W. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this study we define a “core repressor domain” in ETO, which contributes strongly to repressor activity, homo- and heterodimerization, and high molecular weight complex formation. Our data indicate that multiple regions of ETO work synergistically to repress transcription but have little repressor activity on their own. These data give new insights into the formation and function of the corepressor complex and may help to identify new strategies for the treatment of AML1/ETO-induced leukemias. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), 50 units per ml penicillin, 50 μg per ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression plasmids for GAL4-ETO fusion proteins were generated by subcloning the diverse ETO DNA fragments in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (residues 1–147) of pCMX-GAL4 (5Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). AdditionalXhoI sites were introduced into pcDNA3-ETO (kindly provided by Olaf Heidenreich, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany) by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the following positions (amino acid residues indicated): pcDNA3-ETO/XhoI-133 (upstream primer 5′-CCTTACTACCCTCGAGCAGTTTGGCA-3′); pcDNA3-ETO/XhoI-234 (upstream primer 5′-TTTCGTTCACCTCGAGAAGCAGCTCT-3′); pcDNA3-ETO/XhoI-323 (upstream primer 5′-CCACAGGGACCTCGAGGACAGAA ACA-3′); pcDNA3-ETO/XhoI-399 (upstream primer 5′-GTACAGTGACCTCGAGGACTTAAAAA-3′). TheXhoI-XbaI(blunt) fragments of ETO were then cloned between the SalI-EcoRV restriction sites of pCMX-GAL4. To construct GAL4-ETOΔ1–501, a SalI site was created in pcDNA3-ETO at residue 500. TheSalI-XbaI(blunt) fragment was then inserted between the SalI and EcoRV sites of pCMX-GAL4. Gal4-ETOΔ1–236ΔC was constructed by inserting two XbaI sites in Gal4-ETOΔ1–236 at residues 382 (upstream primer 5′-CTAAAGCGGTGTCTAGAAGCAGACC-3′) and 430 (upstream primer 5′-GACGCGCATCTAGAATTCCTTCAC-3′) and by removing the sequence in between the two XbaI sites. To generate GAL4-ETOΔ1–236ΔNHR2, two XbaI sites were created in Gal4-ETOΔ1–236 at residues 337 (upstream primer 5′-GCATGGCACACGTCTAGAAGAAATGATTG-3′) and 382 (upstream primer 5′-CTAAGGCGGTGTCTAGAAGCAGACC-3′). The sequence between these two sites was then deleted. GAL4-NHR2+C was created by removing the sequence in between the EcoRI sites (from residue 432 to the carboxyl terminus) in GAL4-ETOΔ1–321. GAL4-N was constructed by deleting the sequence in between theMscI and EcoRI sites (from residue 306 to the carboxyl terminus) in GAL4-ETOΔ1–236. To generate GAL4-NHR2 and GAL4-C, the corresponding inserts were cut with SalI andHindIII (blunt) out of pGEX-AHK-NHR2 and pGEX-AHK-C (see below), respectively, and subcloned into the SalI andEcoRV sites of pCMX-GAL4. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing on an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion constructs were generated by subcloning the ETO DNA fragments, in frame, with the GST domain of pGEX-AHK (5Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). GST·AML1/ETO and GST·ETO were constructed by inserting aSalI restriction site in pcDNA3-AML1/ETO and pcDNA3-ETO (both provided from Olaf Heidenreich, Tübingen, Germany), respectively, immediately in front of the coding region and by subcloning the SalI-XbaI fragments into the respective sites of pGEX-AHK. GST·NHR3+4 was generated by inserting the EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pcDNA3-ETO between the respective sites of pGEX-AHK. GST·NHR4 was created by subcloning the SalI-XbaI fragment of pcDNA3-ETO-SalI-512 into the respective sites of pGEX-AHK. GST·N, GST·N+NHR2, GST·NHR2, GST·NHR2+C, and GST·C were generated by ligation of theXbaI-HindIII-digested polymerase chain reaction products of pcDNA3-ETO into the respective sites of pGEX-AHK. For the amplification of polymerase chain reaction fragments, the following primers were used: 5′-CGCTCTAGACTCGATGTGAACGAAAACGGG-3′ as a common upstream primer for GST·N and GST·N+NHR2, 5′-CGCTCTAGAAGGGACCTCAGGGACAGAAAC-3′ as a common upstream primer for GST·NHR2 and GST·NHR2+C, 5′-CGCTCTAGAGCAGACCGGGAAGAATTG-3′ as upstream primer for GST·C, 5′-CGTCCCAAGCTTGTTTCTGTCCCTGAGGTCCCT-3′ as downstream primer for GST·N, 5′-CGTCCCAAGCTTCAATTCTTCCCGGTCTGC-3′ as a common downstream primer for GST·N+NHR2 and GST·NHR2, and 5′-CGTCCCAAGCTTGAATTCCCGATGCGCGTCTAG-3′ as a common downstream primer for GST·NHR2+C and GST·C. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. 293T cells were transfected in triplicate with 0.75 μg of the indicated pCMV-Gal4-ETO plasmids, 1.5 μg of 2xUAS-thymidine kinase-luciferase plasmid (5Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), and 1 μg of a promoterless renilla luciferase plasmid by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (5Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) following the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Repression is given relative to the luciferase activity obtained by the DNA binding domain of Gal4 alone. Experiments were repeated at least five times, and results are indicated as the means with S.D. Assays were performed as described elsewhere (5Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In short, GST and the indicated GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 codon+ cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and equal amounts of each were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Full-length ETO as well as the indicated ETO fragments were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For precipitation assays, equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were incubated with adequate amounts of the ETO-TNT reaction mixture in 100 μl of PPI buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl flouride (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at 37 °C. The beads were washed four times, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The gel was then fixed in gel drying solution (Bio-Rad) for 30 min, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. In vitrotranslated mSin3A was incubated with the indicated35S-labeled translated ETO polypeptides in 50 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at 37 °C. 1 μg of anti-mSin3A rabbit polyclonal antibody (K20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or 1 μg of anti-GAL4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was added to the mixture, and immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C. 35 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was then added for 1 h to precipitate the immune complexes. The immune complexes were washed five times with NETN buffer, the precipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. For coprecipitation experiments using whole cell extracts, 293T cells (5 × 106 cells seeded in 10-mm-diameter dishes 24 h prior to transfection) were transfected with 20 μg of the diverse Gal4-ETO constructs. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in NETN buffer supplemented with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh). After centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and immunoprecipitated for 1 h with 1 μg of anti-mSin3A primary antibody. 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added for 1 h to collect the immune complexes, which were then washed five times with NETN buffer. The precipitated proteins were eluted from the immune complexes by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli buffer (ROTH), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roth). Western blots were blocked for 2 h with 5% milk and incubated with anti-Gal4 (DBD) primary antibody (RK5C1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing the blots were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. After further washing, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). 500 μl of cell extracts obtained from 293T cells transfected with Gal4-ETO deletion mutants were loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to determine the native molecular weight. The column was run in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PAA, Linz, Austria) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for the presence of complexes containing Gal4-ETO mutants by Western blotting with an anti-ETO antibody (Calbiochem-Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, UK) or an anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. To functionally dissect the repressor domains of ETO and to determine their role in ETO-mediated repression, we constructed a series of amino-terminal deletion mutants leaving NHR4, the presumed binding site for the corepressor N-CoR, intact (Fig.1 A). Like other corepressors, the ETO protein cannot bind to DNA by itself. We therefore used Gal4-ETO fusion proteins to repress transcription from a reporter construct containing two Gal4 binding sites upstream of a thymidine kinase promoter driving firefly luciferase gene expression (2xUAS-thymidine kinase-luciferase) in transient transfection assays in 293T cells. Transfection efficiencies were normalized to the activity of a cotransfected promoterless renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pΔprom-Renilla Luciferase). A fusion protein of GAL4 and wild type ETO (Gal4-ETOwt) showed 80-fold reduction in luciferase activity compared with a control plasmid, expressing only the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 1 B). The repressor activity of all other constructs was given relative to that of Gal4-ETOwt, which was set as 100% repressor activity. The deletion of the first 236 amino acids of ETO including NHR1 (Gal4 Δ1–236) did not significantly affect repressor activity, indicating that the amino-terminal region is not essential for transcriptional repression (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of a further 85 amino acids strongly reduced repressor activity to only 22.5% of ETOwt levels. This construct (Gal4 Δ1–321) lacks NHR1 and the region between NHR1 and NHR2 (Fig. 1 B), revealing a previously unrecognized role of this region in transcriptional repression. Gal4 constructs containing either NHR3 and NHR4 (Gal4 Δ1–401) or NHR4 alone (Gal4 Δ1–510) showed only 5.4 or 3.8% transcriptional repression, respectively, as compared with Gal4-ETOwt (Fig. 1 B). All GAL4-ETO constructs were expressed at similar levels, as estimated from Western blots of lysates obtained from transfected 293T cells (data not shown). The observation that extended amino-terminal deletions of ETO (ETOΔ1–401 and ETOΔ1–510) display drastically reduced repressor activity, prompted us to investigate whether they would be impaired in respect to binding to the corepressor N-CoR. In pull-down experiments with GST fusions of ETO mutants, a fusion protein containing NHR3 and NHR4 (GST·NHR3+4) but not NHR4 alone (GST·NHR4) interacted with N-CoR (Fig. 2). Together with the repressor activity (Fig. 1), these data suggest that N-CoR binding per se is not sufficient to mediate significant transcriptional repression. We mapped the minimal ETO binding site of N-CoR between aa 1147 and 1213, because a Gal4-N-CoR construct containing aa 970–1258 (Fig. 2), but not a smaller fragment (Gal4-N-CoR 970–1147) or a more carboxyl-terminal region (Gal4-N-CoR 1213–1502), can be precipitated by GST·NHR3+4 (data not shown). Because NHR3 and NHR4 do not have substantial repressor activity on their own, despite binding to N-CoR, we investigated which other regions in ETO contribute to repressor activity. To this end we generated internal and carboxyl-terminal deletions of a Gal4-ETO deletion mutant (Gal4-Δ1–236) that showed maximum repression in our assay system. Removing the region between NHR2 and NHR3 (Gal4-Δ1–236ΔC; Δaa 384–432) reduced repressor activity to 49.3% repression compared with 102.6% repression with Gal4-Δ1–236 (Fig. 3 B). To evaluate the role of NHR2, we deleted the NHR2 region to generate the construct Gal4-Δ1–236ΔNHR2. This deletion reduced transcriptional repression to 24.3% of Gal4-ETOwt levels (Fig. 3 B). To our surprise, a construct containing 196 amino acids, including the central NHR2 domain and surrounding regions (Gal4-CRD; aa 236–432) but lacking the N-CoR binding site, showed significant repressor activity (42.7% of Gal4-ETOwt; Fig. 3 B). This region of ETO was designated “core repressor domain” (CRD). Gal4-ETO fusions containing only subfragments of the core repressor domain were considerably less effective in repressing transcription. A fusion of Gal4 with a region between NHR1 and NHR2 (Gal4-N; aa 236–306) conferred only 1.7% repression, whereas a region between NHR2 and NHR3 (Gal4-C; aa 384–432) or the NHR2 region alone (Gal4-NHR2; aa 321–388) induced 8.8 and 13.5% repression, respectively (Fig. 3 B). From these data we conclude that ETO requires all but its first 236 amino acids to induce maximal repression, whereby a region containing NHR2 and neighboring amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences (CRD) represents the smallest deletion construct conferring significant repressor activity on its own. Based on these results we tested whether the core repressor domain binds to another corepressor molecule, mSin3A. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments using in vitrotranslated mSin3A together with in vitro translated35S-labeled mutants of ETO. An antibody against mSin3A coprecipitated full-length ETO, amino-terminally deleted ETO (Gal4-Δ1–236), and carboxyl-terminally deleted ETO (Gal4-CRD), indicating that the interaction domain is placed within the core repressor domain (Fig. 4). To further map the ETO-mSin3A interaction, we tested internal deletion mutants of ETO. Interestingly, constructs where NHR2 (Gal4-Δ1–236ΔNHR2), the carboxyl-terminal region between NHR2 and NHR3 (Gal4-Δ1–236ΔC), or the amino-terminal 85 amino acids (Gal4-Δ1–321) are deleted showed reduced or no binding to mSin3A (Fig. 4). As expected, no mSin3A interaction was seen with a construct containing only the carboxyl-terminal NHR3 and NHR4 regions (Gal4-Δ1–401). Furthermore, we could not detect coprecipitation of mSin3A with ETO deletions that contained only the amino-terminal (Gal4-N) or the carboxyl-terminal sequences (Gal4-C; data not shown) surrounding NHR2 or NHR2 (Gal4-NHR2) alone. However, ETO mutants containing NHR2 and the carboxyl-terminal region (Gal4-NHR2+C; aa 321–432) or NHR2 and the amino-terminal region (Gal4-N+NHR2; aa 236–389) were still able to interact weakly with mSin3A (Fig. 4). These results were confirmed using cellular extracts from 293T cells transfected with Gal4-ETO deletion constructs. All ETO mutants containing the core repressor domain could be coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody against Sin3A (Fig. 5). We found strong interaction of Sin3A with Gal4-ETOwt, Gal4-Δ1–236, and the construct containing only the core repressor domain (Gal4-CRD) by coprecipitating 10 to 20% of ETO protein in cellular lysates with an antibody to Sin3A. In contrast, 10-fold less ETO protein (1–2% of input) could be coprecipitated with Sin3A from cellular lysates that expressed ETO mutants lacking the amino-terminal region of the core repressor domain (Gal4-Δ1–321) or the NHR2 region (Gal4-Δ1–401). No interaction could be found with shorter mutants consisting only of NHR2 and the neighboring carboxyl-terminal region (Gal4-NHR2+C) or a Gal4 fusion with NHR3 and NHR4 (Gal4-Δ1–401) (Fig. 5). The ETO binding site within mSin3A was mapped to the paired amphipathic helix 2 domain in mSin3A (data not shown), which has also been described to interact with the repression domain of Mad I (24Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A.I. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 777-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Interaction of N-CoR and HDAC2 with ETO was only seen with the ETOwt construct but not with the construct containing the core repressor domain (data not shown). Because deletion of amino- or carboxyl-terminal sequences within the CRD led to impaired repressor activity, we investigated whether these mutants are defective in NHR2-mediated homodimerization. NHR2 has been shown to induce homo- and heterodimerization between ETO and related family members such as MTGR1 (21Kitabayashi I. Ida K. Morohoshi F. Yokoyama A. Mitsuhashi N. Shimizu K. Nomura N. Hayashi Y. Ohki M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All constructs containing the NHR2 domain, but not those lacking NHR2 (e.g. Gal4-Δ1–236ΔNHR2), were able to bind to GST·ETO in pull-down experiments, confirming the structural integrity of NHR2 (Fig. 6). Homodimerization was also seen in a construct, Gal4 Δ1–321, that showed only little repressor activity (22.5%, Fig. 1 B), indicating that ETO repressor activity depends only in part on the NHR2 amphipathic helix structure, whereas a proline-rich region amino-terminal to NHR2 appears to be critically required for maximum repressor activity. In a recent paper by Minucci et al. (22Minucci S. Maccarana M. Cioce M. De Luca P. Gelmetti V. Segalla S. Di Croce L. Giavara S. Matteucci C. Gobbi A. Bianchini A. Colombo E. Schiavoni I.

Cell. 2000; 5: 811-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), high molecular weight (HMW) complex formation was shown to be required for efficient repressor activity of AML-ETO, PML-RAR, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-RAR. To investigate the ability of our constructs to form HMW complexes, we expressed various GAL4-ETO mutants in 293T cells and determined the molecular weight of the complexes by size-exclusion chromatography. HMW complexes obtained with Gal4 fusions of full-length ETO had an apparent molecular mass of 1,600 kDa. Similarly, ETO deletions Δ1–236, Gal4-Δ1–236ΔNHR2, and Δ1–321 formed complexes with the same molecular weight, but the formation of smaller complexes, which were eluted in all fractions, from 500 to 1,600 kDa could be noted, probably because of destabilization of the 1,600-kDa complex. Furthermore, deletions within the CRD, such as deletion of the 85 amino acids amino-terminal to NHR2 (Gal4-Δ1–321) or an internal deletion of NHR2 (Gal4-Δ1–236ΔNHR2), shifted the peak elution volume to a lower molecular mass of about 990 kDa. A complete deletion of the CRD in the construct Gal4 Δ1–401 had its elution maximum at 500 kDa, similar to a Gal4 fusion containing the CRD alone (Gal4-CRD), whereas the construct Gal4 Δ1–510 was eluted in its monomeric and dimeric form only (Fig. 7). These data highlight the importance of the integrity of the CRD in HMW complex formation and in ETO-induced repression, suggesting that both phenomena correlate. In summary, our data clearly indicate that various regions of ETO cooperate to mediate repressor activity. The amphipathic helix structure of NHR2 and adjacent carboxyl- and amino-terminal sequences provide the structural basis for strong mSin3A binding, which contributes to transcriptional repression and HMW complex formation. N-CoR binding through NHR3 and NHR4, however, does not mediate repression by itself but is required in cooperation with additional factors for maximum transcriptional repression. Our data indicate that transcriptional repression of the leukemia-associated protein ETO is based on a modular structure that mediates high molecular weight complex formation and maximum transcriptional repression. Furthermore, we have defined a core repressor domain containing NHR2 and the neighboring carboxyl- and amino-terminal sequences that mediates strong interaction with Sin3A and represents the smallest deletion with significant, albeit reduced repressor activity. NHR1 (25Morohoshi F. Mitani S. Mitsuhashi N. Kitabayashi I. Takahashi E. Suzuki M. Munakata N. Ohki M.

This is in agreement with published data showing that deletion of NHR1 does not affect ETO-mediated repression of the MDR-1 promoter. In this context it is worth noting that although a lack of NHR1 did not effect repressor activity, it destabilized the formation of high molecular weight complexes, as indicated by the appearance of smaller-sized complexes compared with ETOwt. The fourth homology region (NHR4) consists of two zinc finger domains that are necessary for ETO-N-CoR/SMRT interaction. Deletion, or even point mutations, of this region completely abolish binding of ETO to N-CoR/SMRT but reduce transcriptional repression only partially (10Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B.

This is in agreement with our data showing that the core repressor domain alone mediates 50% of ETOwt repressor activity, although it recruits only Sin3A but not N-CoR. Furthermore, we present evidence that the NHR4 zinc finger motif alone is not capable of interacting with the ETO binding region in N-CoR, which we mapped within N-CoR repressor domain III. ETO-N-CoR interaction requires both the presence of the zinc finger motif and the adjacent helical structure of NHR3. In experiments similar to ours, Zhang et al. (29Zhang J. Hug B.A. Huang E.Y. Chen C.W. Gelmetti V. Maccarana M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) could also demonstrate binding of the highly homologous corepressor SMRT to an ETO mutant containing NHR3 and NHR4 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. We conclude that NHR4 is necessary but not sufficient to recruit N-CoR. Interestingly, the binding site for N-CoR (NHR3 and NHR4) did not induce transcriptional repression, suggesting that the interaction may be unable to efficiently recruit histone deacetylases. However, N-CoR binding may serve to enhance repression by stabilizing the corepressor complex with other corepressors that are needed to induce repressor activity. Recent evidence indicates that the oncogene AML1/ETOrequires homodimerization, mediated by the amphipathic helix structure NHR2 (17Lutterbach B. Sun D. Schuetz J. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3604-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Kitabayashi I. Ida K. Morohoshi F. Yokoyama A. Mitsuhashi N. Shimizu K. Nomura N. Hayashi Y. Ohki M. Mol. Cell.

Di Croce L. Giavara S. Matteucci C. Gobbi A. Bianchini A. Colombo E. Schiavoni I. Badaracco G. Hu X. Lazar M. Landsberger N. Nervi C. Pelicci P.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 811-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We were able to confirm that the stability and size of these complexes correlate with repressor function, entrusting an important role to the core repressor domain for the correct formation of HMW complexes. This was demonstrated with ETO constructs lacking structural elements of the CRD, such as NHR2, the amino-terminal 85 amino acids, or the carboxyl-terminal region, which not only had reduced repressor activity but also led to the formation of complexes with a lower molecular weight. Interestingly, both Gal4-ETO mutants lacking either the amino-terminal or the carboxyl-terminal region of the core repressor domain (Gal4-Δ1–321 and Gal4-Δ1–236ΔC) were still perfectly able to dimerize with full-length ETO, indicating that the amphipathic helix structure of NHR2 was functional. These ETO deletions were, however, severely impaired in binding to Sin3A. We conclude that repressor activity and HMW complex formation are not solely determined by the process of NHR2-induced dimerization but also through the affinity of the ETO molecule to Sin3A. In this context it is worth noting that only ETOwt or the deletion construct Gal4-Δ1–236 could be eluted in the same fraction as complexes containing Sin3A (data not shown). The ETO-Sin3A interaction, however, appears to be more complex than anticipated. We were still able to detect weak binding of Sin3A to ETO mutants lacking NHR2 and sequences amino-terminal of NHR2 in cellular lysates. Similar results have also been obtained in Cos-7 cells overexpressing mSin3A and ETO deletion mutants (10Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B. Patten A. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Huynh K.D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7176-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), showing that binding of mSin3A to ETO under these conditions occurs even in the absence of NHR2 (10Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B. Patten A. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Huynh K.D. Bardwell V.J. Lavinsky R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C. Seto E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7176-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This may indicate that Sin3A interacts with ETO not only directly, but also indirectly through other corepressor molecules (5Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 30Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C.

Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To reduce the possibility of indirect interactions via secondary molecules, we tested ETO-Sin3A interaction with in vitro translated proteins. These experiments, however, support our in vivodata showing weak interaction of mSin3A with ETO constructs lacking sequences of the core repressor domain. Our data favor a model in which complex structural requirements are needed for stable direct interaction of Sin3A with ETO, whereas the indirect interaction of Sin3A to ETO through binding to N-CoR and HDAC2 is not sufficient to induce repressor activity. Because Gal4-ETO mutants with deletions in the mSin3A binding site/core repressor domain were impaired in their ability to repress transcription, and neither the Sin3A binding site (CRD) nor the N-CoR binding site (NHR3 and NHR4) were able to induce maximum transcriptional repression or HMW complex formation by themselves, we conclude that these two major domains in ETO cooperate for optimal function. Although these results have been obtained in transient transfection assays and may not properly reflect the physiological situation at endogenous chromosomal loci (32Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), it raises the question why binding to one corepressor molecule is not sufficient for ETO to induce optimal repression. It appears that the corepressor complex requires a certain stability, possibly mediated by the interaction of corepressor molecules with each other. The concept that complexes with multiple interacting subunits are required in the process of transcriptional regulation has also been demonstrated for coactivator complexes containing histone acetylase activity (3Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The modular structure of ETO opens the possibility to interfere with one or more structural elements in the ETO molecule, thereby destabilizing complex formation and reducing repressor activity. This in turn may ultimately enable a therapeutic approach for the treatment of leukemias with the t(8;21) translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2125955139,"The TrkA receptor is activated primarily by nerve growth factor (NGF), but it can also be activated by high concentrations of neurotrophin 3 (NT-3). The pan-neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) strongly inhibits activation of TrkA by NT-3 but not by NGF. To examine the role of p75(NTR) in regulating the specificity of TrkA signaling, we expressed both receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Application of NGF or NT-3 to oocytes expressing TrkA alone resulted in efflux of (45)Ca(2+) by a phospholipase C-gamma-dependent pathway. Coexpression of p75(NTR) with TrkA inhibited (45)Ca(2+) efflux in response to NT-3 but not NGF. The inhibitory effect on NT-3 activation of TrkA increased with increasing expression of p75(NTR). Coexpression of a truncated p75(NTR) receptor lacking all but the first 9 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain inhibited NT-3 stimulation of (45)Ca(2+) efflux, whereas coexpression of an epidermal growth factor receptor/p75(NTR) chimera (extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of p75(NTR)) did not inhibit NT-3 signaling through TrkA. These studies demonstrated that the extracellular domain of p75(NTR) was necessary to inhibit NT-3 signaling through TrkA. Remarkably, p75(NTR) binding to NT-3 was not required to prevent signaling through TrkA, since occupying p75(NTR) with brain-derived neurotrophic factor or anti-p75 antibody (REX) did not rescue the ability of NT-3 to activate (45)Ca(2+) efflux. These data suggested a physical association between TrkA and p75(NTR). Documenting this physical interaction, we showed that p75(NTR) and TrkA could be coimmunoprecipitated from Xenopus oocytes. Our results suggest that the interaction of these two receptors on the cell surface mediated the inhibition of NT-3-activated signaling through TrkA."

The production of ceramide is associated with virtually every known stress stimulus, and thus, generation of this sphingolipid has been suggested as a universal feature of apoptosis. Recent studies suggest that an important component of cell death following diverse stress stimuli (e.g. interleukin-3 withdrawal, sodium arsenite treatment, and peroxide treatment) is the activation of the double-stranded RNA-activable protein kinase, PKR, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis (Ito, T., Jagus, R., and May, W. S. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 7455–7459). The recently discovered cellular PKR activator, RAX, is phosphorylated in association with PKR activation (Ito, T., Yang, M., and May, W. S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15427–15432). Since RAX is phosphorylated by an as yet undetermined SAPK and ceramide is a potent activator of SAPKs such as JNK, a role for ceramide in the activation of RAX might be possible. Results indicate that overexpression of exogenous RAX potentiates ceramide-induced killing. Furthermore, ceramide can potently inhibit protein synthesis. Since ceramide potently promotes RAX and eukaryotic initiation factor-2α phosphorylation, a possible role for ceramide in this process may involve the activation of PKR by RAX. Since 2-aminopurine, a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that has previously been shown to inhibit PKR, blocks both the potentiation of ceramide killing by RAX and ceramide-induced inhibition of protein synthesis, ceramide appears to promote PKR activation, at least indirectly.

However, until recently, much of what is known about PKR has been derived from its role in inhibiting host cell protein synthesis in response to viral infection, thereby activating the host antiviral defense mechanism (17Matthews M.B.

Consistent with this role, RAX/PACT has been shown to activate PKR in response to stress applications such as IL-3 withdrawal, sodium arsenite treatment, and peroxide treatment (22Ito T. Yang M.

Indeed, the generation of ceramide is so common during apoptosis that it has been considered a universal feature of this process (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 3Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar). Ceramide has been demonstrated to activate a number of stress-activated kinases, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK1 and JNK2 (4Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene.. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Google Scholar, 32Westwick J.K. Bielawaska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 22689-22692Google Scholar, 34Jarvis W.D. Fornari F.A.

Considering that ceramide is produced during diverse apoptotic stress applications and has been demonstrated to activate stress-activated kinases, it is possible that ceramide may regulate RAX. The findings presented indicate a novel signal pathway linking ceramide to the regulation of protein translation, via a mechanism involving RAX. These data point to a unique level of cellular homeostatic control involving this important second messenger molecule. All reagents used were purchased from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Murine leukemia NSF/N1.H7 cells and NSF/N1.H7 cells stably transfected with HA-RAX or vector control plasmid were maintained as previously described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.

Where appropriate, cells were treated with increasing doses of 2-aminopurine (Sigma) for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion, and apoptosis was determined by detecting DNA laddering in apoptotic cells as previously described (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl.

The immunoprecipitated protein was resuspended in sample buffer, and protein was subjected to vertical slab isoelectric focusing and immunoblot analysis with an anti-RAX polyclonal antibody as described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and eIF2α was analyzed by immunoprecipitation as previously described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.

Samples were electrophoresed on a 0.1% SDS-12% acrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C. The same blot was used for Western blotting with anti-eIF2α antiserum and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). Cells were treated with increasing doses of C2-ceramide for 30 min and lysed, and PKR was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKR antibody as previously described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated protein was electrophoresed on a 0.1% SDS-12% acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-RAX polyclonal antibody as described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). Cells were treated with C2-ceramide (0, 1, 10, or 50 μm) or C2-dihydroceramide (50 μm) for 30 min. Where indicated, cells were treated with 1 mm 2-AP for 30 min. Measurement of protein synthesis was performed as previously described (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 7455-7459Google Scholar). After treatment, ∼1 × 106 cell eq were incubated with l-U-14C-labeled amino acid mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 2 μCi/ml for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity in the acid-precipitable fraction was measured in a scintillation counter. Protein synthesis, which is required for cell growth, is inhibited by activated PKR (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 7455-7459Google Scholar). Ceramide is a potent apoptotic agent and inhibitor of cell growth (3Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar, 4Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene.. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Google Scholar, 5Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1999; 24: 224-225Google Scholar), yet the effect of ceramide on protein translation is unknown. To determine whether RAX, the first cellular activator of PKR to be discovered, can participate in a ceramide-mediated pathway, the effect of ceramide treatment was compared in cells stably expressing exogenous HA-RAX versusvector-only or parental control cells. Overexpression of RAX has previously been shown to accelerate the cell death of murine IL-3-dependent myeloid cells following IL-3 withdrawal or after treatment with apoptotic agents such as peroxide and sodium arsenite in the presence of IL-3 (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). Since ceramide is generated during virtually all known stress stimuli (2Smyth M.L. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Pharmacol... 1997; 41: 133-154Google Scholar, 3Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar), we tested whether stress activation of RAX may be mediated by ceramide. If ceramide can participate in RAX-mediated stress, it is predicted that RAX may sensitize cells to ceramide-induced cell death in a mechanism similar to that by which RAX sensitizes factor-dependent cells to killing following factor deprivation (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). The results revealed that cells expressing exogenous HA-RAX were at least 2.5-fold more sensitive to active C2-ceramide killing compared with vector-transfected or untransfected cells (Fig.1 A). The IC50 for the untransfected or vector-transfected cells treated with ceramide for 24 h was >50 μm, whereas the IC50 for cells overexpressing RAX was dramatically reduced to 18 μm. Cell killing resulted from apoptosis as determined by the classic pattern of DNA fragmentation observed (Fig. 1 B) (35Obeid L.M. Lindardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Google Scholar, 36Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 20296-20300Google Scholar). As a further control, cells overexpressing HA-RAX were also treated with an inactive C2-ceramide analog, C2-dihydroceramide (2Smyth M.L. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Pharmacol... 1997; 41: 133-154Google Scholar), at 50 μm. The inactive analog had no effect on cell viability (Fig.2). Although a role for RAX in ceramide-induced cell killing is suggested but not proven by these findings, it was initially unclear whether PKR is involved. Therefore, 2-AP, a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that has previously been shown to inhibit PKR (37DeBenedetti A. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem... 1983; 258: 14556-14562Google Scholar, 38Hu Y. Conway T.W. J. Interferon Res... 1993; 13: 323-328Google Scholar), was used. A high concentration of 2-AP (10 mm) was found to have no effect on cell viability. However, in cells overexpressing HA-RAX, 2-AP was found to protect cells from C2-ceramide-induced cell killing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Using a concentration of C2-ceramide that approximates the IC50 at 24 h (i.e. 18 μm), cells treated with ≥1 mm 2-AP were protected from ceramide-induced cell killing. These data strongly suggest a novel mechanism for ceramide-mediated apoptosis involving both RAX and PKR.Figure 2The PKR inhibitor 2-AP blocks ceramide-induced cell killing. NSF/N1.H7 cells overexpressing HA-RAX were treated for 24 h with 18 μmC2-ceramide or 50 μmC2-dihydroceramide. Varying concentrations of 2-AP were introduced to cells at the same time as C2-ceramide addition. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Data shown are means ± S.D. of triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ceramide is known to activate serine/threonine stress-activated kinases, including JNK (3Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar, 4Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene.. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Google Scholar, 5Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem.

Cancer Res... 1996; 2: 1-6Google Scholar). Since RAX is serine-phosphorylated by an as yet unidentified stress-activated kinase (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar), it is possible that a mechanism by which ceramide can induce PKR activation and inhibit protein synthesis is by promoting RAX phosphorylation and activation. Therefore, whether C2-ceramide could induce RAX phosphorylation was assessedin vivo. Previously, isoelectric focusing analysis revealed that exponentially growing NFS/N1.H7 cells contain predominantly a single unphosphorylated species of RAX with an approximate pI of 8.6, whereas stress applications to cells, including IL-3 deprivation or treatment of cells with sodium arsenite or thapsigargin, induces a prominent acidification (i.e. via phosphorylation) of RAX with a pI 8.3 (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). Thus, cells not exposed to stress stimuli contain primarily the unphosphorylated form of RAX, whereas stress treatment induces phosphorylation of RAX. The results demonstrated that ceramide could also induce the phosphorylation of RAX in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). Although little, if any, of the phosphorylated form of RAX (observed as the slower migrating band following vertical slab isoelectric focusing electrophoresis) could be detected by Western blot analysis of protein lysates from untreated cells or cells treated with a low concentration of C2-ceramide (i.e. 1 μm), cells treated with >10 μm C2-ceramide expressed virtually all RAX as a phosphoprotein (Fig. 3). Thus, ceramide appears to activate a RAX kinase. Since RAX phosphorylation promotes the activation of PKR by RAX (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar), it is likely that ceramide activates PKR. Co-immunoprecipitation studies have previously demonstrated that cellular activation of PKR strongly correlates with the association of PKR with RAX (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). To determine whether ceramide can promote RAX/PKR association, protein extracts from cells treated with increasing doses of C2-ceramide were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKR antiserum as previously described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). RAX was detected by Western analysis using an anti-RAX polyclonal antibody that was produced as previously described (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). The results indicated that ceramide promoted RAX/PKR association in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). However, whether ceramide induced PKR activation was not clear. Previously, it has been demonstrated that stress application induces RAX phosphorylation and promotes RAX/PKR association concomitant with PKR activation and eIF2α phosphorylation (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar, 24Ito T. Warnken S. May W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 265: 589-594Google Scholar). Since the biogenesis of ceramide can result from many diverse stress stimuli, we tested whether ceramide may trigger this cascade by inducing PKR activation. To determine whether ceramide can promote the activation of PKR in a RAX-dependent manner, the effect of C2-ceramide treatment on eIF2α phosphorylation was assessed. Cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, treated with C2-ceramide for 30 min, and lysed in detergent buffer, and the phosphorylation status of eIF2α was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 25 μm C2-ceramide was used since this is roughly the IC50 for these cells (Fig. 1 A). In addition, it was expected that most, if not all, of the RAX would be phosphorylated since only >10 μm C2-ceramide was shown to induce RAX phosphorylation (Fig. 3). C2-ceramide was found to promote the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 5), suggesting a novel mechanism whereby ceramide can promote RAX phosphorylation and activation.Figure 5Ceramide promotes phosphorylation of eIF2α. NSF/N1.H7 cells overexpressing HA-RAX were treated with C2-ceramide for 30 min. Cells (2 × 107 cell eq) were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then immunoprecipitated with an anti-eIF2α antibody. Phosphorylation was observed by autoradiography. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm that the detected bands were eIF2α. Pre, pre-immune sera control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, whether ceramide-activated signaling actually couples to a RAX pathway that involves regulation of protein synthesis was not clear. To determine the effect of ceramide on protein synthesis, the rate of nascent protein synthesis in vivo was assessed. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of C2-ceramide for 30 min, followed by incubation with a14C-radiolabeled amino acid mixture for 10 min at 37 °C and precipitation of protein by the addition of trichloroacetic acid as previously described (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 7455-7459Google Scholar). Protein synthesis rates were determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity incorporated in the acid-precipitable fraction. The results indicated that ceramide inhibited protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6). Cells that were treated with ≥10 μm C2-ceramide exhibited a markedly reduced level (i.e. ∼60%) of nascent protein synthesis compared with untreated cells. Collectively, these findings strongly support a mechanism whereby ceramide can promote RAX activation and inhibit protein synthesis. Next, a role for PKR in ceramide-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis was examined using 2-AP. The results revealed that the inactive ceramide analog (C2-dihydroceramide) failed to inhibit protein synthesis, whereas 50 μmC2-ceramide resulted in potent inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 7). Importantly, ceramide-induced inhibition of protein synthesis was prevented when cells were co-treated with 2-AP (Fig. 7). These results indicate a role for PKR in this process and suggest a novel role for ceramide in the regulation of protein synthesis involving both RAX and PKR. The role of PKR in viral host defense is well known (17Matthews M.B. Semin. Virol... 1993; 4: 247-257Google Scholar, 18Hovanessian A.G. Semin. Virol... 1993; 4: 237-245Google Scholar). In response to viral double-stranded RNA, host PKR is activated, resulting in the phosphorylation of eIF2α with a shutdown of protein synthesis to prevent viral replication (13Hershey J.W.B. Semin. Virol... 1993; 4: 201-207Google Scholar, 14Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res... 1997; 17: 503-524Google Scholar, 15Tan S.L. Katze M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res... 1999; 19: 543-554Google Scholar, 16Williams B.R.G. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Google Scholar). Yet it is only recently that cellular activation of PKR has been established (7Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 7455-7459Google Scholar). The identification of RAX/PACT as a cellular PKR activator and its participation in programmed cell death suggest an important link between the regulatory mechanisms that mediate cell survival and protein synthesis (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar, 23Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 4379-4390Google Scholar, 24Ito T. Warnken S. May W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

One mechanism for linkage would be via a second signal molecule that is rapidly generated such as ceramide (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 2Smyth M.L. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Pharmacol... 1997; 41: 133-154Google Scholar, 3Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar, 4Basu S. Kolesnick R.

Considering that ceramide production is associated with most, if not all, stress stimuli (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar, 3Hannun Y.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Google Scholar), we examined whether ceramide may provide the link between these pathways. Our findings clearly indicate that ceramide can regulate cell survival by multiple mechanisms involving diverse signal pathways. For example, ceramide can affect transcriptional mechanisms (e.g. c-Jun) (4Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene.. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Google Scholar, 34Jarvis W.D. Fornari F.A. Auer K.L. Freemerman A.J. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Johnson C.R. Barbour S.E. Dent P. Grant S. Mol. Pharmacol... 1997; 52: 935-947Google Scholar). In addition, ceramide was found to regulate stress-signaling pathways involved in apoptosis by stimulating dephosphorylation of Bcl2 and Bad (36Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 20296-20300Google Scholar, 39Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30419-30426Google Scholar, 40Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 1941-1946Google Scholar). Now we have discovered a novel mechanism whereby ceramide can regulate protein synthesis by a mechanism(s) involving both PKR and RAX. PKR is likely involved since 2-AP can reverse ceramide-induced killing (Fig. 2) and ceramide-induced inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 7). In addition, ceramide promotes RAX/PKR association, which strongly correlates with PKR activation and inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 4) (22Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15427-15432Google Scholar). Although it was not formally tested whether RAX may also activate another cellular eIF2α kinase such as HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor of translation) (9Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 7603-7606Google Scholar) or PERK (41Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature.. 1999; 397: 271-274Google Scholar), an association of RAX with any other eIF2α kinase has yet to be reported. Thus, the findings presented here strongly suggest that the upstream event triggering the inhibition of protein synthesis involves RAX activation of PKR. The precise mechanism by which phosphorylated RAX may activate PKR remains to be elucidated. PKR is a ribosomal protein that is apparently activated when it is released from the ribosome (42Zhu S. Romano P.R. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 14434-14441Google Scholar, 43Wu S. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 13816-13826Google Scholar). Recently, PKR has been shown to interact with the L18 ribosomal protein (44Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 1116-1125Google Scholar). Interestingly, L18 inhibits PKR autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation of eIF2α is blocked in vitro and in vivo (44Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 1116-1125Google Scholar). Since ribosome-associated PKR is in a monomeric (inactive) form (45Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 10729-10736Google Scholar), it is possible that activation of PKR coincides with displacement from the ribosome (43Wu S. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 13816-13826Google Scholar). Since RAX can associate with and activate PKR, it is tempting to speculate that at least one mechanism by which RAX may activate PKR is by blocking L18 binding to PKR. A role for ceramide in this potential mechanism remains to be determined. An elaborate homeostatic regulatory mechanism for apoptosis involving ceramide is beginning to emerge. On the one hand, during stress that can lead to cell death, ceramide activates protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 2A that can promote the functional dephosphorylation and inactivation of anti-apoptotic signal molecules, including Bcl2 (36Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 20296-20300Google Scholar), Akt (46Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 13330-13335Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (33Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 13169-13174Google Scholar). On the other hand, ceramide can directly activate SAPKs such as JNK (Fig. 4) (4Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene.. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Google Scholar,32Westwick J.K. Bielawaska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 22689-22692Google Scholar). Although it remains to be determined which SAPK(s) may be responsible for RAX phosphorylation, a role for ceramide in inhibiting protein synthesis may involve activation of a ceramide-activated SAPK to phosphorylate RAX and lead to PKR activation, eIF2α phosphorylation, inhibition of protein synthesis, and apoptosis (Fig.8). Further studies are necessary to identify a physiologic RAX kinase to fully understand the mechanism(s) by which protein synthesis may be negatively regulated under stress. eukaryotic initiation factor-2α interleukin-3 stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase hemagglutinin 2-aminopurine"
https://openalex.org/W1990238941,"alphaB-crystallin is a member of the small heat shock protein family and can act as a molecular chaperone preventing the in vitro aggregation of other proteins denatured by heat or other stress conditions. Expression of alphaB-crystallin increases in cells exposed to stress and enhanced in tumors of neuroectodermal origin and in many neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we examined the properties of lens epithelial cells derived from mice in which the alphaB-crystallin gene had been knocked out. Primary rodent cells immortalize spontaneously in tissue culture with a frequency of 10(-5) to 10(-6). Primary lens epithelial cells derived from alphaB-crystallin-/- mice produced hyperproliferative clones at a frequency of 7.6 x 10(-2), four orders of magnitude greater than predicted by spontaneous immortalization (1). Hyperproliferative alphaB-crystallin-/- cells were shown to be truly immortal since they have been passaged for more than 100 population doublings without any diminution in growth potential. In striking contrast to the wild-type cells, which were diploid, the alphaB-crystallin-/- cultures had a high proportion of tetraploid and higher ploidy cells, indicating that the loss of alphaB-crystallin is associated with an increase in genomic instability. Further evidence of genomic instability of alphaB-crystallin-/- cells was observed when primary cultures were infected with Ad12-SV40 hybrid virus. In striking contrast to wild-type cells, alphaB-crystallin-/- cells expressing SV40 T antigen exhibited a widespread cytocidal response 2 to 3 days after attaining confluence, indicating that SV40 T antigen enhanced the intrinsic genomic instability of alphaB-crystallin-/- lens epithelial cells. These observations suggest that the widely distributed molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin may play an important nuclear role in maintaining genomic integrity."

IHF strongly stimulates ParB binding to parS, and the minimal partition complex contains a single dimer of ParB. To examine the architecture of the partition complex, we have investigated the DNA binding activity of various ParB fragments. Gel mobility shift and DNase I protection assays showed that the first 141 residues of ParB are dispensable for the formation of the minimal, high affinity partition complex. A fragment missing only the last 16 amino acids of ParB bound specifically to parS, but binding was weak and was no longer stimulated by IHF. The ability of IHF to stimulate ParB binding to parS correlated with the ability of ParB to dimerize via its C terminus. Using full and partial parS sites, we show that two regions of ParB, one in the center and the other near the C terminus of the protein, interact with distinct sequences withinparS. Based on these data, we have proposed a model of how the ParB dimer binds parS to form the minimal partition complex.

The P1 prophage exists as a low copy number plasmid inEscherichia coli, and its active partition system ensures that P1 is stably maintained in a bacterial population. The P1par operon encodes two trans-acting factors, ParA and ParB, and a cis-acting centromere-like site,parS. Analogous systems exist in a number of low copy number plasmids, and the genes for homologues of both ParA and ParB have been identified in the chromosomes of several bacterial species (1Williams D.R.

Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 1313-1320Google Scholar). Both ParA and ParB are required for and have multiple functions in partition. ParB binds specifically to the parS site (8Davis M.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J... 1988; 7: 1881-1888Google Scholar, 9Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1988; 170: 954-958Google Scholar), along with E. coli integration host factor (IHF).1 Together, these two proteins bend and wrap the DNA into a structure called the partition complex (10Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1988; 85: 6657-6661Google Scholar, 11Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J... 1990; 9: 991-998Google Scholar, 12Funnell B.E. J. Biol.

Bright, localized foci of ParB bound to parS in vivo have been visualized by immunofluorescence (14Erdmann N. Petroff T. Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 14905-14910Google Scholar). ParA is an ATPase and binds the par operator region, repressingparA and parB expression (15Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. Mol. Microbiol... 1992; 6: 1141-1147Google Scholar). ParA also interacts directly with ParB bound at parS in an ATP-dependent manner (16Bouet J.-Y. Funnell B.E. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 1415-1424Google Scholar). ParA is required for proper localization of the ParB-parS complexes (14Erdmann N. Petroff T. Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 14905-14910Google Scholar), although it is not known how ParA promotes positioning of these complexes. The plasmid centromere, parS, is a multipartite DNA site. An IHF binding site is flanked by two types of distinct sequences, called box A and box B, which are specifically recognized by ParB (11Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J... 1990; 9: 991-998Google Scholar, 13Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 3616-3624Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Previous mutational and deletion analyses have shown that the presence and relative spacing of boxes A2, A3, B1, and B2 are essential for wild-type parS function in vivo, while boxes A1 and A4 are dispensable (11Davis M.A. Martin K.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J... 1990; 9: 991-998Google Scholar, 13Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 3616-3624Google Scholar, 17Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. Biochimie ( Paris ).. 1994; 76: 924-932Google Scholar). ParB and IHF enhance each other's affinity for parS (12Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 14328-14337Google Scholar, 17Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. Biochimie ( Paris ).. 1994; 76: 924-932Google Scholar). IHF binding creates a large bend in parS (12Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 14328-14337Google Scholar), and an inherently bent DNA sequence can partially substitute for the IHF site inparS (18Hayes F. Austin S. J. Mol. Biol... 1994; 243: 190-198Google Scholar). One dimer of ParB binds across the IHF-directed bend in parS (19Bouet J.-Y. Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 8213-8219Google Scholar), forming a structure in which the DNA is wrapped around the protein core (10Funnell B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1988; 85: 6657-6661Google Scholar, 12Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 14328-14337Google Scholar, 19Bouet J.-Y. Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 8213-8219Google Scholar). Subsequent dimers load onto the partition complex with increasing ParB concentrations via a series of protein-protein interactions and specific and nonspecific protein-DNA interactions that tether increasing amounts of ParB to the partition complex. Two independent self-association domains have been identified within ParB (Fig. 2 A) (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). One domain is located within the last 59 amino acids of ParB and is probably the domain that mediates dimerization in solution. The second domain is located near the N terminus of the protein. Our observations suggested that this domain is involved in oligomerization (i.e. dimer-dimer interactions) but that some type of conformational change in ParB is required for oligomers to form (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). First, the N terminus of ParB is relatively susceptible to proteolysis, suggesting that it is not very stably folded in solution. Second, self-association of the N terminus, measured by chemical cross-linking experiments in vitro, was observed only when the C-terminal half of ParB was removed. One possibility is that DNA binding elicits a conformational change that removes the inhibitory effect of the C terminus on N-terminal self-association, promoting oligomerization (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). The N-terminal oligomerization domain either overlaps or is adjacent to a region of ParB that is required for an interaction with ParA (Fig. 2 A) (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar, 21Radnedge L. Youngren B. Davis M. Austin S. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 6076-6085Google Scholar). Previously we began to define the structural domains of ParB by identifying stable fragments generated by limited exposure to trypsin (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion resulted in fragments with increasingly C-terminal start sites (Fig. 2 A, arrows) that extended to, or close to, the C terminus of ParB. The two longest lived fragments started at residues 142 and 185, respectively (Fig.2 A, arrows C and D). These results suggested that the C-terminal dimerization domain forms the core of a very stably folded C-terminal half of ParB (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). Two different regions of ParB appear to have a role in its specific DNA binding activity, one near the C terminus of ParB and the second in the middle of the protein (Fig. 2 A). Point mutations near the C terminus disrupt DNA binding activity (22Lobocka M. Yarmolinsky M. J. Mol. Biol... 1996; 259: 366-382Google Scholar). Proteins with these mutations also fail to dimerize, and it has been suggested that lack of dimerization prevents DNA binding. These mutations all fall within the last 59 amino acids of ParB, a region that encompasses the C-terminal dimerization domain (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). This region also includes the “discriminator recognition sequence” (DRS), defined by domain-swapping experiments (23Radnedge L. Davis M.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J... 1996; 15: 1155-1162Google Scholar). When residues 281–302 of P1 ParB were swapped with the equivalent region of the ParB protein of P7, the resulting hybrid protein recognized P7 parS in an in vivo partition assay (23Radnedge L. Davis M.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J... 1996; 15: 1155-1162Google Scholar). The P7 parS site is very similar to P1 parS. The P1 and P7 box A sequences are interchangeable, but the box B sequences are not (24Hayes F. Austin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1993; 90: 9228-9232Google Scholar). Thus, the swapping experiment defined the DRS as a region that contacts box B sequences directly or promotes a fold that allows box B binding. Analysis of the ParB sequence identified a putative helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, from residue 166 to 189, that has also been implicated in ParB's DNA binding activities (25Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res... 1990; 18: 5019-5026Google Scholar). Point mutations located on either side of the putative HTH domain disrupt DNA binding activity (22Lobocka M. Yarmolinsky M. J. Mol. Biol... 1996; 259: 366-382Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this region of the protein binds the box A sequences in parS (23Radnedge L. Davis M.A. Austin S.J. EMBO J... 1996; 15: 1155-1162Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the interaction of ParB with its specific sequences in parS by asking how different regions of the protein contribute to its DNA binding activities. Our results suggest a model of how protein-DNA (ParB-box A and ParB-box B) and protein-protein (dimerization) interactions contribute to the architecture of the partition complex. E. coli DH5 (F- endA1 hsdR17(rK−mK+) supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA96 relA1) was used for all plasmid constructions. E. coli BL21 (F- ompT hsdSB(rB−mB+) dcm gal) (λDE3, pLysS) (26Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol... 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar) was used for fusion protein expression and purification. All bacterial cells were grown in LB medium or on LB plates (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). Ampicillin and chloramphenicol, when used, were present at 100 and 25 μg/ml, respectively. Sources for reagents were as follows: dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), bovine serum albumin, and guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma); imidazole and Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Enzymes for cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The new constructs created for this work were generated by PCR and cloned into pET15b (Novagen), which encodes a hexahistidine tag. pJS10 (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar) was used as the substrate for PCR amplification. To create the 142–333 ParB fragment, the region ofparB encoding this portion was amplified by PCR. The upstream primer (5′-GCGCCATATGGACGTTCAGACAGCATTG) added a single Met residue upstream of residue 142. M13 forward primer was the downstream primer. This PCR fragment was gel-purified (QIAEX II), digested withNdeI and BamHI, and ligated into pET15b, creating pJS208. For 1–330, 1–325, and 1–317 ParB, the upstream primer (5′-GCGCATATGTCAAAGAAAAACAGACCAAC) incorporated an NdeI site at the start site. The downstream primers, 5′CGCGGGATCCTTACTTTTTATCGAGGCTC, 5′CGCGGGATCCTTACTTTCTAAGGATATGCCC, and 5′CGCGGGATCCTTACCTGTCGAGTTCTTCCTG, created stop codons in place of residues 331, 326, and 318, respectively, and created aBamHI site downstream of the stop codons. TheNdeI–BamHI fragments were then cloned into pET15b, generating pJS207, pJS212, and pJS213. To create the internal deletions of ParB, the region of parBencoding residues 185–333 was amplified using an upstream primer (5′-CGCGCTCGAGTGCTCTCCAGGCAGCGAGTG) that placed a XhoI site just upstream of codon 185 and the M13 forward primer. The resultingXhoI–BamHI fragment was cloned into pET15b to create pJS206. The regions encoding residues 1–142 and residues 1–165 were amplified with an upstream primer, 5′-GCGCATATGTCAAAGAAAAACAGACCAAC (placing an NdeI site at the start site), and a downstream primer, either 5′-CGCGCTCGAGTCTTTCGCTAAATTTTGCGC (creating an XhoI site just downstream of codon 142) or 5′-CGCGCTCGAGCCATCATTTTTCATTCGCAT (creating an XhoI site just downstream of codon 165). TheNdeI–XhoI fragments were cloned into pJS206 to generate pJS210, encoding Δ142–185 ParB, and pJS211, encoding Δ166–185 ParB. This cloning strategy replaced the region between residues 143 and 185 or between residues 165 and 185 of ParB with two serine residues. The plasmids pBEF165 and pBEF166 contain the P1 parS sequence in opposite orientations in a modified pBluescript vector (12Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 14328-14337Google Scholar). For gel mobility shift assays with the intactparS site, pBEF165 was digested with eitherBamHI, yielding a 252-bp parS fragment, orXbaI, yielding a 132-bp parS fragment. The DNA fragments were labeled at their 3′-ends with [α-32P]dATP and DNA polymerase I large fragment and purified with phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). For DNase I footprinting reactions, DNA substrates were generated by digesting either pBEF165 or pBEF166 with BamHI andSmaI or BamHI and BglII, generating a 211- or 240-bp parS fragment, respectively. They were32P-labeled at the 3′-end of the BamHI site. The fragments labeled on the upper strand (as drawn in Fig. 1 A) were generated from pBEF165, and fragments labeled on the lower strand were generated from pBEF166. Competitor fragments for the gel mobility shift assays were 270 bp in length and were generated by PCR from pALA207 (28Abeles A.L. Friedman S.A. Austin S.J. J. Mol. Biol... 1985; 185: 261-272Google Scholar). TheparS-containing fragment was amplified using the primers 5′-CACTTGTGTGAATCCCTTTTC and 5′-CAGGAAGAACTCGACAGGATG. The nonspecific fragment was amplified with the primers 5′-GCCTCTTGCGGGATATCGTC and 5′-CTGTCGCAGCAGAGATGATG. The fragments were then purified from agarose gels. The single site oligonucleotide substrates used for gel mobility shift assays are illustrated in Fig. 1 B. The lower strand of each pair was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The unincorporated nucleotide was removed by gel filtration or by ethanol precipitation. The labeled oligomers were then mixed with an equal amount of the appropriate upper strand oligomer in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA. The mixture was heated to 70 °C and was then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, to allow the two strands to anneal. Protein samples were diluted to between 8 and 20 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 nm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. DSP (20 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) was added to 0.1 mg/ml, and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature. To stop the cross-linking and precipitate the proteins, samples were mixed with an equal volume of 30% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with acetone and resuspended in 20 μl of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue. The samples were incubated at 90 °C for 3 min and were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The standard reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 0.1 nm32P-labeledparS substrate in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The mixtures were assembled on ice, incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 90 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA at 180 V for 3 h in a water-cooled gel apparatus. The gels were dried on Whatman DE81 paper and exposed either to film or to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). When the single site oligomers were used as substrates, 1 nm labeled substrates were used per assay, and the final salt concentration of each reaction was ∼140 nm NaCl. Standard 20-μl reaction mixtures contained 10–50 fmol of 32P-labeled substrate, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The mixtures were assembled on ice and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Bovine pancreatic DNase I was then added (1 μl of a 1 μg/μl solution). After 2 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of 1.6 m ammonium acetate, 400 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1 m EDTA. After phenol/chloroform extractions of the mixtures, the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 4 μl of formamide dye (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). In this work, we have examined the architecture of the partition complex by determining the DNA binding properties of various regions of ParB. ParB is 333 amino acids in length, and we previously examined its domain structure by partial proteolysis mapping and by the self-association activity of various ParB protein fragments (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). Here we have used several of those fragments to examine their interaction with the P1 parS site. All fragments contained a polyhistidine tag to facilitate purification. In addition, we have constructed six new versions of ParB (Fig. 2 B). Our previous partial proteolysis experiments identified two tryptic fragments that were relatively resistant to further digestion. His-ParB-(142–333) (constructed here) and His-ParB-(187–333) (constructed previously (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar)) correspond to these two tryptic fragments (Fig. 2 A; Ref. 20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). To examine the function of the extreme C terminus of ParB, we removed 3, 8, and 16 residues from its C terminus, generating His-ParB-(1–330), His-ParB-(1–325), and His-ParB-(1–317), respectively. Finally, we made two internal deletions of ParB that removed the HTH motif. The first removed only this predicted motif (residues 166–184), and the second removed residues 143–184, the region between the start sites of the two stable tryptic fragments mentioned above (Fig. 2 B). We first tested the dimerization activity of the new protein fragments in a cross-linking assay (Fig. 3). His-ParB-(142–333) and both proteins with internal deletions (His-ParB-(Δ166–184) and His-ParB-(Δ143–184)) were cross-linked to dimer-sized smears in the presence of DSP, a cross-linking reagent that reacts primarily with lysines. His-ParB-(1–330) and His-ParB-(1–325) were also able to dimerize, as determined by this assay (Fig. 3). His-ParB-(1–317), however, was not cross-linked, indicating that it is predominantly monomeric in solution. It behaves as His-ParB-(1–312) (Fig. 3), which we previously reported to not be cross-linked by DSP (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). Therefore, the region between residues 317 and 325 of ParB defines the C-terminal boundary of its dimerization domain. The abilities of previously isolated ParB fragments to dimerize are summarized in Fig.2 B (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). In the presence of IHF, one dimer of ParB binds to parS in a very high affinity protein-DNA complex (12Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 14328-14337Google Scholar, 19Bouet J.-Y. Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 8213-8219Google Scholar). This interaction requires that ParB contact its specific recognition sequences on either side of the IHF-directed bend simultaneously (13Funnell B.E. Gagnier L. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 3616-3624Google Scholar). In the absence of IHF, ParB affinity for parS is much lower, and binding is primarily dependent on the box A and box B sequences on the right side of the IHF site (Fig.1). Therefore, we can distinguish two types of ParB binding: the latter (low affinity), requiring specific contacts but not IHF, and IHF-stimulated DNA binding (high affinity), requiring both specific contacts and the IHF-directed bend in the DNA. In this work, we address the question of what regions of ParB contribute to the different aspects of ParB's DNA binding activities. We first examined several C-terminal fragments of ParB (i.e.truncated from the N terminus) for their parS binding activity. Full-length ParB (or His-ParB in our assays), and three fragments, His-ParB-(47–333), His-ParB-(67–333), and His-ParB-(142–333), bound to parS, and this binding was stimulated by IHF (Fig. 4, A–C). The affinity of the different ParB fragments for parS differed, but the relative affinity of each ParB fragment for parS was much higher with IHF than without IHF. Therefore, the first 141 residues of ParB are not required for IHF-stimulated parS binding. Next, we assessed the importance of the central portion of ParB in DNA binding. His-ParB-(187–333) and His-ParB-(275–333) contain both the C-terminal dimerization domains and the DRS but are missing the putative HTH domain located near the center of ParB (Fig.2). Neither fragment had anyparS binding activity, with or without IHF (Figs.4 D and 8 and data not shown). Therefore, a region N-terminal to residue 187 is required for stable parS binding in this assay. Since the first 141 residues were not required for binding (Fig.4 C), the region between amino acids 142 and 187, which includes the putative HTH motif, contains information required for DNA binding. We next examined the activity of ParB fragments lacking only this region, His-ParB-(Δ166–184) and His-ParB-(Δ143–184). Neither protein bound parS with or without IHF (Fig. 4, Eand F), although some apparently nonspecific or unstable binding activity was observed at the highest protein concentrations. These results indicated that the central region of ParB is required forparS binding and the C-terminal DRS is not sufficient for stable parS binding. Finally, we were interested in the role of the C terminus of ParB in DNA binding. We deleted 3 and 8 residues from the C terminus of ParB and tested the resulting fragments of ParB for their ability to bindparS in the gel mobility shift assay. His-ParB-(1–330) and His-ParB-(1–325) both exhibited IHF-stimulated DNA binding (Fig. 4,G and H), and both were able to dimerize as judged by cross-linking assays (Fig.3). DNase I footprinting experiments showed that His-ParB, His-ParB-(47–333), His-ParB-(67–333), and His-ParB-(142–333) exhibited very similar patterns of protection of the parSsequence (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). As predicted from the gel mobility shift experiments, these results indicate that the first 141 amino acids of ParB are not required for minimal partition complex formation. Neither His-ParB-(187–333) nor His-ParB-(275–333) provided any protection of parS from DNase I cleavage, also consistent with the results from the gel mobility shift assays (data not shown). Similarly, His-ParB-(Δ143–184) and His-ParB-(Δ166–184) afforded no protection from DNase I cleavage (data not shown). Footprinting experiments with His-ParB-(1–330) produced a pattern of protection similar to that of His-ParB but with additional enhancements (Fig. 5, B and C). First, on the upper strand ofparS, one band in box B1 was strongly enhanced. On the lower strand, one band near the center and one near the right boundary of the IHF binding site were strongly enhanced. These differences indicate changes in the geometry of the complex that make the minor groove more accessible to DNase I in these regions. These enhancements were not observed in the presence of His-ParB-(1–325), whose protection pattern was very similar to that of His-ParB. In contrast to the fragments with small C-terminal deletions, His-ParB-(1–317), His-ParB-(1–312), His-ParB-(1–293), and His-ParB-(1–274) bound parS, but a high protein concentration was required to observe binding (500–1000 nm), and little or no stimulatory effect by IHF was observed (Fig. 4, I andJ, and data not shown). The IHF-insensitive binding is relatively weak, as is full-length ParB binding to parS in the absence of IHF (12Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 14328-14337Google Scholar). Therefore, removal of only 16 amino acids from the C terminus removed the ability of IHF to stimulate ParB's specific DNA binding activity. The appearance of IHF-insensitive binding correlated with the loss of dimerization activity (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar) (Figs. 2 and 3). Note that the N-terminal fragments with IHF-insensitive binding activity retain the putative HTH domain. His-ParB-(1–317) and His-ParB-(1–312) also retain the DRS. ParB fragments that exhibited IHF-insensitive DNA binding activity in a gel mobility shift assay showed no detectable protection patterns inparS in DNase I footprinting experiments (Fig.5 D and data not shown). This was unexpected, because we had expected to observe binding to at least the box A motifs, since these fragments retained the HTH motif. We concluded that the parS binding activity of these IHF-insensitive ParB fragments was too weak to be detectable in a DNase I footprinting assay. However, His-ParB-(1–317) did show evidence of a specific interaction with parS. The same enhancements observed in the presence of His-ParB-(1–330) were also observed with His-ParB-(1–317) (Fig. 5 D). We tested whether the IHF-insensitive binding activity was still specific for parS, using competition assays (Fig.6). The ability of an N-terminal fragment of ParB to bind to a labeled parS substrate was challenged by a 270-bp unlabeled DNA fragment containing either theparS sequence or a nonspecific sequence. With both His-ParB-(1–317) and His-ParB-(1–312), the parS DNA was a better competitor than the nonspecific DNA, indicating that binding was specific (Fig. 6 and data not shown). All ParB fragments that boundparS also contained some nonspecific DNA binding activity, a property of the full-length protein (12Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 14328-14337Google Scholar). N-terminal fragments smaller than His-ParB-(1–274) had no DNA binding activity (data not shown). His-ParB-(1–234) is not cross-linked by DSP, and His-ParB-(1–189) has some self-association activity through the N-terminal oligomerization domain (20Surtees J.A. Funnell B.E. J. Bacteriol... 1999; 181: 5898-5908Google Scholar). Neither fragment interacted with parS. Therefore, a region C-terminal to residue 234 is required for binding, and N-terminal self-association of the protein is not sufficient to promote DNA binding. While the different DNA binding activities of the ParB fragments used in this study supported the hypothesis that the putative HTH and the DRS regions interact with box A and box B sequences, respectively, we asked whether we could demonstrate direct interactions to isolated box A and/or box B sequences. We designed synthetic oligomer (25-bp) substrates that contained only the box A inverted repeat (i.e. box A2-box A3), only a single box B sequence, or box A2 + A3 combined with box B1 (“box A/B”). The last substrate essentially represents the minimal parS site, from box A2 to B1, that is functional in vivo (17Funnell B.E. Gagnier L.

Two mutants were not expressed, four were inactive, and two showed severely reduced glutamate transport activity. Cysteine mutations at the other positions were well tolerated. Only the two most amino- and carboxyl-terminal mutants (G374C, I375C, S399C, and Q404C) could be labeled with the large thiol reagent fluorescein maleimide, indicating unrestricted access and a location in a loop structure outside the membrane. The labeling pattern of these mutants using membrane- permeable and -impermeable thiol reagents showed that the N and C termini of the mutated stretch are located extra- and intracellularly, respectively. Thus, the location of the membrane-spanning segment was confined to a stretch of 23 residues between Gly-374 and Ser-399. Cysteine residues in three mutants in the central part of the segment (M381C, V388C, and N391C) could be labeled with the small and flexible reagent 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide only, suggesting accessibility via a narrow aqueous pore. When the region was modeled as an α-helix, all positions at which cysteine mutations lead to inactive or severely impaired transporters cluster on one face of this helix. The inactive mutants showed neither proton motive force-driven uptake activity nor exchange activity nor glutamate binding. The results indicate that transmembrane segment 8 forms an amphipathic α-helix. The hydrophilic face of the helix lines an aqueous pore and contains many residues that are important for activity.

Glutamate transporters in the mammalian central nervous system remove the neurotransmitter glutamate from the synaptic cleft into surrounding neurons and glial cells. Removal of glutamate prevents neurotoxicity of high concentrations of glutamate and helps to end the excitatory signal at some synapses (1Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. Jahr C.E.

Nature. 1994; 368: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The proteins are secondary transporters that couple glutamate transport against the concentration gradient to the transport of protons, sodium ions, and potassium ions across the membrane. The glutamate transporters belong to a large family of transport proteins in which are also found bacterial glutamate transporters including GltT of Bacillus stearothermophilus (5Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 293-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computational analyses of the amino acid sequences and hydropathy profiles of the glutamate transporters showed that the proteins form a unique structural class of membrane proteins, which is structurally not related to any other family of secondary transporters (5Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 293-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lolkema J.S. Slotboom D.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1998; 15: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequent experimental studies confirmed that the proteins contain unique structural features, like water-filled pores and pore loops, which are not found in “regular” secondary transporters (7Seal R.P.

The amino-terminal half of the transporters contains six membrane-spanning α-helices, with the amino terminus of the proteins located in the cytoplasm. The membrane topology of the carboxyl-terminal half of the transporters is still somewhat controversial. However, in the most generally accepted model the six amino-terminal α-helices are followed by a reentrant loop entering the membrane from the cytoplasmic side, a seventh membrane-spanning helix, a reentrant loop entering the membrane from the extracellular side and, finally, an eighth membrane-spanning segment, leaving the carboxyl terminus in the cytoplasm (Fig.1). The eukaryotic and prokaryotic glutamate transporters differ predominantly in the length of their hydrophilic regions. Three hydrophilic stretches are considerably longer in the eukaryotic proteins: the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal extensions and the region between the third and fourth membrane-spanning segment, which is glycosylated in the eukaryotic members. Evidence is accumulating that the carboxyl-terminal half of the transporters, which is particularly well conserved, constitutes a major part of the translocation pathway and contains the binding sites for the substrate and cotransported ions (7Seal R.P.

The bacterial proteins catalyze the electrogenic symport of glutamate with two protons or a proton and a sodium ion. The eukaryotic glutamate transporters catalyze the electrogenic symport of glutamate with three sodium ions and one proton, whereas one potassium ion is antiported. The location of the most carboxyl-terminally located membrane-spanning segment (segment 8), which enters the membrane from the extracellular side and runs to the cytoplasmic side, is particularly ill defined. Previous cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies with two glutamate transporters (human EAAT1 and rat EAAT2) have restricted the membrane-spanning segment to a stretch of about 50 amino acids (10Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,11Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Hydropathy profile analysis is not very helpful in defining the position of segment 8 more accurately because the region is relatively hydrophilic and does not contain a stretch of ∼20 hydrophobic residues, which is characteristic for membrane-spanning α-helices. The secondary structure of membrane-spanning segment 8 has been a matter of debate, and it has been modeled both as an α-helix and a β-strand (10Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I.

A β-strand structure was suggested because of the hydrophilic nature of the region (11Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas an α-helical structure was suggested on the basis of computational analysis of periodicity in the amino acid sequences of the glutamate transporters (5Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 293-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Slotboom D.J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31317-31321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). No firm experimental evidence for either structure has been presented. Here, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis is applied to the region containing membrane-spanning segment 8 in the glutamate transporter GltT ofB. stearothermophilus. The position of the membrane-spanning segment is confined to a stretch of 23 amino acids, which is likely to adopt an α-helical conformation. The segment lines an aqueous channel and contains many residues that are of crucial importance for glutamate binding and transport. Escherichia coli strain ECOMUT2, which lacks the glutamate transporter GltP (20Tolner B. Ubbink-Kok T. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was used to express GltT mutants and was grown in Luria Broth medium at 37 °C. Chloramphenicol and ampicillin were used at final concentrations of 30 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively. Expression of GltT mutants from pBAD24-derived plasmids (21Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J.

General molecular biological techniques are described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymes for recombinant DNA work were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). The polymerase chain reaction overlap extension method (23Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) was used to introduce mutations in the gltT gene on a pBAD24-derived expression plasmid, which encodes GltT with an amino-terminal His tag consisting of six adjacent histidines (9Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced by BMTC (Groningen, The Netherlands). Membrane vesicles with a rightside-out orientation were prepared from E. coli ECOMUT2 cells expressing GltT mutants by the osmotic lysis procedure, as described by Kaback (24Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Randomly oriented membrane vesicles and membrane vesicles with an inside-out orientation were prepared with sonication and passage through a French pressure cell, respectively, as described previously (9Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. The protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay from Bio-Rad. Expression levels of His-tagged proteins were determined by running membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and detection with monoclonal antibodies directed against a 6 His tag (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Antibodies were visualized by using the Western light chemiluminescence detection kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). GltT mutant proteins were purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes as described before (25Gaillard I. Slotboom D.J. Knol J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. The detergentn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Anatrace, Ohio) was used instead of Triton X-100 to solubilize cytoplasmic membranes (0.4 mg/4 mg of membrane protein) and during purification of GltT (0.03%). Triton X-100 was still used to destabilize preformed liposomes (25Gaillard I. Slotboom D.J. Knol J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The lipid to protein ratio during reconstitution was 330 (w/w). The protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay from Bio-Rad. Proteoliposomes were stored in liquid nitrogen an appropriate buffer (see below). Unless stated otherwise, membrane vesicles with a rightside-out orientation (10 mg of protein/ml) were labeled for 10 min at room temperature with 0.25 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)1 or with the methanethiosulfonate reagents (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl) methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET, 1 mm) and 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA, 2.5 mm) (Anatrace, Ohio). Immediately after labeling, glutamate uptake experiments were performed with these membrane vesicles using artificial gradients. Membrane vesicles with a random orientation (500 μl, 2 mg of protein/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7) were labeled with 0.25 mm fluorescein maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding a 10-fold excess of dithiothreitol, followed by small scale purification of His-tagged GltT mutants using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (9Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescence of proteins labeled with fluorescein maleimide was visualized by UV excitation using a Gel-Doc system (Bio-Rad). Proteoliposomes (30 μg of protein) were labeled with 0.25 mm NEM or 0.25 mm4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMdiS) at room temperature for 10 min in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. The reaction was stopped with a 10-fold excess of dithiothreitol. The labeled proteoliposomes were washed once with 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7, and solubilized in 300 μl of the same buffer containing 2% Triton X-100. 0.25 mm fluorescein maleimide was added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with a 10-fold excess of dithiothreitol. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescence of proteins labeled with fluorescein maleimide was visualized using a Lumi-imager (Roche). Glutamate uptake in rightside-out membrane vesicles was measured by rapid filtration. Membrane vesicles were either energized using the potassium ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate electron donor system or by artificial gradients. In the former case, the membranes were diluted to a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, and 10 mmpotassium ascorbate. The uptake experiments were performed in 100 μl at 30 °C under a constant flow of water-saturated air. Phenazine methosulfate was added at a concentration of 100 μm, and the proton motive force was allowed to develop for 2 min, after whichl-[14C]glutamate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a final concentration of 1.9 μm. The uptake was stopped by adding a 20-fold excess of ice-cold 0.1 mLiCl solution, followed by immediate filtration over cellulose nitrate filters (pore size, 0.45 μm). The filters were washed once with 2 ml of 0.1 m LiCl and assayed for radioactivity. When artificial gradients were used, a buffer system described previously was used (20Tolner B. Ubbink-Kok T. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles (10 mg protein/ml) were loaded with a buffer containing 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 100 mm potassium acetate, pH 7, and 1 μmvalinomycin. Proton motive force-driven uptake was initiated by diluting the 4-μl vesicles into 330 μl of buffer containing 125 mm MES, adjusted to pH 6 with methylglucamine, 1 μm valinomycin, and 0.6 μml-[14C]glutamate and incubated at 30 °C. The uptake was stopped as described above. For counterflow experiments proteoliposomes were loaded with 25 mm potassium phosphate and 5 mm potassium glutamate, pH 7, by freeze thawing followed by extrusion through polycarbonate filters (pore size, 400 nm). Proteoliposomes were concentrated by centrifugation (250,000 ×g, 20 min, 10 °C) and resuspended at a protein concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml. Counterflow was initiated by diluting 4 μl of proteoliposomes into 330 μl of 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, prewarmed at 30 °C, and containing 1.2 μml-[14C]glutamate. The uptake was stopped as described above. Glutamate uptake driven by artificial gradients in proteoliposomes was assayed using the same procedure as described for counterflow but with the buffer system for artificial gradient described above. To measure efflux, proteoliposomes were loaded withl-[14C]glutamate using the artificial gradient method until ∼10 pmol/μg of protein was taken up by the proteoliposomes. 10 μm Carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was added, and the efflux reaction was stopped at several time points by diluting aliquots of the reaction mixture in ice-cold 0.1 m LiCl followed by rapid filtration as described above. The cysteineless version of GltT, which was shown previously to have glutamate uptake activity similar to that of the wild type (9Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), was used as background for the construction of a set of 21 single cysteine mutants in the region of membrane-spanning segment 8 (Fig. 1). Each residue in the amino acid stretch that is highly amphipathic when modeled an α-helix (residues 374–392) (5Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 293-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was mutated to cysteine, as well as selected residues at the carboxyl-terminal end of the stretch. Out of the 21 mutants 19 could be expressed in E. coli and were present in the cytoplasmic membrane as judged from Western blots using antibodies raised against the amino-terminal His tag which is present in all mutants (Fig.2 A). Only two mutants, D376C and G390C, were not found in the membrane of E. coli (not shown). The glutamate transport activity of the mutants that were expressed was measured in membrane vesicles with a rightside-out orientation. At most of the positions cysteine mutations were well tolerated by the transporter resulting in glutamate transport activities between 40 and 125% of the cysteineless mutant (Fig.2 B). In four mutants (D380C, R383C, T384C, and N387C) glutamate transport was completely abolished. In two other mutants, R377C and M381C, glutamate uptake was measurable but severely impaired (5 and 17% of the activity of the cysteineless mutant, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). In none of these mutants was the impaired or abolished activity caused by a reduced level of expression (Fig.2 A). The accessibility of the cysteine residues in the GltT mutants for the large maleimide compound fluorescein maleimide (molecular weight 427) was determined. Randomly oriented membrane vesicles were prepared from cells expressing the various GltT mutants and labeled with fluorescein maleimide. Subsequently, the vesicles were solubilized, and His-tagged GltT mutants were purified, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence of GltT mutants labeled with fluorescein maleimide was detected by UV excitation. The cysteineless mutant was used as a negative control and was not modified by fluorescein maleimide (not shown). Only four single cysteine mutants (G374C, I375C, S399C, and Q404C) were labeled with fluorescein maleimide (Fig. 3). The cysteine residues in the four mutants are located at the extreme amino and carboxyl termini of the mutated stretch. The accessibility of these residues for fluorescein maleimide indicates a location in the protein structure, which is well exposed to the aqueous environment and is consistent with a position in a loop structure. The other single cysteine mutants could not be labeled with fluorescein maleimide, as exemplified by mutants R377C, A382C, and S392C (Fig. 3). The cysteine residues in these mutants are either buried in the protein structure or exposed to the lipid environment. Although mutants G374C, I375C, and S399C were readily labeled with fluorescein maleimide, the accessibility of the cysteine residues in these mutants is not completely unrestricted: biotin maleimide (molecular weight 524), which was used previously in membrane topology studies of GltT (9Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), did not label these mutants (not shown). Only the single cysteine in mutant Q404C was readily labeled with biotin maleimide in membrane vesicles with an inside-out orientation, and labeling was prevented by preincubation with the charged maleimide AMdiS, suggesting a cytoplasmic location (9Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In agreement, Q404C was not labeled with biotin maleimide in whole cells (not shown). The effect of cysteine modification on glutamate transport activity was determined in membrane vesicles with a rightside-out orientation prepared from E. coli cells expressing the single cysteine mutants. Three small modifying reagents were used: NEM and MTSEA, which are membrane-permeable, and MTSET, which is charged and reportedly membrane-impermeable (26Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 27Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Treatment with NEM did not affect glutamate uptake of the cysteineless mutant when the vesicles were energized with the artificial electron donor system ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate (9Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, the methanethiosulfonate reagents severely reduced glutamate uptake activity by the cysteineless mutant using the same energizing method. Apparently, the reagents interfere with the generation of a proton motive force by inhibition of one of the components of the electron transport chain. Therefore, the proton motive force was generated using a combination of acetic acid and K+ diffusion gradients (20Tolner B. Ubbink-Kok T. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Glutamate transport catalyzed by the cysteineless mutant driven by the diffusion gradients was not significantly affected by the methanethiosulfonate reagents or NEM (Fig. 4 A). One of the four mutants that were labeled with fluorescein maleimide (Fig. 3), G374C, was inactivated by both the membrane-permeable and membrane-impermeable modifying reagents, consistent with accessibility from the outside (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, mutant S399C was inactivated by the membrane-permeable reagents MTSEA and NEM but not by the membrane-impermeable MTSET. This behavior is consistent with a cytoplasmic accessibility. The other mutants that were labeled with fluorescein maleimide, I375C and Q404C, were not inactivated by NEM (Fig. 4 A). Similarly the MTS reagents did not inactivate mutant Q404C, whereas the activity of mutant I375C was only slightly affected by the reagents. Apparently, modification of the single cysteines in these mutants is well tolerated. In the set of single cysteine mutants that were not labeled with fluorescein maleimide, three mutants, M381C, V388C, and N391C, could be inactivated by the membrane-permeable reagent MTSEA but not by the membrane-impermeable reagent MTSET and also not by NEM (Fig.4 A). Apparently, accessibility of the cysteine residues is very much restricted, allowing the small and flexible MTSEA reagent, but not NEM, which has a more constrained structure, to reach the residues. Because the membrane-impermeable analogue MTSET did not inhibit the three mutants, the cysteines in the mutants appear to be accessible through a narrow aqueous pore from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Finally, the activity of most of the mutants that were not labeled with fluorescein maleimide was not affected by any of the modifying reagents. These mutants either tolerated modification or could not be modified at all because they were not accessible. Based on the results described here it is not possible to distinguish between the two possibilities. When the region between Gly-374 and Ser-392 is modeled as an α-helix, all inactive, severely impaired, and nonexpressed mutants cluster on one face of the helix (black circles in Fig. 5 B), whereas the active mutants cluster on the other face (bars in Fig.5 A and open circles in 5B). The mutants that were inactivated by the cysteine-modifying reagents also cluster on one face of the helix. This face partially overlaps with the face of the helix containing the inactive mutants (gray barsand gray circles in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). Mutant G374C that is accessible from the periplasmic side of the membrane was inactivated with the membrane-impermeable reagent MTSET with a half-time of 1–2 min (Fig.4 B). Mutant S399C that is located at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane was not significantly inactivated in 10 min. However, longer incubations did result in partial inactivation of the mutant. This is most likely caused by a slow permeability of the reagent followed by access from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Similar observations were made for mutants M381C, V388C, and N391C (shown for V388C and N391C in Fig. 4 B), suggesting a similar accessibility from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane following the slow permeation of the reagent. A more detailed kinetic characterization of the single cysteine mutants was done in proteoliposomes. A procedure to purify GltT and to reconstitute the protein into proteoliposomes was described before (25Gaillard I. Slotboom D.J. Knol J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To interpret correctly results obtained with single cysteine mutants reconstituted in proteoliposomes (below), the orientation of GltT in the liposomal membrane was determin"

Flash photolysis of caged IP3 mimicked the agonist-induced voltage response, suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ release and subsequent opening of Ca2+-activated ion channels serve as the common transduction mechanism. In contrast, cAMP- and PKC-dependent pathways were not involved in the electrophysiological effects of the extracellular signaling molecules. The depolarization was predominantly mediated by a DIDS- and niflumic acid-sensitive Cl- current, whereas a charybdotoxin- and clotrimazole-sensitive K+ current underlay the prominent hyperpolarization. Consistent with the electrophysiological data, RT-PCR showed that HaCaT keratinocytes express two types of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels, CaCC2 and CaCC3 (CLCA2), as well as the Ca2+-activated K+ channel hSK4. That the pronounced hSK4-mediated hyperpolarization bears significance on the growth and differentiation properties of keratinocytes is suggested by RNase protection assays showing that hSK4 mRNA expression is strongly down-regulated under conditions that allow keratinocyte differentiation. hSK4 might thus play a role in linking changes in membrane potential to the biological fate of keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2000551229,"Using an antisense strategy, we have previously shown that in vascular myocytes, subtypes 1 and 2 of ryanodine receptors (RYRs) are required for Ca2+ release during Ca2+ sparks and global Ca2+ responses, evoked by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, whereas RYR subtype 3 (RYR3) has no contribution. Here, we investigated the effects of increased Ca2+ loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) on the RYR-mediated Ca2+ responses and the role of the RYR3 by injecting antisense oligonucleotides targeting the RYR subtypes. RYR3 expression was demonstrated by immunodetection in both freshly dissociated and cultured rat portal vein myocytes. Confocal Ca2+ measurements revealed that the number of cells showing spontaneous Ca2+ sparks was strongly increased by superfusing the vascular myocytes in 10 mmCa2+-containing solution. These Ca2+ sparks were blocked after inhibition of RYR1 or RYR2 by treatment with antisense oligolucleotides but not after inhibition of RYR3. In contrast, inhibition of RYR3 reduced the global Ca2+responses induced by caffeine and phenylephrine, indicating that RYR3 participated together with RYR1 and RYR2 to these Ca2+responses in Ca2+-overloaded myocytes. Ca2+transients evoked by photolysis of caged Ca2+ with increasing flash intensities were also reduced after inhibition of RYR3 and revealed that the [Ca2+]i sensitivity of RYR3 would be similar to that of RYR1 and RYR2. Our results show that, under conditions of increased SR Ca2+ loading, the RYR3 becomes activable by caffeine and local increases in [Ca2+]i.

Tanaka M. Ogawa Y. Nature. 1970; 228: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), the function of ryanodine receptor channels (RYRs)1 have been widely studied in both skeletal and cardiac muscles (2Fleischer S.

Commun. 1996; 222: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After the cloning and sequencing of three genes encoding different RYR subtypes, the localization and role of each RYR subtype in Ca2+ signaling have begun to be studied. Of the three RYRs, RYR subtype 3 (RYR3) is the most widely expressed (10Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), whereas RYR1 and RYR2 are mainly found in skeletal and cardiac muscles, respectively (11Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 12Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Hirose K. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3309-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, in arterial and venous smooth muscles, the three RYR subtypes have been identified (13Neylon C.B. Richards S.M. Larsen M.A. Agrotis A. Bobik A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but their role in Ca2+ release is still unclear. The regulation of the different RYR subtypes has been extensively studied using single channel recordings in lipid bilayers. The single channel properties of RYR subtypes are rather similar, i.e.they form a large conductance channel permeable to monovalent and divalent cations, which can be activated by ATP, caffeine, and submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+; inhibited by Mg2+, ruthenium red, and millimolar concentrations of Ca2+; and modulated by ryanodine (15Chu A.

However, differences in responses to cyclic ADP-ribose and caffeine as well as in sensitivities to Ca2+ activation and Ca2+inactivation have been reported between RYR1 and RYR3 and between RYR3s cloned from skeletal and smooth muscles (17Murayama T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16011-16020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these differences may result from the expression of different splice variants of RYR3 (21Miyatake R. Furukawa A. Matsushita M. Iwahashi K. Nakamura K. Ichikawa Y. Suwaki H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The physiological contribution of the different RYR subtypes to Ca2+ signaling has been addressed first by using either RYR1 and RYR2 knockout mice (12Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Hirose K. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3309-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Takeshima H. Yamazawa T. Ikemoto T. Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or RYR3 knockout mice (23Takeshima H. Ikemoto T. Nishi M. Nishiyama N. Shimuta M. Sugitani Y. Kuno J. Saito I. Saito H. Endo M.

J. 1999; 77: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In RYR1-null myotubes in culture, the Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in response to increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) or caffeine is strongly reduced, but a similar decrease in caffeine sensitivity is also observed in RYR3-null neonatal myocytes, suggesting a possible co-contribution of each RYR subtype to Ca2+signaling, at least at some stages of myogenesis. Accordingly, it has been recently proposed that, in embryonic skeletal muscle, both RYR1 and RYR3 may co-contribute to Ca2+ release during Ca2+ sparks (25Conklin M.W. Barone V. Sorrentino V. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ sparks produced independently in RYR1- or RYR3-null cells reveal similar spatio-temporal parameters (26Conklin M.W. Ahern C.A. Vallejo P. Sorrentino V. Takeshima H. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1777-17785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another approach using antisense oligonucleotides, that specifically targeted each one of the RYR subtypes, has been used to determine which RYR subtypes are responsible for Ca2+ sparks and global Ca2+ responses in smooth muscle cells (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It appears that both RYR1 and RYR2 are required for Ca2+ release during Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves induced by activation of L-type Ca2+ currents and that RYR3 does not contribute to these Ca2+ signals. In smooth muscle cells, Ca2+ sparks are observed spontaneously or in response to Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels (8Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana M.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J.

Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and their localization corresponds to coupling areas between the plasma membrane and the SR (28Arnaudeau S. Boittin F.X.

Res. 1998; 82: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In rat portal vein myocytes, spatial and temporal recruitment of Ca2+ sparks results in propagating Ca2+waves, which trigger cell contraction (30Boittin F.X. Macrez N. Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the effects of elevating the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) on both Ca2+ sparks and global Ca2+ responses induced by Ca2+, caffeine, and phenylephrine. Under conditions of increased SR Ca2+ loading, we provide the first evidence that the RYR3, which becomes activable by caffeine and localized increases in [Ca2+]i, is responsible for the increased global Ca2+ responses. We also found that spontaneous Ca2+ sparks are highly abundant but remain dependent on activation of only RYR1 and RYR2. Rats (160–180 g) were killed by cervical dislocation. The portal vein was cut into several pieces and incubated for 10 min in low Ca2+ (40 μm) physiological solution, and then 0.8 mg/ml collagenase (EC 3.4.24.3), 0.20 mg/ml Pronase E (EC 3.4.24.31), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added at 37 °C for 20 min. After this time, the solution was removed, and pieces of portal vein were incubated again in a fresh enzyme solution at 37 °C for 20 min. Tissues were placed in a enzyme-free solution and triturated using fire-polished Pasteur pipette to release cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 103 cells/mm2on glass slides imprinted with squares for localization of injected cells. Cells were maintained in short term primary culture in medium M199 containing 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin; they were kept in an incubator gassed with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The myocytes were cultured in this medium for 4 days. The normal physiological solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, with NaOH). Phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (denoted with the prefix “as”) used in the present study were designed on the known cloned RYR sequences deposited in the GenBank™ sequence data base with Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Sequences of all three RYR cDNAs were aligned with each other, and specific antisense oligonucleotide sequences were chosen in region of the cDNA of interest, completely different from the sequences of the two other RYR subtypes. Then antisense and scrambled sequences displaying putative binding to any other mammalian sequences deposited in GenBank™ were discarded. Oligonucleotides were injected into the nuclei of myocytes by a manual injection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Intranuclear oligonucleotide injection with Femtotips II (Eppendorf) was performed as previously described (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The myocytes were then cultured for 3–4 days in culture medium, and the glass slides were transferred into the perfusion chamber for physiological experiments. The sequences of as1RYR1 and as2RYR1 are AGCGTGTGCAGCAGGCTCA and GCAATCCGCTCCCGCCCA, corresponding to nucleotides 325–343 and 584–601, respectively, of RYR1 cDNA deposited in GenBankTM (accession numberX83932); those of as1RYR2 and as2RYR2 are GTGTCCTCACAGAAGTT and TGAAATCTAGTGCAGCCT, corresponding to nucleotides 137–153 and 1587–1604, respectively, of RYR2 cDNA (accession number X83933); and those of as1RYR3 and as2RYR3 are AAGTCAAGGGCATTTTTG and ACTTAGCCATGACACCAG, corresponding to nucleotides 502–519 and 557–574, respectively, of RYR3 cDNA (accession number X83934). In some control experiments, myocytes were injected with the following scrambled oligonucleotides: CACGCCTACGCACCTCCG, corresponding to a scrambled sequence of as2RYR1 (nucleotides 584–601 of RYR1 cDNA); AGTCGTACATGACTCGTA, corresponding to a scrambled sequence of as2RYR2 (nucleotides 1587–1604 of RYR2 cDNA); and CAGCACTATCAGTACGAC, corresponding to a scrambled sequence of as2RYR3 (nucleotides 557–574 of RYR3 cDNA). In most experiments, cells were loaded by incubation in physiological solution containing 4 μm fluo 3-acetoxymethylester (fluo 3-AM) for 1 h at room temperature. These cells were washed and allowed to cleave the dye to the active fluo 3 compound for at least 30 min. Images were acquired using the line scan mode of a confocal Bio-Rad MRC1000 microscope connected to a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Excitation light was delivered by a 25-milliwatt argon ion laser (Ion Laser Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) through a Nikon Plan Apo × 60, 1.4 NA objective lens. Fluo 3 was excited at 488 nm, and emitted fluorescence was filtered and measured at 540 ± 30 nm. At the setting used to detect fluo 3 fluorescence, the resolution of the microscope was near 0.4 × 0.4 × 1.5 μm (x,y, and z axis). Images were acquired in the line scan mode at a rate of 6 ms/scan. Scanned lines were plotted vertically, and each line was added to the right of the preceding line to form the line scan image. In these images, time increased from the left to the right, and position along the scanned line was given by vertical displacement. Fluorescence signals are expressed as pixel per pixel fluorescence ratios (F/Fo), whereF is the fluorescence during a response andFo is the rest level fluorescence of the same pixel. Image processing and analysis were performed by using COMOS, TCSM, and MPL 1000 software (Bio-Rad). In other experiments, cells were loaded by incubation in physiological solution containing 1 μm indo 1-AM for 30 min. [Ca2+]i measurements were estimated from the 405-/480-nm fluorescence ratio, as previously reported (31Morel J.L. Macrez-Leprêtre N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The minimum and maximum fluorescence (Rmin andRmax, respectively) values were determinedin vivo, in the absence of Ca2+ and at saturating Ca2+, in cells superfused in 1.7 and 10 mm [Ca2+]o. Caffeine and phenylephrine were applied by pressure ejection from a glass pipette for the period indicated on the records. All experiments were carried out at 26 ± 1 °C. Caged Ca2+, 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-EDTA, tetra(acetoxymethylester) (DMNP-EDTA, AM) at 15 μm, was added to the bathing solution and maintained in the presence of cells for 1 h in an incubator at 37 °C. Photolysis was produced by a 1-ms pulse from a xenon flash lamp (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, United Kingdom) focused to a ∼2-mm diameter spot around the cell. Light was band pass-filtered with a UG11 glass between 300 and 350 mm. Flash intensity could be adjusted by varying the capacitor-charging voltage between 0 and 380 V, which corresponded to a change in the energy input into the flash lamp from 0 to 240 J. On flash photolysis, Ca2+ was released within 2 ms, and the small percentage of conversion of the caged compound (∼10%) allowed us to apply repetitive pulses without altering the Ca2+ responses and the reserve of caged Ca2+. Freshly dissociated and cultured myocytes (3 days after injection) were immunostained as previously described (30Boittin F.X. Macrez N. Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were incubated in the presence of anti-RYR3-specific antibody (20Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A.M. Wu G.M.

Thereafter, cells were mounted in Vectashield. Images of the stained cells were obtained with the Bio-Rad confocal microscope. Control cells and injected cells on the same glass slide were compared with each other by keeping acquisition parameters constant (gray values, exposure time, aperture). Fluorescent labeling was estimated by gray level analysis using MPL software and expressed in arbitrary units of fluorescence. Collagenase was obtained from Worthington. Fluo 3-AM and DMNP-EDTA, AM were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Caffeine was from Merck. Indo 1-AM, ryanodine, and cyclopiazonic acid were from Calbiochem. Medium M199 was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Fetal calf serum was from Bio Media (Boussens, France). Streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, and pyruvate were from Life Technologies, Inc. All primers and phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized and purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). All other chemicals were from Sigma. The rabbit anti-RYR3-specific antibody was directed against the deduced amino acid sequence, 4326–4336 (11 amino acids), of rabbit RYR3 (20Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A.M. Wu G.M.

Data are expressed as means ± S.E.;n represents the number of tested cells. Significance was tested by means of Student's test. p values < 0.05 were considered as significant. The effects of increasing the external Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]o) in rat portal vein myocytes were studied in a series of experiments, in which caffeine (10 mm) was applied through a micropipette positioned near the surface of the cells and the resulting [Ca2+]ichanges were measured either in the entire cytosol (indo 1 experiments) or in a single line repeatedly scanned through the confocal cell section (fluo 3 experiments). In indo 1-loaded cells, the peak fluorescence (Δ ratio 405/480 nm) as well as the total fluorescence measured during 10-s applications of caffeine (Δ ratio × 10 s) increased in a time-dependent manner and reached a steady-state value within 1 h in 10 mmCa2+-containing solution. In 1.7 mm[Ca2+]o, the values for the peak and total fluorescence were 0.69 ± 0.03 and 119.2 ± 7.6, respectively (n = 46). In 10 mm[Ca2+]o, these values increased to 0.98 ± 0.03 (n = 79) and 272.2 ± 26.1 (n= 46), respectively, indicating a 40% increase in caffeine response amplitude and a 230% increase in SR Ca2+ release. In contrast, the basal [Ca2+]i was not significantly increased (from 55 ± 8 nm in 1.7 mm[Ca2+]o to 64 ± 10 nm in 10 mm [Ca2+]o, n = 46). In fluo 3-loaded cells (Fig. 1), the amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ waves, measured from a 2-μm region of the line scan image, also increased from 2.01 ± 0.10 (ΔF/Fo, n = 32) in 1.7 mm [Ca2+]o to 2.66 ± 0.08 (n = 45) in 10 mm[Ca2+]o, indicating a 30% increase in Ca2+ response amplitude (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the upstroke velocity of the caffeine-induced Ca2+response, corresponding to the initiation site of the response, was enhanced from 8.57 ± 0.71 (ΔF/Fo·s−1,n = 32) in 1.7 mm[Ca2+]o to 33.57 ± 4.27 (n= 45) in 10 mm [Ca2+]o, indicating a 350% increase in Ca2+ release velocity (Fig.1 B). Taken together, these results suggest that the SR Ca2+ content of vascular myocytes is increased by sustained elevation in extracellular [Ca2+] and that both amplitude and upstroke velocity of the Ca2+ responses can be used as significant parameters to study the cellular mechanisms involved during increased SR Ca2+ loading. To assess the role of the SR Ca2+ loading in the generation of large and fast Ca2+ responses to caffeine, the effects of 10 μm cyclopiazonic acid were first investigated on the caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses. Inhibition of the Ca2+ uptake capacity of the intracellular store by cyclopiazonic acid resulted in a small elevation of the basal [Ca2+]i and the suppression of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ response in the continuous presence of cyclopiazonic acid for 5 min (n = 6). In a second set of experiments, caffeine (10 mm) was applied in Ca2+-free, 0.5 mm EGTA-containing solution for 10 s (a time sufficient to remove voltage-dependent Ca2+ current) on myocytes superfused either in 1.7 mm [Ca2+]o or 10 mm[Ca2+]o. After 10 s in Ca2+-free solution, the amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+responses (measured with indo 1) was 0.55 ± 0.03 (Δ ratio,n = 26) in myocytes pretreated with 1.7 mm[Ca2+]o and 0.79 ± 0.07 (n= 26) in myocytes pretreated with 10 mm[Ca2+]o, indicating an increase in Ca2+ response amplitude similar to that obtained in Ca2+-containing solutions (about 40%). Taken together, these results suggest that the increased accumulation of Ca2+ in the SR is responsible for the large and fast caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses under conditions of increased [Ca2+]o. As recently published (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we designed antisense oligonucleotides specifically targeting each RYR subtype mRNA. For each RYR subtype, two antisense sequences were chosen, one targeting the region of the mRNA amplified in PCR experiments (named as2RYR) and the other one (named as1RYR) designed to hybridize the mRNA outside the amplified fragment but close to the start codon. The time course of antisense oligonucleotide efficiency was determined by checking the ability of a mixture of as1RYR1 + as1RYR2 + as1RYR3 (10 μm each) to inhibit the Ca2+ waves induced by 10 mmcaffeine in isolated myocytes superfused in 10 mm[Ca2+]o for 1 h. The Ca2+responses were strongly inhibited 3 days after nuclear injection of the antisense oligonucleotides (83 ± 5%, n = 30); recovery began the fourth day with an inhibition of 48 ± 5% (n = 25). Nonspecific effects of antisense oligonucleotides were detected only at concentrations higher than 50 μm (for example, inhibition of RYR2 protein expression by 50 μm anti-Gαo antisense oligonucleotide). Immunodetection of RYR3 with an anti-RYR3-specific antibody (20Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A.M. Wu G.M. Grassucci R. Wagenknecht T. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16011-16020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) revealed a homogeneous distribution of fluorescence in cell sections from freshly isolated and cultured myocytes (Fig.2, A and B). In cells injected with as1RYR3, the immunostaining was very weak (Fig.2 C), whereas it was not significantly changed in cells injected with as1RYR1 + 2 (Fig. 2, E and F). These results indicate that RYR3 is expressed in rat portal vein myocytes and can be selectively inhibited by asRYR3 without variation in the expression of the other RYR subtypes; they are in good agreement with previous data using BODIPY®-labeled ryanodine staining, which showed that inhibition of each one of the three RYR subtypes decreased by approximately one-third the specific fluorescence (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that, in 1.7 mm [Ca2+]o, both RYR1 and RYR2 are required for Ca2+ release during Ca2+ sparks evoked by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since elevation of luminal [Ca2+] has been suggested to increase the activity of RYRs (32Gyorke I. Gyorke S. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we studied the parameters of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks in Ca2+-overloaded cells. In control cells, superfused in 1.7 mm[Ca2+]o, spontaneous Ca2+ sparks were rarely detected, in less than 25% of cells tested (7/32 cells), and the number of initiation sites per line scan image was 1.1 ± 0.1 (n = 7). In 10 mm[Ca2+]o, spontaneous Ca2+ sparks were detected in about 80% of cells tested (116/140 cells; Fig.3 A), and the number of initiation sites per line scan image was 2.17 ± 0.21 (n = 44, Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the spatio-temporal parameters of Ca2+ sparks were not significantly different in 1.7 mm[Ca2+]o and 10 mm[Ca2+]o (TableI).Table IEffects of RYR3 antisense oligonucleotides on the parameters of Ca2+ sparksAmplitudeTime to peakFTHMFWHMnΔ (F/Fo)msmsμm1.7 mm [Ca2+]oNoninjected cells1.01 ± 0.0922.1 ± 0.936.1 ± 1.81.6 ± 0.23210 mm [Ca2+]oNoninjected cells1.02 ± 0.0721.4 ± 0.736.3 ± 1.31.9 ± 0.144asRYR3-injected cells0.88 ± 0.0622.1 ± 0.735.3 ± 1.81.8 ± 0.238Data are means ± S.E., with n indicating the number of cells tested in each conditions.

When cells were injected with asRYR1, asRYR2, or asRYR1 + 2, the number of cells with spontaneous Ca2+ sparks was strongly decreased (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the number of cells with spontaneous Ca2+ sparks and the number of initiation sites per line scan image were not significantly affected in cells injected with asRYR3 (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that under both normal (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and increased SR Ca2+content conditions, Ca2+ sparks are due to activation of both RYR1 and RYR2 and that RYR3 does not contribute to triggering Ca2+ sparks. In addition, the spatio-temporal parameters of Ca2+ sparks in 10 mm[Ca2+]o were not significantly different in noninjected cells and in cells injected with asRYR3 (Table I). Taken together, these results suggest that increased SR Ca2+loading potentiates the activity of Ca2+ release units formed by RYR1 and RYR2, leading to an increase in Ca2+spark frequency without alterations of the spatio-temporal parameters. We have previously shown that in 1.7 mm[Ca2+]o, caffeine triggers Ca2+ waves by activating both RYR1 and RYR2 (14Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of RYR1 or RYR2 by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides partly inhibited the caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses, whereas inhibition of RYR3 was ineffective (14Coussin F.

We show in nuclei-free lysates and cytoplasts that both cell lines failed to generate ceramide in response to ionizing radiation. Moreover, whereas cytoplasts did respond to anti-Fas stimulation through phosphatidylserine externalization, no effect was observed with ionizing radiation. Only in highly purified nuclei preparations did we observe ceramide generation, neutral sphingomyelinase activation, and apoptotic features (PARP cleavage, nuclear fragmentation, DNA laddering) in TF-1–33, but not in TF-1–34 cells. These observations suggest that nuclear sphingomyelinase and ceramide formation may contribute to ionizing radiation-triggered apoptosis.—Jaffrezou, J.-P., Bruno, A.

https://openalex.org/W2063328471,"In a series of papers, Ames and colleagues allege that the scientific and public health communities have perpetuated a series of 'misconceptions' that resulted in inaccurate identification of chemicals that pose potential human cancer risks, and misguided cancer prevention strategies and regulatory policies. They conclude that exposures to industrial and synthetic chemicals represent negligible cancer risks and that animal studies have little or no scientific value for assessing human risks. Their conclusions are based on flawed and untested assumptions. For instance, they claim that synthetic residues on food can be ignored because 99.99% of pesticides humans eat are natural, chemicals in plants are pesticides, and their potential to cause cancer equals that of synthetic pesticides. Similarly, Ames does not offer any convincing scientific evidence to justify discrediting bioassays for identifying human carcinogens. Ironically, their arguments center on a ranking procedure that relies on the same experimental data and extrapolation methods they criticize as being unreliable for evaluating cancer risks. We address their inconsistencies and flaws, and present scientific facts and our perspectives surrounding Ames' nine alleged misconceptions. Our conclusions agree with the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the National Toxicology Program, and other respected scientific organizations: in the absence of human data, animal studies are the most definitive for assessing human cancer risks. Animal data should not be ignored, and precautions should be taken to lessen human exposures. Dismissing animal carcinogenicity findings would lead to human cancer cases as the only means of demonstrating carcinogenicity of environmental agents. This is unacceptable public health policy."

We have used a biochemical approach to determine how many Gβγ subunits bind GIRK tetramers. By extending our previous chemical cross-linking studies (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which indicated that GIRKs form tetramers, we demonstrate that GIRK4 homotetramers bind four Gβγ subunits in their natural membrane environment. Bovine atrial plasma membranes were isolated (48Slaughter R.S. Sutko J.L. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3183-3190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized as described (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Native GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromultimers (IKACh) were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity as described (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The protease inhibitors leupeptin (50 μg/ml Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), aprotinin (1 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), and pepstatin (2 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) were used during all steps of the purification. Plasma membrane proteins containing GIRK1-AU5 and GIRK4-AU1 were isolated from COS7 cells and solubilized as described (49Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). G-proteins were isolated from bovine brain and separated into Gα and Gβγ subunits (50Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and were further purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized Gα (51Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated COS7 cells or native atrial membranes were treated for 1 h with 100 mmdithiothreitol and then dialyzed against 20–50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4–7.5 (Gβγ binding buffer). Individual membrane aliquots were preincubated with purified bovine brain Gβγ and rotated for 20 min at room temperature prior to cross-linking. The Gβγ stock solution was in Gβγ binding buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS (0.1% Gβγ binding buffer). The final CHAPS concentration was less than or equal to 0.1%. Solubilized COS7 membrane proteins were treated for 1 h with 100 mmdithiothreitol and then dialyzed against 0.1% Gβγ binding buffer. Individual aliquots were preincubated with purified brain Gβγ (supplied in 0.1% Gβγ binding buffer) and rotated for 20 min at room temperature prior to cross-linking. 5 mmdithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP, Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) was prepared as an 11× stock solution immediately prior to use in 100 mm HEPES-containing buffer, pH 7.5. Iodine was added only to solutions containing purified IKACh. Cross-linking reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature and then quenched with 50 mm Tris. Typically 5–10 μg of membrane proteins were used per reaction in a final volume of 15 μl. Atrial membrane proteins or recombinant GIRK proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (or 30 mmiodoacetamide when a cross-linking agent was used) for 15 min at 50 °C, 30 min at room temperature, and 15 min at 50 °C. 3–10% separating, 3% stacking, and pre-cast 2–15% (ISS) gels were utilized. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GIRK4 antibodies (generated against amino acids 19–32, Ref. 31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and/or anti-GIRK1 antibodies (generated against the last 156 amino acids of GIRK1, Ref. 31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several antibodies were tested for use in the anti-Gβγ immunoblotting experiments. Only one anti-Gβγ antibody (anti-KTREGNVRVSREL, Chemicon International, Inc. Temecula, CA) reacted with Gβγ after DTSSP treatment. Typically, DTSSP treatment reduced total antigenic signal by >90%, >60%, and >95% for anti-GIRK4, anti-GIRK1, and anti-Gβγ antibodies, respectively. Transfer times for immunoblot analysis were extended to >2 h at 15 V to improve transfer of the high molecular weight complexes. A GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California) was used to analyze the protein gels and immunoblots. Molecular masses were calculated using densitometry profiles from a combination of prestained high molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) and low and high molecular mass markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In a portion of the gels, thyroglobulin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to ensure linearity up to 330 kDa. Previous chemical cross-linking studies demonstrated that GIRK subunits form tetrameric channels and that the native atrial channel IKACh is composed of 2 GIRK1 and 2 GIRK4 subunits (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Complete cross-linking of purified atrial IKACh formed a single adduct with a total molecular mass that was most consistent with a tetramer. In addition, partial cross-linking of purified IKACh produced subsets of molecular weight adducts consistent with monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers. In this study, we extended our previous experiments to determine how many Gβγ molecules can be cross-linked to GIRK tetramers. To test whether GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromultimers could be directly and specifically cross-linked to Gβγ, we used isolated native atrial GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and bovine brain Gβγ (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Isolated GIRK1 and GIRK4 heterotetramers were preincubated with isolated Gβγ, followed by cross-linking with DTSSP (Fig.1). Although the predicted molecular masses of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits are 56 and 45 kDa, respectively, the glycosylated GIRK1 migrates in a broad band between 67–72 kDa (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the absence of Gβγ, a band formed at 230 kDa, consistent with the total molecular mass of two GIRK1 (56, 67–72 kDa) and two GIRK4 (45 kDa) subunits. In the presence of Gβγ, a band corresponding to a molecular mass of 390 kDa was detected. Because Gβγ, GIRK1 and GIRK4 were the predominant proteins present, we interpreted the 160-kDa shift as the result of direct cross-linking of Gβγ to GIRK channels. The molecular mass of Gβγ is 42 kDa, suggesting that the 160-kDa shift was because of cross-linking of several Gβγ molecules to the GIRK1/GIRK4 heterotetramers. Because GIRK4 can form homotetramers, we repeated the previous cross-linking experiment using recombinant GIRK4 subunits. In the absence of Gβγ, cross-linking of recombinant GIRK4 resulted in a band at 170 kDa, corresponding to GIRK4 homotetramers. When Gβγ was added to recombinant GIRK4, cross-linking yielded a band at ∼320 kDa (not shown). This banding pattern is most consistent with four specific and saturable Gβγ binding sites per GIRK4 homotetramer. It is important to study GIRK-Gβγ binding in its membrane environment because phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) (52Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 53Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) is involved in the Gβγ-mediated activation of GIRK channels. Our previous GIRK cross-linking studies employed isolated solubilized channels (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether GIRK subunits could be cross-linked into tetramers in membranes. After DTSSP cross-linking of membranes from COS7 cells expressing either recombinant GIRK4, GIRK1, or GIRK1 and GIRK4, SDS-PAGE yielded 180–220-kDa bands (Fig.2 B, lanes 1–3). These bands are similar in molecular mass to those produced when solubilized GIRKs are cross-linked into tetramers (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Of the GIRK tetramers, the chemically cross-linked GIRK4 homotetramers produced the narrowest band, around 190 kDa (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). In addition, the GIRK4 band cross-linked directly in membranes (Fig.2 B, lane 1) was narrower than that of GIRK4 that had been solubilized before cross-linking (31Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GIRK4 homotetramers were used in our membrane-confined GIRK-Gβγ binding experiments because cross-linking of GIRK4 homotetramers in membranes yielded the narrowest bands. We altered our cross-linking conditions to verify that there were indeed four Gβγ binding sites in the GIRK tetramer. DTSSP and Gβγ concentrations were adjusted so that variable numbers of Gβγ molecules were cross-linked to the GIRK4 homotetramers. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with GIRK4, and their membranes were divided into separate aliquots. Each aliquot was treated with variable amounts of Gβγ and DTSSP and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Untreated GIRK4, migrated as a 47-kDa trichloroacetic acid-disruptable monomer (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). GIRK4 cross-linked with DTSSP migrated as a 170-kDa tetramer (Fig.3 B, lane 2). GIRK4, preincubated with Gβγ and then cross-linked with DTSSP, resulted in a laddering pattern of four main adducts (in addition to the GIRK4 homotetramer adduct) with consistent 40–45-kDa increments between bands (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3 and 4). The proportion of high molecular weight adducts increased with increasing Gβγ concentrations. Unlike our previous experiments that used solubilized GIRK protein, a population of the membrane-confined GIRK4 homotetramers (166 kDa) remained resistant to any Gβγ binding. One possible explanation for this observation is that a subpopulation of GIRK4 homotetramers may not have been accessible to the exogenously applied Gβγ. In five independent trials, four GIRK-Gβγ adducts consistently appeared. In some trials, high molecular mass, lower intensity smears formed, but these bands were not consistently reproducible. A laddering pattern was not formed when Gβγ was boiled prior to its addition to membranes (data not shown). We hypothesize that the five adducts formed by treatment of Gβγ and GIRK4-containing solutions with DTSSP represent the binding of zero, one, two, three, and four Gβγ molecules to GIRK4 homotetramers. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Gβγ is directly cross-linked to GIRK channels in our experiments. Gβγ has been coimmunoprecipitated with GIRK subunits under the conditions used in our experiments (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ∼45-kDa increments between cross-linked GIRK-Gβγ adducts are consistent with the stepwise addition of 42-kDa Gβγ subunits to the channel. Finally, similar results were obtained even when IKACh and Gβγ were purified to >95% homogeneity prior to cross-linking. Because, IKAchand Gβγ are the predominant proteins in solution, the molecular mass shift with Gβγ addition strongly suggests that Gβγ is being directly cross-linked to the channel. As a final precaution, we tested whether the putative GIRK-Gβγ adducts are recognized by anti-Gβγ antibodies. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with GIRK4 and their membranes were isolated. The membranes were treated with Gβγ and DTSSP, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoblots were probed with anti-GIRK4 antibodies then stripped and reprobed with anti-Gβγ antibodies (Fig. 4,lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The anti-Gβγ antibodies recognized bands at molecular masses that correspond to the putative GIRK-Gβγ adducts. The present study of Gβγ binding to channel proteins has several advantages over other approaches. First, we ensured that we were using intact tetramers throughout our Gβγ binding experiments. In addition, we purposely studied Gβγ binding in membranes to approximate physiological conditions. This is especially important because PIP2, a component of the cell membrane, plays a role in Gβγ-mediated activation of GIRKs (52Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 53Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Nonprenylated Gβγ mutants do not activate GIRK channels (54Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Vorobiov D. Gilman A.G. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Dascal N. Nature. 1996; 380: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 55Nakajima Y. Nakajima S. Kozasa T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that Gβγ association with cell membranes may be a prerequisite for Gβγ binding. We have paid careful attention to detergent concentrations, because low detergent conditions can potentially expose hydrophobic patches on GIRKs, producing nonspecific binding. Indeed, we found it difficult to prevent GIRK and Gβγ aggregation in low detergent concentrations. The stoichiometry of the IKACh-Gβγ interaction has been repeatedly estimated by using the Hill equation to fit the Gβγ-IKACh dose-response curve. Estimates of the Hill coefficient for IKACh activation varied from 1.5 (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to 3 (56Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 57Kurachi Y. Tung R.T. Ito H. Nakajima T. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) whereas it was ∼1 in the study of the direct binding of purified IKACh and Gβγ proteins (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although often used to infer binding stoichiometry of Gβγ with GIRK subunits, the Hill coefficient is a measure of cooperativity, not the number of binding sites. For the Hill coefficient to equal the Gβγ binding stoichiometry, two criteria need to be met or approximated. The Gβγ molecules must bind the channel simultaneously and Gβγ must bind with infinite cooperativity (58Weiss J.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In addition, the Hill equation does not take into account the increasing open probability of the channel with each ligand molecule bound. Thus, the stoichiometry of Gβγ binding to IKACh is not adequately determined by fits of the Hill equation to the Gβγ dose-response relations. Even the more complicated Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (MWC) formula does not properly describe the subunit gating of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (59Ruiz M.L. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the cooperativity in IKACh activation (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 56Ito H. Sugimoto T. Kobayashi I. Takahashi K. Katada T. Ui M. Kurachi Y. J. Gen.

Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the Gβγ-dependent shifts in its gating modes (60Ivanova-Nikolova T.T. Breitwieser G.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 61Nemec J. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 246-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggest that GIRK channels have multiple Gβγ binding sites. Given the inadequacy of available models, a direct biochemical approach was used to determine GIRK-Gβγ binding stoichiometry. Solutions containing purified GIRK1 and GIRK4 were treated with the cross-linking reagent DTSSP in the presence or absence of Gβγ. A 230-kDa band was observed in the absence of Gβγ, compared with a 390-kDa band when Gβγ was present. We concluded that the 160-kDa shift was the result of covalent linkage of multiple 42-kDa Gβγ molecules to the channel. Next, solubilized recombinant GIRK4 homotetramers were treated with DTSSP in the presence and absence of Gβγ. A 170-kDa band formed without Gβγ in contrast to the 320-kDa band in the Gβγ-containing experiment. The 150-kDa shift in the presence of Gβγ is most consistent with the chemical cross-linking of four 42-kDa Gβγ molecules to the GIRK4 homotetramers with complete Gβγ binding site saturation and cross-linking. Finally, a variety of membrane-associated GIRK channels were treated with DTSSP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In each case, completely cross-linked GIRK tetramers resulted. To verify that there were four Gβγ binding sites in GIRK tetramers, we altered our cross-linking conditions. DTSSP and Gβγ concentrations were adjusted so that variable numbers of Gβγ molecules were cross-linked to the GIRK4 homotetramers. Five adducts, representing zero, one, two, three, and four Gβγ molecules cross-linked to the channel, were detected. We were unable to cross-link more than four Gβγ molecules to the channel, even with Gβγ concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than theKd for Gβγ binding to GIRK subunits. We conclude that four Gβγ subunits can bind to a GIRK tetramer. Currently, the Gβγ binding site on GIRK subunits is thought to reside primarily on the cytoplasmic C-terminal region shortly after the second transmembrane domain. But a detailed description of the GIRK/Gβγ binding site will undoubtedly require direct structural determination. For example, it is not possible to determine with our experiments whether the Gβγ binding pockets were formed within subunits or between subunits. Short of direct structural determination, in future experiments it may be possible to cross-link Gβγ to GIRKs during patch clamp recording. Such a technique has proven valuable in evaluating cyclic nucleotide binding to cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (59Ruiz M.L. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).

Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells of hematopoietic origin that are responsible for resorbing bone (1Walker D.G. Science. 1973; 180: 275Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Kahn A.J. Simmons D.J. Nature. 1975; 258: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Following tight attachment to the bone surface, osteoclasts begin the resorptive process by secreting protons into the extracellular space (3Baron R. Neff L. Louvard D. Courtoy P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2210-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), which results in the removal of bone mineral and the exposure of the underlying matrix. It also provides optimal conditions for the activity of osteoclast-derived proteases that ultimately solubilize these matrix components, which include type I collagen, osteopontin, osteonectin, and other components. The identification of the key enzyme(s) responsible for this protein matrix degradation is essential for understanding the mechanisms of bone metabolism and for the design of inhibitors of the resorptive process for the intervention of metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Numerous reports have suggested that cathepsin L and/or cathepsin K may be the major proteases involved in this process (4Woo J.-T. Yamaguchi K. Hayami T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S. Sugimoto K. Kondo K.

In contrast, it has been reported that the knockout of cathepsin K results in osteopetrosis that is characterized by osteosclerosis (8Saftig P. Huntziger E. Wehmeyer O. Jones S. Boyde A.

Both microcomputerized tomography and histomorphometry indicate an increase in trabecular number and in trabecular and cortical thickening in the knockout animals when compared with their wild-type littermates (9Gowen M.

Res. 1999; 14: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this mutation leads to the elimination of all osteoclast-related cathepsin activity and ultimately to a reduction in osteoclast-mediated matrix degradation. The importance of cathepsin K in the resorptive process is further supported by a rare skeletal disorder in humans called pyknodysostosis, which occurs as a result of mutations in the cathepsin K gene, resulting in elimination of cathepsin K activity (10Gelb B.D. Shi G.-P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The disorder is characterized by a reduction in the rate of bone turnover, which leads to poor quality dense bone that is predisposed to fracture (11Elmore S.M. Nance W.E. McGee B.J. Montmollin M.E. Engel E. Am. J. Med. 1966; 40: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Meredith S.C. Simon M.A. Laros G.S. Jackson M.A. J. Bone Jt. Surg.

Other skeletal manifestations of the disorder include a dysplasia in the bones of the face and clavicle, abnormal tooth eruption, and a lack of closure in the cranial sutures. Several reports claim that potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsin L are able to inhibit bone resorption both in vitro andin vivo (4Woo J.-T. Yamaguchi K. Hayami T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S.

Similarly, several studies suggest that small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin K are also capable of inhibitingin vitro and in vivo bone resorption (13Votta B.J. Levy M.A. Badger A. Bradbeer J.

In this study, we address this discrepancy and determine the relative importance of cathepsins L and K in human osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In the course of a program directed at specific inhibition of cathepsin K, we have discovered several inhibitors that are selective for this enzyme, but we also have found selective inhibitors of cathepsin L. We also have studied the inhibitor of Woo et al. (4Woo J.-T. Yamaguchi K. Hayami T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S. Sugimoto K. Kondo K. Tsuji T. Ohba Y. Tagami K. Sumitani K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that we find to be a potent inhibitor of both cathepsins L and K. Nonselective inhibitors from our inhibitor collection have also been studied. Our data suggest that cathepsin K and not cathepsin L is the major protease responsible for human osteoclastic bone resorption. Inhibition of human cathepsin K activity was measured as previously described (13Votta B.J. Levy M.A. Badger A. Bradbeer J. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Thompson S. Bossard M.J. Carr T. Connor J.R. Tomaszek T.A. Szewczuk L. Drake F.H. Veber D.F. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cathepsin L was measured under identical experimental conditions using the substrateZ-Phe-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin. As appropriate, linear portions of the initial velocity data from product progress curves were analyzed to generate steady-state constants. A standard curve with AMC was used in the conversion of fluorescence to molar units. Human osteoclastoma tissue (Jefferson Hospital, Philadelphia, PA) was obtained (with informed consent) at the time of surgery and frozen as described previously (15Dodds R.A. Connor J.R. James I.E. Arnett T.R. Henderson B. Methods in Bone Biology. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 198-238Google Scholar). Cryostat sections (7 μm) were cut on a Hacker cryostat (Hacker Instruments, Inc., Fairfield, NJ) equipped with a finely polished tungsten-tipped steel knife and flash-dried onto glass 4-well slides. Cryostat sections of human osteoclastoma were assayed for cathepsin activity using a slightly modified version of the azo-coupling procedure described by Dodds et al. 1Dodds, R. A., James, I. E., Rieman, D., Ahern, R., Hwang, S. M., Connor, J. R., Thompson, S. D., Veber, D. F., Drake, F. H., Holmes, S., Lark, M. W., and Gowen, M. (2001) J. Bone Miner. Res.16, 478–486. Each section was incubated in the presence or absence of inhibitors (0.01–1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C in 150 μl of the following reaction medium: 20% polypeptide (Sigma) in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mm EDTA and 7 mm substrate Ac-Leu-Arg-4-methoxy-β-naphthylamide. The medium was removed, and the sections were postcoupled with 0.25 mg/ml Fast Blue B Base (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and finally incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 100 mm CuSO4. The reaction product was measured on a per cell basis (× 40 objective at 550 nm) in a minimum of 10 osteoclasts in duplicate sections of osteoclastoma using a Vickers M85 scanning and integrating microdensitometer as described previously.1 Results are presented as IC50 for individual inhibitors as calculated from the resulting dose response curves. Human osteoclastoma-derived osteoclasts were isolated as previously described (17James I.E. Dodds R.A. Lee-Rykaczewski E. Eichman C.F. Connor J.R. Hart T.K. Maleeff B.E. Lackman R.D. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1608-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and were used in an in vitro bone resorption assay (18James I.E. Lark M.W. Zembryki D. Lee-Rykaczewski E.V. Hwang S.M. Tomaszek T.A. Belfiore P. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Isolated osteoclast-enriched cell preparations were seeded onto bovine cortical bone slices in the presence of compound (0.001–3 mm) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 48 h at 37 °C. Compounds were not tested at concentrations higher than 3 mm, because the vehicle is inhibitory at high concentrations. The culture supernatants were harvested, and the levels of the C-terminal peptide of the α-1 chain of human type I collagen were quantified with a biochemical readout of resorption using a second generation one-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Osteometer Biotech A/S, Herlev, Denmark). This is a modification of the original competitive assay described by Foged et al. (19Foged N.T. Delaisse J.-M. Hou P. Lou H. Sato T. Winding B. Bonde M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as percent inhibition of resorption. The IC50 values were determined from the resultant dose response curves. The compounds were synthesized in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry (SmithKline Beecham). Details of the design and synthesis of these compounds will be reported elsewhere. SB 412515, a potent cathepsin L and cathepsin K inhibitor, was originally synthesized and described by Woo et al. (4Woo J.-T. Yamaguchi K. Hayami T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S. Sugimoto K. Kondo K. Tsuji T. Ohba Y. Tagami K. Sumitani K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SB 290190, a potent and selective cathepsin K inhibitor, is described by Veberet al. (20Veber D.F. Yamashita D.S. Oh H.-J. Smith B.R. Salyers K. Lee C.-P. Marzulli A. Smith P. Tomaszek T. Tew D. McQueney M. Stroup G.B. Lark M.W. James I.E. Gowen M. Fields G.B. Tam J.P. Barany G Peptides for the New Millenium: Proceeding of the 16th American Peptide Symposium. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000: 453-455Google Scholar). The human cathepsin L inhibitors (SB 468420, SB 468432, and SB 468433 in TableI) used in this study are very potent inhibitors of this enzyme (Ki = 0.0099 ± 0.0003, 0.033 ± 0.006, and 0.272 ± 0.026 nm, respectively) and demonstrate impressive selectivity compared with the closely related cysteine protease, human cathepsin K (66- to >50,000-fold selectivity). The dipeptide aldehyde SB 412515 is also a potent cathepsin L inhibitor (Ki = 0.052 ± 0.002 nm), but it also shows activity against cathepsin K (Ki = 1.57 ± 0.367 nm, Table I). This compound was originally described as a potent cathepsin L inhibitor (4Woo J.-T. Yamaguchi K. Hayami T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S. Sugimoto K. Kondo K. Tsuji T. Ohba Y. Tagami K. Sumitani K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but no data were presented showing its activity against human cathepsin K. In contrast, SB 290190 is a potent inhibitor of cathepsin K (Ki = 0.050 ± 0.050 nm) and shows ∼72-fold selectivity over cathepsin L (Ki = 3.58 nm, Table I). The data in Table I are presented as Ki ± S.D.Table IEnzyme inhibitory activity of the cathepsin inhibitors Open table in a new tab To determine whether the cathepsin L selective inhibitors could inhibit native osteoclast cathepsins within whole tissue sections of human osteoclastoma, the compounds were evaluated in an in situ cytochemical assay using the cathepsin K/L substrate, Ac-Leu-Arg-4M-β-naphthylamide. Using this assay none of the cathepsin L selective compounds at concentrations of up to 1 μminhibited enzyme activity (Table II). The selective cathepsin L inhibitors also failed to decrease bone resorption at all concentrations tested (0.001–300 nm, Table II), even though their potency against cathepsin L ranged fromKi = 0.097 nm to Ki=1.7 nm (Table I). In contrast, SB 290190, a potent and selective cathepsin K inhibitor (Ki = 0.050 ± 0.005 nm), showed potent inhibition of osteoclast cathepsin activity in the cytochemical assay (Fig.1, IC50 = 63 ± 4 nm), and this activity translated into potent inhibition of bone resorptive activity in the in vitro resorption assay (Fig. 1, IC50 = 71 ± 25 nm, Table II, and Fig. 2). Significantly, SB 412515, a compound that had been reported previously as a selective inhibitor of cathepsin L (4Woo J.-T. Yamaguchi K. Hayami T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S. Sugimoto K. Kondo K. Tsuji T. Ohba Y. Tagami K. Sumitani K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), also demonstrated potent activity in both the in situ cytochemical assay (IC50 = 110 ± 5 nm) and the in vitro resorption assay (IC50 = 115 ± 40 nm). Subsequent measurement of the enzyme inhibitory activity of this compound revealed that it is a potent inhibitor of both human cathepsins K and L. Together these data indicate that inhibition of cathepsin K is required for the inhibition of bone resorption in vitro. Potent inhibition of cathepsin L without cathepsin K inhibition has no effect on this process.Table IIPotent and selective cathepsin L inhibitors do not block cathepsin activity or in vitro resorption by human osteoclasts Open table in a new tab Figure 2SB 412515, a potent dual cathepsin L and cathepsin K inhibitor, restricts in vitro human osteoclast-mediated resorption and in situ cathepsin activity. The compound was tested in the human osteoclast resorption (n = 4) (A) and cathepsin cytochemical assays (n = 4) (B). The compound was active in both assays and showed similar potency. The data are presented as percent inhibition ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Conflicting data suggest that cathepsin L may play a pivotal role in human osteoclast-mediated resorption. This study was designed to determine whether potent and selective inhibitors of this protease can indeed inhibit the resorptive process and to contrast them with potent and selective cathepsin K inhibitors. The data presented here show a lack of inhibition of both human osteoclast cathepsin activity and resorption by these selective cathepsin L inhibitors. In contrast, the compounds that show potent inhibition of cathepsin K (with some cathepsin L inhibitory activity) potently inhibit cathepsin activity and resorption in human osteoclasts. Taken together, these data indicate that cathepsin K is the single most important protease in human osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and that cathepsin L is not likely to play a role in this process. The pivotal role for cathepsin K in osteoclast-mediated bone matrix degradation has been described using multiple approaches. Northern blot (16Inaoka T. Bilbe G. Ishibashi O. Tezuka K.-I. Kamegawa M.

Furthermore, the enzyme is activated as the cells approach bone and distributed in a polarized fashion to the surface of the cell that interacts with the bone surface. In contrast, in situhybridization studies have shown that mRNA for cathepsins L, B, and S is undetectable in human osteoclasts (5Drake F.H. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Connor J.R. Debouck C. Richardson S.

Mutations in the cathepsin K gene also indicate the importance of cathepsin K in the resorptive process. The cathepsin K knockout mouse (8Saftig P. Huntziger E. Wehmeyer O. Jones S. Boyde A.

Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), are characterized by marked osteopetrosis as a result of retarded osteoclastic bone resorption. In contrast, a null mutation in the cathepsin L gene that resulted in mice lacking cathepsin L mRNA and biological activity did not present with bone abnormalities (7Hart K.A. Potts W. Bowyer J. Slynn G. Elston P. Vernon W. Tucker K. Johnstone D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: S181Google Scholar). We have previously described the development and characterization of a human in vitro resorption assay that uses osteoclastoma-derived osteoclasts (18James I.E. Lark M.W. Zembryki D. Lee-Rykaczewski E.V. Hwang S.M. Tomaszek T.A. Belfiore P. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This assay provides a robust and reproducible system for the evaluation of inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption including the inhibitors of cathepsin K. The potency of the cathepsin K compounds correlates strongly with the activity against recombinant human cathepsin K enzyme activity (r2 = 0.80). In addition to the resorption assay, we recently described the development of a quantitative cytochemical assay that measures cathepsin activity in osteoclasts in sections of human tissue.1 Previous studies using this assay on bone from cathepsin K knockout mice1indicated that cathepsin K was the enzyme activity being measured within osteoclasts in this assay. Consequently, the cathepsin cytochemical assay provides confirmation of the activity of the cathepsin K inhibitors in the resorption assay and is an essential part of our screen for potential cathepsin K inhibitors. It has been reported previously by Woo et al. (4Woo J.-T. Yamaguchi K. Hayami T. Kobori T. Sigeizumi S. Sugimoto K. Kondo K. Tsuji T. Ohba Y. Tagami K. Sumitani K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that the dipeptidyl aldehyde SB 412515 was a potent cathepsin L inhibitor that could inhibit both in vitro and in vivo bone resorption. Although this report describes the compound as a more potent inhibitor for cathepsin L than other cysteine proteases, such as cathepsin B and calpain II, its inhibition of cathepsin K was not reported. Similarly, Yasuma et al. (6Yasuma T. Oi S. Choh N. Nomura T. Furuyama N. Nishimura A. Fujisawa Y. Sohda T. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4301-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reports the preparation of a series of peptide aldehyde derivatives that demonstrated potent activity against cathepsin L; data were not reported for cathepsin K inhibition. One of these compounds inhibited bone resorption in vitro and prevented bone loss in the ovariectomized mouse (6Yasuma T. Oi S. Choh N. Nomura T. Furuyama N. Nishimura A. Fujisawa Y. Sohda T. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4301-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our enzyme activity studies revealed that SB 412515 had potent activity against human cathepsin K, as well as cathepsin L, and the compound from the Yasuma study (6Yasuma T. Oi S. Choh N. Nomura T. Furuyama N. Nishimura A. Fujisawa Y. Sohda T. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4301-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is a potent inhibitor of both human and mouse cathepsin K (data not shown). The lack of activity of the cathepsin L selective compounds confirm that it is the potent cathepsin K activity of SB 412515 and SB 290190 that explains their potent antiresorptive activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate using two distinct in vitro assays of human osteoclast function that cathepsin L selective inhibitors are unable to inhibit human osteoclast cathepsin activity, and this results in a lack of inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In contrast, potent inhibitors of cathepsin K reproducibly inhibited osteoclast function thus providing unequivocal evidence that it is cathepsin K and not cathepsin L that plays the pivotal role in osteoclast-mediated matrix degradation. We thank Dr. Richard Lackman of the Jefferson Hospital (Philadelphia, PA) for supplying the osteoclastoma tissues."

Eukaryal and archaeal histones, chromatin-associated proteins, and bacterial nucleoid proteins affect DNA structure by inducing compaction, bending, and/or supercoiling (9Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Arch.

Ner S.S. Churchill M.E.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). DNA supercoiling participates in essential functions in the cell, such as control of gene expression, DNA condensation, decatenation and segregation of replicated DNA molecules, and homologous DNA pairing (see Refs. 23Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1322-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar and24Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Scopus (190) Google Scholar and references therein). Whereas negative supercoiling is required to provide melting potential, positive supercoiling stabilizes the double helix; consistently, DNA is negatively supercoiled in mesophiles, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, whereas it is from relaxed to positively supercoiled in hyperthermophilic Archaea (25Charbonnier F. Forterre P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lopez-Garcia P. Forterre P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Positive supercoiling is considered a key element of the adaptation to high temperature and correlates with the presence of the enzyme reverse gyrase, which introduces positive superturns into DNA molecules (reviewed in Refs. 27Duguet M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 9. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 84-114Google Scholar and 28Forterre P. Bergerat A. Lopez-Garcia P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 18: 237-248Crossref Google Scholar). On the other hand, hyperthermophilic Archaea also contain classical topoisomerases, such as TopoVI (29Bergerat A. Gadelle D. Forterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27663-27669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TopoV (30Slesarev A.I. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Gellert M. Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which relax positive and negative superturns, and architectural proteins showing unwinding activity (13Mai V.Q. Chen X. Hong R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2322-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown for other organisms, rapid changes in DNA topology are associated with cold and heat shock in these organisms (26Lopez-Garcia P. Forterre P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that different factors cooperate in achieving careful regulation of general and local DNA topology in hyperthermophilic Archaea; mechanisms and elements taking part in this complex homeostatic process are poorly understood. Here we report the identification of a novel DNA-binding protein of Sulfolobus solfataricus, named Smj12, which is homologous to the transcription regulator Lrs14, an archaeal repressor belonging to the BA family; however, unlike Lrs14, Smj12 is a nonspecific DNA-binding protein. It is highly basic and thermostable, binds double-stranded DNA, and protects it from thermal denaturation. By using topoisomerase I assays we show that Smj12 induces positive supercoiling of minicircle and plasmid DNA. Whereas abundant proteins inducing negative supercoiling in Sulfolobus have been reported (13Mai V.Q. Chen X. Hong R. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2560-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Xue H. Guo R. Wen Y. Liu D. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Lopez-Garcia P. Knapp S. Ladenstein R. Forterre P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2322-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this is the first protein showing the opposite activity described in this organism. Moreover, Smj12 is not abundant as expected for architectural proteins. The possible function of Smj12 in the regulation of DNA conformation is discussed. Smj12 was identified while searching for activities able to recognize Holliday junctions (HJ) in Sulfolobus strains. The cells of two archaeal species, S. solfataricus MT4 and S. shibate B12, were supplied by the Center for Extremophile Research, Porton Down, UK. Cell lysis, centrifugation, and chromatography steps were carried out at 4 °C. 50-g cells were thawed in 150 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, HCl) and immediately sonicated for 5 × 1 min with cooling. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted 4-fold with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl) and applied to an SP-Sepharose high performance 26/10 column (Hi-Load; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A. A 500-ml linear gradient comprising 50 to 600 mm NaCl was used to elute cationic proteins. Fractions were assayed for four-way DNA junction-specific binding by gel electrophoresis mobility shift analysis using the32P-labeled synthetic four-way DNA junction Z28 (32Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25540-25546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An activity peak was detected in the fractions eluted from the column at 370 to 400 mm NaCl, and these fractions were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated protein (7 ml) was loaded onto a 26/70 gel filtration column (Superdex 200 Hi Load; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and developed with Buffer A containing 300 mmNaCl. Active fractions eluted at 210 to 225 ml were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of Buffer A. The protein was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (80 ml; 0.05 to 1 m NaCl), and active fractions were pooled and diluted 5-fold with Buffer A. Finally, the enzyme was loaded onto a Mono-S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 100 ml of 50 to 1,000 mm NaCl. The active fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stored at 4 °C until needed. A sample of the purified Smj12 protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein band was identified by staining with Coomassie Blue, excised, and destained with 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile. The gel piece was cut in 1-mm cubes and digested with 12.5 μg/ml modified trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 30 °C for 18 h. The gel pieces were removed by centrifugation (at 13,000 rpm for 15 min in a microcentrifuge) and subsequently washed with 50% acetonitrile:1% trifluoroacetic acid in water followed by centrifugation as above. The supernatants were pooled, and an aliquot of the mixture was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry in a Perceptive Biosystems Elite STR mass spectrometer using alpha-cyanocinnamic acid as the matrix. The supernatant was dried and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a 150 × 0.5-mm C18 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) coupled to an Applied Biosystems 173A microblotter HPLC system. The column was developed with a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water versus 70% acetonitrile:30% water in 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were detected at 210 nm, and fractions were collected onto a Problot/ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane fitted to the microblotter. After allowing the membrane to dry, relevant regions of the blot were excised and subjected to Edman sequence analysis in either an Applied Biosystems 492A or 476A protein sequencer. A synthetic gene encoding Sulfolobus Smj12 was constructed from the following six oligonucleotides shown below by recursive polymerase chain reaction (33Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar): Oligo 1, CGTCGGATCCCCATGGCCATCGAAATCTCCGAAAAATCCTTCCTGCTGAAACGTTTCCTGATCGTTGCTTACG; Oligo 2, TTTCGCTCGAGACGATTTTGATGAAAGCGTCAACGTCAGCTTCGGACAGACCGTAAGCAACGATCAGGAAACGTTTCAGC; Oligo 3, ATCGTCTCGAGCGAAACCGGTAAAGACGTTGACGCTATCGCTGGTGAACTGGGTATCTCCAAATCCCGTGCTTCCCTGATCC; Oligo 4, CACCTCTAGAAACGGAGGTTTTTTCTTTTTCAACCAGACCAGCGTCAGCCAGTTTTTTCAGGATCAGGGAAGCACGGGATTTGG; Oligo 5, CCGTTTCTAGAGGTGGTCGTCCGAAATTCCTGTACCGTATCAACAAAGAAGAACTGAAAAAGAAACTGATCAAACGTTCCGAAG; and Oligo 6, GGATCCGTCGACTTACAGGAAGGAGGAGATGATGGTGTGCAGGTCTTTGCAGGTTTCTTCGGAACGTTTGATCAGTTTCTTTTTCAG. Codon bias was optimized for expression in E. coli. The full-length polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into theBamHI site of vector pUC119 (CLONTECH), creating the plasmid pUC119-Smj12, whose insert was sequenced completely to ensure that no errors had been introduced in the amplification process. The Smj12 gene was subcloned from pUC119 into the BamHI and NcoI sites of the expression vector pET19b (Novagen), allowing expression of Smj12 with a native N terminus in BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) RIL cells (Stratagene). Transformed cultures were induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2.5 h; cells were lysed, and total extracts, showing strong expression of an ∼12-kDa protein band (data not shown) were heated for 20 min at 70 °C to precipitate E. coli proteins. Smj12 was purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography using SP-Sepharose or heparin columns. The synthetic gene, amplified with the addition of BglII andHindIII tails at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was also cloned in pQE-31 (Qiagen) cut with BamHI andHindIII. The resulting plasmid (after resequencing of the insert) was transformed in E. coli BL21 trx; the recombinant protein, containing a six-histidine tail at the N terminus, was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose as reported (3Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recovered protein was >95% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE (not shown). The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the GenBankTM/EBI data bases under accession numberAJ133494. S. solfataricus P2 cultures (200 ml) were grown at different A600 at 80 °C as indicated; total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). The amount of RNA loaded was normalized by the fluorescence of ribosomal RNAs in ethidium bromide-stained gels and by staining the filters with methylene blue. The same filters were hybridized sequentially with two random-primed probes, a 375-bp fragment containing the Smj12 coding sequence and a 390-bp fragment containing the Lrs14 coding sequence (3Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard reactions (10 μl) contained the following: 1× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol), purified Smj12, cold competitor DNA if appropriate, and 2–5 × 103 cpm of end-labeled probe (0.5 nm). After incubations at indicated temperatures samples were immediately loaded on native 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate buffer and run at room temperature. The gels were dried, and the autoradiograms were exposed at −80 °C. The probe BEN (300 bp) contained 280 bp of the upstream region of the Lrs14gene, amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned in pGEM-Teasy (Promega), and cut with EcoRI; the probe AMP contained 221 bp of the ampicillin gene obtained from pGEM3 byAvaII digestion. Probes were prepared by restriction digestion of the appropriate plasmid DNA, gel-purified, dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, and end-labeled using32P-γATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Relaxed circular probes were obtained by ligation of labeled fragments in the absence of any intercalating agents; minicircle probes with different topology were obtained as described below. S. solfataricus P2 cultures were grown at 80 °C until the A600 reached 0.5; cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Buffer E (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 500 mm NaCl, and lysed by sonication. Extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm to pellet cell debris and dialyzed against 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Appropriate volumes of extracts were denatured, loaded on polyacrylamide SDS gels, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit against Lrs14 and Sso7d and in goat against Smj12; secondary anti-rabbit and anti-goat peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were developed using the Amersham ECL-plus kit. The procedure reported (34Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2803-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was as follows: a 371-bp DNA fragment isolated from pUC18 by AclI restriction cleavage was dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase and 5′-end labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with 32P-γATP followed by a chase with cold ATP (1 mm). Labeled DNA fragments were incubated at a DNA concentration of 0.11 μg/ml (final volume 250 μl) in ligase buffer in the presence of 400 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 18 h at 16 °C and ethidium bromide at 0, 0.2, 0.6, or 1.2 μg/ml. After incubation 1% SDS and 1 m NaCl were added, and samples were extracted with 1 volume of chloroform (SEVAG extraction) and ethanol-precipitated. Samples were loaded on preparative 5% polyacrylamide gel and run at room temperature in 0.5 × TBE buffer (30 mm Tris borate, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8). Topoisomers were identified by their mobility relative to that of the topoisomer of ΔLk = 0, which is the slowest (34Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2803-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); minicircles of ΔLk = −2 and −3, obtained at the highest ethidium bromide concentrations, migrated less than topoisomer −1, suggesting that they deviate from the B form of DNA, as previously reported (34Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2803-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA minicircle molecules were extracted from gel and purified by SEVAG extraction and ethanol precipitation. The identity of each purified topoisomer was confirmed by topoisomerase I assay (35Zivanovic Y. Goulet I. Revet B. Le Bret M. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 267-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Assays were performed as reported (35Zivanovic Y. Goulet I. Revet B. Le Bret M. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 267-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Smj12 minicircles binding reaction mixes containing 0.8 ng of probe (0.33 nm) and indicated Smj12 amounts were incubated with 2 units of DNA topoisomerase I from wheat germ (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C. After SEVAG extraction and ethanol precipitation, samples were loaded on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and run at room temperature in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The gels were dried, and the autoradiograms were exposed at −80 °C. Relaxed pGEM3 plasmid DNA was prepared using DNA topoisomerase I (Promega) according to the manufacturer's conditions. Reaction mixture contained 300 ng (11 nm) of relaxed plasmid DNA, 4 units of topoisomerase I, and the indicated amount of Smj12 where appropriate. After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 1% SDS and by SEVAG extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Reaction products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature. Negatively to positively supercoiled plasmids were separated using no intercalating agent during the first dimension and 10 ng/ml ethidium bromide during the second dimension. Running conditions were 25 mA for 16–17 h and 15 mA for 22 h, respectively. Stained gels were photographed under UV light. In the frame of a project aimed at identification of components of the recombination pathway in archaea, we searched for activities able to recognize HJ in two Sulfolobus strains (S. solfataricus MT4 and S. shibate B2). Starting with a 50-g wet weight of cells, we assayed extracts for HJ-specific binding activity using a synthetic four-way DNA junction substrate (32Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25540-25546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The activity was detected in both archaeal species investigated after the fractionation of the cell lysates by cation exchange chromatography. The protein responsible for the activity was purified from S. solfataricus by means of four column chromatography steps, resulting in a 500-fold purification with an overall yield of some 15 μg of protein, which was >95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). The subunit molecular mass estimated by SDS-PAGE was 15,000 ± 1,000 Da, and the protein was eluted from a calibrated size exclusion column with a retention time consistent with a molecular mass of 31 ± 4,000 Da (data not shown), suggesting a dimeric composition in solution. Although the N terminus was blocked, in gel trypsin digestion after denaturing SDS-PAGE yielded ∼20 peptides. Nine were sequenced, and the longest sequence obtained (amino acid sequence IVSSETGKDVDAIAGELGISK) was used to search the S. solfataricus P2 genome sequence. 2S. solfataricus P2 genome project, unpublished results. A perfect match was found for a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 116 amino acids (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ133494). Other tryptic peptide sequences (80 residues in total) were also matched to this protein. The theoretical protein, designated Smj12, has a calculated molecular mass of 12,890 Da and an isoelectric point of 9.3, in agreement with the biochemical properties of the purified protein. The open reading frame annotated in the S. solfataricus data base starts with a TTG codon, which is not unusual in Archaea (36Dennis P.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It was not possible to confirm the authenticity of this initiation codon, because the N terminus of the protein was blocked. Data base searches showed that the predicted Smj12 protein shares significant sequence similarity with the Lrs14 protein of S. solfataricus (3Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); sequence homologs were found among hypothetical proteins of S. solfataricus and other Archaea whose genomes have been completed. The alignment with the best matches is shown in Fig. 2. We have analyzed transcription in vivo of the Smj12 gene by Northern blot (Fig. 3 A). Total RNA was extracted from S. solfataricus cells at different growth stages and was probed with a DNA fragment corresponding to theSmj12 coding sequence. The probe hybridized to a 0.4 kb-long transcript, accounting for a monocistronic transcription of the gene. This finding suggests that the Smj12 promoter is adjacent to its coding sequence; indeed sequences matching the consensus for the archaeal Tf-B responsive element and TATA elements (37Bell S.D. Kosa P.L. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were found in the region 49–34 upstream of the first TTG (Fig.3 C). Interestingly the steady-state Smj12 RNA was only present during the exponential phase (Fig. 3 A , lanes 2 and 3) and declined in later growth stages, a pattern different from that of three members of the Lrp/AsnC family, namely Lrs14, Sa-Lrp from S. acidocaldarius, and theE. coli Lrp, whose levels are sustained in the stationary phase (Fig. 3 B; see Refs. 3Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Enoru-Eta J. Gigot D. Thia-Toong T.L. Glansdorff N. Charlier D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3661-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, and 38Landgraf J.R. Wu J. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6930-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain suitable amounts of the protein we constructed a synthetic Smj12 gene with codons optimized for expression in E. coli; the gene was cloned both in vector pET9a, for expression from the presumptive first codon, and in vector pQE-31, for expression as a fusion protein with a histidine tag at the N terminus. The two recombinant proteins were identical in thermostability and binding properties (data not shown); unless otherwise specified, the experiments shown were obtained with the His-tailed protein. To characterize Smj12 binding properties we tested a variety of different fragments as probes in band shift experiments (Fig.4). The protein was able to bind linear (A and B) or circular (C) fragments and plasmids (not shown) of different length and sequence. In all cases the protein produced ladders of multiple complexes whose mobility decreased with increasing protein concentration; at higher concentrations the complexes hardly entered the gels. The binding affinity was comparable with all probes tested; theKapp calculated from data in Fig. 4 and data not shown was about 40 nm. Although the protein was identified for its ability to bind synthetic fragments containing HJ, Smj12 did not show higher affinity for such substrates (data not shown). Single-stranded DNA was not bound (data not shown). We conclude that Smj12 is a sequence-nonspecific DNA-binding protein and does not show DNA structure preference. Nonspecific DNA-binding proteins often induce compaction of DNA, a conformational change resulting in reduction of the hydrodynamic volume of DNA-protein complexes, which show electrophoretic acceleration rather than retardation; for instance, the archaeal proteins MC1 and Sso7d induce compaction of negative or positively supercoiled DNA molecules, respectively (39Toulmé F. Le Cam E. Teyssier C. Delain E. Sautiere P. Maurizot J.-C. Culard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6286-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3A. Napoli, Y. Zivanovic, C. Bocs, C. Buhler, M. Rossi, P. Forterre, and M. Ciaramella, submitted for publication. Complexes formed by Smj12 with DNA molecules of different nature (plasmids, minicircles of any topology, and linear fragments) were always retarded, and therefore there was no evidence of compaction (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Because S. solfataricus is a hyperthermophilic organism optimally living at 80–85 °C we tested the effect of temperature on Smj12 binding activity (Fig.5). Binding efficiency was unchanged in the range 37–75 °C, was reduced above 80 °C, and at 95 °C no stable complex was formed; in reactions performed above 80 °C the fraction of unbound probe was denatured. In contrast, when the protein was preincubated with DNA at 37 °C and then shifted to high temperatures, all the p"

A fundamental issue that needs to be addressed is the mechanism of binding of antigenic peptide to gp96. Here, we show using scanning transmission electron microscopy that recombinant gp96 binds peptide in stable multimeric complexes, which may have biological significance. To open the possibility for genetically engineering gp96 for improved immunogenicity and to understand if molecular recognition plays a role in the binding of antigenic peptide, we mutagenized some specific aromatic amino acids in the presumed peptide-binding pocket. Replacement of Tyr-667 or Tyr-678 to Ala reduced affinity for peptide whereas conversion of Trp-654 to Tyr increased peptide binding. Similarly, changing Trp-621 to Phe or Leu or Ala or Ile negatively affected peptide binding whereas changing Trp-621 to Tyr or Val positively affected peptide binding. Probing the peptide microenvironment in gp96-peptide complexes, suggested that hydrophobic interactions (and perhaps hydrogen bonding/stacking interactions) may play a role in peptide loading by gp96.

Intriguingly, gp96 acts as a chaperone of peptides and aids in provoking a strong immune response against peptide antigens (12Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 657-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Its potential as a natural adjuvant for therapeutic cancer vaccines makes this protein highly significant for human health. The proposed role of gp96 is to ferry antigenic peptides into specialized antigen-presenting cells via receptor-mediated internalization of gp96-antigenic peptide complexes (15Binder R.J. Han D.K.

Clearly, the primary event in the HSP-mediated immune response pathway appears to be the recognition and binding of antigenic peptides by gp96. In this context many questions remain unanswered;e.g. how are peptides selected, and what are the mechanisms of peptide binding by gp96? To address this, we developed a highly sensitive fluorescence-based assay for gp96/peptide binding (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and mapped the minimal peptide-binding site to amino acid residues 624–630 in the C-terminal region of gp96 (23Linderoth N.A. Popowicz A. Sastry S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A molecular model of the gp96 peptide-binding site was offered with the suggestion that the antigenic peptide may bind in a pocket. Here, to further explore the molecular interactions of peptide and gp96, we used STEM to show that gp96-peptide complexes exist in higher order multimeric complexes and used site-directed mutagenesis to understand the role of specific aromatic amino acid residues in the gp96 peptide-binding pocket. Wild-type and mutant His-gp96 proteins were purified from plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli strain JM109 using published procedures (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol.

The purity and intactness of the proteins were assessed by electrophoresis in SDS-containing 10‥ polyacrylamide gels, silver staining, and immunoblotting (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol.

Peptide RGYVYQGLKSGLRRASLGRS is a known ligand of gp96 that contains a vesicular stomatitis virus-derived core sequence (23Linderoth N.A. Popowicz A. Sastry S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was synthesized (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX) and purified by HPLC. The peptide was covalently labeled with nanogold using the amine-reactive reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimido nanogold according to the manufacturer's protocol (Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY). A 10-fold molar excess of peptide over nanogold was used to maximize the coupling efficiency. To purify nanogold-peptide from free peptide and nanogold, the reaction was subjected to ultrafiltration (10 kDa molecular mass cut-off) and washed repeatedly with 0.1m triethylammonium acetate-water. The retentate was filtered (0.45 micron) and the nanogold-peptide conjugate was purified by C18 reverse phase HPLC. The following HPLC gradient was used: 10 min of 0.1 m TEAA-water and a linear ramp from 100‥ 0.1 m TEAA-water to 100‥ MeOH in 30 min. The nanogold-peptide-containing fractions were identified using inline absorption spectra (A280,A420) collected using a diode array detector (Hewlett-Packard 1090 series HPLC) and identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing nanogold-peptide were driedin vacuuo and dissolved in water. Portions were separated on SDS-containing 15‥ polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with LI silver enhancement solution (Nanoprobes) to detect gold-containing bands. A binding mixture consisting of 5 μm gp96 and 5 μm nanogold-peptide in 10 mmNa+/HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 was incubated for several hours at room temperature. Assuming that the Kd for the modified peptide was equivalent to that of the unmodified peptide (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S.

The STEM analysis was carried out as described previously (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S.

Open table in a new tab WT and mutant His-gp96 proteins (1 mg/ml) were dialyzed versus 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and the spectra were acquired and data processed as described before (10Linderoth N.A.

Peptide-pyrene conjugate was prepared and purified by HPLC as described previously (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Equilibrium peptide-pyrene binding to WT and mutant His-gp96 proteins was done in a final volume of 12 μl of binding buffer (20 mmHEPES/Na+, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). A fixed concentration of gp96 (typically 5 μm) was mixed with different concentrations of peptide-pyrene (400 pm to 5 μm). Binding mixtures were prepared at 25 °C and incubated at room temperature for ∼3 h. Control reactions were prepared with matched concentrations of peptide-pyrene alone. Binding buffer was added to a final volume of 650 μl. The steady-state fluorescence intensity of the samples was measured and corrected for background buffer signal. All steady-state fluorescence spectra were acquired at 23 °C using JOBIN YVON/SPEX fluorolog3 τ instrument (Instruments, S.A. Inc., NJ) as previously described (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The excitation was performed at 340 nm and the emission was measured at either 376 or 396 nm with a 5-nm bandpass set for both monochromators. Intensity-average lifetime (<τ>) measurements were acquired by using the phase-shift and demodulation method (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 10.

A scattering agent, LudoxTM in water (0 ns lifetime), was used to correct for baseline fluctuations during lifetime acquisition. Lifetimes of the experimental samples were measured against 1,4-bis[5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl]benzene in MeOH. Excitation was performed at 340 nm and emission was measured by using the T-detector fitted with a neutral density filter (KV340, Schott) to cutoff stray light below 340 nm. The AC/DC signals were balanced for the reference and experimental samples. Twelve modulated excitation frequencies ranging from 1 to 10 MHz were synthesized. A minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 repeat measurements of phase and demodulation were taken. Intensity-average lifetime was calculated from the fractional amplitude (α) and lifetime (τ) using both the phase-shift and demodulation data. Post-experiment iterative lifetime modeling program version 2.1 (SPEX) was used to fit the data to a multiexponential decay model, giving fits with good χ2values (Table II). Fitting the lifetime data to a single-exponential model gave unacceptable χ2values.Table IILifetime parameters for gp96-peptide-pyrene complexesItemα1 2-aα1 is the fractional amplitude normalized to sum of 1.α2α3α4τ1 2-bτi is the lifetime (ns) associated with each component.τ2τ3τ4τ− 2-cτ− is the number-average lifetime (ns): Σαiτi/Σαi.<τ> 2-d<τ> is the intensity-average lifetime (ns): Σαiτi2/Σαiτi.χ2 2-eχ2 is a measure of the goodness of fit.Peptide-Pyr0.700.29——77.410.5——9087 2-fThe standard error for the average lifetime is ± 20–30 ns.1.1WT0.190.250.220.33—19.635.592.81501471.2Y575A0.170.140.600.08—11.960.4105.61811771.2Y652A0.130.050.790.030.20.256.456.61141121.5Y667A0.110.010.88—0.2—57.0—58561.0Y677A0.010.02—0.971.51.762.362.41291271.5Y678A0.200.80———71.2——72701.0Y677A + Y678A0.330.67——1.561.5——64621.0W485Y0.270.220.55—7.27.692.659.31611661.6W654F0.120.120.610.13—9.956.5116.01831811.0W654L0.070.070.000.854.14.280.980.41721691.4W654Y0.160.460.290.0955.60.0143.4114.23143121.2W621A0.320.68——13.282——96.2941.1W621F1.00———108———1091072.0W621I0.040.96——4.599.5——1051031.3W621L0.090.91——24.7109——1351121.0W621V0.640.36——24.9222——2472461.2W621Y0.770.23——16.4291——3083091.12-a α1 is the fractional amplitude normalized to sum of 1.2-b τi is the lifetime (ns) associated with each component.2-c τ− is the number-average lifetime (ns): Σαiτi/Σαi.2-d <τ> is the intensity-average lifetime (ns): Σαiτi2/Σαiτi.2-e χ2 is a measure of the goodness of fit.2-f The standard error for the average lifetime is ± 20–30 ns. Open table in a new tab Recently, we used STEM to show that gp96 forms higher order multimers larger than dimers (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was shown that native mouse protein also forms higher order structures (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We wished to know if peptide could be bound to gp96 in these large multimeric structures. Therefore we prepared antigenic peptide conjugated to 1.4 nm-nanogold and used STEM to analyze the peptide-gp96 complexes. STEM is particularly useful for studying higher order structures because one observes bare, unstained molecules and can obtain estimates of masses and dimensions. For this purpose STEM is superior to solution-based techniques and other types of electron microscopy. Moreover, using STEM one can directly visualize and count nanogold-peptide particles (28Gregori L. Hainfeld J.F. Simon M.N. Goldgaber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 58-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nanogold-peptide-gp96 complexes were prepared at concentrations approaching intracellular gp96 concentrations (∼5–10 μm, Ref. 1Koch G. Smith M. Macer D. Webster P. Mortata R. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 86: 217-232PubMed Google Scholar) and the complexes were diluted just prior to visualization by STEM (Fig.1). Nanogold-peptide was seen as bright white spots against the background of gray gp96 multimeric structures resting on a black surface (Fig. 1, A–E). It was not possible to determine whether a given nanogold-peptide resided on a distal or proximal surface of a complex because with STEM one sees a two-dimensional (transmission) projection of the particle. Isolated nanogold-peptide was also seen in some fields (Fig. 1,F–J) but at a much lower density than observed with or in close proximity to gp96 (Fig. 1,A--E). In general, these examples of STEM images showing massive gp96 multimers are similar to ones seen earlier that were prepared without peptide (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) except that we did not observe many smaller complexes of gp96 such as monomer/dimer, tetramers etc. This suggested that gp96-peptide complexes were assembled in large multimers and that dilution and washing did not dissociate bound peptide, consistent with our previous findings (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We manually counted the number of nanogold-peptide associated with gp96 complexes and found that the number of bound nanogold-peptide roughly corresponded to the number of gp96 monomer units in a complex (Fig. 1, below). With some types of samples, e.g. large viruses, nanogold-signal from a distal surface might be obscured because of sample thickness. However, this is unlikely to be the case with gp96 complexes. It is possible that some gp96 molecules in the multimeric complex failed to bind nanogold-peptide or lost their nanogold-peptide during sample processing. The dimensions of the multimeric complexes suggested no specific geometric configuration, only unordered shapes (Fig. 1, A–E and lower table), consistent with previous findings (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was not possible with this limited amount of data. Many of the molecules (not shown) appeared to be “denatured” because of unknown reasons. The finding that gp96-peptide complexes are assembled in massive multimers is potentially important because such a binding mode may facilitate the transport and receptor-mediated uptake of gp96-peptide complexes into antigen-presenting cells (15Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). These large complexes may sequester peptide more effectively than smaller ones (dimers, tetramers, etc.), resulting in more efficient delivery of antigenic peptides to their subcellular destination in the antigen presenting cell for further processing. Also, higher order complexes may be more easily bound by the cognate gp96 receptors, because the high local concentration of gp96-peptide complexes could greatly enhance the frequency of collisional interaction with gp96 receptors. Thus we suggest a biological significance for the higher order assembly of gp96-peptide complexes. We recently identified the peptide-binding site of gp96 based on photochemical cross-linking studies (23Linderoth N.A. Popowicz A. Sastry S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because no high resolution structure exists for the gp96- or HSP90-peptide complex, we constructed a computer model depicting the peptide-binding pocket of gp96 (for details and rationalization see Ref. 23Linderoth N.A. Popowicz A. Sastry S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This model has served as a guide for further exploration of the molecular nature of gp96-peptide interactions. Crystallographic and NMR studies of other peptide-binding proteins have revealed that aromatic amino acids such as Tyr and Trp play an important, although nonexclusive role in optimal peptide-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 30Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For example, in the MHC I molecule-antigenic peptide complex, tyrosyl residues from the MHC form H-bonds with “anchor” tyrosyl residues in the bound peptide (31Zhang W. Young A.C.M. Imarai M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Also, most of the specificity in the MHC class II molecule HLA·DR1-peptide complex comes from binding to an N-terminal tyrosine in peptide. Likewise, the SH2 domains of Src-tyrosine kinase and Syp-tyrosine phosphatase utilize phosphotyrosines in peptide for their interactions (32Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 33Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jaques S. Margolis B. Schlessiger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To better understand the microenvironment of the peptide-binding pocket of gp96, we turned to site-specific mutagenesis. The peptide-binding domain of gp96 contains five Tyr and three Trp residues. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to alter these codons in expression vector pHisGP96 (Table I). Each of the Tyr codons was individually changed to an Ala codon; a mutant with both Y677A and Y678A was also constructed. Alanine was selected as the replacement amino acid for Tyr because it lacks the large bulky hydrophobic side chain proposed to interface with peptide ligand but retains some hydrophobicity. Alanine is the most common amino acid in proteins, does not introduce new hydrogen bonding or charge and is found in both buried and exposed regions of proteins and in all types of secondary structure (27Wachsman J.T. Drake J.W. Genetics. 1987; 115: 405-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Trp-codon alterations, Trp-485 was replaced with Tyr because nearly all HSP90 proteins have Tyr at the equivalent position. Trp-621 was substituted with Ala, Ile, Leu, and Val, because all of these residues can be found at this position in various HSP90 homologs. Mutants with Phe-621 and Tyr-621 were also tested, in case gp96 structure or function might require a large hydrophobic side-chain at this position. In place of Trp-654, only conservative replacements to Phe, Leu, and Tyr were made; Trp is the only amino acid found in gp96 homologs at this position. gp96 mutant proteins, which had N-terminal His6 tags, were purified using Ni2+-affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (Fig.2). Silver staining of the gel showed that the mutant proteins migrated as single bands similar to the WT gp96 protein (Fig. 2 A). Western blotting with a C terminus-recognizing anti-KDEL antibody indicated that the proteins were full-length and intact (Fig. 2 B and not shown). The results indicated that the mutant protein preparation was >95‥ pure gp96. To find out if single mutations in the gp96 protein affected secondary structure, we used CD spectroscopy. CD is a sensitive method for measuring changes in protein conformation. An example of the CD data is shown in Fig. 3, top panel. Data for the other mutants are not shown because they were similar to Fig. 3 (top panel) within experimental error. The CD data showed that global secondary structure content was not appreciably affected by the changes in single amino acids. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that local conformation of small segments in the protein may have been affected by the point mutations, which may affect peptide binding. To assay for peptide binding in solution and to quantitate the differences in peptide loading efficiencies of gp96 mutant proteins, we used a pyrene-labeled peptide ligand. The detailed procedure for synthesis of this fluorescent peptide and method of assay for peptide binding by gp96 have been described elsewhere (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fluorescent group pyrene was attached to the unique lysine residue in the peptide (SLSDLRGYVYQGLKSGNVS) via an amide linkage. Here the pyrene serves as an optical sensor of the changes in the environment of the peptide-binding site. When peptide-pyrene binds to gp96 there is an increase in the excited-state lifetime of pyrene because it is in a hydrophobic environment (10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T. Sastry S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By measuring the fluorescence intensity and the intensity-averaged lifetime of pyrene, we can gauge peptide binding affinities as well as the extent of changes in hydrophobicity as previously demonstrated (9Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Linderoth N.A. Simon M.N. Rodionovaz N.A. Cadene M. Laws W.R. Chait B.T.

This assay has several advantages over STEM for the present purpose. 1) The fluorescence assay allows for “sensing” the microscopic changes in pyrene environment (which may translate into peptide environment) brought about by alterations in amino acid side chains. 2) The fluorescence assay is quantitative; t"
https://openalex.org/W2048047111,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a T cell-regulated, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease. Immunization with two myasthenogenic peptides, p195-212 and p259-271, which are sequences of the human acetylcholine receptor, resulted in MG-associated immune responses. A dual altered peptide ligand (APL) composed of the two APLs of the myasthenogenic peptides inhibited, in vitro and in vivo, those responses. This study was aimed at understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the in vivo inhibitory properties of the dual APL. To this end, we analyzed T cells of mice that were immunized with p259-271 for their adhesiveness toward vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, for the activity of their secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and for their intracellular phospholipase C (PLC) activity. Immunization with p259-271 triggered the above three activities and in vivo administration of the dual APL inhibited the latter. Thus, treatment of mice with the dual APL interferes with functions required for T cells to migrate and interact with the self-AChR. This is the first indication that very late antigen 4, MMP-9, and PLC are targets for immunomodulation of autoreactive T cells by altered peptide ligands."

In this study, we show that isolated peptides corresponding to several bacterial signal sequences inhibit the GTPase activity of the Escherichia colisignal recognition particle, as previously reported (Miller, J. D., Bernstein, H. D., and Walter, P. (1994) Nature 367, 657–659), but not by the direct mechanism proposed. Instead, isolated signal peptides bind nonspecifically to the RNA component and aggregate the entire signal recognition particle, leading to a loss of its intrinsic GTPase activity. Surprisingly, only “functional” peptide sequences aggregate RNA; the peptides in general use as “nonfunctional” negative controls (e.g. those with deletions or charged substitutions within the hydrophobic core), are sufficiently different in physical character that they do not aggregate RNA and thus have no effect on the GTPase activity of the signal recognition particle. We propose that the reported effect of functional signal peptides on the GTPase activity of the signal recognition particle is an artifact of the high peptide concentrations and low salt conditions used in these in vitro studies and that signal sequences at the N terminus of nascent chains in vivo do not exhibit this activity.

We propose that the reported effect of functional signal peptides on the GTPase activity of the signal recognition particle is an artifact of the high peptide concentrations and low salt conditions used in these in vitro studies and that signal sequences at the N terminus of nascent chains in vivo do not exhibit this activity. The targeting of nascent secretory and integral membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes and the inner membrane of bacteria has been extensively studied in recent years, and many details of the pathway have been uncovered (1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 2Bernstein H.D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R715-R718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, targeting begins when the N-terminal signal sequence of a nascent secretory protein being synthesized by the ribosome is specifically recognized by the SRP54 1The abbreviations used are: SRPsignal recognition particleFfhfifty-four homologuesubunit of the signal recognition particle. SRP bound to the ribosome-nascent chain complex interacts with its receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and subsequently the ribosome-nascent chain complex is passed to the translocon. A tight junction formed between the ribosome and the translocon then allows cotranslational vectorial transfer of the nascent polypeptide chain into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.In contrast, prokaryotic cells use multiple pathways to target nascent protein chains to their final destinations (3Duong F. Eichler J. Price A. Leonard M.R. Wickner W. Cell. 1997; 91: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The SRP homologue in Escherichia coli is part of a specialized system responsible for bringing polytopic inner membrane proteins to the cell membrane for cotranslational insertion (4MacFarlane J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Compared with the eukaryotic SRP, which contains six protein subunits bound to a 7SL RNA scaffold, the E. coli SRP consists of a single protein subunit (Ffh, forfifty-four homologue) that is bound to a smaller but homologous RNA termed 4.5S RNA (1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Ffh and SRP54 share similar two-domain modular structures with an N-terminal GTPase (NG) domain and a C-terminal methionine-rich M domain (9Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hobben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P. Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 10Römisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehn S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1989; 340: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that binds to both RNA and signal sequences (11Römisch K. Webb J. Lingelbach K. Gausepohl H. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Zopf D. Bernstein H.D. Johnson A.E. Walter P.

The relative simplicity of the E. coli SRP makes it a tractable model for the eukaryotic system.Signal sequences function as molecular zip codes, specifying the destination of each nascent chain. Despite a lack of consensus among the signal sequences of different proteins, they do share some very general characteristics, such as an N-terminal region that is typically positively charged (the n-region) followed by a hydrophobic core of 7–13 amino acids (the h-region) and a C-terminal polar sequence containing a cleavage site recognized by signal peptidase (the c-region) (14Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). How such divergent sequences are specifically recognized by SRP has remained a puzzle for many years. High resolution structures of the M domains of Ffh and SRP54 suggest that signal sequences may be bound by a hydrophobic “finger” loop that has sufficient flexibility to mold itself to a wide variety of sequences (15Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 16Clemons Jr., W.M. Gowda K. Black S.D. Zwieb C. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on a crystal structure of the Ffh M domain complexed with 4.5S RNA, Batey et al. (17Batey R.T. Rambo R.T. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) recently proposed that an RNA surface contiguous with the finger loop cleft might contribute to the recognition of the positively charged n-region of the signal sequence. Whether these proposed models faithfully represent signal sequence recognition will have to await a structure of SRP54 or Ffh in a complex with a signal peptide.The structural and functional consequences of signal sequence binding to SRP have long been the subject of intensive investigation. One attractive hypothesis that has been tested by a number of laboratories is that signal sequence binding to SRP54 or Ffh regulates the binding and/or hydrolysis of nucleotides by the NG domain. In related studies, isolated peptides corresponding to the signal sequence of the E. coli outer membrane protein, LamB, were shown to inhibit the GTPase activity of the E. coli and canine pancreas SRPs by blocking nucleotide binding (18Miller J.D. Wilhelm H. Gierasch L. Gilmore R. Walter P. Nature. 1993; 366: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Conversely, however, Bacheret al. (20Bacher G. Lütcke H. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) demonstrated that signal sequences presented to SRP as ribosome-nascent chain complexes increased GTP binding to SRP. These data were reconciled with previous results by proposing that a ribosomal component overcomes the signal sequence-induced inhibition of nucleotide binding. Finally, an elegant study by Rapiejko and Gilmore (21Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Cell. 1997; 89: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) clearly shows that the nucleotide-binding site in SRP54 can remain empty until its high affinity interaction with SRP receptor, arguing that signal sequence binding to SRP54 has little or no effect on GTP binding. In the arena of structural effects, peptides corresponding to functional signal sequences have been shown to destabilize the tertiary structure of isolated Ffh, an effect that can be reversed by the addition of 4.5S RNA (22Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These studies would seem to indicate that signal sequences inhibit, enhance, or have no effect on nucleotide binding to SRP depending upon the experimental conditions used. Here we present an explanation for this apparent contradiction.Our work demonstrates that experiments conducted with isolated peptides corresponding to signal sequences must be carried out and interpreted with extreme caution. We initially observed aggregation of SRP by signal peptides when making concentrated samples of Ffh·4.5S RNA plus LamB signal peptide analogues for structural studies by NMR. In an attempt to find conditions to circumvent this aggregation, we discovered that signal peptide-induced aggregation of SRP occurs even at much lower concentrations, such as those used to show that signal peptides inhibit the SRP GTPase activity (18Miller J.D. Wilhelm H. Gierasch L. Gilmore R. Walter P. Nature. 1993; 366: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that peptides with the features of signal sequences (e.g. a positively charged region followed by a region of substantial hydrophobicity) nonspecifically bind and aggregate RNA molecules at micromolar concentrations. In the case of 4.5S RNA complexed with Ffh, signal peptide-induced RNA aggregation results in the aggregation of the entire SRP particle, which is the likely cause for its loss of GTPase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Proteins, Peptides, and RNAFfh and 4.5S RNA were prepared as described previously (22Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 5S rRNA and lysine-specific tRNA were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma, respectively. 7SL RNA from canine pancreas was a generous gift from Harris Bernstein (National Institutes of Health). KRR-LamB, DM, R1, OmpA, and K5W(AL)10 peptides were synthesized and purified according to previously published methods (23Jones J.D. Gierasch L.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1534-1545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purity and correct mass of each peptide were verified by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and the concentration of each was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis.GTPase Activity AssaysGTPase assays were conducted as described previously (19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), with the exception that the concentrations of Ffh protein and 4.5S RNA were 25 and 50 nm, respectively. Reactions in buffer A (50 mmtriethanolamine/acetic acid, pH 7.5, 25 mm potassium acetate (K acetate), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)) were allowed to continue for 20 min before quenching. However, because of the low basal GTPase rate of Ffh at higher salt concentrations, GTPase activity assays in buffer A supplemented with K acetate (175 mm final concentration) were run for a full hour to generate adequate signal.Aggregation TestsTo test for aggregation of Ffh under the conditions of the GTPase activity assay, 0.5-ml samples of Ffh ± 4.5S RNA were prepared with the indicated concentrations of signal peptides exactly as indicated for the GTPase inhibition assay. After the addition of “cold” GTP and 30 min of incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged for 15 min in a microcentrifuge. Supernatants were carefully removed from the resultant pellets and precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid, incubated for 20 min on ice, and centrifuged for 15 min as before. Pellets and trichloroacetic acid precipitates were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer, run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. To test for aggregation of RNAs, each RNA (200 nm, except where indicated otherwise) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of signal peptides in GTPase assay buffer A at room temperature for 30 min. UV absorption spectra (230–300 nm) of these solutions were recorded, samples were microcentrifuged for 15 min, and the UV absorbance of the supernatants was remeasured for comparison.RESULTSA LamB Signal Peptide Analogue That Inhibits the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase Activity Also Aggregates the Complex in the Same Concentration RangeMiller et al. (19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) demonstrates that a peptide corresponding to the wild-type LamB signal sequence (TableI) causes dose-dependent inhibition of the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity. A LamB signal peptide analogue containing an insertion of three basic residues in the n-region termed KRR-LamB (Table I) behaves similarly (22Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This insertion increases the aqueous solubility of the LamB signal peptide (24Wang Z.L. Jones J.D. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but is not expected to affect its in vivo function because the insertion of two basic residues in the n-region of the LamB signal sequence does not affect its ability to target nascent LamB protein (25Carlson J.H. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). KRR-LamB inhibited the GTPase activity of the Ffh·4.5S RNA complex with an IC50 of 9.4 μm and with significant positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 5, Fig.1 a). Identical samples were then tested for signal peptide-induced Ffh·4.5S RNA aggregation by brief centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ffh partitioned into the pellet fraction upon the addition of KRR-LamB with roughly half of the Ffh located in the pellet at a KRR-LamB concentration of 3–6 μm (Fig. 1 b). This aggregation had previously escaped detection, presumably because it was not accompanied by any obvious change in sample turbidity, indicating that the aggregates were fairly small. These results clearly indicate that KRR-LamB aggregates Ffh·4.5S RNA in the same concentration range in which inhibition of the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity occurs.Table ISynthetic signal peptide analogues used in this studyPeptideSequenceLamB wild typeMMITLR—KLPLAVAVAAGVMSAQAMAKRR-LamBMMITLRKRRKLPLAVAVAAGVMSAQAMADMMMITLR—KLP—-VAAGVMSAQAMAR1MMITLR—KLP—-VAACVMSAQAMAOmpAMKKTAIAIAVALAGFATVAQA/APKDK5W(AL)10KKKKKWALALALALALALALALALAL Open table in a new tab Aggregation of Ffh·4.5S RNA by KRR-LamB Is Mediated by a Direct Interaction with 4.5S RNASurprisingly, in similar aggregation tests conducted on Ffh alone in the absence of 4.5S RNA, Ffh did not pellet even at the highest concentration of KRR-LamB tested (120 μm, Fig. 1 c), demonstrating that the RNA component must be present for aggregation to occur. To determine whether this is a direct effect of KRR-LamB on 4.5S RNA, we incubated 4.5S RNA alone and with increasing concentrations of KRR-LamB and then compared the UV absorbance spectra of these samples before and after brief centrifugation. Surprisingly, the addition of KRR-LamB to 4.5S RNA resulted in a dose-dependent loss of RNA from solution after centrifugation (Fig. 2,a and b). Half-maximal aggregation of 4.5S RNA by KRR-LamB occurred at a peptide concentration of 6 μm, which was directly comparable to the concentration of KRR-LamB that caused 50% aggregation and inhibition of the GTPase activity of the Ffh·4.5S RNA complex. Interestingly, when KRR-LamB was added to 4.5S RNA, the RNA absorbance increased in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 6–12 μm (Fig. 2,a and c). This increase was not attributable to absorbance of KRR-LamB itself because this peptide had no aromatic residues and did not absorb in this region (Fig. 2 a,inset).Figure 2The aggregation of Ffh·4.5S RNA by KRR-LamB is mediated by a direct interaction with 4.5S RNA. a, 4.5S RNA was tested for KRR-LamB-induced aggregation by brief centrifugation after incubating 4.5S RNA with various concentrations of peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Solid curves with filled symbolsand dashed curves with open symbols indicate absorbance spectra recorded before and after centrifugation, respectively. Circles, no KRR-LamB added; inverted triangles, 1.2 μm KRR-LamB; diamonds, 6 μm KRR-LamB; triangles, 12 μmKRR-LamB; squares, 30 μm KRR-LamB. Theinset at bottom is the absorption spectrum of 6 μm KRR-LamB alone. These data are represented in graphic form in panel b in which the loss of RNA from solution with increasing KRR-LamB concentration is indicated by the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm after centrifugation to the absorbance before centrifugation. Panel c graphically represents the increase in RNA absorbance that occurs with KRR-LamB addition. The percent increase in 260 nm absorbance at each peptide concentration was calculated relative to the absorbance of 4.5S RNA alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)KRR-LamB Aggregates RNA NonspecificallyTo determine whether KRR-LamB aggregates 4.5S RNA via a specific binding interaction, several different RNA species were tested for aggregation by this peptide including 7SL RNA from dog pancreas (the mammalian SRP RNA), 5S rRNA from E. coli, and lysine-specific tRNA from E. coli (Fig. 3). Each RNA alone did not pellet when centrifuged (black bars); however, incubation of each RNA with 6 μm KRR-LamB resulted in significant aggregation (dark gray bars). All of the heterologous RNAs were even more sensitive to aggregation by KRR-LamB than was 4.5S RNA. In each case, the aggregation was accompanied by a significant increase in the 260 nm absorbance of each RNA (data not shown) as was observed with 4.5S RNA. These results show that KRR-LamB aggregates RNA nonspecifically.Figure 3The interaction between signal peptides and RNA is nonspecific. 7SL RNA, 5S rRNA, tRNA, and 4.5S RNA were incubated at 200 nm either alone (black bars) or with 6 μm KRR-LamB peptide (dark gray bars). 4.5S RNA at 300 nm was incubated with 5 μm OmpA signal peptide (light gray bar) and 2 μm K5W(AL)10 (white bar). The fraction of RNA remaining in solution was calculated from the ratio of the 260 nm absorbance after centrifugation to the absorbance before centrifugation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Other Signal Peptides Also Aggregate RNAA peptide corresponding to the signal sequence of the E. coli outer membrane porin, OmpA, as well as an idealized peptide with a longer hydrophobic core (K5W(AL)10, see Table I) were tested for aggregation of 4.5S RNA. As seen in Fig. 3, incubation with 5 μm OmpA signal peptide pellets 90% of the total 4.5S RNA, and the addition of 2 μmK5W(AL)10 pellets 71% of the total 4.5S RNA. These results indicate that this phenomenon is not limited to LamB and may be characteristic of signal peptides in general.The Hydrophobic Core Plays an Important Role in Aggregation of the Ffh·4.5S RNA Complex by PeptidesTo understand what characteristics of signal peptides are important for aggregation of the Ffh·4.5S RNA complex, we tested peptides corresponding to functional and nonfunctional analogues of the LamB signal sequence. The DM deletion mutant peptide is missing four residues from the hydrophobic core (Table I), leading to a defect in translocation of LamB nascent chains in vivo (26Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); the lower helical propensity of this peptide compared with wild type has been proposed to be responsible for its in vivo defect (27McKnight C.J. Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17293-17297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When added to GTPase reactions, DM does not inhibit the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity even at the highest concentration tested (30 μm, Fig.4 a) as shown earlier (19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DM also did not aggregate the Ffh·4.5S RNA complex. Even in the presence of 30 μm DM peptide, no Ffh was pelleted by centrifugation (Fig. 4 b). Similar results were obtained with a LamB variant containing an aspartate substitution within the hydrophobic core (data not shown), confirming that the signal peptide hydrophobic core plays an important role in the aggregation of RNA.Figure 4Nonfunctional signal peptides do not aggregate Ffh·4.5S RNA or inhibit its GTPase activity. a, the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity was measured with the indicated concentrations of DM (■) and R1 (●) peptides and compared with control reactions without added peptides. The curveindicates the best nonlinear fit to the R1 data with IC50 = 0.94 ± 0.05 μm and nH = 1.5 ± 0.1. The Ffh·4.5S RNA complex was tested for aggregation by DM (b) or R1 (c) by brief centrifugation. Thefirst two lanes of each gel show the Ffh band from the trichloroacetic acid precipitates (lane 1) and pellets (lane 2) from a sample of Ffh·4.5S RNA in the absence of added peptide. In b, lanes 3–10 show the Ffh band from pellets after incubation with 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1.5, 3.1, 6.1, 15, and 31 μm DM peptide. Lanes 3–9 ofpanel c show the Ffh band from pellets after incubation with 0.04, 0.08, 0.21, 0.42, 0.84, 2.1 and 4.2 μm R1 peptide. Molecular mass markers are indicated to the left of each gel in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The R1 pseudorevertant peptide lacks four hydrophobic core residues like DM (Table I) but has higher helical propensity than does DM due to the replacement of a helix-breaking glycine residue with cysteine (27McKnight C.J. Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17293-17297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R1 signal sequence effectively targets LamB nascent proteinin vivo (26Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Paralleling what has been shown earlier (19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), R1 inhibited the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity with an IC50 of 0.94 μm (Fig. 4 a). It is interesting to note that R1 inhibited the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity with significantly less cooperativity than did KRR-LamB with a Hill coefficient of only 1.5 compared with 5 for KRR-LamB (Fig.1 a). Strikingly, in the same concentration range where R1 inhibited the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity, R1 also aggregated Ffh·4.5S RNA (50% aggregation at ∼0.84 μm, Fig.4 c). These experiments indicate that both hydrophobicity and helical propensity are important characteristics of peptides that aggregate RNA.Electrostatics Also Make an Important Contribution to the Aggregation of Ffh·4.5S RNA by Signal PeptidesTo investigate the effect of ionic strength on the peptide/RNA interaction, we increased the potassium acetate concentration in GTPase assay buffer A (19Miller J.D.

Under these more physiological conditions, the ability of KRR-LamB to aggregate either the Ffh·4.5S RNA complex or 4.5S RNA alone was reduced approximately 5-fold; 12–30 μm KRR-LamB aggregated 50% of the total Ffh·4.5S RNA (Fig. 5 a) compared with only 3–6 μm KRR-LamB that was required to have the same effect in low salt (Fig. 1 b). Likewise, 30 μmKRR-LamB aggregated 50% of the total 4.5S RNA alone under these conditions compared with 6 μm KRR-LamB in low salt buffer (Fig. 5 b, compare with Fig. 2 b). It is noteworthy that the half-maximal increase in RNA absorption was also shifted to higher KRR-LamB concentrations in 175 mm K acetate (30–60 μm as shown in Fig. 5 c, compared with 6–12 μm in buffer A as shown in Fig. 2 c).Figure 5Increasing the salt concentration to a physiological level reduces the ability of KRR-LamB to aggregate 4.5S RNA and inhibit the Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity by similar degrees. a, aggregation of the Ffh·4.5S RNA complex by KRR-LamB was tested as in Fig. 1 b, except that the concentration of K acetate in the buffer was increased from 25 to 175 mm. Lanes 1 and 2 show the Ffh band from the trichloroacetic acid precipitate and pellet, respectively, from a sample of Ffh·4.5S RNA without added peptide. The Ffh band from pellets after incubation of Ffh·4.5S RNA with 1.2, 3, 6, 12, 30, 60, and 120 μm KRR-LamB are shown in lanes 3–9. Molecular mass markers are indicated to the leftof the gel in kDa. b and c, aggregation of 4.5S RNA by KRR-LamB was tested as in Fig. 2 a with the exception of [K acetate] = 175 mm. Panel billustrates the loss of RNA from the solution at higher KRR-LamB concentration as calculated in Fig. 2b, and panel c shows the enhancement of RNA absorbance at high KRR-LamB concentration, as calculated in Fig. 2c. Inhibition of the GTPase activity of Ffh·4.5S RNA by KRR-LamB at 25 mm K acetate (gray bars) and 175 mm K acetate (black bars) is shown in the bar graph in panel d.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the signal sequence/Ffh interaction is thought to be primarily hydrophobic in nature, we initially hypothesized that increasing the ionic strength of the buffer would strengthen peptide binding to its specific site on Ffh, possibly resulting in a lower IC50for GTPase inhibition. Contrary to this idea, however, the amount of KRR-LamB required to inhibit 50% of the total Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity was increased to 60–120 μm in 175 mm K acetate (Fig. 5 d) compared with 9.4 μm at low salt (Fig. 1 a). When the buffer ionic strength was increased, the ability of KRR-LamB to both aggregate 4.5S RNA and inhibit the GTPase activity of Ffh·4.5S RNA was reduced by similar degrees, suggesting that the aggregation and GTPase inhibition are related events. Intriguingly, however, at low KRR-LamB concentrations in which significant aggregation did not occur (<30 μm), there appeared to be a subtle increase in Ffh·4.5S RNA GTPase activity (32% increase over control at 6 μmKRR-LamB, Fig. 5 d). It is tempting to speculate that the increase in ionic strength has reduced the aggregation to an extent where the true effect of signal peptide binding to its site on Ffh is uncovered.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that signal peptides do not inhibit theE. coli SRP GTPase activity directly, as originally proposed (19Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but instead cause aggregation of the entire SRP particle via a nonspecific interaction with the RNA component. We propose that the SRP GTPase activity is lost secondarily because of aggregation. The “nonfunctional” signal peptides used as negative controls in these earlier"
