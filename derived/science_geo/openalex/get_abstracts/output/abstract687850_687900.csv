https://openalex.org/W4206737621,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues worldwide with many variants arising, some of which are variants of concern (VOCs). A recent VOC, omicron (B.1.1.529), which obtains a large number of mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, has risen to intense scientific and public attention. Here, we studied the binding properties between the human receptor ACE2 (hACE2) and the VOC RBDs and resolved the crystal and cryoelectron microscopy structures of the omicron RBD-hACE2 complex as well as the crystal structure of the delta RBD-hACE2 complex. We found that, unlike alpha, beta, and gamma, omicron RBD binds to hACE2 at a similar affinity to that of the prototype RBD, which might be due to compensation of multiple mutations for both immune escape and transmissibility. The complex structures of omicron RBD-hACE2 and delta RBD-hACE2 reveal the structural basis of how RBD-specific mutations bind to hACE2."
https://openalex.org/W4210654369,"Infection-neutralizing antibody responses after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination are an essential component of antiviral immunity. Antibody-mediated protection is challenged by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) with immune escape properties, such as omicron (B.1.1.529), which is rapidly spreading worldwide. Here we report neutralizing antibody dynamics in a longitudinal cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 convalescent and infection-naive individuals vaccinated with mRNA BNT162b2 by quantifying SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies and determining their avidity and neutralization capacity in serum. Using live-virus neutralization assays, we show that a superior infection-neutralizing capacity against all VoCs, including omicron, developed after either two vaccinations in convalescents or a third vaccination or breakthrough infection of twice-vaccinated, naive individuals. These three consecutive spike antigen exposures resulted in an increasing neutralization capacity per anti-spike antibody unit and were paralleled by stepwise increases in antibody avidity. We conclude that an infection-plus-vaccination-induced hybrid immunity or a triple immunization can induce high-quality antibodies with superior neutralization capacity against VoCs, including omicron."
https://openalex.org/W4210261834,"Omicron (B.1.1.529), the most heavily mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant so far, is highly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, raising concerns about the effectiveness of antibody therapies and vaccines1,2. Here we examined whether sera from individuals who received two or three doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could neutralize authentic Omicron. The seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibodies were 3.3% (2 out of 60) and 95% (57 out of 60) for individuals who had received 2 and 3 doses of vaccine, respectively. For recipients of three vaccine doses, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titre for Omicron was 16.5-fold lower than for the ancestral virus (254). We isolated 323 human monoclonal antibodies derived from memory B cells in triple vaccinees, half of which recognized the receptor-binding domain, and showed that a subset (24 out of 163) potently neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Omicron. Therapeutic treatments with representative broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were highly protective against infection of mice with SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) and Omicron. Atomic structures of the Omicron spike protein in complex with three classes of antibodies that were active against all five variants of concern defined the binding and neutralizing determinants and revealed a key antibody escape site, G446S, that confers greater resistance to a class of antibodies that bind on the right shoulder of the receptor-binding domain by altering local conformation at the binding interface. Our results rationalize the use of three-dose immunization regimens and suggest that the fundamental epitopes revealed by these broadly ultrapotent antibodies are rational targets for a universal sarbecovirus vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W3123800621,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major impact to health and medical infrastructure, economy, and agriculture. Prominent computational and mathematical models have been unreliable due to the complexity of the spread of infections. Moreover, lack of data collection and reporting makes modelling attempts difficult and unreliable. Hence, we need to re-look at the situation with reliable data sources and innovative forecasting models. Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks are well suited for modelling spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, we apply recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and encoder-decoder LSTM models for multi-step (short-term) COVID-19 infection forecasting. We select Indian states with COVID-19 hotpots and capture the first (2020) and second (2021) wave of infections and provide two months ahead forecast. Our model predicts that the likelihood of another wave of infections in October and November 2021 is low; however, the authorities need to be vigilant given emerging variants of the virus. The accuracy of the predictions motivate the application of the method in other countries and regions. Nevertheless, the challenges in modelling remain due to the reliability of data and difficulties in capturing factors such as population density, logistics, and social aspects such as culture and lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W4210473150,"The impact that COVID-19 had on individuals globally has been immense. Our study aims to determine if the various COVID-19 related beliefs (information seeking; invulnerability; disruption; health importance and response effectiveness) are predictors of perceived stress and if self-efficacy acts as a mediator in reducing perceived COVID-19 related stress. From a large sample of 23,629, data were assessed using validated multi-item measures for seven COVID-19 related beliefs, self-efficacy and perceived stress. After conducting a series of tests and checks via Confirmatory Factor Analyses, linear modelling and mediation analyses with bootstrapping were applied to test direct and mediation hypotheses. It is found that stress perception is most strongly affected by self-efficacy and perceived disruption. Except for information seeking, which positively affected perceived stress, self-efficacy partially mediates all other COVID-19 related beliefs (perceptions of disruption, health importance and response effectiveness) in conjunction with their direct effects. Only perceived invulnerability elicited opposite effects on stress, increasing stress directly but decreasing stress indirectly by increasing self-efficacy. This finding gives reason to believe that individuals may disclose that they are less vulnerable to COVID-19, fostering their self-efficacy, but still accept that stressing factors such as economic and social consequences apply. Overall, reinforcing self-efficacy was carved out as the most important resilience factor against perceiving high levels of stress. On this basis, implications for research and practice are provided."
https://openalex.org/W4210632297,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a targeted attack on oligodendroglia (OLG) and myelin by immune cells, which are thought to be the main drivers of MS susceptibility. We found that immune genes exhibit a primed chromatin state in single mouse and human OLG in a non-disease context, compatible with transitions to immune-competent states in MS. We identified BACH1 and STAT1 as transcription factors involved in immune gene regulation in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). A subset of immune genes presents bivalency of H3K4me3/H3K27me3 in OPCs, with Polycomb inhibition leading to their increased activation upon interferon gamma (IFN-γ) treatment. Some MS susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) overlap with these regulatory regions in mouse and human OLG. Treatment of mouse OPCs with IFN-γ leads to chromatin architecture remodeling at these loci and altered expression of interacting genes. Thus, the susceptibility for MS may involve OLG, which therefore constitutes novel targets for immunological-based therapies for MS."
https://openalex.org/W4206994500,"Muscle myosin heads, in the absence of actin, have been shown to exist in two states, the relaxed (turnover ∼0.05 s-1) and super-relaxed states (SRX, 0.005 s-1) using a simple fluorescent ATP chase assay (Hooijman, P. et al (2011) Biophys. J.100, 1969-1976). Studies have normally used purified proteins, myosin filaments, or muscle fibers. Here we use muscle myofibrils, which retain most of the ancillary proteins and 3-D architecture of muscle and can be used with rapid mixing methods. Recording timescales from 0.1 to 1000 s provides a precise measure of the two populations of myosin heads present in relaxed myofibrils. We demonstrate that the population of SRX states is formed from rigor cross bridges within 0.2 s of relaxing with fluorescently labeled ATP, and the population of SRX states is relatively constant over the temperature range of 5 °C-30 °C. The SRX population is enhanced in the presence of mavacamten and reduced in the presence of deoxy-ATP. Compared with myofibrils from fast-twitch muscle, slow-twitch muscle, and cardiac muscles, myofibrils require a tenfold lower concentration of mavacamten to be effective, and mavacamten induced a larger increase in the population of the SRX state. Mavacamten is less effective, however, at stabilizing the SRX state at physiological temperatures than at 5 °C. These assays require small quantities of myofibrils, making them suitable for studies of model organism muscles, human biopsies, or human-derived iPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W4210617210,"Chronic pain is a significant societal problem and pain complaints are one of the main causes of work absenteeism and emergency room visits. Physical activity has been associated with reduced risk of suffering from musculoskeletal pain complaints, but the exact relationship in an older adult sample is not known.Participants self-reported their physical activity level and whether they were often troubled by bone, joint, or muscle pain. Logistic regression analyses revealed the nature of the relationship between musculoskeletal pain and physical activity cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the course of 10 years. Data were taken from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, comprising of 5802 individuals residing in England aged 50 or older.Only high levels of physical activity were associated with a reduced risk of suffering from musculoskeletal pain compared to a sedentary lifestyle longitudinally. In addition, having low wealth, being female, and being overweight or obese were found to be risk factors for suffering from musculoskeletal pain.The development of interventions aimed at alleviating and preventing musculoskeletal pain complaints might benefit from incorporating physical activity programs, weight loss, and aspects addressing wealth inequality to maximise their efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4210467898,"Identifying new pathways that regulate mammalian regeneration is challenging due to the paucity of in vivo screening approaches. We employed pooled CRISPR knockout and activation screening in the regenerating liver to evaluate 165 chromatin regulatory proteins. Both screens identified the imitation-SWI chromatin remodeling components Baz2a and Baz2b, not previously implicated in regeneration. In vivo sgRNA, siRNA, and knockout strategies against either paralog confirmed increased regeneration. Distinct BAZ2-specific bromodomain inhibitors, GSK2801 and BAZ2-ICR, resulted in accelerated liver healing after diverse injuries. Inhibitor-treated mice also exhibited improved healing in an inflammatory bowel disease model, suggesting multi-tissue applicability. Transcriptomics on regenerating livers showed increases in ribosomal and cell cycle mRNAs. Surprisingly, CRISPRa screening to define mechanisms showed that overproducing Rpl10a or Rpl24 was sufficient to drive regeneration, whereas Rpl24 haploinsufficiency was rate limiting for BAZ2 inhibition-mediated regeneration. The discovery of regenerative roles for imitation-SWI components provides immediate strategies to enhance tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W4210558915,"Background In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals have been found to endorse conspiracy beliefs. Socio-demographic variables, personality functioning, anxiety, and loneliness could be risk factors for this endorsement. Methods In a representative sample of the German population ( N = 2,503) measures of conspiracy mentality, conspiracy-related beliefs toward COVID-19, personality functioning (OPD-SQS), anxiety (HADS), and loneliness (UCLA) were assessed. Pearson product-moment correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Results Conspiracy mentality and conspiracy-related beliefs toward COVID-19 were strongly correlated. Regression analyses found younger age, male gender, lower education, and lower income to be associated with conspiracy mentality. The subscales relationship model and self-perception of the OPD-SQS were positively related to conspiracy mentality whereas interpersonal contact was negatively associated. Higher levels of anxiety were statistically predictive for conspiracy mentality. Conclusion Our findings indicate a contribution of personality functioning to the understanding of conspiracy mentality and thus to the advancement of interventions during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4210487514,"M-wallets are comparatively more advantageous and convenient than conventional payment systems as m-wallets allow users to avoid cash. The present research uses the diffusion of innovation theory as the base theory to propose a research model by incorporating constructs like convenience, perceived security, personal innovativeness, and perceived trust to investigate the determinants of consumers' intention-to-use m-wallets. A twofold approach comprising of Structural Equation Modelling-Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) was used: First, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to determine the significant determinants of intention-to-use. Second, the ANN approach was applied as robustness to corroborate the outcomes of PLS-SEM and to estimate the relative importance of the SEM-based significant determinants. Our findings confirmed that compatibility, ease of use, observability, convenience, relative advantage, personal innovativeness, perceived trust, and perceived security are the key elements that influence the intention-to-use m-wallets. Moreover, we ascertained that perceived security is the most influential predictor of intention-to-use. The outcomes of ANN have complemented the findings of PLS-SEM, but some differences were also exhibited in the order of influential factors. The study brings to fore significant insights and a set of suggestions for the companies carrying out the development, execution, and marketing of M-wallet services."
https://openalex.org/W4220920086,"Oncogene-induced replication stress characterizes many aggressive cancers. Several treatments are being developed that target replication stress, however, identification of tumors with high levels of replication stress remains challenging. We describe a gene expression signature of oncogene-induced replication stress. A panel of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-transformed cell lines were engineered to overexpress CDC25A, CCNE1 or MYC, which resulted in slower replication kinetics. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a set of 52 commonly upregulated genes. In parallel, mRNA expression analysis of patient-derived tumor samples (TCGA, n = 10,592) also revealed differential gene expression in tumors with amplification of oncogenes that trigger replication stress (CDC25A, CCNE1, MYC, CCND1, MYB, MOS, KRAS, ERBB2, and E2F1). Upon integration, we identified a six-gene signature of oncogene-induced replication stress (NAT10, DDX27, ZNF48, C8ORF33, MOCS3, and MPP6). Immunohistochemical analysis of NAT10 in breast cancer samples (n = 330) showed strong correlation with expression of phospho-RPA (R = 0.451, p = 1.82 × 10−20) and γH2AX (R = 0.304, p = 2.95 × 10−9). Finally, we applied our oncogene-induced replication stress signature to patient samples from TCGA (n = 8,862) and GEO (n = 13,912) to define the levels of replication stress across 27 tumor subtypes, identifying diffuse large B cell lymphoma, ovarian cancer, TNBC and colorectal carcinoma as cancer subtypes with high levels of oncogene-induced replication stress."

https://openalex.org/W4210744318,"Copper(I) is an essential metal for all life forms. Though Cu(II) is the most abundant and stable state, its reduction to Cu(I) via an unclear mechanism is prerequisite for its bioutilization. In eukaryotes, the copper transporter-1 (CTR1) is the primary high-affinity copper importer, although its mechanism and role in Cu(II) reduction remain uncharacterized. Here we show that extracellular amino-terminus of human CTR1 contains two methionine-histidine clusters and neighboring aspartates that distinctly bind Cu(I) and Cu(II) preceding its import. We determined that hCTR1 localizes at the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK-II cells and that its endocytosis to Common-Recycling-Endosomes is regulated by reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and subsequent Cu(I) coordination by the methionine cluster. We demonstrate the transient binding of both Cu(II) and Cu(I) during the reduction process is facilitated by aspartates that also act as another crucial determinant of hCTR1 endocytosis. Mutating the first Methionine cluster (7Met-Gly-Met9) and Asp13 abrogated copper uptake and endocytosis upon copper treatment. This phenotype could be reverted by treating the cells with reduced and nonreoxidizable Cu(I). We show that histidine clusters, on other hand, bind Cu(II) and are crucial for hCTR1 functioning at limiting copper. Finally, we show that two N-terminal His-Met-Asp clusters exhibit functional complementarity, as the second cluster is sufficient to preserve copper-induced CTR1 endocytosis upon complete deletion of the first cluster. We propose a novel and detailed mechanism by which the two His-Met-Asp residues of hCTR1 amino-terminus not only bind copper, but also maintain its reduced state, crucial for intracellular uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4206969801,"Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type-1 gamma (Pip5k1c) is a lipid kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of receptor-mediated calcium signaling in multiple tissues; however, its role in the skeleton is not clear. Here, we show that while deleting Pip5k1c expression in the mesenchymal stem cells using Prx1-Cre transgenic mice does not impair the intramembranous and endochondral ossification during skeletal development, it does cause osteopenia in adult mice, but not rapidly growing young mice. We found Pip5k1c loss dramatically decreases osteoblast formation and osteoid and mineral deposition, leading to reduced bone formation. Furthermore, Pip5k1c loss inhibits osteoblastic, but promotes adipogenic, differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells. Pip5k1c deficiency also impairs cytoplasmic calcium influx and inactivates the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, which regulates levels of transcription factor Runx2 by modulating its stability and subsequent osteoblast and bone formation. In addition, Pip5k1c loss reduces levels of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, but not that of osteoprotegerin, its decoy receptor, in osteoblasts in bone and in sera. Finally, we found Pip5k1c loss impairs the ability of bone marrow stromal cells to support osteoclast formation of bone marrow monocytes and reduces the osteoclast precursor population in bone marrow, resulting in reduced osteoclast formation and bone resorption. We conclude Pip5k1c deficiency causes a low-turnover osteopenia in mice, with impairment of bone formation being greater than that of bone resorption. Collectively, we uncover a novel function and mechanism of Pip5k1c in the control of bone mass and identify a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W4210266414,"It is well documented that drug responses are related to Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) characteristics of individual patients. Several studies have identified genetic variability in pharmacogenes, that are either directly responsible for or are associated with ADME, giving rise to individualized treatments. Our objective was to provide a comprehensive overview of pharmacogenetic variation in the Saudi population. We mined next generation sequencing (NGS) data from 11,889 unrelated Saudi nationals, to determine the presence and frequencies of known functional SNP variants in 8 clinically relevant pharmacogenes ( CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A5 , CYP4F2 , VKORC1 , DPYD , TPMT and NUDT15 ), recommended by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), and collectively identified 82 such star alleles. Functionally significant pharmacogenetic variants were prevalent especially in CYP genes (excluding CYP3A5 ), with 10–44.4% of variants predicted to be inactive or to have decreased activity. In CYP3A5 , inactive alleles (87.5%) were the most common. Only 1.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% of NUDT15 , TPMT and DPYD variants respectively, were predicted to affect gene activity. In contrast, VKORC1 was found functionally, to be highly polymorphic with 53.7% of Saudi individuals harboring variants predicted to result in decreased activity and 31.3% having variants leading to increased metabolic activity. Furthermore, among the 8 pharmacogenes studied, we detected six rare variants with an aggregated frequency of 1.1%, that among several other ethnicities, were uniquely found in Saudi population. Similarly, within our cohort, the 8 pharmacogenes yielded forty-six novel variants predicted to be deleterious. Based upon our findings, 99.2% of individuals from the Saudi population carry at least one actionable pharmacogenetic variant."
https://openalex.org/W4210719271,"Non-aversive handling is a well-documented refinement measure for improving rodent welfare. Because maternal stress is related to reduced productivity, we hypothesized that welfare benefits associated with non-aversive handling would translate to higher production and fewer litters lost in a laboratory mouse breeding colony. We performed a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a standard method of handling (tail-lift with forceps) versus non-aversive handling with transfer tunnels (‘tunnel-handled’) on breeding performance in 59 C57BL/6J mouse pairs. Intervention assignments could not be concealed from technicians, but were concealed from assessors and data analyst. An operationally significant effect of tunnel-handling (large enough differences to warrant programmatic change) was defined before study initiation as a 5% increase in productivity, or one extra pup over the reproductive lifetime of each pair. Pairs were randomly allocated to handling intervention and cage rack location, and monitored over an entire 6-month breeding cycle. For each group, we measured number of pups born and weaned, and number of entire litters lost prior to weaning. Differences between transfer methods were estimated by two-level hierarchical mixed models adjusted for parental effects and parity. Compared to tail-lift mice, tunnel-handled mice averaged one extra pup per pair born (+1.0; 95% CI 0.9, 1.1; P = 0.41) and weaned (+1.1, 95% CI 0.9, 1.2; P = 0.33). More tunnel-handled pairs successfully weaned all litters produced (13/29 pairs, 45% vs 4/30 pairs, 13%; P = 0.015), averaged fewer litter losses prior to weaning (11/29 pairs [38%] vs 26/30 pairs [87%]; P &lt;0.001), and had a 20% lower risk of recurrent litter loss. The increase in numbers of pups produced and weaned with tunnel handling met threshold requirement for operational significance. These data and projected cost savings persuaded management to incorporate tunnel handling as standard of care across the institution. These data also suggest that overlooked husbandry practices such as cage transfer may be major confounders in studies of mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W4210526440,"We investigated the role of the NFE2L3 transcription factor in inflammation-induced colorectal cancer. Our studies revealed that Nfe2l3-/- mice exhibit significantly less inflammation in the colon, reduced tumor size and numbers, and skewed localization of tumors with a more pronounced decrease of tumors in the distal colon. CIBERSORT analysis of RNA-seq data from normal and tumor tissue predicted a reduction in mast cells in Nfe2l3-/- animals, which was confirmed by toluidine blue staining. Concomitantly, the transcript levels of Il33 and Rab27a, both important regulators of mast cells, were reduced and increased, respectively, in the colorectal tumors of Nfe2l3-/- mice. Furthermore, we validated NFE2L3 binding to the regulatory sequences of the IL33 and RAB27A loci in human colorectal carcinoma cells. Using digital spatial profiling, we found that Nfe2l3-/- mice presented elevated FOXP3 and immune checkpoint markers CTLA4, TIM3, and LAG3, suggesting an increase in Treg counts. Staining for CD3 and FOXP3 confirmed a significant increase in immunosuppressive Tregs in the colon of Nfe2l3-/- animals. Also, Human Microbiome Project (HMP2) data showed that NFE2L3 transcript levels are higher in the rectum of ulcerative colitis patients. The observed changes in the tumor microenvironment provide new insights into the molecular differences regarding colon cancer sidedness. This may be exploited for the treatment of early-onset colorectal cancer as this emerging subtype primarily displays distal/left-sided tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4210776049,"Abstract The prognosis for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with Mixed-Lineage Leukemia ( MLL ) gene rearrangements (MLLr BCP-ALL) is still extremely poor. Inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 with venetoclax emerged as a promising strategy for this subtype of BCP-ALL, however, lack of sufficient responses in preclinical models and the possibility of developing resistance exclude using venetoclax as monotherapy. Herein, we aimed to uncover potential mechanisms responsible for limited venetoclax activity in MLLr BCP-ALL and to identify drugs that could be used in combination therapy. Using RNA-seq, we observed that long-term exposure to venetoclax in vivo in a patient-derived xenograft model leads to downregulation of several tumor protein 53 ( TP53 )-related genes. Interestingly, auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, sensitized MLLr BCP-ALL to venetoclax in various in vitro and in vivo models, independently of the p53 pathway functionality. Synergistic activity of these drugs resulted from auranofin-mediated upregulation of NOXA pro-apoptotic protein and potent induction of apoptotic cell death. More specifically, we observed that auranofin orchestrates upregulation of the NOXA-encoding gene Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate-Induced Protein 1 ( PMAIP1 ) associated with chromatin remodeling and increased transcriptional accessibility. Altogether, these results present an efficacious drug combination that could be considered for the treatment of MLLr BCP-ALL patients, including those with TP53 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4210553333,"Oxytocin is a potent uterotonic agent administered to nearly all patients during childbirth in the United States. Inadequate oxytocin response can necessitate Cesarean delivery or lead to uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage. Thus, it may be clinically useful to identify patients at risk for poor oxytocin response and develop strategies to sensitize the uterus to oxytocin. Previously, we showed that the V281M variant in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene impairs OXTR trafficking to the cell surface, leading to a decreased oxytocin response in cells. Here, we sought to identify pharmacological chaperones that increased oxytocin response in cells expressing WT or V281M OXTR. We screened nine small-molecule agonists and antagonists of the oxytocin/vasopressin receptor family and identified two, SR49059 and L371,257, that restored both OXTR trafficking and oxytocin response in HEK293T cells transfected with V281M OXTR. In hTERT-immortalized human myometrial cells, which endogenously express WT OXTR, treatment with SR49059 and L371,257 increased the amount of OXTR on the cell surface by two- to fourfold. Furthermore, SR49059 and L371,257 increased the endogenous oxytocin response in hTERT-immortalized human myometrial cells by 35% and induced robust oxytocin responses in primary myometrial cells obtained from patients at the time of Cesarean section. If future studies demonstrate that these pharmacological chaperones or related compounds function similarly in vivo, we propose that they could potentially be used to enhance clinical response to oxytocin."
https://openalex.org/W4210590900,"The influence of cholesterol fraction in the membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) on their size distributions and bending moduli has been investigated. The membranes of GUVs were synthesized by a mixture of two elements: electrically neutral lipid 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and cholesterol and also a mixture of three elements: electrically charged lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (DOPG), DOPC and cholesterol. The size distributions of GUVs have been presented by a set of histograms. The classical lognormal distribution is well fitted to the histograms, from where the average size of vesicle is obtained. The increase of cholesterol content in the membranes of GUVs increases the average size of vesicles in the population. Using the framework of Helmholtz free energy of the system, the theory developed by us is extended to explain the experimental results. The theory determines the influence of cholesterol on the bending modulus of membranes from the fitting of the proper histograms. The increase of cholesterol in GUVs increases both the average size of vesicles in population and the bending modulus of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W4210616070,"Lameness is a tremendous problem in intensively managed dairy herds all over the world. It has been associated with considerable adverse effects on animal welfare and economic viability. The majority of studies have evaluated factors associated with gait disturbance by categorising cows into lame and non-lame. This procedure yet entails a loss of information and precision. In the present study, we extend the binomial response to five categories acknowledging the ordered categorical nature of locomotion assessments, which conserves a higher level of information. A cumulative link mixed modelling approach was used to identify factors associated with increasing locomotion scores. The analysis revealed that a low body condition, elevated somatic cell count, more severe hock lesions, increasing parity, absence of pasture access, and poor udder cleanliness were relevant variables associated with higher locomotion scores. Furthermore, distinct differences in the locomotion scores assigned were identified in regard to breed, observer, and season. Using locomotion scores rather than a dichotomised response variable uncovers more refined relationships between gait disturbances and associated factors. This will help to understand the intricate nature of gait disturbances in dairy cows more deeply."
https://openalex.org/W4210817299,"Implementations of construction projects in Indonesia, especially in Aceh Province, are often delayed. Time, quality, and cost are three important components of planning a construction project. The benchmark for a successful construction project is the project completion time being in accordance with the time period specified in the contract. In project implementation, there is often a risk of delays in completing construction projects that can cause losses and fines; therefore, it is necessary to know the risk factors potentially causing project delays. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors causing delays greatly affecting construction projects in Aceh Province. The data used in this study were questionnaire data distributed to 68 respondents. The data processing methods included validity tests, reliability tests, and the construction of descriptive statistics. Ultimately, 60 delay factors were obtained; of these, 30 risk indicators were included in the very influential category with a mode value of (= 5), 29 delay risk indicators were in the high influence category with a mode value of (= 4), and one indicator was included in the category of medium influence (= 3)."

https://openalex.org/W4210750310,"The present work aims to analyze the elements that affect corporate green technology innovation and investigate a method suitable for predicting and evaluating corporate performance. First, the elements of green technology innovation and their relationships are analyzed and explained. Then, the Complex Adaptive System (CAS) theory is introduced. On this basis, a computer model for the driving mechanism system of corporate green technology innovation is constructed on the Recursive Porus Agent Simulation (Repast) platform. Finally, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model is optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), constituting the PSO-BPNN algorithm to evaluate corporate performance. The results of network training and simulation demonstrate that compared with traditional BPNN, PSO-BPNN achieve a faster convergence speed and fewer errors. Besides, the actual output value has a tiny difference from the expected value, showing the application potential of this algorithm in corporate performance prediction. Moreover, the driving factors of green technology innovation greatly affect the profitability and performance of enterprises. Given insufficient corporate profit margin, continuous technological innovation activities can ensure the normal operation of enterprises. A smaller corporate tax rate can shorten the time for the system to reach equilibrium. When the corporate tax rate is above 0.2, the system takes longer to reach equilibrium. In addition, the public opinion coefficient directly affects the time needed for the system to attain equilibrium. When the public opinion coefficient is within 50,00 ~ 6,000 interval, the time that the system takes to reach equilibrium changes significantly. Furthermore, corporate internal and external driving factors have a direct effect on corporate green technology innovation and performance. The research findings indicate that the PSO-BPNN algorithm is of vital practical value to corporate performance evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4226219485,"Gene co-expression analysis is an attractive tool for leveraging enormous amounts of public RNA-seq datasets for the prediction of gene functions and regulatory mechanisms. However, the optimal data processing steps for the accurate prediction of gene co-expression from such large datasets remain unclear. Especially the importance of batch effect correction is understudied.We processed RNA-seq data of 68 human and 76 mouse cell types and tissues using 50 different workflows into 7,200 genome-wide gene co-expression networks. We then conducted a systematic analysis of the factors that result in high-quality co-expression predictions, focusing on normalization, batch effect correction, and measure of correlation. We confirmed the key importance of high sample counts for high-quality predictions. However, choosing a suitable normalization approach and applying batch effect correction can further improve the quality of co-expression estimates, equivalent to a >80% and >40% increase in samples. In larger datasets, batch effect removal was equivalent to a more than doubling of the sample size. Finally, Pearson correlation appears more suitable than Spearman correlation, except for smaller datasets.A key point for accurate prediction of gene co-expression is the collection of many samples. However, paying attention to data normalization, batch effects, and the measure of correlation can significantly improve the quality of co-expression estimates."
https://openalex.org/W4206917970,"Increasing evidence has shown that AdipoRon, a synthetic adiponectin receptor agonist, is involved in the regulation of whole-body insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis. However, the mechanisms underlying these alterations remain unclear. Here, using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and isotopic tracing techniques, we show that short-term (10 days) AdipoRon administration indirectly inhibits lipolysis in white adipose tissue via increasing circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 in mice fed a high-fat diet. This led to reduced plasma-free fatty acid concentrations and improved lipid-induced whole-body insulin resistance. In contrast, we found that long-term (20 days) AdipoRon administration directly exacerbated white adipose tissue lipolysis, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and impaired the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the skeletal muscle, resulting in aggravated whole-body insulin resistance. Together, these data provide new insights into the comprehensive understanding of multifaceted functional complexity of AdipoRon."
https://openalex.org/W4210443724,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common presentation in patients admitted with acute abdomen. Whether Ringers lactate (RL) or Normal Saline (NS) as a resuscitation fluid is better still remains unclear. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of RL and NS in terms of control of systemic inflammation by measuring indirect markers specifically Systemic Inflammation Response Syndrome (SIRS) scores and C- Reactive Protein (CRP) level.This was an open label randomized trial conducted in a tertiary level hospital of Nepal. Ethical approval was obtained prior to the study. Patients with acute pancreatitis were randomized to either RL or NS group for the fluid resuscitation. The fluid was given as per the study protocol for three days for hydration. Baseline SIRS and CRP were recorded on admission and subsequently as defined. All the data were analyzed using SPSS ver 20.0 software.Total 51 patients were enrolled, 26 in RL and 25 in NS group. The commonest etiology of AP was alcohol (84.31%). SIRS was present in 46.2% and 64.0% of patients in RL and NS group respectively (p = 0.20) on admission. At least one SIRS criteria was still present in 44.0% of patients in the NS group compared to only 15.4% in the RL group after 24 hours (p = 0.025). The baseline CRP were comparable in both the groups. However after 72 hours, the increment of CRP was more in the NS group compared to the RL group; median value of 14.2 mg/dl (12.15, 16.45) and 22.2 mg/dl (18.20, 30.60) in RL and NS group respectively (p<0.001).Ringers lactate was associated with a reduction in systemic inflammation compared to normal saline in patients with acute pancreatitis. Incidence of SIRS at 72 hours and occurrence of local complications were however similar in both the groups."
https://openalex.org/W4210774486,"Background and aims Multi drug or rifampicin resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) is a major burden to TB prevention and eradication globally. Since 2016, WHO guidelines have included options for treating MDR/RR-TB with a standard regimen of 9 to 11 months duration (the ’shorter regimen’) rather than an individual regimen of at least 20 months. This regimen has been introduced in Indonesia since September 2017. Therefore, we aimed to determine the success rate and factors associated with the treatment outcome of shorter injectable based regimen in West Java province, Indonesia. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of MDR/RR-TB patients aged over 18 years old who received the shorter injectable based regimen between September 2017 and December 2020. We defined successful outcomes as the combined proportion of patients who were cured or had complete treatment. While, unsuccessful outcomes were defined as the combined proportion of patients who died from any causes, failure, and loss to follow-up (LTFU). Results A total of 315 patients were included in this study. The success rate was 64.5%. Multivariate analysis showed male gender (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.34) increased the chance of successful outcome, while malnutrition (aRR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), history of previous TB treatment (aRR = 0.80%CI 0.68 to 0.94), and time of culture conversion &gt;2 months (aRR = 0.72 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.87) decreased the chance of successful outcome. Conclusion History of previous TB treatment, time of culture conversion &gt;2 months, and malnutrition were independent factors that decrease the chance for success rate, while male gender increase the likelihood for success rate of patients treated by the shorter injectable based regimen."
https://openalex.org/W4206919641,"Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in cell–cell communication. Herein, we isolated EVs from human plasma and demonstrated that these EVs activate cell signaling and promote neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. Analysis of human plasma EVs purified by sequential ultracentrifugation using tandem mass spectrometry indicated the presence of multiple plasma proteins, including α2-macroglobulin, which is reported to regulate PC-12 cell physiology. We therefore further purified EVs by molecular exclusion or phosphatidylserine affinity chromatography, which reduced plasma protein contamination. EVs subjected to these additional purification methods exhibited unchanged activity in PC-12 cells, even though α2-macroglobulin was reduced to undetectable levels. Nonpathogenic cellular prion protein (PrPC) was carried by human plasma EVs and essential for the effects of EVs on PC-12 cells, as EV-induced cell signaling and neurite outgrowth were blocked by the PrPC-specific antibody, POM2. In addition, inhibitors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDA-R) and low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein-1 (LRP1) blocked the effects of plasma EVs on PC-12 cells, as did silencing of Lrp1 or the gene encoding the GluN1 NMDA-R subunit (Grin1). These results implicate the NMDA-R–LRP1 complex as the receptor system responsible for mediating the effects of EV-associated PrPC. Finally, EVs harvested from rat astrocytes carried PrPC and replicated the effects of human plasma EVs on PC-12 cell signaling.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced by diverse cells and include exosomes, which form by inward budding of multivesicular bodies in the endosomal transport pathway, microvesicles that shed from the cell surface, and membrane blebs formed by apoptotic cells (1Raposo G.

Shedding light on the cell biology of extracellular vesicles.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 213-228Google Scholar). EVs have been strongly implicated in cell–cell communication, based mainly on their ability to transfer cargo from one cell to another, including mRNAs, microRNAs, and proteins (1Raposo G.

For example, integrins in EV membranes not only target EVs to specific cell types but also trigger cell signaling in target cells (5Hoshino A. Costa-Silva B. Shen T.L. Rodrigues G. Hashimoto A.

Another example involves EV-associated tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, which functions similarly to soluble cytokine receptors, binding soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha and preventing it from engaging cellular receptors (7Hawari F.I.

Understanding the complete spectrum of mechanisms by which EVs regulate cell physiology is an important goal. Cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a widely expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein which, when misfolded, causes transmissible neurodegenerative diseases (9Prusiner S.B.

Exosomes and their role in the intercellular trafficking of normal and disease associated prion proteins.Mol. Aspects Med. 2018; 60: 62-68Google Scholar). The abundance of PrPC in EVs may be regulated by the overall expression level in the EV-generating cell (16Lazarini F. Castelnau P. Chermann J.F. Deslys J.P. Dormont D.

LRP1 and the NMDA-R are well characterized as cell-signaling receptors for various soluble proteins, including tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), the activated conformation of α2-macroglobulin (α2M), and matrix metalloprotease-9 (22Herz J.

In this study, we demonstrate that membrane-anchored PrPC in human plasma EVs engages the NMDA-R–LRP1 receptor complex in PC-12 cells to activate cell signaling and promote neurite outgrowth, similarly to S-PrP (21Mantuano E. Azmoon P. Banki M.A. Lam M.S. Sigurdson C.J. Gonias S.L. A soluble derivative of PrPC activates cell-signaling and regulates cell physiology through LRP1 and the NMDA receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 14178-14188Google Scholar). The ability of EVs to induce neurite outgrowth is previously described (28Xin H. Li Y. Buller B. Katakowski M. Zhang Y. Wang X. Shang X. Zhang Z.G.

Neurobiol. 2019; 56: 1812-1824Google Scholar). The mechanism identified here, in which the NMDA-R–LRP1 receptor system in target cells plays an essential role, is novel. The effects of human plasma EVs on PC-12 cell signaling and neurite outgrowth were blocked by the PrPC-specific antibody, POM2. EVs isolated from cultured rat astrocytes also expressed PrPC and activated cell signaling in PC-12 cells by a pathway that was inhibited by POM2. The interaction of EV-associated PrPC with target cell NMDA-R–LRP1 receptor complex may contribute to the ability of EVs to mediate cell–cell communication in the nervous system. EVs were harvested from fresh-frozen human plasma (FFP) obtained from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) transfusion service. Initially, EVs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (UC), applying minor modifications to established methods (33Caby M.P. Lankar D. Vincendeau-Scherrer C. Raposo G. Bonnerot C. Exosomal-like vesicles are present in human blood plasma.Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 879-887Google Scholar, 34Kalra H. Adda C.G. Liem M. Ang C.S. Mechler A. Simpson R.J. Hulett M.D. Mathivanan S. Comparative proteomics evaluation of plasma exosome isolation techniques and assessment of the stability of exosomes in normal human blood plasma.Proteomics. 2013; 13: 3354-3364Google Scholar). To further purify EVs, samples isolated by UC were subjected to molecular exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B, which has a fractionation range of 1 × 104–4 × 106 for globular proteins. The resulting preparations are referred to as size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) EVs. We also took advantage of the fact that the outer membranes of many EVs are rich in phosphatidylserine (PS) (35Matsumoto A. Takahashi Y. Nishikawa M. Sano K. Morishita M. Charoenviriyakul C. Saji H. Takakura Y. Role of phosphatidylserine-derived negative surface charges in the recognition and uptake of intravenously injected B16BL6-derived exosomes by macrophages.J. Pharm.

UC EVs that were further purified by PS immunoaffinity chromatography using immobilized PS-specific antibody are referred to as phosphatidylserine affinity chromatography (P-AC) EVs (Fig. 1A). We incorporated an intermediate step into our EV harvesting method in which plasma was subjected to UC at 20,000g. This step was designed to selectively pellet larger EVs and enrich UC EV preparations in smaller EVs, which include exosomes; however, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) demonstrated that there was still considerable size heterogeneity in the UC EVs (Fig. 1B). This heterogeneity was decreased in SEC EVs and P-AC EVs. UC, SEC, and P-AC EVs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after negative staining with uranyl acetate. Representative images of SEC EVs and P-AC EVs are shown in Figure 1C. Multiple particles with cup-like morphology were observed in all three preparations, consistent with the known ultrastructure of EVs. The granularity of the background was somewhat decreased in P-AC EV preparations, compared with UC or SEC EV preparations. This result was interpreted to reflect a lower level of plasma protein contamination in the P-AC EVs. Immunoblot (IB) analysis of UC EVs, isolated from human plasma, demonstrated flotillin-1, which is a lipid raft–associated protein, heat shock protein-70, tumor susceptibility gene 101, and the tetraspanins, CD9 and CD81 (Fig. 1D). These proteins are considered EV biomarkers (38Kowal J. Arras G. Colombo M. Jouve M. Morath J.P. Primdal-Bengtson B. Dingli F. Loew D. Tkach M. Thery C. Proteomic comparison defines novel markers to characterize heterogeneous populations of extracellular vesicle subtypes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: E968-E977Google Scholar). The golgi matrix protein 130 was absent from human plasma UC EVs, as anticipated. PrPC was detected in human plasma UC EVs by IB analysis. When EV-associated PrPC was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies POM2 and POM19 coupled to Dynabeads Protein-G, prior to IB analysis (immunoprecipitation/IB), up to three PrPC bands were detected between 25 and 37 kDa, consistent with the known glycosylation states of PrPC (39Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. Serban H. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Dwek R.A. Glycosylation differences between the normal and pathogenic prion protein isoforms.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13044-13049Google Scholar). An uncropped IB showing PrPC in a UC EV preparation isolated from a different plasma sample is shown in Fig. S1. The relative abundance of the three PrPC bands varied in UC EVs isolated from different plasma samples, as is evident by comparing the images in Figure 1D and Fig. S1. Figure 1E shows that PrPC was retained when UC EVs were further purified to generate SEC EVs and P-AC EVs. NTA and bicinchoninic acid protein assays were performed to compare UC, SEC, and P-AC EVs from human plasma. The number of particles per microgram of EV protein was increased in SEC EVs, compared with UC EVs, and significantly increased in P-AC EVs, compared with UC or SEC EVs (Fig. 2A). This result was interpreted to indicate that plasma protein contamination in EV preparations is decreased by applying secondary purification methods after UC. To identify plasma proteins present in EV preparations and quantitate these proteins compared with EV proteins, we performed LC–MS/MS studies. Cellular proteins identified by LC–MS/MS were assumed to be true EV components. Tryptic peptides derived from plasma proteins indicated either contaminants or proteins that associate with circulating EVs. The abundance of proteins identified by LC–MS/MS was estimated based on spectral counts. Figure 2B shows that in UC EVs, 90 ± 4% of the total protein content was attributed to plasma proteins. In P-AC EVs, plasma proteins accounted for only 19 ± 12% of the total protein identified by LC–MS/MS. Plasma proteins that were amongst the 25 most abundant proteins in each EV preparation are shown in Figure 2C (additional relevant data regarding identified proteins are presented in File S1). α2M was the most abundant plasma protein in UC EV preparations; however, α2M was present only in trace quantities or not detected at all in P-AC EVs. This result is notable because although the majority of the α2M in plasma is in the native conformation, which does not interact with the NMDA-R–LRP1 receptor system (24Gonias S.L. Campana W.M.

When equivalent amounts of protein from UC EVs and P-AC EVs were compared by immunoblotting, α2M was abundant in the UC EVs but undetectable in the P-AC EVs (Fig. 2D). By contrast, fibrinogen γ chain was detected in equal abundance in both preparations. Similar results were obtained when we probed for α2M in UC EVs and P-AC EVs using an activity assay that detects α2M based on its ability to bind trypsin (44Ganrot P.O. Determination of alpha-2-macroglobulin as trypsin-protein esterase.Clin. Chim. Acta. 1966; 14: 493-501Google Scholar). α2M was readily detected in UC EVs and present at only trace levels in P-AC EVs (Fig. 2E). Next, we subjected UC EVs to molecular exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B. Elution fractions were analyzed by IB analysis. Flotillin-1, which was monitored to identify fractions that contain EVs, was detected in early elution fractions, as anticipated (Fig. 2F). Fibrinogen partially coeluted with the EVs, whereas α2M eluted in later fractions even though fibrinogen and α2M have similar hydrodynamic radii (45Armstrong J.K. Wenby R.B. Meiselman H.J.

Size and shape of protein molecules at the nanometer level determined by sedimentation, gel filtration, and electron microscopy.Biol. Proced. Online. 2009; 11: 32-51Google Scholar). This result suggests that a portion of the fibrinogen detected in plasma EV preparations was probably EV associated, whereas α2M appears to be mostly a contaminant. S-PrP activates cell signaling and promotes neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells (21Mantuano E. Azmoon P. Banki M.A. Lam M.S. Sigurdson C.J. Gonias S.L. A soluble derivative of PrPC activates cell-signaling and regulates cell physiology through LRP1 and the NMDA receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 14178-14188Google Scholar). Because we and others (17Ritchie A.J. Crawford D.M. Ferguson D.J. Burthem J. Roberts D.J. Normal prion protein is expressed on exosomes isolated from human plasma.Br. J.

Immunol. 2021; 208: 85-96Google Scholar) identified PrPC in human plasma EVs, we undertook experiments to test whether EVs replicate the activity of S-PrP. To begin, we studied EVs purified by UC alone. When PC-12 cells were treated with UC EVs (2.5 μg/ml) for 0.5 h, extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was activated (Fig. 3A). The response was blocked by the noncompetitive NMDA-R inhibitor, MK801/dizocilpine, and by the LRP1 inhibitor, receptor-associated protein (RAP) (23Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. Argraves W.S. Diverse roles for the LDL receptor family.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 66-74Google Scholar, 47Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. A novel mechanism for controlling the activity of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Multiple regulatory sites for 39-kDa receptor-associated protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). UC EVs (2.5 μg/ml) promoted PC-12 cell neurite outgrowth, as shown in representative images in Figure 3B and in summary form in Figure 3C. RAP and MK801 entirely blocked the effects of UC EVs on neurite outgrowth. As a positive control, we also examined nerve growth factor beta (NGF-β) (50 ng/ml). NGF-β promoted neurite outgrowth as anticipated, and the response was not inhibited by RAP or MK801. To confirm the role of the NMDA-R and LRP1 in ERK1/2 activation by UC EVs, we silenced expression of Lrp1 and Grin1 with siRNA in PC-12 cells. Grin1 encodes the essential GluN1 subunit in the NMDA-R. We also silenced expression of Prnp, which encodes PrPC in PC-12 cells. Control cells were transfected with nontargeting control (NTC) siRNA. Figure 4A shows that the siRNAs specifically silenced the targeted genes without altering expression of nontargeted genes. Figure 4B shows that UC EVs activated ERK1/2 in cells transfected with NTC siRNA, as did the control NMDA-R–LRP1 ligands, S-PrP (40 nM) and purified α2M (10 nM), which was converted into the LRP1-recognized form by reaction with methylamine (42Mantuano E. Mukandala G. Li X. Campana W.M. Gonias S.L. Molecular dissection of the human alpha2-macroglobulin subunit reveals domains with antagonistic activities in cell signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19904-19911Google Scholar). In cells in which Lrp1 or Grin1 was silenced, the response to UC EVs was blocked, as was the response to S-PrP and α2M (Fig. 4, C and D), confirming that the NMDA-R–LRP1 system mediates ERK1/2 activation in PC-12 cells treated with UC EVs. Mattei et al. (48Mattei V. Manganelli V. Martellucci S. Capozzi A. Mantuano E. Longo A. Ferri A. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R.

Neurochem. 2020; 152: 468-481Google Scholar) reported that tPA-initiated cell signaling requires target cell PrPC. However, we demonstrated that in PC-12 cells, PrPC is not required for activation of cell signaling by S-PrP (21Mantuano E. Azmoon P. Banki M.A. Lam M.S. Sigurdson C.J. Gonias S.L. A soluble derivative of PrPC activates cell-signaling and regulates cell physiology through LRP1 and the NMDA receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 14178-14188Google Scholar). Figure 4E confirms that when Prnp is silenced in PC-12 cells, ERK1/2 activation by S-PrP is not affected. Similarly, activation of ERK1/2 by UC EVs was not affected by Prnp gene silencing. By contrast, purified α2M failed to activate ERK1/2 when Prnp was silenced in PC-12 cells, suggesting a requirement for target cell PrPC as an NMDA-R–LRP1 coreceptor for α2M, similar to that demonstrated with tPA previously (48Mattei V. Manganelli V. Martellucci S. Capozzi A. Mantuano E. Longo A. Ferri A. Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. A multimolecular signaling complex including PrP(C) and LRP1 is strictly dependent on lipid rafts and is essential for the function of tissue plasminogen activator.J. Neurochem. 2020; 152: 468-481Google Scholar). We conclude that UC EVs activate cell signaling in PC-12 cells by a mechanism that requires target cell NMDA-R and LRP1 but does not require target cell PrPC. The PrPC-specific monoclonal antibodies, POM1, POM2, POM3, and POM19, bind to defined epitopes in the structure of PrPC (49Polymenidou M. Moos R. Scott M. Sigurdson C. Shi Y.Z. Yajima B.

Kav N. et al.The POM monoclonals: A comprehensive set of antibodies to non-overlapping prion protein epitopes.PLoS One. 2008; 3e3872Google Scholar). POM2, which binds to the tandem octarepeats in the N-terminal unstructured region of PrPC, is the only PrPC-specific antibody in this series that blocks signal transduction initiated by S-PrP (21Mantuano E. Azmoon P. Banki M.A. Lam M.S. Sigurdson C.J. Gonias S.L. A soluble derivative of PrPC activates cell-signaling and regulates cell physiology through LRP1 and the NMDA receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 14178-14188Google Scholar). Figure 5A shows that POM2 (10 μg/ml) completely blocked ERK1/2 activation by UC EVs (2.5 μg/ml). POM1, POM3, and POM19 (10 μg/ml) were without effect. POM2 also blocked the ability of UC EVs to promote neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells, as shown in the representative images in Figure 5B and in summary form in Figure 5C. POM-1 was ineffective. In control experiments, methylamine-activated α2M promoted neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells, an anticipated consequence of its known interaction with the NMDA-R–LRP1 receptor system (41Shi Y.

This paper examined the effects of village fund programs and village apparatuses’ capacities to combat stunting based on aggregate data at the district level in Indonesia. Using descriptive data analysis and fixed effect panel regression, we observed that village fund programs could significantly reduce Indonesia’s stunting prevalence, especially outside Java. It also revealed that the increasing education of regional leaders does not necessarily positively impact leaders’ skills in handling stunting. At the same time, the number of village officials has a statistically significant influence on reducing stunting prevalence. It advised that the village budget fund can support national priorities in tackling the prevalence of stunting. Furthermore, it is essential to build the capacity of the village head for increasing awareness of health activities, especially early prevention of stunting, in addition to an adequate number of officials."

The present study investigated the changes that occurred during germination in two new genotypes black soybeans. Raw and germinated seeds were tested against in vitro Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including oxidative stress, inflammatory factors and cholinesterase enzymes as well as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. Sprouts significantly inhibited the cholinesterase enzymes and inflammatory factors (protein denaturation, proteinase and lipoxygenase) than seeds. An increase in phenolic, flavonoid and GABA (10-folds) content and antioxidant capacity (ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP) was observed in germinated seeds. However, anthocyanin content was decreased in sprouts. UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS2 metabolites profiling approach identified 22 compounds including amino acids, peptides, fatty acids, and polyphenols. Among identified compounds, daidzein, genistein, gallic acid, spermidine, L-asparagine, and L-lysine exhibited the highest increase after germination. The current study reveals that germination of black soybeans have promising potential to inhibit/prevent AD and can be used to develop functional foods."
https://openalex.org/W4210314970,"Induction of labor is one of the most used obstetric procedures in the world. It is performed in around 20% of all pregnancies. Failed induction of labor, on the other hand, has been associated with poorer mother and newborn health outcomes. Besides, there is a scarcity of data on the current burden and drivers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with failed induction in Worabe Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Southern Ethiopia.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on medical records of mothers who delivered through induction of labor during September 1st, 2018 to August 30th, 2020. The samples were collected using a systematic sampling technique. The data was extracted using a checklist. Data were entered into EpiData (version 3.1) and analyzed using SPSS (version 24). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to decide the association of explanatory variables with the outcome variable. Odds ratio with their 95% CI were calculated to identify the presence and strength of an association. A p-value of < 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.In this study, the prevalence of failed induction was observed to be 22.2%. The associated factors included rural residence (AOR = 5.7, 95% CI: 3.12-11.02), primiparity (AOR = 8.4, 95% CI: 2.72-22.36) and unfavourable bishop score (AOR = 5.9, 95% CI: 4.52-16.12).In comparison to the rate reported in developed countries, the study area had a high rate of failed induction. Being rural residence, primiparity and unfavourable bishop score were the associated factors of failed induction. Therefore, to reduce of the rate of failed induction, health care practitioners should analyze cervical status (using Bishop Score) to decide the possibility of successful induction, with a focus on associated factors like parity."

A descriptive analysis was performed through 26 dental procedures, including spontaneous, preventive, restorative/prosthetic and surgical procedures, and actions of cancer monitoring. Each conducted procedure assigned a score to the OHT, the final score being the sum of the number of procedures performed by the OHTs. These scores were then compared among the geographic regions of the country. Most OHTs perform basic dental procedures, such as supragingival scaling, root planning and coronal polishing (98.1%), composite filling (99.0%), and permanent tooth extraction (98.6%). The frequency related to dental prosthesis and monitoring of oral cancer decreased. Only 12.9% of the OHTs carries out biopsies, 30.9% monitor patients undergoing biopsy, 15.1% carry out impression for prostheses, and 13.6% carry out prostheses' installation. The scores reveal that OHT's performed, on average, 19.45 (±3.16) dental procedures. The OHTs in the South, Southeast, and Northeast had a higher number of primary dental procedures, while the teams in the North and Midwest performed, on average, fewer procedures. The Brazilian regions with the highest dental need have the lowest number of dental procedures. It is necessary to increase the range of procedures offered by OHT and reduce regional inequalities, adapting to the needs of the population in order to achieve comprehensive oral health."
https://openalex.org/W4210730317,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundant neurohormone in the central and peripheral nervous system involved in feeding behavior, energy balance, nociception, and anxiety. Several NPY receptor (NPYR) subtypes display elevated expression in many cancers including in breast tumors where it is exploited for imaging and diagnosis. Here, we address how hypoxia, a common feature of the tumor microenvironment, influences the expression of the NPYRs. We show that NPY1R and NPY5R mRNA abundance is induced by hypoxia in a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. We demonstrate that HIFs bind to several genomic regions upstream of the NPY1R and NPY5R transcription start sites. In addition, the MAPK/ERK pathway is activated more rapidly upon NPY5R stimulation in hypoxic cells compared with normoxic cells. This pathway requires insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) activity in normoxia, but not in hypoxic cells, which display resistance to the radiosensitizer and IGF1R inhibitor AG1024. Furthermore, hypoxic cells proliferate and migrate more when stimulated with NPY relative to normoxic cells and exhibit a more robust response to a Y5-specific agonist. Our data suggest that hypoxia-induced NPYRs render hypoxic cells more sensitive to NPY stimulation. Considering that breast tissue receives a constant supply of NPY, hypoxic breast tumors are the perfect storm for hyperactive NPYR. This study not only highlights a new relationship between the HIFs and NPYR expression and activity but may inform the use of chemotherapeutics targeting NPYRs and hypoxic cells."
https://openalex.org/W4210764846,"A variety of cancer entities are driven by KRAS mutations, which remain difficult to target clinically. Survival pathways, such as resistance to cell death, may represent a promising treatment approach in KRAS mutated cancers. Based on the frequently observed genomic deletions of BCL-2-related ovarian killer (BOK) in cancer patients, we explored the function of BOK in a mutant KrasG12D-driven murine model of lung cancer. Using KrasG12D/+ Bok-/- mice, we observed an overall tumor-promoting function of BOK in vivo. Specifically, loss of BOK reduced proliferation both in cell lines in vitro as well as in KrasG12D-driven tumor lesions in vivo. During tumor development in vivo, loss of BOK resulted in a lower tumor burden, with fewer, smaller, and less advanced tumors. Using KrasG12D/+ Tp53Δ/Δ Bok-/- mice, we identified that this phenotype was entirely dependent on the presence of functional p53. Furthermore, analysis of a human dataset of untreated early-stage lung tumors did not identify any common deletion of the BOK locus, independently of the TP53 status or the histopathological classification. Taken together our data indicate that BOK supports tumor progression in Kras-driven lung cancer."

We compared the recurrence risk between BCS-based regimens in Cox regressions and presented as adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI).The 1,836 study cohort with a low-to-intermediate risk of recurrence was grouped into BCS alone (6.1%), BCS+RT (6.2%), BCS+HT (23.4%) and BCS+HT+RT (64.3%) according to the initial treatments. During the follow-up (median: 3.3 years), the highest 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was in BCS+RT (94.1%) group and followed by BCS+HT+RT (92.8%), BCS+HT (87.4%) and BCS alone (84.9%). Of the single adjuvant therapies, RT was more effective than HT. Both BCS+HT (HR: 1.52, 95%CI: 0.99-2.35) and BCS+RT (HR: 1.10, 95%CI: 0.50-2.41) did not significantly increase recurrence risk comparing against the BCS+HT+RT group.Single adjuvant demonstrated a similar subsequent recurrence risk with dual adjuvant. This study supports the proposition to de-escalate adjuvant treatments in patients with low-to-intermediate risk of DCIS recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4210487082,"Organic matter management is key to sustain ecosystem services provided by soils. However, it is rarely considered in a holistic view, considering local resources, agro-environmental effects and harmonization with farmers' needs. Organic inputs, like compost and biochar, could represent a sustainable solution to massive current challenges associated to the intensification of agriculture, in particular for tropical regions. Here we assess the potential of agricultural residues as a resource for farmer communities in southwestern India to reduce their dependency on external inputs and sustain ecosystem services. We propose a novel joint evaluation of farmers' aspirations together with agro-environmental effects of organic inputs on soils. Our soil quality evaluation showed that biochar alone or with compost did not improve unilaterally soils in the tropics (Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol). Many organic inputs led to an initial decrease in water-holding capacities of control soils (-27.3%: coconut shell biochar with compost on Anthroposol). Responses to organic matter inputs for carbon were strongest for Ferralsols (+33.4% with rice husk biochar), and mostly positive for Anthroposols and Vertisols (+12.5% to +13.8% respectively). Soil pH responses were surprisingly negative for Ferralsols and only positive if biochar was applied alone (between -5.6% to +1.9%). For Anthroposols and Vertisols, highest increases were achieved with rice husk biochar + vermicomposts (+7.2% and +5.2% respectively). Our socio-economic evaluation showed that farmers with a stronger economical position showed greater interest towards technology like biochar (factor 1.3 to 1.6 higher for farmers cultivating Anthroposols and/or Vertisols compared to Ferralsols), while poorer farmers more skepticism, which may lead to an increased economical gap within rural communities if technologies are not implemented with long-term guidance. These results advocate for an interdisciplinary evaluation of agricultural technology prior to its implementation as a development tool in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4210597932,"Diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are catastrophic illnesses that collectively lead to increased mortality and premature death. However, the size of the problem and the appropriate approach to deal with the burden is still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the yield, number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one death or adverse event for screening DM and hypertension and assess the prevalence and contributors to DM and/or hypertension.Based on PTB contact tracing, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 801 PTB index cases and 972 household contacts from April 2019 to October 2020 in Guizhou, China. All the participants were screened for DM and hypertension. The yield was calculated as the proportion of newly detected cases among the study subjects, excluding known cases. The NNS was computed by dividing the number needed to treat for risk factors by the prevalence of the unrecognized diseases. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the independent predictors of DM and/or hypertension.Of the 1,773 participants, the prevalence of DM and hypertension was 8.7% (70/801) and 15.2% (122/801) in the PTB patients, 3.2% (31/972) and 14.0% (136/972) in the contacts, respectively. The prevalence of DM and/or hypertension was 21.2% (170/801) among the PTB patients and 15.4% (150/972) among their contacts. The screening yields to detect new cases of DM and hypertension among PTB patients were 1.9% and 5.2%, and that in the contacts were 0.8% and 4.8%, respectively. The NNS for DM was 359 for the PTB cases and 977 for the contacts, 299 for PTB cases and 325 for hypertension, respectively. Older age, under or overweight and obesity, family history hypertension and earlier diagnosis of other chronic conditions were the independent predictors for DM and/or hypertension among both PTB cases and their contacts.Screening for DM and hypertension should be mandated in PTB patients and their household contacts to disclose undetected cases of these two conditions during TB contact tracing, which might reduce the potential cardiovascular disease deaths."
https://openalex.org/W4210643333,"We study the limits imposed by transcription factor specificity on the maximum number of binding motifs that can coexist in a gene regulatory network, using the SwissRegulon Fantom5 collection of 684 human transcription factor binding sites as a model. We describe transcription factor specificity using regular expressions and find that most human transcription factor binding site motifs are separated in sequence space by one to three motif-discriminating positions. We apply theorems based on the pigeonhole principle to calculate the maximum number of transcription factors that can coexist given this degree of specificity, which is in the order of ten thousand and would fully utilize the space of DNA subsequences. Taking into account an expanded DNA alphabet with modified bases can further raise this limit by several orders of magnitude, at a lower level of sequence space usage. Our results may guide the design of transcription factors at both the molecular and system scale."
https://openalex.org/W4210712929,"Recursive splicing (RS) is a splicing mechanism to remove long introns from messenger RNA precursors of long genes. Compared to the hundreds of RS events identified in humans and drosophila, only ten RS events have been reported in mice. To further investigate RS in mice, we analyzed RS in the mouse brain, a tissue that is enriched in the expression of long genes. We found that nuclear total RNA sequencing is an efficient approach to investigate RS events. We analyzed 1.15 billion uniquely mapped reads from the nuclear total RNA sequencing data in the mouse cerebral cortex. Unexpectedly, we only identified 20 RS sites, suggesting that RS is a rare event in the mouse brain. We also identified that RS is constitutive between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and between sexes in the mouse cerebral cortex. In addition, we found that the primary sequence context is associated with RS splicing intermediates and distinguishes RS AGGT site from non-RS AGGT sites, indicating the importance of the primary sequence context in RS sites. Moreover, we discovered that cryptic exons may use an RS-like mechanism for splicing. Overall, we provide novel findings about RS in long genes in the mouse brain."
https://openalex.org/W4212789108,"Olive leaf extract (OLE) has been increasingly recognized as a natural and effective antimicrobial against a host of foodborne pathogens. This study attempts to predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OLE against Listeria monocytogenes F2365 by utilizing the asymptotic deceleration point (PDA) in a logistic model (LM), namely MIC-PDA. The experimental data obtained from the inhibitory rate (IR) versus OLE concentration against L . monocytogenes were sufficiently fitted ( R 2 = 0.88957). Five significant critical points were derived by taking the multi-order derivatives of the LM function: the inflection point (PI), the maximum acceleration point (PAM), the maximum deceleration point (PDM), the absolute acceleration point (PAA), and the asymptotic deceleration point (PDA). The PDA ([OLE] = 37.055 mg/mL) was employed to approximate the MIC-PDA. This MIC value was decreased by over 42% compared to the experimental MIC of 64.0 mg/mL, obtained using the conventional 2-fold dilution method ( i . e ., MIC-2fold). The accuracy of MIC-PDA was evaluated by an in vitro L . monocytogenes growth inhibition assay. Finally, the logistic modeling method was independently validated using our previously published inhibition data of OLE against the growths of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis . The MIC-PDA (for [OLE]) values were estimated to be 41.083 and 35.313 mg/mL, respectively, compared to the experimental value of 62.5 mg/mL. Taken together, MIC-PDA, as estimated from the logistic modeling, holds the potential to shorten the time and reduce cost when OLE is used as an antimicrobial in the food industry."
https://openalex.org/W4225888445,"Evidence from the 1950s showed that Macedonia was iodine deficient. After the introduction of mandatory universal salt iodisation, the country saw a steady increase in iodine intake and decline in goitre prevalence, earning iodine-deficiency free status in 2003. Iodine status assessments in 2007 and 2016 showed adequate iodine intake among school age children (median urinary iodine concentration of 241 μg/L and 236 μg/L respectively). Macedonia participated in piloting the Iodine Global Network Programme Guidance on the use of iodised salt in industrially processed foods to better understand potential iodised salt intake from processed foods. One objective of implementation was to identify the need, opportunities, and required actions to strengthen the processed food component of the national salt iodisation policy. Data from the 2017 Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES) was used to determine household salt consumption, to identify widely-consumed, salt-containing industrially processed foods, and estimate typical daily intake of these foods. Their estimated contribution to iodine intake was estimated based on their salt content and the percentage of food industry salt that is iodised. Although the study has limitations, including a relatively small selection of foods, the results indicate potential iodine intake from iodised household salt and iodised salt in the selected foods of nearly 300% of the Estimated Average Requirement and over 220% of the Recommended Nutrient Intake for adults. This was approximately 50% of the tolerable safe Upper Level for iodine intake. The study confirmed high daily salt intake (11.2 grams from household salt only). Successful salt reduction would be expected to reduce iodine intake, however, modelling with 10% and 30% reduction implied this is unlikely to put any population group at risk of deficiency. It is recommended that implementation of salt iodisation and salt reduction policies are harmonized, alongside continued regular iodine status monitoring for different population groups."

Blocking blue light has been shown to improve sleep and may be a suitable intervention for sleep problems during pregnancy. The present study investigated the effects of blue light blocking in the evening and during nocturnal awakenings among pregnant women on primary sleep outcomes in terms of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and mid-point of sleep.In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 60 healthy nulliparous pregnant women in the beginning of the third trimester were included. They were randomized, using a random number generator, either to a blue-blocking glass intervention (n = 30) or to a control glass condition constituting partial blue-blocking effect (n = 30). Baseline data were recorded for one week and outcomes were recorded in the last of two intervention/control weeks. Sleep was measured by actigraphy, sleep diaries, the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale.The results on the primary outcomes showed no significant mean difference between the groups at posttreatment, neither when assessed with sleep diary; total sleep time (difference = .78[min], 95%CI = -19.7, 21.3), midpoint of sleep (difference = -8.9[min], 95%CI = -23.7, 5.9), sleep efficiency (difference = -.06[%], 95%CI = -1.9, 1.8) and daytime functioning (difference = -.05[score points], 95%CI = -.33, .22), nor by actigraphy; total sleep time (difference = 13.0[min], 95%CI = -9.5, 35.5), midpoint of sleep (difference = 2.1[min], 95%CI = -11.6, 15.8) and sleep efficiency (difference = 1.7[%], 95%CI = -.4, 3.7).

Children exposed to metformin vs. placebo in utero, have increased head circumference at birth and are more overweight and obese at 8 years of age. Also, maternal PCOS-status seems to alter the long-term cardio-metabolic health of offspring. We hypothesized that the long-term effects of metformin-exposure and/or maternal PCOS may be mediated by circulatory adaptations during fetal life.This is a sub-study of a larger double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, where women with PCOS were randomized to metformin (2g/day) or placebo in pregnancy, a total of 487 women. A sub-group of participants (N = 58) took part in this sub-study and had an extended ultrasound examination at gestational week 32, including blood flow velocity and diameter measurements of the umbilical vein (UV), the ductus venosus (DV) and the portal vein (PV). Blood flow volume was calculated and adjusted for estimated fetal weight (EFW) (normalized flow). Metformin exposed fetuses were compared to placebo exposed fetuses. Fetuses of mothers with PCOS (metformin [n = 30] and placebo [n = 28]) were compared to a low-risk reference population (N = 160) by z-score statistics.There was no difference in fetal liver flow between metformin vs. placebo-exposed fetuses. Fetuses of mothers with PCOS had higher EFW (0.63 [95% CI 0.44-0.83] p<0.001), lower normalized UV, DV, PV, and lower total venous liver blood flows than the reference population.Metformin during pregnancy did not affect fetal liver blood-flow. In our population, maternal PCOS-status was associated with reduced total venous liver blood-flow, which may explain altered growth and metabolism later in life."
https://openalex.org/W4210383166,"This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) from discharge to 6-month visit and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with acute heart failure (AHF).Among 1246 patients enrolled in the prospective longitudinal follow-up study nested from the Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure registry, this study population included 446 patients with available paired BNP data at discharge and 6-month index visit. This study population was classified into 3 groups by percent change in BNP from discharge to 6-month visit; the low tertile (≤-44%, N = 149), the middle tertile (>-44% and ≤22%, N = 149) and the high tertile (>22%, N = 148).The cumulative 180-day incidence after the index visit of the primary outcome measure (a composite endpoint of all-cause death or hospitalization for HF) was significantly higher in the high and middle tertiles than in the low tertile (26.8% and 14.4% versus 6.9%, log-rank P<0.0001). The adjusted excess risk of the high tertile relative to the low tertile remained significant for the primary outcome measure (hazard ratio: 3.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.51-8.46, P = 0.003).Percent change in BNP was associated with a subsequent risk for a composite of all-cause death and hospitalization for HF after adjustment of the absolute BNP values, suggesting that observing the change in BNP levels, in addition to absolute BNP levels themselves, helps us to manage patient with HF."
https://openalex.org/W4210583572,"Endocrine-therapy-resistant estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancer cells often exhibit an augmented capacity to maintain endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) homeostasis under adverse conditions. Oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) is a known transcriptional coactivator that promotes cancer development. However, it is unclear whether HBXIP participates in maintaining EnR homeostasis and promoting drug resistance in ER+ breast cancer. Here, we report that tamoxifen-resistant (TmaR) breast cancer cells exhibit increased expression of HBXIP, which acts as an inactivator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to diminish tamoxifen-induced EnR stress. We show that HBXIP deficiency promotes EnR-associated degradation, enhances UPR-element reporter activity and cellular oxidative stress, and ultimately attenuates the growth of TmaR cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HBXIP acts as a chaperone of UPR transducer inositol-requiring enzyme 1a and diminishes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TamR breast cancer cells. Upon loss of HBXIP expression, tamoxifen treatment hyperactivates IRE1α and its downstream proapoptotic pathways and simultaneously induces accumulation of intracellular ROS. This elevated ROS programmatically activates the other two branches of the UPR, mediated by PKR-like ER kinase and activating transcription factor 6α. Clinical investigations and Kaplan–Meier plotter analysis revealed that HBXIP is highly expressed in TamR breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, reinforced HBXIP expression is associated with a high recurrence and poor relapse-free survival rates in tamoxifen monotherapy ER+ breast cancer patients. These findings indicate that HBXIP is a regulator of EnR homeostasis and a potential target for TamR breast cancer therapy.

These findings indicate that HBXIP is a regulator of EnR homeostasis and a potential target for TamR breast cancer therapy. Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in women, and nearly 70% of cases are estrogen receptor–positive (ER+). Tamoxifen (TAM) has been universally used for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. However, the inevitable emergence of resistance to TAM obstructs the successful treatment of this cancer. The endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress-activated unfolded protein response (UPR), a collective set of signaling pathways, has been demonstrated to be one of the most vital endocrine-therapy-resistant mechanisms (1Kim I. Xu W. Reed J.C. Cell death and endoplasmic reticulum stress: Disease relevance and therapeutic opportunities.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 1013-1030Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms by which the UPR pathways integrate their cytoprotective and proapoptotic outputs under EnR stress, such as TAM treatment, are still unknown. EnR plays a crucial role in regulating protein homeostasis. When undergoing insatiable protein folding requirements, the cells will initiate EnR stress and cause UPR. The UPR is a prime candidate for one survival mechanism that, if successfully activated, could allow cells to survive the stress of endocrine therapies and confer a resistance phenotype (2Clarke R. Shajahan A.N. Wang Y. Tyson J.J. Riggins R.B. Weiner L.M. Bauman W.T. Xuan J. Zhang B. Facey C. Aiyer H. Cook K. Hickman F.E. Tavassoly I. Verdugo A. et al.Endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response, and gene network modeling in antiestrogen resistant breast cancer.Horm. Mol. Biol. Clin. Investig. 2011; 5: 35-44Google Scholar). Three EnR protein sensors, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activation transcription factor 6α (ATF6), and inositol requiring enzymes 1α (IRE1α), primarily mediate the UPR (3Senft D. Ronai Z.A. UPR, autophagy, and mitochondria crosstalk underlies the ER stress response.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 141-148Google Scholar). The complex signaling network mediated by these proteins coordinates the response of cells to EnR stress. Chronic activation of the UPR signaling pathway is a key factor in cancer progression and has been widely accepted by the scientific and medical communities. The UPR is often abnormally activated when a tumor suppressor is absent or an oncogene is activated. Cancer cells can survive high protein synthesis and metabolic stress to promote tumor progression (4Phillips A.M. Doud M.B. Gonzalez L.O. Butty V.L. Lin Y.S. Bloom J.D. Shoulders M.D. Enhanced ER proteostasis and temperature differentially impact the mutational tolerance of influenza hemagglutinin.Elife. 2018; 7e38795Google Scholar). However, activation of the UPR pathway is a double-edged sword, as persistent or irreplaceable EnR stress can activate apoptosis (5Urra H. Dufey E. Avril T. Chevet E. Hetz C. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the hallmarks of cancer.Trends Cancer. 2016; 2: 252-262Google Scholar). At present, the combined use of chemotherapy and targeted drugs that inhibit oncogenic driver gene mutations to induce persistent EnR stress has become a promising cancer treatment strategy (6Clarke H.J. Chambers J.E. Liniker E. Marciniak S.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress in malignancy.Cancer Cell. 2014; 25: 563-573Google Scholar, 7Hetz C. Chevet E. Oakes S.A. Proteostasis control by the unfolded protein response.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 829-838Google Scholar). Although the UPR represents an ideal target for cancer treatment, it is also vital for cancer cells to develop chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Recent studies have shown that cancer cells with constitutive or acquired resistance to chemotherapy are resistant to EnR-stress-triggered cell death (8Salaroglio I.C. Panada E. Moiso E. Buondonno I. Provero P. Rubinstein M. Kopecka J. Riganti C. PERK induces resistance to cell death elicited by endoplasmic reticulum stress and chemotherapy.Mol. Cancer. 2017; 16: 91Google Scholar). Drug-resistant tumor cells often have a set of coordinated regulatory mechanisms to maintain appropriate EnR stress, promote survival, and prevent excessive stress-induced apoptosis (9Avril T. Vauleon E. Chevet E. Endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling and chemotherapy resistance in solid cancers.Oncogenesis. 2017; 6e373Google Scholar). However, how is the UPR regulated in tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) ER+ breast cancer is not fully understood. Hepatitis B virus X protein-binding protein (HBXIP), which is highly expressed in a variety of cancers, plays a vital role in tumor progression. As a vital oncogenic transcriptional coactivator, HBXIP modulates many crucial transcription factors such as c-Myc, p53, FAS, Sp1, E2F1, STAT4, and c-Myb (10Xiu M. Zeng X. Shan R. Wen W. Li J. Wan R. The oncogenic role of HBXIP.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2021; 133: 111045Google Scholar), to regulate multiple signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt, Hippo/YAP, MDM2/p53, and ERK1/2/NF-κB, promoting malignant tumor phenotype progression (11Fang R. Xu F. Shi H. Wu Y. Cao C. Li H. Ye K. Zhang Y. Liu Q. Zhang S. Zhang W. Ye L. LAMTOR5 raises abnormal initiation of O-glycosylation in breast cancer metastasis via modulating GALNT1 activity.Oncogene. 2020; 39: 2290-2304Google Scholar, 12Zhao Y. Li H. Zhang Y. Li L. Fang R. Li Y. Liu Q. Zhang W. Qiu L. Liu F. Zhang X. Ye L. Oncoprotein HBXIP modulates abnormal lipid metabolism and growth of breast cancer cells by activating the LXRs/SREBP-1c/FAS signaling cascade.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 4696-4707Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Wang Z. Shi H. Li H. Li L. Fang R. Cai X. Liu B. Zhang X. Ye L. HBXIP and LSD1 scaffolded by lncRNA hotair mediate transcriptional activation by c-Myc.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 293-304Google Scholar). Recently, our group found that HBXIP competes with NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) to bind with Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1), activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway, and enhance breast cancer cell antioxidant stress coping ability (14Zhou X.L. Zhu C.Y. Wu Z.G. Guo X. Zou W. The oncoprotein HBXIP competitively binds KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and enhance breast cancer cell growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 4028-4046Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether HBXIP plays a role in TamR ER+ breast cancer cells. Here, we found that expression of HBXIP was significantly elevated in TamR breast cancer cells. HBXIP deficiency resensitizes TamR cells to tamoxifen (TAM) and attenuates the growth of TamR breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HBXIP inactivates the UPR to maintain EnR homeostasis in two ways: 1) HBXIP binds to the cytoplasmic region linker domain (LD) of IRE1α to stabilize the IRE1α-Bip complex and inactive the IRE1α pathway. 2) HBXIP reduces cellular ROS levels by activating the Nrf2-ARE pathway to inhibit the PERK and ATF6 pathways. Moreover, clinical analysis and Kaplan–Meier plotter investigations found that high expression of HBXIP was associated with high recurrence and poor survival rates in tamoxifen monotherapy ER+ breast cancer patients. Our findings provide evidence of the molecular mechanism that establishes HBXIP as a valuable regulatory element of TamR breast cancer treatment. TAM is a first-line drug for endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer. The emergence of TAM resistance and tumor recurrence is the foremost challenge in clinical treatment. To evaluate whether HBXIP is linked to TAM resistance in breast cancer, we established the TamR breast cancer cell lines MCF-7/TAM and T47D/TAM by screening with increasing doses of TAM for 8 months. Compared with the parent cells, the TAM IC50 values of MCF-7/TAM and T47D/TAM cells were increased by 23.44- and 23.97-fold, respectively Figs. S1–S6). HBXIP promoter activity and mRNA and protein expression levels were substantially increased in TamR cells compared with their parent cells (Fig. 1A). HBXIP deficiency markedly decreased TAM IC50 values (Fig. 1B) and inhibited the growth of TamR cells (Fig. 1C). Reconstituting HBXIP expression in HBXIP-deficient TamR cells restored drug resistance and growth ability (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, an in vitro soft agar colony formation assay revealed that the colony formation abilities of HBXIP-deficient TamR cancer cells were significantly inhibited by 1 μM TAM. Reconstitution of HBXIP expression reinstated the colony formation abilities of HBXIP-deficient TamR cells in TMA soft agar (Fig. S2). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that overexpression of HBXIP induced TAM resistance and enhanced the malignant growth ability of native MCF-7 and T47D cells in the presence of TAM in vitro and in vivo (15Liu B. Wang T. Wang H. Zhang L. Xu F. Fang R. Li L. Cai X. Wu Y. Zhang W. Ye L. Oncoprotein HBXIP enhances HOXB13 acetylation and co-activates HOXB13 to confer tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.J. Hematol. Oncol. 2018; 11: 26Google Scholar). Moreover, a xenograft tumor model was established to verify the roles of HBXIP in TamR breast cancer cells in vivo. The growth curve of xenograft tumors showed that weekly TAM administration (2 mg/kg, oral gavage) significantly inhibited the growth of HBXIP-deficient MCF-7/TAM and T47D/TAM xenograft tumors compared with the MCF-7/TAM and T47D/TAM groups (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the reduction in HBXIP expression resensitized the xenografts to TAM treatment. Reconstituting HBXIP expression restored TAM resistance and xenograft growth abilities of HBXIP-deficient TamR cancer cells in vivo in response to TAM treatment (Fig. 1D). These findings demonstrate that enhanced HBXIP expression is involved in maintaining TAM resistance in ER+ breast cancer. To explore the mechanisms involved in HBXIP-mediated drug resistance of TamR breast cancer cells, we examined the ultrastructural variations between HBXIP-deficient TamR cells and control cells using transmission electron microscopy. After treatment with 1 μM TAM or 5 μg/ml EnR stressor tunicamycin (Tm) for 48 h, apparent dilation of EnR was observed in stable HBXIP knockdown MCF-7/TAM and T47D/TAM cells (Fig. 2A). Dilation of the EnR is a hallmark feature of EnR stress. Studies have reported that EnR stress plays a critical role in generating drug resistance (16Cao S. Tang J. Huang Y. Li G. Li Z. Cai W. Yuan Y. Liu J. Huang X. Zhang H. The road of solid tumor survival: From drug-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress to drug resistance.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2021; 8: 620514Google Scholar) by inducing the UPR as an adaptive response for maintaining EnR homeostasis (17Wang M. Kaufman R.J. The impact of the endoplasmic reticulum protein-folding environment on cancer development.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14: 581-597Google Scholar, 18Hetz C. Papa F.R. The unfolded protein response and cell fate control.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69: 169-181Google Scholar). Additionally, endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is an integral part of the UPR because the expression of many ERAD genes is controlled by the UPR (19Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Functional and genomic analyses reveal an essential coordination between the unfolded protein response and ER-associated degradation.Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Google Scholar). To evaluate the roles of HBXIP in UPR pathway activation, we first evaluated whether HBXIP contributes to ERAD by evaluating the protein stability of the ERAD reporter CD3δ-YFP (20Liu Y. Tao S. Liao L. Li Y. Li H. Li Z. Lin L. Wan X. Yang X. Chen L. TRIM25 promotes the cell survival and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma through targeting Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 348Google Scholar), which was transiently expressed in stable HBXIP-deficient TamR cells and control cells. After 48 h of TAM treatment, there was increased CD3δ-YFP accumulation in HBXIP-deficient cells than in control TamR cells (Fig. 2B). Reconstitution of HBXIP expression led to decreased CD3δ-YFP levels in HBXIP-deficient TamR cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that HBXIP deficiency induces UPR activation and enhances ERAD in response to TAM treatment. Next, the UPR element (UPRE) reporter assay was conducted in TamR breast cancer cells and MEFs by employing the UPRE-Luc system(21). Knockdown of HBXIP expression in TamR cancer cells resulted in a significant increase in UPRE reporter activity during TAM treatment. Reconstitution of HBXIP expression markedly attenuated UPRE reporter activity (Fig. 2C). Enhancing the expression of HBXIP in native MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells also resulted in a significant decrease in UPRE reporter activity during TAM treatment (Fig. S3). Similar results were noted in HBXIP knockout MEFs. UPRE reporter activity was considerably enhanced in HBXIP knockout MEFs, but weakened in HBXIP rescued MEFs after the indicated Tm treatment for 6 h (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the ERAD reporter and UPRE-Luc reporter assays are heavily dependent on the activation of IRE1α-Xbp1 (21Sepulveda D. Rojas-Rivera D. Rodriguez D.A. Groenendyk J. Kohler A. Lebeaupin C. Ito S. Urra H. Carreras-Sureda A. Hazari Y. Vasseur-Cognet M. Ali M.M.U. Chevet E. Campos G. Godoy P. et al.Interactome screening identifies the ER luminal chaperone Hsp47 as a regulator of the unfolded protein response transducer IRE1alpha.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69: 238-252.e237Google Scholar) which is the most conserved branch among UPR pathways. Upon activation, IRE1α cleaves the Xbp1u mRNA into a spliced form Xbp1s(22). We confirmed these results using RT-PCR to examine Xbp1 mRNA in TamR breast cancer cells and MEFs under TAM or Tm treatment. Xbp1s mRNA levels were unevenly elevated in HBXIP knockdown TamR cells and HBXIP knockout MEFs, demonstrating that IRE1α-Xbp1 signaling was activated (Fig. 2, E and F). Rescuing HBXIP expression in HBXIP knockout MEFs decreased Xbp1s mRNA level (Fig. 2F). Next, the UPR inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) was employed to explore the UPR inhibitory role of HBXIP on TAM resistance in breast cancer cells. As shown in Figure 2G and Fig. S4, 4-PBA treatment reversed HBXIP-deficient cell growth and colony formation abilities in the presence of TAM. Collectively, these results suggested that HBXIP is a negative UPR regulator and that HBXIP deficiency in TamR cancer cells, in combination with TAM treatment, promotes IRE1α-Xbp1 pathway activation. The other two arms of the UPR, the ATF6α and PERK pathways, also play critical roles in regulating EnR stress. During EnR stress, ATF6α converts an active transcription factor (TF) after cleavage by S1P/S2P proteases (22Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: From stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Google Scholar). PERK directly phosphorylates the TF eIF2α and induces expression of the TF ATF4 and several UPR factors such as CHOP (22Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: From stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Google Scholar). We further examined whether downstream effectors of the IRE1α-Xbp1 pathway were activated in HBXIP-deficient TamR breast cancer cells in response to TAM treatment. qPCR and Western blot analysis revealed that mRNA and protein expression levels of the Xbp1s target factors ERdj4, p58IPK, EDEM, and PDIA6 (23Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. XBP-1 regulates a subset of endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone genes in the unfolded protein response.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Google Scholar) were significantly upregulated in HBXIP-deficient TamR breast cancer cells after treatment with TAM (Fig. 3, A and B). Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 in response to EnR stress (24Takeda K. Noguchi T. Naguro I. Ichijo H. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 in stress and immune response.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 199-225Google Scholar). We found that silencing HBXIP in TamR cells triggered the phosphorylation of IRE1α, ASK1, and JNK, which in turn induced enhanced expression of the proapoptotic factors Puma and Noxa in response to TAM treatment (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, HBXIP deficiency also induced the elevation of PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation and CHOP and cleaved ATF6α expression (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that HBXIP deficiency activates the PERK and ATF6α pathways in TamR breast cancer cells treated with TAM. In HBXIP expression rescue assays, activation of the UPR pathways IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6α was attenuated by the reconstitution of HBXIP expression in HBXIP-deficient TamR breast cancer cells under TAM treatment conditions (Fig. 3E). Collectively, the results suggest that HBXIP upregulation in TamR cancer cells mitigates the TAM-induced UPR. To clarify the intrinsic mechanism by which HBXIP inactivates the UPR in TamR breast cancer cells, we analyzed the interactions of HBXIP with IRE1α, PERK, or ATF6α proteins in TamR breast cancer cells by coimmunoprecipitation. An HBXIP-specific antibody was used to immunoprecipitate HBXIP in the indicated whole-cell extracts, and immunoblotting experiments detected coprecipitated IRE1α but not PERK or ATF6α (Fig. 4A). Because HBXIP primarily exists in cytoplasmic breast cancer cells (14Zhou X.L. Zhu C.Y. Wu Z.G. Guo X. Zou W. The oncoprotein HBXIP competitively binds KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and enhance breast cancer cell growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 4028-4046Google Scholar), the binding site is likely located in the cytoplasmic region of IRE1α. Therefore, the cDNA fragment coding for cytoplasmic region 465 to 977 AA of IRE1α was cloned in the pGEX-4T1 vector. The subsequent GST-pulldown experiment verified that recombinant GST-IRE1cyto (cytoplasmic region) directly binds to His-HBXIP in vitro (Fig. 4B). Moreover, IRE1α was immunoprecipitated in control MCF-7/TAM cells, HBXIP-deficient MCF-7/TAM cells with HBXIP expression reconstituted, and coprecipitated HBXIP was detected in control and HBXIP reconstituted cells using an anti-HBXIP antibody. Furthermore, the flag-tagged HBXIP was detected in the coprecipitate of the HBXIP-reconstituted group, indicating the specificity of HBXIP-IRE1α binding (Fig. 4C). Next, we determined the domain of the IRE1α protein responsible for binding to HBXIP. Based on known domains of the IRE1α protein (25Li H. Korennykh A.V. Behrman S.L. Walter P. Mammalian endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1 signals by dynamic clustering.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 16113-16118Google Scholar), we constructed a series of specific domain deletion mutants with flag tags (Fig. 4D). Coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed in HEK293 cells transiently coexpressing HA-HBXIP and flag-tagged IRE1α mutants. In addition to the IRE1α fragment lacking the linker domain (LD), IRE1α mutants lacking the ribonuclease (RNase) domain (RD) or kinase and RNase domain (KRD) interacted with HBXIP (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that the LD domain of IRE1α is responsible for the interaction between IRE1α and HBXIP. The 91 C-terminal amino acids (83–173) are well conserved among species (Table S3) and contain several conserved functional regions, such as the CoRNR-like domain, KBS motif, and Leu zipper domain (14Zhou X.L. Zhu C.Y. Wu Z.G. Guo X. Zou W. The oncoprotein HBXIP competitively binds KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and enhance breast cancer cell growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 4028-4046Google Scholar). We co-overexpressed IRE1α and various functional domains containing HBXIP truncated mutations that were previously constructed (14Zhou X.L. Zhu C.Y. Wu Z.G. Guo X. Zou W. The oncoprotein HBXIP competitively binds KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and enhance breast cancer cell growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 4028-4046Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that HBXIP-C and HBXIP-CoK, containing the CoRNR and KBS motifs, could bind to the IRE1α protein (Fig. 4F). The tertiary structure of HBXIP (26Garcia-Saez I. Lacroix F.B. Blot D. Gabel F. Skoufias D.A. Structural characterization of HBXIP: The protein that interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein survivin and the oncogenic viral protein HBx.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 331-340Google Scholar) has an α helix (86–95) and a β sheet formed by CoRNR-like box IVGVL (100–104) that form a hydrophobic pocket. We speculated that this hydrophobic pocket is responsible for binding to the nonpolar amino-acid-rich linker domain of IRE1α. Accordingly, we designed an HBXIPmut mutant in which the ""IVGVL"" (100–104) motif was replaced with “GAGAG.” Coimmunoprecipitation determined that HBXIPmut could not bind IRE1α in cells (Fig. S5), suggesting that the ""IVGVL (100–104)"" motif of HBXIP was responsible for interacting with the linker domain of IER1α. Treating MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells with 0.5 and 1 μM TAM for 12 h induced dose-dependent elevation of the phosphorylation level of IRE1α (Fig. 4G). Coimmunoprecipitation determined that levels of the HBXIP-IRE1α complex were elevated in a dose-dependent manner in response to with the dose of TAM (Fig. 4G). Similarly, treatment of MCF-7 and T47D cells with increasing doses of Tm as indicated for 12 h activated the IRE1α pathway in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4H). Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that levels of the intracellular HBXIP-IRE1α complex were elevated as the Tm dose increased in TamR breast cancer cells (Fig. 4H). TAM or Tm, which can induce EnR stress, promotes formation of the IRE1α-HBXIP complex. Therefore, we speculated that the interaction between HBXIP and IRE1α helps ER+ breast cancer cells inhibit excessive EnR stress and promotes cell survival and drug resistance. IRE1α activity is primarily regulated by the EnR-resident chaperone-binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), which regulates IRE1α activity through combination with or separation from IRE1α (27Amin-Wetzel N. Saunders R.A. Kamphuis M.J. Rato C. Preissler S. Harding H.P. Ron D. A J-protein co-chaperone recruits BiP to monomerize IRE1 and repress the unfolded protein response.Cell. 2017; 171: 1625-1637.e13Google Scholar). We examined whether HBXIP influences the interaction between IRE1α and BiP in MCF-7/TAM cells. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that HBXIP forms a heterologous trimer with IRE1α and BiP in MCF-7/TAM cells. HBXIP deficiency resulted in the release of BiP protein from IRE1α and elevation of the phosphorylation level of IRE1α in response to TAM treatment (Fig. 4I). These results suggest that HBXIP stabilizes the IRE1α-Bip complex by forming a heterologous trimer that regulates the inactivation of IRE1α in TamR breast cancer cells during TAM incubation. Next, the activation time course of the three arms of the UPR was investigated by transiently knocking down the expression of HBXIP using specific shRNA expressed by lentivirus pLKO-HBXIP (14Zhou X.L. Zhu C.Y. Wu Z.G. Guo X. Zou W. The oncoprotein HBXIP competitively binds KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and enhance breast cancer cell growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 4028-4046Google Scholar). Under TAM treatment, phosphorylation levels of IRE1α and protein levels of Xbp1s were significantly increased 48 to 120 h after lentivirus infection. Phosphorylation levels of PERK and protein levels of ATF4 and CHOP did not significantly increase until 96 h after infection, and cleaved ATF6α levels significantly increased 72 h postinfection (Fig. 5A). HBXIP deficiency has a programmatic regulatory effect on activating the three UPR pathways in TamR breast cancer cells. Studies have confirmed that high cellular ROS levels induce UPR activation (28Eletto D. Chevet E. Argon Y. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Redox controls UPR to control redox.J.

Zhu C.Y. Wu Z.G. Guo X. Zou W. The oncoprotein HBXIP competitively binds KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and enhance breast cancer cell growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 4028-4046Google Scholar). Therefore, intracellular ROS levels were analyzed after lentivirus pLKO-HBXIP infection, and the results of DCFH-DA flow cytometry demonstrated that intracellular ROS level was markedly increased 72 h after lentivirus infection and dramatically elevated 96 h postinfection (Fig. 5, B and C). These changes in ROS levels are consistent with the time course of activation of the UPR branch pathways PERK and ATF6α. To further confirm these results, we reconstituted wild-type HBXIP, HBXIPN112A, and HBXIPmut mutants in HBXIP-deficient MCF-7/TAM cells. The HBXIPN112A mutant could not bind Keap1 and lost its anti-ROS function (14Zhou X.L. Zhu C.Y. Wu Z.G. Guo X. Zou W. The oncoprotein HBXIP competitively binds KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and enhance breast cancer cell growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2019; 38: 4028-4046Google Scholar), but it did bind to the LD domain of IRE1α (Fig. S6). Compared with the wild-type HBXIP re-expression group, reintroducing the expression of HBXIPN112A inactivated IRE1α and reduced levels of Xbp1s protein, expect in the PERK and ATF6α pathways. In addition, re-expressing HBXIPmut (100–104, GAGAG), which loses IRE1α-binding ability, inactivated the PERK and ATF6α pathways but had little effect on the IRE1α-Xbp1 pathway (Fig. 5D). Assessing the variation of intracellular ROS found that the reconstruction of HBXIPN112A did not attenuate the intracellular ROS compared with the wild-type HBXIP and HBXIPmut reconstitution groups (Fig. 5, E and F). Moreover, diminishing intracellular ROS levels in HBXIPN112A-rescued cells by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) inactivated the PERK and ATF6α signaling pathways (Fig. 5G). Collectively, these results indicate that enhanced HBXIP maintains EnR homeostasis in TamR breast cancer cells during TAM treatment in two ways: (1) inactivating IRE1α by binding to the LD domain (Figs. 2 and 4) inhibiting PERK and ATF6α pathway act"
https://openalex.org/W4210652810,"Agricultural diversity is one of the bases of traditional agroecosystems, having great environmental and cultural importance. The current loss of agricultural diversity is causing serious concern, mainly because of its essential role in supporting global and local food security. Stopping this loss requires a better understanding of how diversity is managed locally and what mechanisms sustain agricultural diversity. Here we propose a generalist agent-based model that couples biological, cultural, and social dynamics to obtain varietal diversity as an emergent phenomenon at the community level. With a mechanistic approach, we explore how four of the model dynamics can shape systems diversity. To validate the model, we performed a bibliographic review on Manihot esculenta and Zea mays case studies. The model yielded compatible results for manioc and maize varietal richness at both community and household levels."
