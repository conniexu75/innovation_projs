https://openalex.org/W2109002457,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) comprise a range of disorders that share a core of neurobehavioural deficits characterized by widespread abnormalities in social interactions, deficits in communication as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. The neurological basis and circuitry mechanisms underlying these abnormal behaviours are poorly understood. SHANK3 is a postsynaptic protein, whose disruption at the genetic level is thought to be responsible for the development of 22q13 deletion syndrome (Phelan-McDermid syndrome) and other non-syndromic ASDs. Here we show that mice with Shank3 gene deletions exhibit self-injurious repetitive grooming and deficits in social interaction. Cellular, electrophysiological and biochemical analyses uncovered defects at striatal synapses and cortico-striatal circuits in Shank3 mutant mice. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for SHANK3 in the normal development of neuronal connectivity and establish causality between a disruption in the Shank3 gene and the genesis of autistic-like behaviours in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2066286996,"The summer of 2010 was exceptionally warm in eastern Europe and large parts of Russia. We provide evidence that the anomalous 2010 warmth that caused adverse impacts exceeded the amplitude and spatial extent of the previous hottest summer of 2003. ""Mega-heatwaves"" such as the 2003 and 2010 events likely broke the 500-year-long seasonal temperature records over approximately 50% of Europe. According to regional multi-model experiments, the probability of a summer experiencing mega-heatwaves will increase by a factor of 5 to 10 within the next 40 years. However, the magnitude of the 2010 event was so extreme that despite this increase, the likelihood of an analog over the same region remains fairly low until the second half of the 21st century."
https://openalex.org/W2105512180,"In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, most genes appear to be transcribed during short periods called transcriptional bursts, interspersed by silent intervals. We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again."
https://openalex.org/W2157910818,"A frequent complication in colorectal cancer (CRC) is regeneration of the tumor after therapy. Here, we report that a gene signature specific for adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) predicts disease relapse in CRC patients. ISCs are marked by high expression of the EphB2 receptor, which becomes gradually silenced as cells differentiate. Using EphB2 and the ISC marker Lgr5, we have FACS-purified and profiled mouse ISCs, crypt proliferative progenitors, and late transient amplifying cells to define a gene program specific for normal ISCs. Furthermore, we discovered that ISC-specific genes identify a stem-like cell population positioned at the bottom of tumor structures reminiscent of crypts. EphB2 sorted ISC-like tumor cells display robust tumor-initiating capacity in immunodeficient mice as well as long-term self-renewal potential. Taken together, our data suggest that the ISC program defines a cancer stem cell niche within colorectal tumors and plays a central role in CRC relapse.

Tissue regeneration in the intestine is ultimately sustained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that reside at the base of mucosal invaginations called crypts (Figure 1A ). The progeny of ISCs, termed transient amplifying (TA) cells, is expanded through several rounds of mitosis while it migrates upwards along the crypt axis. Close to the intestinal lumen, TA cells undergo cell-cycle arrest and terminal differentiation. Stem cells of the mouse small intestine (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J.

Lgr5+ ISCs are long lived, proliferate continuously, and generate all cell types present in the gut. The onset of intestinal tumorigenesis is driven in most cases by activating mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway. Mouse Lgr5+ cells give rise to intestinal tumors with higher efficiency than other intestinal epithelial cell populations upon mutational activation of the Wnt pathway (Barker et al., 2008Barker N. Ridgway R.A. van Es J.H. van de Wetering M. Begthel H. van den Born M. Danenberg E. Clarke A.R. Sansom O.J. Clevers H. Crypt stem cells as the cells-of-origin of intestinal cancer.Nature. 2008; 457: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ISCs represent the cell of origin for colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the second cause of death by cancer. The current therapeutic strategy for most CRC patients includes surgical resection of the tumor and chemotherapeutic treatment. After curative therapy, a large proportion of CRC patients remain clinically free of disease for months or years. Yet, after such period of remission, cancer recurs in 30%–50% of all cases, generally in the form of metastasis. The risk of cancer recurrence is linked to the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis (American Joint Cancer Committee [AJCC] staging system). Most Stage I CRC patients (95%–98%) will not develop recurrent cancer, whereas 20%–25% of Stage II and 40%–50% of Stage III CRC patients will experience disease relapse upon treatment. Although a large proportion of deaths by CRC are caused by recurrent tumors, the biological basis for disease relapse remains unknown. Cancer relapse is caused by isolated tumor cells that disseminated prior to resection of the primary tumor and that resisted chemotherapeutic treatments. In some patients, resilient cancer cells eventually resume growth and regenerate a new tumor mass. Recent studies have evidenced that not all cell populations present in primary CRCs are capable of regenerating a tumor as isolated entities. CRCs contain subsets of cells that can effectively propagate the disease when implanted in an immunodeficient host. These cells, termed tumor-initiating cells, can be identified by the expression of surface markers such as cd133 (O'Brien et al., 2007O'Brien C.A. Pollett A. Gallinger S. Dick J.E.

USA. 2007; 104: 10158-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Cd133+ or cd44+ cell populations represent a particular subset of aggressive CRC cells. In addition, some indirect evidences suggest a connection between tumor-initiating cells and ISCs. In particular, cd133 and cd44 are expressed in the proliferative compartment of normal crypts (progenitors and ISCs) (Snippert et al., 2009Snippert H.J. van Es J.H. van den Born M. Begthel H. Stange D.E. Barker N. Clevers H.

Also, purified cd133+ tumor-initiating cells can be expanded in vitro as an undifferentiated population that upon xenotransplantation generates tumors that contain differentiated-like cells (Vermeulen et al., 2008Vermeulen L. Todaro M. de Sousa Mello F. Sprick M.R. Kemper K. Perez Alea M. Richel D.J. Stassi G. Medema J.P. Single-cell cloning of colon cancer stem cells reveals a multi-lineage differentiation capacity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13427-13432Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Despite these suggestive observations, a relationship between ISCs and cd133+/cd44+ tumor cells remains speculative. Also, there is lack of evidence supporting a role of tumor-initiating cells in cancer recurrence. Genes transcriptionally regulated by the Wnt pathway in the intestinal epithelium are expressed with patterns ranging from restricted expression to ISCs (e.g., Lgr5) to broad expression in proliferative cells (e.g., Myc) (Van der Flier et al., 2007Van der Flier L.G. Sabates-Bellver J. Oving I. Haegebarth A. De Palo M. Anti M. Van Gijn M.E. Suijkerbuijk S. Van de Wetering M. Marra G. et al.The Intestinal Wnt/TCF Signature.Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 628-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). One of such Wnt target genes, the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2, is expressed in a decreasing gradient from the crypt base toward the differentiated cell compartment (Batlle et al., 2002Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H.

EphB activity is required to establish the position of the different cell types in the crypts as mice mutant for EphB2, EphB3 (Batlle et al., 2002Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H.

Palomo-Ponce S. Iglesias M. Fernandez-Masip J.L. Vivancos A. Whissell G. Huma M. Peiro N. Gallego L.

Genet. 2007; 39: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) display defects in intestinal cell compartmentalization. Here, we take advantage of EphB2 graded expression to purify and obtain the expression profiles of ISCs and other crypt cell types. We discover that expression of ISC-specific genes associates with the risk of developing recurrent CRC. Furthermore, paralleling the results in normal crypts, the graded expression of EphB2 in CRCs identifies tumor cell populations displaying ISC-like or differentiated-like phenotypes. The transcriptional profiles of the different cell types present in the intestinal epithelium remain essentially uncharacterized, which precludes an in-depth analysis of intestinal cell type-specific gene program expression in CRC. We developed a cell isolation method based on surface expression of EphB2, which is expressed following a decreasing gradient from the crypt base (Figure 1A). ISCs (i.e., crypt base columnar cells) showed highest expression of membrane EphB2 (Figure 1A, black arrowheads), whereas TA cells progressively decreased EphB2 protein levels as they migrated toward the surface. Differentiated cells in the villus and Paneth cells were negative for EphB2 expression (Batlle et al., 2002Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H.

We stained suspensions of disaggregated mouse intestinal cells with a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of EphB2 (Mao et al., 2004Mao W. Luis E. Ross S. Silva J. Tan C. Crowley C. Chui C. Franz G. Senter P. Koeppen H. et al.EphB2 as a Therapeutic Antibody Drug Target for the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and by FACS, we isolated epithelial cells (EpCAM+, cd45−, cd31−, cd11b−) displaying different EphB2 surface expression (Figure 1B). Analysis of marker genes revealed similar levels of Ki67, Myc, FoxM1, (Figure 1C) and other genes characteristic of proliferating cells in EphB2hi and EphB2med cell subpopulations (Figure S1 available online). However, EphB2hi cells expressed around 5-fold higher levels of ISC-specific genes Lgr5 (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. et al.Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), Ascl2 (van der Flier et al., 2009van der Flier L.G. van Gijn M.E. Hatzis P. Kujala P. Haegebarth A. Stange D.E. Begthel H. van den Born M. Guryev V. Oving I. et al.Transcription factor achaete scute-like 2 controls intestinal stem cell fate.Cell. 2009; 136: 903-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and Olfm4 (van der Flier et al., 2009van der Flier L.G. van Gijn M.E.

These results suggest that the EphB2hi cell population is enriched in ISCs, whereas EphB2med cells correspond mainly to crypt TA cells. To test the functionality of each crypt cell population, freshly isolated cells from mouse small intestine were cultured in conditions that mimic the intestinal stem cell niche as previously described (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. et al.Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar). Single cells expressing high or medium levels of EphB2 developed into complex multicellular 3D structures (Figure 1D). These in vitro organoids recreated the organization of the intestinal epithelium, including the presence of multiple crypt-like structures (Figures 1D and 1F, arrowheads) distributed around a central lumen. EphB2hi cells showed 3- to 5-fold higher efficiency than EphB2med cells in the formation of intestinal organoids (Figure 1E). This result parallels the enrichment in ISC marker gene expression between EphB2hi and EphB2med populations shown in Figure 1C. On the contrary, EphB2lo and EphB2neg cells never grew (Figure 1E). Organoids derived from single EphB2hi cells displayed proliferative Ki67+ cells within crypt-like evaginations (Figure 1G, empty arrowheads) and cell-cycle-arrested Krt20+ differentiated cells forming large lumens (Figure 1H, arrows). Importantly, staining for lineage-specific markers revealed the presence of all mature intestinal cell types (Figures 1I–1K). Organoids were expanded by mechanical disaggregation every 4 to 5 days over a 2 month period without decrease in growth rates. The efficiency of organoid generation from isolated EphB2hi cells was in the range of 0.5%–1%, similar to that obtained from Lgr5-GFPhi cells in our laboratory (1%–2%; data not shown) and slightly lower than reported before (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. et al.Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar). Overall, these observations support the idea that the EphB2hi cell population is enriched in ISCs. By microarray analysis, we identified the global expression profile of EphB2hi ISCs. We selected probe sets enriched at least 2-fold in EphB2hi compared with EphB2med cells, and that were further downregulated in EphB2lo cells. Only 71 probes (54 annotated genes) passed this stringent criterion (Table S1), including the previously described ISC-specific genes Lgr5 (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. et al.Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar) and Ascl2 (van der Flier et al., 2009van der Flier L.G. van Gijn M.E. Hatzis P. Kujala P. Haegebarth A. Stange D.E. Begthel H. van den Born M. Guryev V. Oving I. et al.Transcription factor achaete scute-like 2 controls intestinal stem cell fate.Cell. 2009; 136: 903-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The expression of several randomly selected genes from this list (Smoc2, Pcdh8, and Igfbp4) was restricted to small, wedge-like cells intermingled with Paneth cells at the crypt-bottom most positions (Figure 1L; data not shown). This pattern is characteristic of Lgr5+ cells (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. et al.Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), implying that these three genes represent new ISC-specific markers. To broaden this analysis, we analyzed the expression of the EphB2hi ISC signature in Lgr5-GFP knockin mice (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. et al.Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). The vast majority (98%) of genes contained in the EphB2hi ISC gene expression signature were upregulated (>1.5-fold, p < 0.05) in Lgr5-GFPhi cells relative to Lgr5-GFPlo cells (Figures S2A–S2C) (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. et al.Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). Of note, the EphB2hi ISC gene signature did not contain core pluripotency genes (i.e., oct4, sox2, nanog, klf4) or the Myc-driven gene module characteristic of ESCs (Kim et al., 2010Kim J. Woo A.J. Chu J. Snow J.W. Fujiwara Y. Kim C.G. Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. A Myc network accounts for similarities between embryonic stem and cancer cell transcription programs.Cell. 2010; 143: 313-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). It was not enriched in genes directly involved in proliferation owing to equal levels in ISCs and TA cells (see below). We also established the gene program that defines the proliferation status of crypt cells by selecting probes expressed at equivalent levels in EphB2hi and EphB2med cells that were silenced in EphB2lo cells (Table S1). This gene module was enriched in known mediators of DNA replication, mitosis, DNA-damage repair, and proliferation (Figure 1C and Figure S1). Genes with higher expression levels in EphB2lo compared to EphB2med cells that were further downregulated in EphB2hi subpopulation constituted the gene expression signature of late progenitor cells (Table S1). This set contained several well-established markers of intestinal differentiation such as Krt20, Anpep, or Ada (Figure 1C, Figure S1 and Table S1). Each gene expression signature described above was instrumental to investigate whether the global transcriptional profile of human CRCs resembled that of any particular crypt cell type. Crypt proliferation genes were overexpressed in all CRCs compared with normal tissue (Figure 2A ). Remarkably, 38% of the genes from the EphB2hi ISC gene program were also overexpressed in CRCs, including the bona fide ISC markers Lgr5 and Ascl2 (Figure 2B) (average fold change > 1.5, p < 0.05). The signature of late TA cells was silenced overall (Figure 2A), and Krt20 and other markers of intestinal differentiation were downregulated relative to normal tissue (Figure 2B and data not shown). We next investigated the association of each crypt cell gene-expression signature with clinical progression of CRC. We selected for analysis a representative pooled cohort of 340 primary colon cancer patients treated at three different hospitals (see Experimental Procedures for details). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that the expression of EphB2-ISC genes was strongly associated with metastatic compared with nonmetastatic colon cancer (Figure 2C; Stage IV versus the rest, FDR < 0.0003; data not shown). In addition, the EphB2-ISC and Proliferation signatures were enriched in poorly differentiated tumors compared to more benign well-differentiated CRCs (Figure 2D). To strengthen the above observations, we derived an independent ISC expression signature from Lgr5-GFP cells. We selected those probes more acutely upregulated in Lgr5-GFPhi versus Lgr5-GFPlo cells (>3 fold, p < 0.05, Table S1). 54% of the genes contained in the Lgr5-GFPhi signature were not represented in the EphB2hi ISC signature (Figure S2D) due to the different cut-offs used to define both gene lists. Like for EphB2hi genes, the Lgr5-GFPhi signature was highly enriched in metastatic colon cancer (Figure S2E; Stage IV versus the rest; FDR < 1 × 10−8; data not shown) as well as in poorly differentiated compared with well-differentiated tumors (Figure S2E). Altogether, these results suggest that a distinctive feature of aggressive colon cancers is high expression of an ISC-like gene program. GSEA also revealed that the EphB2-derived ISC signature was highly enriched in genes that positively predicted the relative risk of developing recurrent cancer upon intended curative therapy (FDR < 1 × 10−8; Figure 3A ). We used ISC gene expression levels to stratify CRC patients into three groups (Figure 3B). Patients bearing primary CRCs with high average expression of ISC genes had a relative risk of relapse 10-fold higher than those with low levels (p < 0.0001). The EphB2-ISC medium expression group displayed an intermediate risk (medium versus low; HR = 6.28; p = 0.0182). Remarkably, the EphB2-ISC low group remained virtually disease-free during 10 years of follow-up with only one early recurrent cancer (Figure 3B). The EphB2-ISC signature expression displayed an incremental and approximately linear effect on the risk of recurrence (Figure 3C; linearity test, p = 0.5). Multivariate analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model demonstrated that the EphB2-ISC signature is a predictor of disease relapse independent of AJCC staging (Figure 3D). We obtained equivalent results for the Lgr5-ISC signature (Figure S2H). We noticed that the EphB2- and Lgr5-derived ISC signatures predicted relapse with borderline significance in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively; Figure 3D and Figure S2H). Yet, both ISC signatures performed better to identify CRC relapse occurring later than 2 years after curative therapy (Figure 3B and Figure S2F, dashed lines). GSEA confirmed that both ISC signatures were enriched in genes associated with late (>2 years) compared with early colon cancer relapses (Figure 3E and Figure S2I). Remarkably, multivariate analysis revealed that EphB2-ISC (Figure 3F) and Lgr5-ISC (Figure S2J) signatures outperformed the AJCC staging system in the identification of relapses occurring after 2 years of treatment. Thus, late recurrent tumors appear to arise preferentially from CRCs that expressed high levels of ISC genes. The gene expression signature obtained from late TA cells was enriched in genes that predicted no relapse over follow-up, albeit with borderline statistical significance (FDR = 0.03; Figure 3A). In addition, several well-established markers of intestinal differentiation associated inversely with tumor recurrence, including MUC2 (p = 0.024; HR = −1.37), TFF3 (p = 0.011; HR = −1.38), MATH1 (p = 0.0001; HR = −1.54), CDX2 (p = 0.0005; HR = −1.54), or Villin (p = 0.02; HR = −1.31). GSEA also demonstrated that the crypt proliferation signature was inversely associated with disease relapse (Figure 3A) as previously reported (Anjomshoaa et al., 2008Anjomshoaa A. Lin Y.H. Black M.A. McCall J.L. Humar B. Song S. Fukuzawa R. Yoon H.S. Holzmann B. Friederichs J. et al.Reduced expression of a gene proliferation signature is associated with enhanced malignancy in colon cancer.Br. J. Cancer. 2008; 99: 966-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This observation reinforces the notion that ISC and proliferation genes measure independent features of the tumor. The gene-expression signatures used in this study were obtained from mouse intestinal cells. We reason that genes involved in essential functions for crypt cells must be largely conserved between human and rodents. Yet, to rule out the possibility that the use of mouse-derived gene lists may impose artifacts in the clinical association studies, we analyzed their overall expression patterns in human colon mucosa. We interrogated a publicly available data set of transcriptomic profiles of normal human colon mucosa in which the top crypt and bottom compartments were microdissected and analyzed separately (Kosinski et al., 2007Kosinski C. Li V.S. Chan A.S. Zhang J. Ho C. Tsui W.Y. Chan T.L. Mifflin R.C. Powell D.W. Yuen S.T. et al.Gene expression patterns of human colon tops and basal crypts and BMP antagonists as intestinal stem cell niche factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15418-15423Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). GSEA showed that EphB2-ISC, Lgr5-ISC, and Proliferation signatures were largely enriched in crypt human bottom compared to top region compartments, whereas the Late TA signature followed the reverse pattern (Figure 4B ). Thus, to a large extent, mouse-derived signatures used in this study are expressed by human colon crypts with equivalent patterns. Using the expression profiles of human colon crypts as filters, we excluded from each mouse crypt-derived cell signature those genes that were not differentially expressed between human colon crypt-bottom and crypt-top compartments (see Experimental Procedures). The resulting “humanized” gene lists (Table S5) associated with disease progression with equivalent strength and specificity than the unrefined mouse crypt-derived gene lists (Figures 4C–4F and Figure S3). In particular, Hu-EphB2-ISC and Hu-Lgr5-ISC signatures were enriched in metastatic CRC (Stage IV versus the rest, Hu-EphB2-ISC; FDR = 0.04 and Hu-Lgr5-ISC; FDR < 10−16, data not shown) as well as in recurrent tumors (Figure 4C and Figure S3A). Analogous to the signature of mouse crypt proliferative cells, the Hu-Proliferation signature was enriched in nonrecurrent CRCs (FDR < 10−16, data not shown). In addition, GSEA confirmed a further enrichment of Hu-ISC signatures in tumors that will relapse relatively late (>2 years) (Figure 4D and Figure S3D). Both Hu-EphB2-ISC and Hu-Lgr5-ISC signatures had approximately linear effect on the risk of recurrence (Figure 4E and Figure S3B). Multivariate analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model demonstrates that the power of the humanized ISC signatures to predict relapse is, to a large extent, independent of AJCC staging (Figure 4F and Figure S3C and S3E). Overall, these results strengthen the specificity of the association of the ISC expression program with the clinical progression of CRC. The above observations indicate that most aggressive CRCs express high levels of ISC-specific genes. This phenomenon is associated to the ability of tumor cells to recur after therapy. We next sought to understand whether the ISC program was homogenously expressed by all tumor cells or restricted to specific subpopulations. We used Lgr5 as a surrogate marker to identify the localization of tumor cells with ISC-like phenotype. By in situ hybridization, we detected Lgr5 mRNA at the base of human colonic crypts (Figure 5B ) as well as in a large proportion of tumor samples from CRC patients (Figure 5F). Lgr5 expression was heterogeneous among different tumors. The frequency of positive cells ranged from <1% to 95% (Figure 5F), and staining was restricted to cell clusters dispersed throughout the tumor mass (red arrowheads in Figure 5D and Figure S4). Commonly, Lgr5+ cells localized within the most basal tumor cell layers. In tumor regions that displayed glandular organization, Lgr5+ cells resided at sites where the tumor epithelium invaginates into the surrounding stroma (dotted lines in Figure 5D and Figure S4). Remarkably, the morphology of these invaginations was reminiscent of that of normal colon crypts. As exemplified in Figure 5D, some CRCs were constituted by abundant crypt-like structures arrayed around large lumens. Other CRCs contained individual Lgr5+ crypts dispersed throughout the tumor mass (examples in Figure S4). Of note, we could not detect the expression of Lgr5 in one-third of the samples analyzed (Figure 5F) owing to low sensitivity of ISH technique on archival material. This subset included most poorly differentiated CRCs that consistently showed low levels of Lgr5 (data not shown) even though they were, overall, enriched in expression of ISC-specific genes (Figure 2D and Figure S2E). We also investigated the expression of intestinal differentiation markers in CRC. Krt20 codifies"

Here we used two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to monitor the activity of two Rho GTPases-RhoA and Cdc42-in single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity associated with long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of rat hippocampus. When long-term volume increase was induced in a single spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging, RhoA and Cdc42 were rapidly activated in the stimulated spine. These activities decayed over about five minutes, and were then followed by a phase of persistent activation lasting more than half an hour. Although active RhoA and Cdc42 were similarly mobile, their activity patterns were different. RhoA activation diffused out of the stimulated spine and spread over about 5 µm along the dendrite. In contrast, Cdc42 activation was restricted to the stimulated spine, and exhibited a steep gradient at the spine necks. Inhibition of the Rho-Rock pathway preferentially inhibited the initial spine growth, whereas the inhibition of the Cdc42-Pak pathway blocked the maintenance of sustained structural plasticity. RhoA and Cdc42 activation depended on Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII). Thus, RhoA and Cdc42 relay transient CaMKII activation to synapse-specific, long-term signalling required for spine structural plasticity."

However, the continuous rotation of the dipoles required in vortex structures and the behavior of unit cell dipoles in flux-closure structures have never been experimentally established.

BM-MSCs were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as monolayers. Recombinant BMP-12 treatment (10 ng/ml) of BM-MSCs for 12 hours in vitro markedly increased expression of the tenocyte lineage markers scleraxis (Scx) and tenomodulin (Tnmd) over 14 days. Treatment with BMP-12 for a further 12-hour period had no additional effect. Colony formation assays revealed that ~80% of treated cells and their progeny were Scx- and Tnmd-positive. BM-MSCs seeded in collagen scaffolds and similarly treated with a single dose of BMP-12 also expressed high levels of Scx and Tnmd, as well as type I collagen and tenascin-c. Furthermore, when the treated BM-MSC-seeded scaffolds were implanted into surgically created tendon defects in vivo, robust formation of tendon-like tissue was observed after 21 days as evidenced by increased cell number, elongation and alignment along the tensile axis, greater matrix deposition and the elevated expression of tendon markers. These results indicate that brief stimulation with BMP-12 in vitro is sufficient to induce BM-MSC differentiation into tenocytes, and that this phenotype is sustained in vivo. This strategy of pretreating BM-MSCs with BMP-12 prior to in vivo transplantation may be useful in MSC-based tendon reconstruction or tissue engineering."

https://openalex.org/W2048656742,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a fatal infectious disease endemic in tropical regions worldwide, and especially prevalent in southeast Asia and northern Australia. This intracellular pathogen can escape from phagosomes into the host cytoplasm, where it replicates and infects adjacent cells. We previously demonstrated that, in response to B. pseudomallei infection of macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, a subset of bacteria co-localized with the autophagy marker protein, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), implicating autophagy in host cell defence against infection. Recent reports have suggested that LC3 can be recruited to both phagosomes and autophagosomes, thereby raising questions regarding the identity of the LC3-positive compartments in which invading bacteria reside and the mechanism of the autophagic response to B. pseudomallei infection. Electron microscopy analysis of infected cells demonstrated that the invading bacteria were either free in the cytosol, or sequestered in single-membrane phagosomes rather than double-membrane autophagosomes, suggesting that LC3 is recruited to B. pseudomallei-containing phagosomes. Partial or complete loss of function of type III secretion system cluster 3 (TTSS3) in mutants lacking the BopA (effector) or BipD (translocator) proteins respectively, resulted in delayed or no escape from phagosomes. Consistent with these observations, bopA and bipD mutants both showed a higher level of co-localization with LC3 and the lysosomal marker LAMP1, and impaired survival in RAW264.7 cells, suggesting enhanced killing in phagolysosomes. We conclude that LC3 recruitment to phagosomes stimulates killing of B. pseudomallei trapped in phagosomes. Furthermore, BopA plays an important role in efficient escape of B. pseudomallei from phagosomes."

In contrast, systems biology focuses on the interaction of myriad components and how these give rise to the dynamic and complex behavior of biological systems. Here, we examine the synergies between these two fields. Biology is the technology of this century. The potential uses of biology to improve the human condition and the future of the planet are myriad. Over the last century, humans have used biology to make many useful things, in part based on discoveries from molecular biology. In addition, researchers have redesigned biological systems to test our fundamental understanding of their components and integrated functions. However, the complexity and reliability of engineered biological systems still cannot approach the diversity and richness exhibited by their natural counterparts. It is then the combined promise of systems biology and synthetic biology that may drive transformative advances in our ability to program biological function. One recent example of the successful engineering of a biological system to address a global challenge in health and medicine is the creation of microbes that produce a precursor to the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Ro et al., 2006Ro D.K. Paradise E.M. Ouellet M. Fisher K.J. Newman K.L. Ndungu J.M. Ho K.A. Eachus R.A. Ham T.S. Kirby J. et al.Nature. 2006; 440: 940-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). By shifting synthesis from the natural production host (a plant) to one more optimized for rapid production times and inexpensive scale up (a microorganism), researchers were able to develop a process that enabled cheaper supply of this drug, providing a more accessible cure for a disease devastating third world countries. However, the research phase of this project required an investment of over $25 million and 150 person-years of highly trained researcher effort. This investment cannot realistically be replicated for every chemical or material to which we would apply this approach. Instead, imagine a time when a bioengineer designs a system at the computer, orders the necessary DNA encoding the specified system, and then begins the actual experiment of turning it into life. Thus, one overarching goal of synthetic biology is to make the engineering of biology faster, affordable, and more predictable. Biological systems and their underlying components offer a number of functional parallels with engineered systems. For example, biological sensors are exquisitely sensitive; the olfactory system can detect single odorant molecules and decode them. Biological systems can send and receive signals rapidly and in a highly specific manner. Pathways exist to sense and respond to the environment. Plants and microbes can use sunlight as an energy source. However, biological systems are also uniquely capable of self-replication, mutation, and selection, leading to evolution. Synthetic biologists aim to take advantage of these parallels and develop engineering principles for the design and construction of biological systems. However, an open question is whether we understand biological systems sufficiently to be able to redesign them to fulfill specific requirements. Engineers enjoy the concept of interchangeable parts and modularity. Biology offers many sources of potential modularity but exhibits nonmodular features as well. For many years the gene was regarded as a fundamental modular unit of biology. As such, a gene is capable of transferring a particular phenotype to the organism. However, we now know that genes display more fine-grained modularity in the form of promoters, open reading frames (ORFs), and regulatory elements. mRNAs contain sequences important for proper intracellular targeting and degradation. Proteins often contain targeting sequences, reactive centers, and degradation sequences. And lastly, entire pathways are modular in that some signaling pathways can be transferred from one organism to another to reconstruct a new state in the engineered organism. This modularity underlies one of the core concepts of synthetic biology—the notion that one can assemble biological systems from well-defined “parts” or modules (Endy, 2005Endy D. Nature. 2005; 438: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). However, modular assembly approaches have largely remained confounded by the effects of context—that is, the nonmodular aspects of biology. For example, where a gene or an associated regulatory element is located in the genome can impact expression and thus its function. In addition, the location of regulatory elements relative to each other and ORFs can impact their encoded function (Haynes and Silver, 2009Haynes K. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 589-596Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further analyses provided by systems biology may help to guide the development of standard strategies for assembling genetic modules into functional units. Given that the goals of synthetic biology are to make the engineering of biology faster and more predictable, and to harness the power of biology for the common good, the development of new approaches that support the design and construction of genetic systems has been a core activity within the field. Although advances have been made in both areas (fabrication and design), our ability to construct large genetic systems currently surpasses our ability to design such systems, resulting in a growing “design gap” that is a critical issue that synthetic biologists must address. The ability to synthesize large pieces of DNA corresponding to operons, entire pathways, chromosomes, and genomes in a rapid and predictable way is a key approach to system fabrication. Systems biology has provided numerous templates with the abundance of sequenced genomes being deposited daily into publicly accessible databases. Some progress has recently been reported, including the resynthesis of a bacterial genome and its successful insertion into a different bacterial host (Gibson et al., 2010Gibson D.G. Glass J.I. Lartigue C. Noskov V.N. Chuang R.Y. Algire M.A. Benders G.A. Montague M.G. Ma L. Moodie M.M. et al.Science. 2010; 329: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). However, it took researchers nearly 15 years and approximately $30 million to develop various fundamental aspects of this project. Much of this time and cost was methods development that will hopefully reduce the resources needed to carry out such projects in the future. In addition, new high-throughput methods for large-scale DNA synthesis have been recently described (Matzas et al., 2010Matzas M. Stahler P.F. Kefer N. Siebelt N. Boisguerin V. Leonard J.T. Keller A. Stahler C.F. Haberle P. Gharizaden B. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Norville et al., 2010Norville J.E. Derda R. Drinkwater K.A. Leschziner A.E. Knight T.R. J. Biol. Eng. 2010; 4: 17Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Tian et al., 2009Tian J. Ma K. Saaem I. Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5: 14-22Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, much more work is still needed to develop these technologies to the point where they are accessible to the majority of researchers (that is, in terms of cost and reliability), and systems biology may provide important clues. For example, faster and more reliable ways to synthesize large pieces of DNA may be uncovered by examination of new organisms and thereby reveal new nonchemical methods for DNA synthesis. A second approach is to develop the methods to generate new component functions that can act as sensors, regulators, controllers, and enzyme activities, for example. These components will in turn extend the set of parts from which synthetic biologists can build genetic devices and systems. Synthetic biologists work not only with design of DNA that encodes genetic circuits but also with molecular design of biomolecules, such as RNAs and proteins, to perform new functions. Substantial efforts in the field of protein engineering have contributed to the diversity of functions exhibited by protein components (Dougherty and Arnold, 2009Dougherty M.J. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 486-491Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, even with these advances, the diversity of component activities that is currently available as parts has been limited, thus limiting the design of genetic circuits. Systems biology may aid in the development of effective strategies for generating new component functions by providing information on how Nature has evolved different functions for macromolecules. A third approach is the predictable design of complex genetic circuits that lay the foundation for new biological devices and systems. Many circuits designed and built thus far have relied on our fairly detailed knowledge of how gene transcription is regulated. For example, synthetic circuits have applied concepts of positive and negative feedback to generate systems that sense stimuli, remember past events, and promote cell death in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (Burrill and Silver, 2010Burrill D.R. Silver P.A. Cell. 2010; 140: 13-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Sprinzak and Elowitz, 2005Sprinzak D. Elowitz M.B. Nature. 2005; 438: 443-448Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, many of these systems have been built in a fairly ad hoc manner, requiring substantial troubleshooting and iterative design to exhibit desired functions, and lack the robust performance standards one might expect as an engineer. Going forward, synthetic biologists need to better understand the parts underlying system design, how to predict their function in a particular genetic context, and how to predict their integrated function with other system parts (Ellis et al., 2009Ellis T. Wang X. Collins J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, Savageau, 2011Savageau M. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2011; (Published online January 4, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-010-0220-2Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This biological understanding will then be integrated with computational models to develop computer-aided design tools. As with synthetic biology, many different types of research have been categorized as systems biology. Broadly speaking, systems biology represents an approach to biological research that focuses on the interactions between components of a biological system and how those interactions give rise to the dynamic behavior of the system in contrast to the more traditional molecular biologists' reductionist approach of studying components in isolation from each other (Alon, 2007Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits. Chapman and Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2007Google Scholar). Systems biology has been associated with new technologies and methods that allow for quantitative measures of components and component interactions within biological systems, particularly those that allow for genome-wide measurements. In addition, because many of these technologies result in large datasets, systems biology has also been associated with computational tools that support the integration and analysis of these datasets to identify static relationships and interactions between components. Finally, as one of the ultimate goals of systems biology is to be able to predict a system's dynamic behavior from the component parts, computational tools that can model biological systems-level function from underlying components are associated with this field. However, there are currently a number of challenges and limitations facing the field of systems biology. Paramount is determining how to correctly analyze and draw valid conclusions from large amounts of different types of data ranging from genomics and metabolomics to molecular dynamics in many single cells. Effectively addressing this problem may require new mathematical and computer science approaches. A second key challenge is knowing what kind of measurements to make and how accurate these measurements need to be to fully understand a biological system. Effectively addressing this challenge will require a re-evaluation of how measurements have been made over the past 10 years in systems biology (for instance, the movement from two-hybrid interactions to mass spectrometry to measure protein interactions). It will also require the development of even more sensitive strategies to make time-dependent measurements inside many cells simultaneously. Taken together, systems biology is confronted with the problem of both sensitivity and scale. Does the ultimate goal of synthetic biology of the predictable design, construction, and characterization of biological systems rely on findings and approaches from systems biology? Design, analysis, and understanding are integrally linked in engineering methodology. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that advances gained through systems biology in our understanding of how biological components interact to form integrated systems will support efforts in synthetic biology to design engineered biological systems. However, there is a different viewpoint that argues that the design principles that systems biologists elucidate for natural biological systems are products of evolution over many millions of years and thus are limited by the history of what came before. It is possible, then, that the design principles elucidated for natural biological systems may not be necessary or optimal for the engineered systems that synthetic biologists may design from scratch on a computer with less of a restriction of generating new function through evolutionary processes and timescales. Both of these views have merit, and the reality is likely somewhere in between—even if synthetic biologists design biological systems to have certain properties that are not generally found in natural systems (i.e., optimized for troubleshooting, tailoring, reuse, removal, designer identification), a greater understanding of how components interact to form integrated systems will inform and support the design process. Although synthetic biology did not directly emerge from systems biology, there are important parallels between the two fields. Both systems biology and synthetic biology represent fundamental shifts in approaches from the fields they grew out of. Whereas systems biology represents a shift in the more traditional reductionist approach taken in biological research from studying components in isolation to studying integrated components, synthetic biology represents a shift in emphasizing engineering principles and methodology in building biological systems from more traditional genetic engineering research. In addition, both fields take a bottom-up approach, with systems biology emphasizing the understanding of biological systems from the underlying components and synthetic biology emphasizing building biological systems from modular components. In examining the parallels between the two fields, it is also useful to examine how the key challenges each field is currently facing relate to one another (Figure 1). The challenges synthetic biologists currently face in engineering genetic systems can be classified as relating to either limitations in understanding biological systems or limitations in technical capabilities to study biological systems. The challenges systems biologists currently face in understanding biological systems are related to the complexities associated with studying natural biological systems and the inadequacies of current computational models to capture the physical properties of biological systems. We see several areas where these two fields can be brought together to effectively address these challenges. The richness and complexity of engineered genetic networks, which synthetic biologists could build, will be advanced by using the knowledge gained through systems biology research. For example, genome sequencing can provide an increased diversity of biological parts that synthetic biologists can use in their gene circuit designs. More importantly, systems biology will provide not just the physical parts but a fundamental understanding of how these components can be integrated effectively with other components and how biological systems integrate diverse components and regulatory mechanisms to achieve robust information transmission and behaviors. The importance of this contribution is highlighted by the limited diversity of parts and regulatory mechanisms that have been integrated into synthetic gene circuits to date, in which the majority of engineered systems rely on a limited number of transcriptional regulators and do not exhibit robust behaviors over different timescales and environmental conditions (Elowitz and Leibler, 2000Elowitz M.B. Leibler S. Nature. 2000; 403: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (3096) Google Scholar, Gardner et al., 2000Gardner T.S. Cantor C.C. Collins J.J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). In order to move toward the design of integrated genetic systems, synthetic biologists will need to design more sophisticated genetic circuits that utilize diverse regulatory strategies (specifically, the integration of posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms), balance energetic load, and dynamically modulate system behavior (Lim, 2010Lim W.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Win et al., 2009Win M.N. Liang J.C. Smolke C.D. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 298-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Another important contribution of systems biology to synthetic biology is associated with the technologies and tools for analyzing biological systems. Synthetic biologists often spend the bulk of their effort in a design, characterization, and optimization loop, where original designs are modified based on characterization data to achieve the desired system behavior. The tools developed by systems biologists to study components in a system and their interactions can be applied to analyzing synthetic systems and troubleshooting the system performance. This is particularly true in cases in which the synthetic gene network may have unanticipated effects on native pathways in the cell that may in turn affect system behavior. A common example of this challenge can arise in engineering metabolic pathways, for which synthetic biologists can use genome-wide profiling of transcript, protein, or metabolite levels to identify undesired effects of introducing the synthetic pathway in the host cell on critical functions such as redox balance, cofactor levels, and stress response (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2008Mukhopadhyay A. Redding A.M. Rutherford B.J. Keasling J.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2008; 19: 228-234Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As another example, systems biologists have developed a variety of computational tools for modeling biological systems and sharing information on biological components across different databases. These tools will be useful foundations for synthetic biologists looking to develop methods to standardize and share information across component libraries and develop computer-aided design tools for biological systems. Advances in synthetic biology will provide key contributions to systems biology research by creating new tools for interfacing with and manipulating biological systems. Research aimed at understanding a biological system often utilizes methods to perturb or manipulate that system and examine the resulting behavior of the modified system. Synthetic biologists are developing novel genetic devices that can be used by systems biologists to interface with native networks and precisely probe and manipulate those systems. For example, synthetic genetic devices have recently been used to rewire signaling pathways and create novel interactions between unrelated cellular components (Culler et al., 2010Culler S.J. Hoff K.G. Smolke C.D. Science. 2010; 330: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, Lim, 2010Lim W.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, synthetic biology can contribute strategies for simplifying and isolating biological components and their interactions through the application of diverse approaches for implementing specific component interactions. Synthetic biology can also provide new simulation platforms for systems biology. For example, systems biologists currently develop mathematical models to represent the behavior of their systems and use these models to predict the behavior of their systems under different perturbations and environments. However, the development of these models often requires assumptions that are imperfect matches for the physical model of a cell (i.e., hard sphere, dilute gas models), such that the ability of current computational models to capture system behavior is limited at best. The potential advances in constructing genetic systems coming from synthetic biology research may enable systems biologists to shift from computational models to physical models for their systems by implementing simulations inside of cells. Specifically, scalable and affordable DNA synthesis technology can allow systems biologists to build many modified versions of natural systems to test their understanding of those systems. Moving forward, the synergy between synthetic and systems biology will drive transformative advances in biotechnology. The impact includes not only further understanding of the complexity of biological systems but the ability to use this information to, for instance, design better drugs, commodity manufacturing processes, and cell-based therapies (Ducat et al., 2011Ducat D.C. Way J.C. Silver P.A. Trends Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). As one example, the complexity of biosynthesis processes that can be engineered has been recently advanced through the integration of a number of pathway construction and optimization tools, including genomic discovery and engineering (Bayer et al., 2009Bayer T.S.

Future efforts will focus on the development of more advanced tools for bioprocess optimization, such as those enabling noninvasive monitoring of pathway flux (Win and Smolke, 2007Win M.N. Smolke C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14283-14288Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar), closed loop embedded control of biosynthesis system behavior (Dunlop et al., 2010Dunlop M.J.

Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 533-537Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and biosynthesis compartmentalization and specialization. As another example, systems engineering strategies will play key roles in addressing current challenges in cellular therapies by enabling the programming of cell-fate decisions (Culler et al., 2010Culler S.J. Hoff K.G. Smolke C.D. Science. 2010; 330: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), differentiated states (Deans et al., 2007Deans T.L. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J.

Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 8531-8536Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and effective kill switches (Callura et al., 2010Callura J.M. Dwyer D.J. Isaacs F.J. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 15898-15903Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Ultimately, researchers will design systems that incorporate evolution—designing gene circuits that exhibit desired, evolvable behaviors and eventually constructing ecosystems that exhibit dynamic and predictable behavior patterns. However, it is important to look at history in thinking about the promises and risks of synthetic biology. Molecular biology, and in particular the insertion of foreign genes into microbes, was met with circumspection by both the public and scientific communities. At the time, scientists made promises to the public—for example, the production of human insulin by engineered bacteria—and delivered on at least some of these promises (Villa-Komaroff et al., 1978Villa-Komaroff L. Efstradiadis A. Broome S. Lomedico P. Tizard R. Naber S.P. Chick W.L. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 3727-3731Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). So, what can we expect from the interplay between systems biology and synthetic biology in the near and long term? In the near term, we have already seen companies promise to deliver on new fuels and carbon-based products (such as plastics), and in 5 years time this will be a partial reality, thereby starting to take petroleum out of the production loop. We believe that, in 10 years time, many high-value commodities, including drugs, will be produced biologically as the result of synthetic biology efforts. In the much longer time frame of 20 to 50 years, we hope that synthetic biology will lead to new cell-based therapies, the expansion of immunotherapy, synthetic organs and tissues, and rebuilding devastated environments and ecosystems. These anticipated futures bring us to the controversial areas in synthetic biology. How do we think about a future that could involve the reprogramming of entire organisms? Should we consider engineering ecosystems to support sustainable agriculture, environmental remediation, and pathogen removal and to treat human disease? How far should and can we go in reprogramming life to form new types of cells, tissues, and entire organisms? These are only some of the potential benefits and questions scientists, engineers, policy makers, governments, and, most importantly, the public will need to ponder. Molecular biologists set standards for safe use of engineered organisms over 30 years ago. However, as research in synthetic biology is advancing toward the goals of making biology easier to engineer, the issues of safety and ethical use are being revisited as we write this Essay. In fact, a recent US government report captures many of the critical issues around public benefits and responsible stewardship (Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, 2010Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. (2010). http://www.bioethics.gov/.Google Scholar). Although each field could in principle exist without the other, we instead feel that the natural interplay between design, analysis, and understanding highlights the important relationship between systems biology and synthetic biology. Systems biology brings added layers of information that will further empower future efforts to design synthetic biological systems. Synthetic biology brings new technologies and tools that can be applied to effectively test our understanding of natural biological systems. By integrating the contributions of these rapidly evolving fields, scientists and engineers together will be well positioned to transform health, well-being, and the environment in the years to come.

https://openalex.org/W1996408717,"Glycoprotein D (gD-2) is the entry receptor of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and is the immunogen in the pharmaceutical industry's lead HSV-2 vaccine candidate. Efforts to prevent genital herpes using gD-2 subunit vaccines have been ongoing for 20 years at a cost in excess of $100 million. To date, gD-2 vaccines have yielded equivocal protection in clinical trials. Therefore, using a small animal model, we sought to determine if a live-attenuated HSV-2 ICP0− virus would elicit better protection against genital herpes than a gD-2 subunit vaccine. Mice immunized with gD-2 and a potent adjuvant (alum+monophosphoryl lipid A) produced high titers of gD-2 antibody. While gD-2-immunized mice possessed significant resistance to HSV-2, only 3 of 45 gD-2-immunized mice survived an overwhelming challenge of the vagina or eyes with wild-type HSV-2 (MS strain). In contrast, 114 of 115 mice immunized with a live HSV-2 ICP0− virus, 0ΔNLS, survived the same HSV-2 MS challenges. Likewise, 0ΔNLS-immunized mice shed an average 125-fold less HSV-2 MS challenge virus per vagina relative to gD-2-immunized mice. In vivo imaging demonstrated that a luciferase-expressing HSV-2 challenge virus failed to establish a detectable infection in 0ΔNLS-immunized mice, whereas the same virus readily infected naïve and gD-2-immunized mice. Collectively, these results suggest that a HSV-2 vaccine might be more likely to prevent genital herpes if it contained a live-attenuated HSV-2 virus rather than a single HSV-2 protein."

https://openalex.org/W2000225518,"In human embryogenesis, loss of SRY (sex determining region on Y), SOX9 (SRY-related HMG box 9) or SF1 (steroidogenic factor 1) function causes disorders of sex development (DSD). A defining event of vertebrate sex determination is male-specific upregulation and maintenance of SOX9 expression in gonadal pre-Sertoli cells, which is preceded by transient SRY expression in mammals. In mice, Sox9 regulation is under the transcriptional control of SRY, SF1 and SOX9 via a conserved testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 (TES). Regulation of SOX9 in human sex determination is however poorly understood.We show that a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (NT2/D1) can model events in presumptive Sertoli cells that initiate human sex determination. SRY associates with transcriptionally active chromatin in NT2/D1 cells and over-expression increases endogenous SOX9 expression. SRY and SF1 co-operate to activate the human SOX9 homologous TES (hTES), a process dependent on phosphorylated SF1. SOX9 also activates hTES, augmented by SF1, suggesting a mechanism for maintenance of SOX9 expression by auto-regulation. Analysis of mutant SRY, SF1 and SOX9 proteins encoded by thirteen separate 46,XY DSD gonadal dysgenesis individuals reveals a reduced ability to activate hTES.We demonstrate how three human sex-determining factors are likely to function during gonadal development around SOX9 as a hub gene, with different genetic causes of 46,XY DSD due a common failure to upregulate SOX9 transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2095024221,"The Clostridium perfringens ε-toxin is an extremely potent toxin associated with lethal toxemias in domesticated ruminants and may be toxic to humans. Intoxication results in fluid accumulation in various tissues, most notably in the brain and kidneys. Previous studies suggest that the toxin is a pore-forming toxin, leading to dysregulated ion homeostasis and ultimately cell death. However, mammalian host factors that likely contribute to ε-toxin-induced cytotoxicity are poorly understood. A library of insertional mutant Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which are highly susceptible to the lethal affects of ε-toxin, was used to select clones of cells resistant to ε-toxin-induced cytotoxicity. The genes mutated in 9 surviving resistant cell clones were identified. We focused additional experiments on one of the identified genes as a means of validating the experimental approach. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that one of the identified genes, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1, KIM-1, TIM1), is more abundantly expressed in human kidney cell lines than it is expressed in human cells known to be resistant to ε-toxin. One human kidney cell line, ACHN, was found to be sensitive to the toxin and expresses a larger isoform of the HAVCR1 protein than the HAVCR1 protein expressed by other, toxin-resistant human kidney cell lines. RNA interference studies in MDCK and in ACHN cells confirmed that HAVCR1 contributes to ε-toxin-induced cytotoxicity. Additionally, ε-toxin was shown to bind to HAVCR1 in vitro. The results of this study indicate that HAVCR1 and the other genes identified through the use of gene-trap mutagenesis and RNA interference strategies represent important targets for investigation of the process by which ε-toxin induces cell death and new targets for potential therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W1993935651,"Background Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are essential key players during embryonic development. Through their specific cognate receptors (FGFR) they activate intracellular cascades, finely regulated by modulators such as Sprouty. Several FGF ligands (FGF1, 2, 7, 9, 10 and 18) signaling through the four known FGFRs, have been implicated in lung morphogenesis. Although much is known about mammalian lung, so far, the avian model has not been explored for lung studies. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we provide the first description of fgf10, fgfr1-4 and spry2 expression patterns in early stages of chick lung development by in situ hybridization and observe that they are expressed similarly to their mammalian counterparts. Furthermore, aiming to determine a role for FGF signaling in chick lung development, in vitro FGFR inhibition studies were performed. Lung explants treated with an FGF receptor antagonist (SU5402) presented an impairment of secondary branch formation after 48 h of culture; moreover, abnormal lung growth with a cystic appearance of secondary bronchi and reduction of the mesenchymal tissue was observed. Branching and morphometric analysis of lung explants confirmed that FGFR inhibition impaired branching morphogenesis and induced a significant reduction of the mesenchyme. Conclusions/Significance This work demonstrates that FGFRs are essential for the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that determine epithelial branching and mesenchymal growth and validate the avian embryo as a good model for pulmonary studies, namely to explore the FGF pathway as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2115143804,"To address whether sequences of viral gag and env quasispecies collected during the early post-acute period can be utilized to determine multiplicity of transmitted HIV's, recently developed approaches for analysis of viral evolution in acute HIV-1 infection [1], [2] were applied. Specifically, phylogenetic reconstruction, inter- and intra-patient distribution of maximum and mean genetic distances, analysis of Poisson fitness, shape of highlighter plots, recombination analysis, and estimation of time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were utilized for resolving multiplicity of HIV-1 transmission in a set of viral quasispecies collected within 50 days post-seroconversion (p/s) in 25 HIV-infected individuals with estimated time of seroconversion. The decision on multiplicity of HIV infection was made based on the model's fit with, or failure to explain, the observed extent of viral sequence heterogeneity. The initial analysis was based on phylogeny, inter-patient distribution of maximum and mean distances, and Poisson fitness, and was able to resolve multiplicity of HIV transmission in 20 of 25 (80%) cases. Additional analysis involved distribution of individual viral distances, highlighter plots, recombination analysis, and estimation of tMRCA, and resolved 4 of the 5 remaining cases. Overall, transmission of a single viral variant was identified in 16 of 25 (64%) cases, and transmission of multiple variants was evident in 8 of 25 (32%) cases. In one case multiplicity of HIV-1 transmission could not be determined. In primary HIV-1 subtype C infection, samples collected within 50 days p/s and analyzed by a single-genome amplification/sequencing technique can provide reliable identification of transmission multiplicity in 24 of 25 (96%) cases. Observed transmission frequency of a single viral variant and multiple viral variants were within the ranges of 64% to 68%, and 32% to 36%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1973097392,"Background Reliable estimates of disease burden associated with respiratory viruses are keys to deployment of preventive strategies such as vaccination and resource allocation. Such estimates are particularly needed in tropical and subtropical regions where some methods commonly used in temperate regions are not applicable. While a number of alternative approaches to assess the influenza associated disease burden have been recently reported, none of these models have been validated with virologically confirmed data. Even fewer methods have been developed for other common respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza and adenovirus. Methods and Findings We had recently conducted a prospective population-based study of virologically confirmed hospitalization for acute respiratory illnesses in persons <18 years residing in Hong Kong Island. Here we used this dataset to validate two commonly used models for estimation of influenza disease burden, namely the rate difference model and Poisson regression model, and also explored the applicability of these models to estimate the disease burden of other respiratory viruses. The Poisson regression models with different link functions all yielded estimates well correlated with the virologically confirmed influenza associated hospitalization, especially in children older than two years. The disease burden estimates for RSV, parainfluenza and adenovirus were less reliable with wide confidence intervals. The rate difference model was not applicable to RSV, parainfluenza and adenovirus and grossly underestimated the true burden of influenza associated hospitalization. Conclusion The Poisson regression model generally produced satisfactory estimates in calculating the disease burden of respiratory viruses in a subtropical region such as Hong Kong."
https://openalex.org/W2142114640,"The remarkably safe anesthetics xenon (Xe) and, to lesser extent, nitrous oxide (N2O) possess neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. To investigate the mechanisms of pharmacological action of these gases, which are still poorly known, we performed both crystallography under a large range of gas pressure and biochemical studies on urate oxidase, a prototype of globular gas-binding proteins whose activity is modulated by inert gases. We show that Xe and N2O bind to, compete for, and expand the volume of a hydrophobic cavity located just behind the active site of urate oxidase and further inhibit urate oxidase enzymatic activity. By demonstrating a significant relationship between the binding and biochemical effects of Xe and N2O, given alone or in combination, these data from structure to function highlight the mechanisms by which chemically and metabolically inert gases can alter protein function and produce their pharmacological effects. Interestingly, the effects of a Xe:N2O equimolar mixture were found to be equivalent to those of Xe alone, thereby suggesting that gas mixtures containing Xe and N2O could be an alternative and efficient neuroprotective strategy to Xe alone, whose widespread clinical use is limited due to the cost of production and availability of this gas.—Marassio, G., Prangé, T., David, H.

https://openalex.org/W2076157177,"Cell-cell adhesion in simple epithelia involves the engagement of E-cadherin and nectins, and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics by Rho GTPases, particularly Rac1. However, it remains unclear whether E-cadherin and nectins up-regulate, maintain or suppress Rac1 activity during cell-cell adhesion. Roles for Rho GTPases are complicated by cell spreading and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix that occur concurrently with cell-cell adhesion, and which also require Rho GTPases. Here, we designed a simple approach to examine Rac1 activity upon cell-cell adhesion by MDCK epithelial cells, without cell spreading or integrin-based adhesion. Upon initiation of cell-cell contact in 3-D cell aggregates, we observed an initial peak of Rac1 activity that rapidly decreased by ∼66% within 5 minutes, and further decreased to a low baseline level after 30 minutes. Inhibition of E-cadherin engagement with DECMA-1 Fab fragments or competitive binding of soluble E-cadherin, or nectin2alpha extracellular domain completely inhibited Rac1 activity. These results indicate that cadherins and nectins cooperate to induce and then rapidly suppress Rac1 activity during initial cell-cell adhesion, which may be important in inhibiting the migratory cell phenotype and allowing the establishment of initially weak cell-cell adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2055536175,"Extra-cellular adenosine is an important regulator of inflammatory responses. It is generated from released ATP by a cascade of ectoenzymes and degraded by adenosine deaminase (ADA). There are two types of enzymes with ADA activity: ADA1 and ADGF/ADA2. ADA2 activity originates from macrophages and dendritic cells and is associated with inflammatory responses in humans and rats. Drosophila possesses a family of six ADGF proteins with ADGF-A being the main regulator of extra-cellular adenosine during larval stages. Herein we present the generation of a GFP reporter for ADGF-A expression by a precise replacement of the ADGF-A coding sequence with GFP using homologous recombination. We show that the reporter is specifically expressed in aggregating hemocytes (Drosophila immune cells) forming melanotic capsules; a characteristic of inflammatory response. Our vital reporter thus confirms ADA expression in sites of inflammation in vivo and demonstrates that the requirement for ADA activity during inflammatory response is evolutionary conserved from insects to vertebrates. Our results also suggest that ADA activity is achieved specifically within sites of inflammation by an uncharacterized post-transcriptional regulation based mechanism. Utilizing various mutants that induce melanotic capsule formation and also a real immune challenge provided by parasitic wasps, we show that the acute expression of the ADGF-A protein is not driven by one specific signaling cascade but is rather associated with the behavior of immune cells during the general inflammatory response. Connecting the exclusive expression of ADGF-A within sites of inflammation, as presented here, with the release of energy stores when the ADGF-A activity is absent, suggests that extra-cellular adenosine may function as a signal for energy allocation during immune response and that ADGF-A/ADA2 expression in such sites of inflammation may regulate this role."
https://openalex.org/W2101240979,"Prenatal exposure to mercury causes neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological pathologies in infants, such as microcephaly and mental retardation. Despite critical importance, the molecular interactions leading to mercury toxicity are yet to be elucidated. We first used a cell-free assay to investigate mercury effects on purified γ-secretase activity. Next, we treated adult Drosophila melanogaster with mercury and collected control and mercury-treated embryos, which were subjected to mild hypotonic protein extraction, or immunostained to reveal nervous system morphology. Embryos left to develop into adults were examined for wing phenotypes. Relative to control metals, we found that mercury strongly inhibits in vitro γ-secretase processing of both amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and Notch. Mercury inhibited APP and Notch cleavage in a dose-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 50-125 nM, and is therefore comparable in potency to benchmark γ-secretase inhibitors. Immunoblot analysis of embryonic protein extracts showed that mercury inhibits Notch cleavage by γ-secretase in vivo. This is accompanied by severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities in embryos and adult wing-notching phenotypes. Our findings provide first evidence that mercury is a direct and potent γ-secretase inhibitor and suggest that inhibition of γ-secretase and disruption of the Notch developmental pathway potentially contribute to mercury-induced toxicity in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2141058339,"Systems approaches to biology are steadily widening their reach, but the road to integration and acceptance has been fraught with skepticism and technical hurdles. Interdisciplinary research teams at systems biology centers around the globe are working to win over the critics. Systems approaches to biology are steadily widening their reach, but the road to integration and acceptance has been fraught with skepticism and technical hurdles. Interdisciplinary research teams at systems biology centers around the globe are working to win over the critics. In 2008, the US National Research Council (NRC) appointed a panel of 16 leading biologists and engineers to determine how biology could best capitalize on the wellspring of technical advancements inundating the field. Led by Nobel laureate Philip Sharp, the committee published its findings a year later, calling for a “new biology” that would incorporate physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering, and mathematics. “Biological research is in the midst of a revolutionary change due to the integration of powerful technologies,” declares their report Biology in the 21st. Systems biology, which involves building mathematical models of living processes, sits at the heart of this new paradigm. Systems approaches have been discussed and attempted for almost a century (see Essay by Arkin and Schaffer on page 844 of this issue). But in the late 1990s, a torrent of genomics data, together with the availability of unprecedented computing power, led Leroy Hood, founder of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, and Hiroaki Kitano, a computer scientist with Sony Corporation, to propose a new, integrative “systems biology.” Like the recent blueprint from Sharp's panel, this systems biology would draw on physics, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science to better understand life. Over the past decade, major funding agencies around the world have been backing projects and programs devoted specifically to systems biology, and countless biologists have started applying system approaches into their research. But systems biology's assimilation into the biology mainstream is still a work in progress, and the road to acceptance has been bumpier than proponents anticipated. In essence, Hood and Kitano were advocating a paradigm shift in how biological research is performed. “We're looking at a period of evolution in how biology is done,” says Adrianno Henney, director of the Germany's largest systems biology project, the Virtual Liver Network. Currently, “systems biology is in a period of awkward adolescence, he says. Biologists still differ sharply over what the emphasis of systems biology ought to be and on its place within the wider world of biology. Additionally, some researchers still question the approach's validity. And even Henney admits that systems biology “has not had that many real success stories” so far. Others disagree and claim clear successes for systems-based approaches. For example, Denis Noble, co-director of computational physiology at the University of Oxford, attributes the development of two successful angina treatments, Ivabradine and Ranolazine, to systems approaches used in his laboratory since the 1960s, including a computer-based model of cardiac cells' electrical rhythms. But there's no question that integrative systems biology has proven tough to implement. Mathematical modeling has its natural home in fields of engineering, such as jet engine design, in which basic parameters (e.g., temperature and pressure) are readily measurable and their relationships well-established through the laws of thermodynamics. In contrast, the basic parameters of a biological system are hard to measure, vary over disparate timescales and often reside in a noisy milieu of irrelevant signals. Thus, our global picture of how these components interact is often incomplete. And the mathematics required to model such a complex network is not part of most university biology curricula. “I'd be the first to admit that the complexities [of biological systems] are horrific,” says Noble. “And I don't oppose the reductionist paradigm. I just say that it has to be complemented by an integrative paradigm.” He believes that even the most committed reductionists are coming around to this perspective. The toughness of systems approaches has constrained the field's growth, says Kitano. He started the annual International Society of Systems Biology meeting in 2000. It drew 800 attendees in 2004 and 1200 last year. “Genomics exploded, because if you buy a sequencing machine, anyone can do it,” he says. “But having to combine good biology with good mathematical modeling isn't easy.” Kitano says that Japan's two major public funding agencies, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), are supporting systems biology programs. He estimates their total annual investment in related fields at $30–$50 million but says that it “hasn't grown as much as I would wish.” This picture in Japan reflects the global pattern: a large and increasing number of cell biologists, immunologists, and other biologists are incorporating systems approaches into their work, but the cadre of researchers expressly devoted to systems biology remains relatively small. But Hood is working to expand that cadre, having built up the world's largest center explicitly dedicated to systems biology research. The Institute for Systems Biology (ISB)—set up independently in 2000, when the University of Washington refused to host it—now has 300 staff and an annual budget of some $50 million. In April, it will occupy a 140,000 square foot complex, with the intention of further expansion. Hood believes that real systems biology requires this kind of concentrated, multidisciplinary effort. But what matters most of all, he says, “is that systems biology is driven by biology, not by computation.” Some scientists have been too reliant on fancy mathematical models, often borrowed from other disciplines, he says. “We need to create models that are predictive and adaptive,” he explains. “Most of the mathematical models out there aren't worth a hill of beans.” To remedy the situation, Hood argues that biology needs more institutes established and equipped specifically for systems biology, such as the Broad Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, ETH Zurich, and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. The ISB is currently spreading its wings internationally by helping the government of Luxembourg set up Europe's best-resourced institute for systems biology. Headed by German geneticist Rudi Balling, the Luxembourg Center for Systems Biomedicine will have an annual budget of ∼$20 million. Still, public money for systems biology research remains far more plentiful in the United States than elsewhere around the globe. The Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences has an annual budget of $120 million, and a large majority of this funding goes to systems biology research, says its director, Karin Remington. That includes $35 million to support a dozen systems biology centers at universities. Additional centers are supported by other NIH institutes, including the National Cancer Institute. Considerably more money goes to systems biology projects through mainstream principal investigator grants. But as Remington and others point out, quantifying the total systems funding is essentially arbitrary because it depends on which projects are regarded as taking a systems approach. The US Department of Energy says that it spent $90 million last year on systems biology through its genomic science program. This number doesn't include its support for many facilities that apply systems approaches, such as the Joint Genome Institute at Walnut Creek, California. The National Science Foundation also has several systems programs, including the $50 million iPlant Collaborative for computational plant biology, based at the University of Arizona at Tucson. In Europe, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) has provided the strongest support for systems biology. Early on, German policymakers decided to focus on the study of liver cells. The approach has now evolved into the Virtual Liver Network, which aims to model the whole organ. Overall, BMBF is spending about E50 million annually to fund nine major systems biology initiatives, including the Liver Network, which involves 69 research groups across Germany. In the UK, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) has led the systems biology effort, spending £50 million since 2004 to establish six centers at UK universities, each with a different emphasis. These centers were given 5 year, nonrenewable grants that will expire this year. The BBSRC has supported another series of systems projects to the tune of £23 million over 5 years. And, according to Colin Miles, BBSRC's head of molecular and cell biology, the council is also supporting ∼100 standard grants in systems biology, worth a total of £13 million annually. There has been less organized support for systems biology from the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council in the UK. Jim Smith, director of the MRC's intramural labs and head of its small systems biology division, takes a cautious line on the field's potential. He says that development of tools needed to measure parameters, such as the tension of a particular cell substrate, is the first step in a long road to making systems biology work. One nation that has worked hard to establish a presence in the field is Switzerland. In 2008, a special decree from their parliament established the SystemX initiative, a 4 year, SwF 100 million program headed by Rudolf Aebersold of ETZ Zurich. According to Aebersold, SystemX involves 11 partner institutions in 14 main projects, ranging in scope from measurement technologies and modeling methods to mechanisms of signaling networks, such as those in yeast metabolism. Aebersold says that he doesn't underestimate the difficulty of modeling biological systems. “The number of degrees of freedom is one thing; the systems are also much noisier, they have not been engineered. Every element that we look at comes along with a lot of historical baggage. And things are tightly interlinked in ways that we don't yet understand.” Most researchers who have chosen to specialize in systems biology agree with Hood that a large-scale, integrative, multidisciplinary approach is needed for systems biology to flourish. This means that funding agencies must continue to support these dedicated centers and programs. “You can't just graft it onto cell or molecular biology,” Hood says. Still though, skeptics remain. Molecular biologist Sydney Brenner, for example, says that research money would be better spent on more detailed, reductionist studies of biology until we better understand how the genome programs the cell. “Eventually, that's what you have to explain,” Brenner says. “I don't want to stop these guys. But I don't like the sort of religion that says there is a simple path to heaven.” On balance, however, an increasingly integrative approach to biology seems inevitable, not so much because we know it will work, but because there is no alternative. The weaknesses of narrower approaches that rely on only one class of data, such as genome-wide association studies, and the limitations of the traditional, reductionist approach are obvious. Models of the cellular networks—imperfect as they may be—offer a route forward. The union of biology and mathematics may be a shotgun wedding, but maybe once its offspring walk and talk, initial misgivings will fade."

The immune response and inflammatory processes contribute to the pathophysiology. Hence, the anti-inflammatory dexamethasone is advocated as adjuvant treatment although its clinical efficacy remains a question at issue. In experimental models of pneumococcal meningitis, dexamethasone increased neuronal damage in the dentate gyrus. Here, we investigated expressional changes in the hippocampus and cortex at 72 h after infection when dexamethasone was given to infant rats with pneumococcal meningitis. Nursing Wistar rats were intracisternally infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae to induce experimental meningitis or were sham-infected with pyrogen-free saline. Besides antibiotics, animals were either treated with dexamethasone or saline. Expressional changes were assessed by the use of GeneChip® Rat Exon 1.0 ST Arrays and quantitative real-time PCR. Protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cytokines and chemokines were evaluated in immunoassays using Luminex xMAP® technology. In infected animals, 213 and 264 genes were significantly regulated by dexamethasone in the hippocampus and cortex respectively. Separately for the cortex and the hippocampus, Gene Ontology analysis identified clusters of biological processes which were assigned to the predefined categories “inflammation”, “growth”, “apoptosis” and others. Dexamethasone affected the expression of genes and protein levels of chemokines reflecting diminished activation of microglia. Dexamethasone-induced changes of genes related to apoptosis suggest the downregulation of the Akt-survival pathway and the induction of caspase-independent apoptosis. Signalling of pro-neurogenic pathways such as transforming growth factor pathway was reduced by dexamethasone resulting in a lack of pro-survival triggers. The anti-inflammatory properties of dexamethasone were observed on gene and protein level in experimental pneumococcal meningitis. Further dexamethasone-induced expressional changes reflect an increase of pro-apoptotic signals and a decrease of pro-neurogenic processes. The findings may help to identify potential mechanisms leading to apoptosis by dexamethasone in experimental pneumococcal meningitis."
https://openalex.org/W2044678354,"Each year, during winter months, human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) is associated with epidemics of bronchiolitis resulting in the hospitalization of many infants. Bronchiolitis is an acute illness of the lower respiratory tract with a consequent inflammation of the bronchioles. The rapid onset of inflammation suggests the innate immune response may have a role to play in the pathogenesis of this hMPV infection. Since, the matrix protein is one of the most abundant proteins in the Paramyxoviridae family virion, we hypothesized that the inflammatory modulation observed in hMPV infected patients may be partly associated with the matrix protein (M-hMPV) response. By western blot analysis, we detected a soluble form of M-hMPV released from hMPV infected cell as well as from M-hMPV transfected HEK 293T cells suggesting that M-hMPV may be directly in contact with antigen presenting cells (APCs) during the course of infection. Moreover, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy allowed determining that M-hMPV was taken up by dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages inducing their activation. Furthermore, these moDCs enter into a maturation process inducing the secretion of a broad range of inflammatory cytokines when exposed to M-hMPV. Additionally, M-hMPV activated DCs were shown to stimulate IL-2 and IFN-γ production by allogeneic T lymphocytes. This M-hMPV-mediated activation and antigen presentation of APCs may in part explain the marked inflammatory immune response observed in pathology induced by hMPV in patients."

https://openalex.org/W2051191696,"The vast majority of decision-making research is performed under the assumption of the value maximizing principle. This principle implies that when making decisions, individuals try to optimize outcomes on the basis of cold mathematical equations. However, decisions are emotion-laden rather than cool and analytic when they tap into life-threatening considerations. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying vital loss decisions. Participants were asked to make a forced choice between two losses across three conditions: both losses are trivial (trivial-trivial), both losses are vital (vital-vital), or one loss is trivial and the other is vital (vital-trivial). Our results revealed that the amygdala was more active and correlated positively with self-reported negative emotion associated with choice during vital-vital loss decisions, when compared to trivial-trivial loss decisions. The rostral anterior cingulate cortex was also more active and correlated positively with self-reported difficulty of choice during vital-vital loss decisions. Compared to the activity observed during trivial-trivial loss decisions, the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum were more active and correlated positively with self-reported positive emotion of choice during vital-trivial loss decisions. Our findings suggest that vital loss decisions involve emotions and cannot be adequately captured by cold computation of minimizing losses. This research will shed light on how people make vital loss decisions."
