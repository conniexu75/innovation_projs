https://openalex.org/W2080185465,A 44 amino acid peptide with growth hormone-releasing activity has been isolated from a human tumor of the pancreas that had caused acromegaly. The primary structure of the tumor-derived peptide is H-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Ala-Ile-Phe-Thr-Asn-Ser-Tyr-Arg-Lys-Val-Leu-Gly-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ala- Arg-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Asp-Ile-Met-Ser-Arg-Gln-Gln-Gly-Glu-Ser-Asn-Gln-Glu-Arg-Gly -Ala-Arg-Ala-Arg-Leu-NH2. The synthetic replicate has full biological activity in vitro and in vivo specifically to stimulate the secretion of immunoreactive growth hormone. The tumor-derived peptide is identical in biological activity and similar in physiochemical properties to the still uncharacterized growth hormone-releasing factor present in extracts of hypothalamic tissues.

The protein migrated with an apparent molecular size of 27,000 to 30,000 daltons in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The resistance of this protein to digestion by proteinase K distinguished it from proteins of similar molecular weight found in normal hamster brain. Initial results suggest that the amount of this protein correlates with the titer of the agent."
https://openalex.org/W2169058508,"Deletion mutants of the Drosophila hsp 70 heat-shock gene have been assayed in COS cells using a vector that contains an SV40 replication origin. COS cells are SV40-transformed monkey cells that support high-level replication of the vector. S1 mapping of transcripts shows that the hsp 70 gene is heat-inducible in these cells, whereas the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene is not. Residues -10 to -66 of the hsp 70 gene are apparently sufficient for heat-inducible promotion, and residues between -47 and -66 are necessary. This region upstream of the TATA box contains sequence features common to other heat-shock genes. Expression of the hsp 70 gene can be forced at low temperature by SV40 sequences that include the 72 bp repeat, but only if these are present on the 5' side of the gene. It seems that the upstream element of the hsp 70 promoter is analogous to that of other promoters, but is only functional in heat-shocked cells."

https://openalex.org/W2099070975,"Nucleoplasmin is the most abundant protein of the nucleus of Xenopus laevis oocytes. It rapidly enters the nucleus after being injected into oocyte cytoplasm. Partial proteolysis of the nucleoplasmin pentamer reveals two structural domains within each subunit: a relatively exposed “tail” and a protected “core.” When all the “tails” have been removed from the pentamer the residual “core” remains pentameric. This pentameric core fails to enter the nucleus, remaining stably in the cytoplasm. A single tail region attached to the pentamer is sufficient to transport it into the nucleus. The rate of accumulation in the nucleus, but not its final extent, depends on the number of tails per pentamer. The detached (monomeric) tails rapidly accumulate in the oocyte nucleus, indicating that the tail structure is sufficient for selective accumulation. Pentameric cores diffuse throughout the nucleus but are retained when microinjected into the nucleus, indicating that the tail is necessary for entry but not for retention within the nucleus. An improved method for purification of nucleoplasmin is also described."

These fields were assessed by means of recently developed neuromagnetometric techniques. Surface measurements of magnetic spike field strength in the region of the focus appear sufficient to establish the location, depth, orientation, and polarity of currents underlying the paroxysmal discharge."

Acta 602, 207-212) to rapidly measure intracellular transport of cholesterol from the site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. This transport process is rapid, with a half-time of about 10 min, has different kinetics from that of intracellular glycoprotein transport, and appears to be energy-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W1515916437,"Treatment of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with the trifunctional alkylating agent 2,3-5-tris(ethyleneimino)benzoquinone-1,4 (triaziquonum) led to rapid fragmentation of DNA and depletion of NAD while poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activity showed a retarded increase. Poly(ADP-ribosyl) residues in treated cells increased 4- to 30-fold, but transiently, and in a dose-dependent manner, exhibiting the same initial kinetics as the loss of NAD and the appearance of DNA strand breaks when determined by the nucleoid method. Although the amounts of activated groups present in the substrate NAD (80 nmol/10(8) cells) exceeded by far basal and triaziquonum-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl) groups (up to 250 pmol/10(8) cells), accelerated formation of the polymer, nevertheless, may explain at least partially the loss of NAD seen under these conditions. Addition of benzamide, a potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, to triaziquonum-treated cells effected an immediate drop of poly(ADP-ribose) to basal values. The data indicate a biphasic decay, the half-life of greater than 85% of the polymeric ADP-ribosyl groups exhibiting a t1/2 less than 1 min under these conditions, while the residual fraction died away with t1/2 approximately 6 min. Treatment with the DNA fragmenting agent also led to a 9-fold increase of nuclear mono(ADP-ribosyl) groups, while cytoplasmic mono(ADP-ribosyl) protein conjugates were not significantly affected. The apparent half-life of nuclear mono (ADP-ribosyl) protein conjugates (8-10 min) at peak elevation was definitely longer than that of poly(ADP-ribosyl) residues. This result is consistent with the interpretation that accumulation of mono(ADP-ribosyl) groups is due to a retarded removal of the primary ADP-ribosyl group from the acceptor protein by a separate mono(ADP-ribosyl) protein glycohydrolase, being the rate-limiting step in the overall turnover of poly(ADP-ribosyl) residues."
https://openalex.org/W1539168006,"An assay based on the fluorescent compound 2',7'-([bis(carboxymethyl)amino]methyl) fluorescein (calcein) has been developed to investigate vesicle fusion and lysis. The assay involves encapsulating the nonfluorescent Co2+ complex of calcein in one set of vesicles and EDTA in a second set. If fusion occurs, EDTA chelates Co2+, releasing calcein which may be assayed by means of its intense fluorescence. Leakage of either component of the reaction can be directly quantitated by titrating the external medium with the other component. This assay was used to investigate the effects of calcium ion on small phosphatidylserine vesicles, a system reported to undergo fusion. It revealed immediate and extensive leakage of the encapsulated contents; membrane fusion must, therefore, be simultaneously with or subsequent to, loss of vesicle integrity. This assay is convenient and flexible; it should be useful in a variety of investigations of membrane-bounded compartments."

https://openalex.org/W2097111479,"We investigated the requirements of the carboxyterminal sequence for surface expression of the influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA). Deletions in the cloned hemagglutinin gene were introduced at locations upstream from and spanning into the region that codes for the hydrophobic carboxyl terminus. Primate cells infected with recombinants of the deleted HA gene and an SV40 vector were negative for surface immunofluorescence and failed to adsorb erythrocytes. Polypeptide analysis showed that the mutant hemagglutinins lacking the normal hydrophobic carboxy-terminal sequences were secreted into the medium. These data provide evidence that these sequences of the influenza hemagglutinin are responsible for accumulation at the cell surface. During infection with each deletion mutant, a truncated HA polypeptide was found intracellularly. Both intracellular and extracellular HAs were glycosylated, since a third species representing the unglycosylated mutant hemagglutinin was detected in the presence of tunicamycin. Interestingly, the secreted and intracellular mutant HA polypeptides differ from the surface HA in their sensitivity to endoglycosidase H, indicating that an alteration of glycosylation has occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1513000136,"Human plasma kallikrein was prepared by proteolytic activation of prekallikrein with beta-Factor XIIa (Mr = 28,000). Two forms of kallikrein were generated that were each composed of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains: a heavy chain of apparent Mr = 43,000 and a light chain of apparent Mr = either 36,000 or 33,000. Following reduction and alkylation, the heavy and light chains of kallikrein were isolated by affinity chromatography using insolubilized high molecular weight kininogen. The alkylated light chain of kallikrein did not bind to high molecular weight kininogen-Sepharose while the heavy chain did bind with high affinity and was subsequently eluted. The light chain retained the specific amidolytic activity of native kallikrein. The Km and kcat values for the hydrolysis of H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide by kallikrein or its light chain were identical. Activation of Factor XII in solution was equally well catalyzed by kallikrein and its light chain. However, in kaolin-dependent coagulation, kallikrein was 180 times more effective than the light chain in correcting the clotting defect of prekallikrein-deficient plasma. Furthermore, the light chain was 3.5 times less potent than kallikrein in cleaving high molecular weight kininogen in solution. These observations indicate that the light chain region contains the enzymatic active site and adequately accounts for the enzymatic properties of kallikrein in solution on the protein substrate, Factor XIII, and on oligopeptide substrates. However, the heavy chain region of kallikrein is required for binding to high molecular weight kininogen, for surface-dependent activation of coagulation, and for optimal cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen."
https://openalex.org/W2050740526,"We have viewed the membrane specializations that occur at gap junctions from the inside and outside of cells in replicas of quick-frozen and deep-etched samples. Gap junctions were split to expose the normally apposed outside surfaces of their membranes, which displayed uniform 8–9 nm protrusions with central pores. Such pores were also observed in the protoplasmic-face particles of freeze-fractured gap junctions, even after the junctions were induced to crystallize by treatment with metabolic inhibitors or by homogenization. Crystallized junctions have been shown to be in the closed, high-resistance state; hence the channel-closing mechanism must not be located in the regions viewed so far. In washed-out broken cells, the inner surfaces of gap junctions possess smooth surfaces with no visible pores. These surfaces are devoid of special undercoatings of cytoskeletal elements, suggesting that crystallization observed during uncoupling is an intramembrane phenomenon. Hypertonicity, in itself, may produce the same sort of hexagonal crystallization of gap-junction components that is usually observed after uncoupling."
https://openalex.org/W1540704889,"Arachidonic acid is mobilized from the fetal membranes (amnion and chorion laeve) during human parturition. To define the lipid species that serve as the source of arachidonic acid, we determined the lipid composition of fetal membranes obtained before and during early labor. The arachidonic acid content of diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine decreased by 41% in amnion and 20% in chorion laeve during early labor. The arachidonic acid content of phosphatidylinositol decreased by 35% in amnion and 16% in chorion laeve. No statistically significant changes were found in the arachidonic acid content of the other lipid fractions of either amnion or chorion laeve. Thus, during early labor, there is a net release of arachidonic acid specifically from diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol of amnion and chorion laeve. The specific decrease in the arachidonic acid content of the diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol of human fetal membranes during early labor, as found in the present investigation, can be accounted for by enzymatic activities that are relatively specific for the release of arachidonic acid from these two glycerophospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2012723339,"A 3.4-kilobase DNA fragment containing the gene coding for the E alpha chain of an Ia (I region-associated) antigen from the BALB/c mouse has been sequenced. It contains at least three exons, which correlate with the major structural domains of the E alpha chain-the two external domains alpha 1 and alpha 2, and the transmembrane-cytoplasmic domain. The coding sequence of the mouse E alpha gene shows striking homology to its counterpart at the DNA and protein levels. The translated alpha 2 exon demonstrates significant similarity to beta 2-microglobulin, to immunoglobulin constant region domains, and to certain domains of transplantation antigens. These observations and those of others suggest that the Ia antigen, transplantation antigen, and immunoglobulin gene families share a common ancestor."

https://openalex.org/W2098693385,"The biosynthetic mechanism of prostaglandin D2 in human platelet-rich plasma has been investigated. Platelet-rich plasma was separated into washed platelets and platelet-poor plasma, and [1-14C]prostaglandin H2 was incubated with each fraction. The enzymatic conversion of the endoperoxide to prostaglandin D2 was found only in platelet-poor plasma and not in washed platelets or platelet lysate. This prostaglandin D synthetase activity was purified to homogeneity and identified as serum albumin by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and immunoelectrophoresis. The optimal pH and Km value for prostaglandin H2 were 9.0 and 6 microM, respectively. Glutathione was not required for the activity. Although prostaglandin H2 ws converted to prostaglandin D2 and E2 in the reaction, only the prostaglandin D2 formation was dependent on the protein amount and abolished by prior boiling. The action of this activity under physiological conditions was examined in a model system constituted of serum albumin and washed platelets. Prostaglandin D2 formation was observed in association with thrombin-evoked platelet aggregation in this system and was proportional to the number of platelets and the concentration of serum albumin, suggesting that thrombin-stimulated platelets released prostaglandin H2, and the latter compound was then converted to prostaglandin D2 by the action of serum albumin. Consistent with this interpretation, prostaglandin H2 added to platelet-rich plasma was converted in part to prostaglandin D2, and the aggregation caused by this endoperoxide was greatly enhanced by neutralizing the action of prostaglandin D2 with anti-prostaglandin D2 antiserum."
https://openalex.org/W2027421033,"Monoclonal antibodies specific for rat hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing factor (rGRF) have been produced by in vitro immunization of mouse spleen cells with less than 1 nanomole of rGRF in a partially purified preparation. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for anti-rGRF activity by use of a pituitary culture assay system that can detect growth hormone-releasing factor in the femtomole range. Such highly sensitive in vitro techniques permit the use of picomole quantities of an antigen in partially purified preparations for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies, which can in turn be used in biological studies and in immunochemical procedures for large-scale purification and isolation of that antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1566307072,"The proteoglycans synthesized by cartilage both in vivo and in vitro have been well characterized and serve as a standard for comparison with proteoglycans from other tissues. Both cartilage and muscle are mesenchymally derived tissues; yet proteoglycans synthesized by skeletal muscle have not been studied. This report describes the isolation and preliminary characterization of skeletal muscle proteoglycans synthesized by embryonic chick leg muscle in vitro and in vivo. Proteoglycans extracted from skeletal muscle cultures have a lower relative buoyant density than cartilage proteoglycans, as evidenced by dissociative CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation; only 25% of the muscle proteoglycans are recovered from the densest portion of such gradients. The high buoyant density skeletal muscle proteoglycans have a significantly larger monomer hydrodynamic size and substantially longer chondroitin sulfate chains than do the proteoglycans synthesized by limb bud mesenchyme-derived chondrocytes in culture. The skeletal muscle proteoglycan monomers elute from Sepharose CL-2B with a Kav = 0.17 and have chondroitin sulfate chains estimated to be greater than 50,000 daltons. The proportion of chondroitin-6-sulfate in the in vitro skeletal muscle proteoglycans is higher than that in limb bud culture chondrocyte proteoglycans: 76% versus 58%. Importantly, the chemical and structural features of skeletal muscle proteoglycans are distinct from those of the sulfated molecules produced by muscle-fibroblasts which are also present in the muscle cultures. Thus, the high buoyant density proteoglycans synthesized in vitro by embryonic chick leg myotubes appear to be unique species distinct from the proteoglycans produced in culture by chick limb bud chondrocytes and by chick leg muscle-fibroblasts. Preliminary analysis of chick leg skeletal muscle proteoglycans radiolabeled in ovo indicates that, like the proteoglycans synthesized by skeletal muscle in vitro, they are significantly larger than chondrocyte proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1527380199,"The detergent 1-O-n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (octylglucoside) was found to replace the phospholipid requirement in the demethylation of benzphetamine by cytochrome P-450LM2 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase purified from phenobarbital-treated rabbit liver. At low enzyme concentration (0.1 microM) in the absence of glycerol and phosphate, the maximum rate of benzphetamine-specific NADPH oxidation was approximately 35% of that observed in the presence of dilauroylglyceryl-3-phosphoryl choline. At higher enzyme concentration (2.5 microM) and in the presence of 0.15 M phosphate, 20% glycerol, octylglucoside was as effective as phospholipid in stimulating the production of formaldehyde from benzphetamine. The detergent concentration required for maximal enzymatic activity was 2.5-4.0 g/liter, depending on the cytochrome preparation used. At higher octylglucoside concentrations (5-7 g/liter), activity decreased to zero, although neither enzyme appeared to be irreversibly denatured at these detergent concentrations. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with P-450LM2 alone or in the presence of equimolar reductase showed that increasing octylglucoside levels promoted disaggregation of the cytochrome. Pentamers and hexamers predominated at detergent concentrations where maximal activity was observed, while higher levels of detergent where activity was absent produced cytochrome dimers and, ultimately, monomers. The reductase was monomeric at detergent levels between at least 3 and 7 g/liter. Moreover, both gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium experiments demonstrated that a stable complex between P-450LM2 and its reductase was not formed at octylglucoside concentrations where high activity was evident. These results are consistent with a model of P-450/reductase interaction in which functional aggregates of three to six cytochrome polypeptides move laterally in the microsomal membrane and interact with the reductase by random collision."

https://openalex.org/W1514988890,"A thiol proteinase inhibitor was purified from rat liver by essentially the same procedure as reported previously (Kominami, E., Wakamatsu, N., and Katunuma, N. (1981) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 99, 568-575), but without heat treatment. The purified inhibitor appears homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with and without sodium dodecyl sulfate and displayed no multiple forms. The inhibitor has Mr = 12,500 and contains 50.5% of polar amino acid residues, 9.3% aromatic amino acids, and no tryptophan. The presence of 2 half-cystines/molecule and the absence of free thiol groups indicate that the inhibitor possesses one disulfide bridges. The inhibitor inhibits cathepsin H by forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex in a molar ratio of 1:1. It inhibits most thiol proteinases such as cathepsin H, L, B, and C, papain, and ficin, but not calcium-activated neutral proteinase or serine proteinases or carboxyl proteinases. The inhibitor was found in various rat tissues. Immunological diffusion analysis with anti-liver thiol proteinase inhibitor serum indicated that the rat liver inhibitor is immunologically identical with the inhibitors from other rat tissues. On subcellular fractionation of rat liver, the thiol proteinase inhibitor was recovered in the cytosol fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1541582732,"1. A23187 and ionomycin cause the release of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ from the mitochondrial matrix. The electroneutral K+ efflux does not reflect direct transport by these ionophores but, rather, results from release of the endogenous K+/H+ exchanger from inhibition by divalent cations. 2. A23187 and ionomycin differ in their affinities for CA2+ and Mg2+, having relative affinity ratios (Ca2+/Mg2+) in respiring mitochondria of 3 and 35, respectively. 3. This difference in Ca2+/Mg2+ affinities was exploited in dose-response studies designed to determine which cation exerts primary control over K+/H+ exchange activity. The results of such studies demonstrate that removal of Ca2+ has no effect on K+ efflux, and that K+ efflux follows Mg2+ efflux whether induced by ionomycin or A23187. 4. K+ steady states, in which K+ uniport equals K+/H+ antiport, were induced by adding low levels of valinomycin to respiring mitochondria. The addition of Ca2+ perturbed the steady state in the direction of increased K+/H+ exchange. 5. Addition of Ca2+ to respiring mitochondria resulted in electroneutral K+ efflux which was strongly affected by the anion composition of the medium. We propose that Ca2+ turns on the K+/H+ exchanger indirectly, through a decrease in matrix [Mg2+] secondary to swelling and uptake of chelating anions. This phenomenon may be of physiological importance as a temporary protection against excessive swelling due to Ca2+ uptake. 6. These studies support the contention that Mg2+, not Ca2+, is the inhibitory cation responsible for the physiological regulation of mitochondrial K+/H+ exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1553070964,"We have studied the structure of actin by measuring the relative reactivities of lysines with acetic anhydride using a competitive labeling procedure comparing monomeric globular actin. monomeric actin in the presence of salt, and filamentous actin polymerized in 100 mM NaCl and 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2. We have identified 12 of the 19 lysines: 18, 50, 61, 68, 113, 191, 237, 290, 315, 325, 327, and 358. In all conditions, Lys (325, 327) is the most reactive. In globular actin, Lys 18, 191, 290, 314. and 358 are less than 20% as reactive as Lys (325, 327); the remaining have intermediate reactivities. On polymerization in the presence of NaCl and Mg2+, lysines 50, 61, 68, 113, and 290 become less reactive relative to Lys (325, 327). The changes in Lys 50, 61, and 113 are due largely to the polymerization event whereas those in Lys 68 and 290 appear to be an effect of Mg2+. Lys 18, 191, and 358 increase in relative reactivity when cation is added to the monomer and then become less reactive in the polymer, showing no large overall change in reactivity relative to the monomer in the absence of salt. Lysines that are reduced in reactivity upon polymerization indicate possible contact regions between actin monomers in the filament in the NH2-terminal third of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1531599853,"Activity gel analysis has been used to identify mouse myeloma polypeptides with DNA polymerase activity. Proteins in a crude homogenate of mouse myeloma were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was soaked from the gel, and polypeptides were allowed to renature in situ; then the intact gel was incubated in a DNA polymerase reaction mixture in order to localize DNA polymerases (Spanos, A., Sedgwick, S. G., Yarranton, G. T., Hubscher, U., and Banks, G. R. (1981) Nucleic Acids Res. 9, 1825-1839). This activity gel analysis revealed that the homogenate contains a Mr = 40,000 polypeptide with strong DNA polymerase activity; from its Mr and catalytic properties this enzyme was identified as beta-polymerase. The homogenate also contains two additional DNA polymerase activities giving relatively strong bands at Mr = approximately 76,000 and approximately 120,000, respectively. Results on the catalytic properties of both of these enzymes suggest that they are alpha-polymerases. Further evidence for the existence of a Mr approximately 120,000 alpha-polymerase catalytic polypeptide came from the observation that a purified preparation of one of the recognized species of mouse myeloma alpha-polymerase is composed of a Mr = approximately 120,000 polypeptide, as revealed by Coomassie blue staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 3 M urea. This purified enzyme does not contain polypeptides in the Mr = 40,000 to 70,000 range, and is capable of producing a strong band at Mr = 120,000 in the activity gel assay."

https://openalex.org/W1565244117,"Six sulfhydryl group were determined after complete denaturation of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase; of these, about 5.2 in both the native holoenzyme and FMN-depleted enzyme are accessible to p-hydroxychloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), which may be differentiated as follows: four --SH groups are modified by low concentration of the reagent but are not essentially involved in the catalytic function; additional block of one --SH group at high concentrations of pCMB completely inhibited the reductase activity. The fluorescence quenching of the FAD in the FMN-depleted enzyme was removed after the fifth --SH group was reacted slowly with pCMB. Kinetic and fluorometric analysis indicated that this finally modified --SH group was assumed to be essential for the activity and significantly protected by either 1 mM NADP+ or 2'-AMP against attack by mercurial compounds. A strong negative ellipticity at around 450 nm is clearly decreased upon binding of pCMB to an essential --SH group, while the CD spectra in the near and far UV region show only minor differences during the modification of --SH groups. Removal of the FMN prosthetic group from the native holoprotein results in 1.25-fold greater tryptophan fluorescence with a slight red shift of the emission maximum from 332 to 336 nm, and FMN reconstitution reduces the protein fluorescence quantum yield to approximately that of the holoprotein. Oxidation of tryptophan indol rings of the FMN-depleted enzyme is associated with a loss of FMN binding ability to the protein which causes the inactivation of cytochrome c reductase activity, but ferricyanide reductase activity is not strongly affected by tryptophan modification."
https://openalex.org/W68827992,"Rat pancreatic islets were exposed to a combination of analogs of arginine (3 mM canavanine) and lysine (3 mM thialysine) for 2 h and then labeled with [3H]leucine in the continued presence of the analogs. Control islets were incubated in parallel without analogs. Prelabeled islets were then incubated for a 3-h chase period without analogs. Incorporation of the analogs blocked conversion of newly synthesized, radioactive, proinsulin to insulin. No untoward toxic effects of the analogs were found on nonradioactive insulin as measured by radioimmunoassay. The rate of release of the modified proinsulin was no different from that found for proinsulin newly synthesized in the absence of analogs and, as such, susceptible to the normal action of the enzymes responsible for proinsulin to insulin conversion. These results confirm the previously untested hypothesis that the beta-granule is the minimal functional unit of release; granules are thus handled by the B-cell and released at a rate which is independent of the physicochemical nature of their contents."
https://openalex.org/W2035353220,"The role of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) in the phenomenon of inducer exclusion was examined in whole cells of Salmonella typhimurium which carried the genes of the Escherichia coli lactose operon on an episome. In the presence of the PTS substrate methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside, the extent of accumulation of the lactose analog methyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside was reduced. A strain carrying a mutation in the gene for Enzyme I was hypersensitive to the PTS effect, while a crr mutant strain was completely resistant. Influx, efflux, and exchange of galactosides via the lactose were inhibited by methyl alpha-glucoside. This inhibition occurred in the presence of metabolic energy poisons, and therefore does not involve either the generation of metabolic energy or energy-coupling to the lactose transport system. When the cellular content of the lactose permease was increased by induction with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, cells gradually became less sensitive to inducer exclusion. The extent of inhibition of methyl beta-thiogalactoside accumulation by methyl alpha-glucoside was shown to be dependent on the relative cellular content of the PTS and lactose system. The data were consistent with an hypothesis involving partial inactivation of galactoside transport due to interaction between a component of the PTS and the lactose permease. By examination of the effects of the PTS and lactose uptake and melibiose permease-mediated uptake of methyl beta-thiogalactoside, it was further shown that the manner in which inducer exclusion is expressed is independent on the routes available to the non-PTS sugar for exit from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1515178543,"A new bacteriophage T4-induced DNA-dependent ATPase-endonuclease was purified to essential homogeneity from an extract of late infected Escherichia coli. Both DNA-dependent ATPase and endonuclease activities co-chromatograph, co-sediment, and have been renatured from a single 43-kilodalton protein eluted following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that both activities are exerted by one multifunctional protein. Duplex, single-stranded, and supercoiled DNAs are all effective activators of the high specific activity ATPase which produces ADP and inorganic PO4. The enzyme displays a broad specificity towards the nucleoside and deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and the ATPase activity is strongly inhibited by DNA-intercalating compounds. The endonuclease appears to be most active on supercoiled DNA, producing double-stranded breaks in duplex DNA, and does not require nucleoside triphosphates. An antiserum against the purified enzyme immunoprecipitated it, inhibited its ATPase activity, and also precipitated from extracts a T4-induced protein of Mr = 43,000. This antigen was not found in uninfected E. coli, or following a gene 55am mutant (late protein synthesis defective) infection, and was not detected following infection with T4 amber mutants of any early capsid protein gene which blocks T4 head protein cleavage in vivo. In a pulse-chase experiment, the radioactive antigen was not found following a pulse of radioactive amino acids, but appeared after a chase with excess nonradioactive amino acids. The enzyme-related antigen is apparently produced by cleavage of a precursor by the T4 head assembly proteinase which processes a number of prohead proteins. These processing reactions are dependent in vivo upon assembly of the prohead and are required for its maturation. The evidence suggests that this enzyme functions in head assembly and DNA packaging, and originates as the cleavage product of a prohead precursor protein."

Lysinoalanine could inactivate metalloenzymes such as carboxypeptidases A and B and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, by removing the zinc ion from the active site. Model building for a mononuclear complex of the metal and lysinoalanine with space-filling models was possible for the LD-isomer, N epsilon-D-(2-amino-2-carboxymethyl)-L-lysine. Etiological studies of its toxicity to humans should be made because the chelating ability of lysinoalanine is sufficiently strong to remove the metal from the enzyme active center at millimolar concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1839089261,"Purified rabbit bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein at bactericidal concentrations is a membrane-perturbing agent that triggers hydrolysis of envelope phospholipids of a phospholipase A-less Escherichia coli (S17) mutant by a highly basic (pI greater than 10) phospholipase A2, purified from Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii snake venom. Most other purified phospholipases A2 do not degrade the phospholipids of E. coli killed by the bactericidal protein. To study the role of enzyme charge in bactericidal protein-dependent phospholipid hydrolysis, lysines of the Agkistrodon phospholipase A2 were modified, either by carbamylation (decreases net charge), or by reductive methylation (no delta charge). Incorporation of [14C]cyanate or [14C]formaldehyde and amino acid analysis served to monitor modification. Modification appears to be limited to epsilon-NH2 groups. Incorporation of up to 5 mol of cyanate or formaldehyde/mol of enzyme did not affect catalytic activity. In contrast, incorporation of, on average, 1 mol of either reagent/mol of protein reduced by 80% the activity of the enzyme toward E. coli S17 killed by the bactericidal protein. Since this loss is similar with carbamylation and reductive methylation, the role of the epsilon-NH2 group in the bactericidal protein-dependent hydrolysis seems independent of charge. Thus, the lysines in this phospholipase A2 are not essential for catalysis and substrate binding, but are essential for the action of this enzyme on E. coli killed by the bactericidal protein."

https://openalex.org/W2144394566,"Characteristics of the activator sites of liver and muscle phosphorylase b were probed by using AMP and AMP analogs in kinetic studies, by quantitative affinity chromatography, and by reaction with an affinity-labeling reagent. Activation of liver phosphorylase b by N6-(6-aminohexyl)AMP in comparison with AMP and other analogs is explained by preferential binding to the activator site. The KM value for glucose-1-P of liver phosphorylase b activated with N6-(6-aminohexyl)AMP is considerably higher than that of muscle phosphorylase b. Affinity chromatography utilizing AMP-Sepharose suggests that the activator site is less well formed in liver phosphorylase than in muscle phosphorylase. Reaction with 8-[m-(m-fluorosulfonylbenzamido)benzylthio]adenine activates liver phosphorylase b and is consistent with the reaction at the activator site. The results suggest that part of the reason that liver phosphorylase b is not activated by AMP and AMP analogs is due to a poor coupling between the activator and active sites. Lack of good activation by AMP also can be explained by binding at the inhibitor site."

(1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 453, 205-210). The enzyme was purified by a new method including affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular weight of 90,000, as before, but showed only a single band, of molecular weight 24,000, on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. This band corresponded to the small subunit observed in enzyme purified by the conventional method. For enzyme purified by the new method, a quaternary structure consisting of three identical subunits, each of which had a single proteolytic nick at a definite peptide bond close to the COOH-terminal, was proposed. A Lineweaver-Burk plot with inosine as substrate was linear for this enzyme preparation (Km = 0.04 mM) in contrast to concave downward curvature with two apparent Km values of 0.04 and 0.2 mM for the enzyme purified by the conventional method."
https://openalex.org/W1587610044,"The Fe protein of nitrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum isolated in the inactive form was found to be activated in vitro by heating. This heat activation was dependent upon temperature, pH, and enzyme concentration. During activation by heating, a change in the subunit composition of Fe protein was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. The upper subunit decreases and the lower subunit increased. All components of the modifying group on inactive Fe protein appear to be lost upon heat activation."
https://openalex.org/W1590870927,"Deoxycoformycin-resistant rat hepatoma cells exhibit up to 300-fold increase in adenosine deaminase activity compared to the sensitive parental cells. In order to determine the basis of the increased enzyme activity in deoxycoformycin-resistant cells, adenosine deaminase was purified from rat liver and deoxycoformycin-sensitive and -resistant cells. Physical, kinetic, and immunological properties of the purified enzymes were compared. Purified adenosine deaminase from all sources was found to be a monomer with an Mr approximately 45,000. In addition, the purified enzymes had a similar isozyme pattern in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Km values for adenosine and Ki values for deoxycoformycin did not differ among the purified enzymes. By double diffusion analysis and quantitative immunoprecipitation, the purified enzymes were found to be immunologically indistinguishable. These data indicate that deoxycoformycin-resistant rat hepatoma cells produce increased amounts of adenosine deaminase protein which results in increased enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1641653852,"Artemia larval ribonuclease (Sebastian, J., and Heredia, C. F., (1978) Eur. J. Bichem. 90, 405-411) has been purified near homogeneity and its properties were studied. It consists of a single polypeptide chain of 38,000 daltons. It requires a divalent cation for activity. Ca2+ is the most effective among the metals tested. The metal dependence of the activity is biphasic. Maximal activity is obtained at 5-10 mM. In the absence of metals and chelating agents in the assay, 30-40% of the activity is observed. However, if chelating agents are added, the activity is abolished. At low concentrations of free metal (1-20 microM), 30-40% of maximal activity is obtained with Ca2+ or Mn2+, but not with Mg2+, Ca2+, but not Mn2+ or Mg2+, protects the enzyme from thermal inactivation. The best substrates for Artemia ribonuclease are poly(U) and poly(A), although with the latter it has only 10% the activity shown with the former. Using poly(U) as substrate, the products of a terminal digestion are P-2':3'-Urd and 3'-UMP. Using dinucleoside monophosphates as substrates, the enzyme is highly specific for a U residue at the 3' side of the phosphodiester bond (UpN), especially UpA, being inactive if the U residue is at the 5' side (NpU). Although some of its properties are similar to other eukaryotic or prokaryotic ribonucleases, its high specificity for UpN bonds suggest that this is a new type of ribonuclease. Moreover, it is a potentially useful enzyme for RNA analysis and/or sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1481675206,"Evidence for the existence of a previously unknown rat hepatic microsomal reductase, short chain trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (SC reductase) is presented. This reductase has a specific requirement for NADPH, is unable to utilize NADH, and catalyzes the conversion of crotonyl-CoA and trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA to butyric acid and hexenoic acid at a rate of 5 and 65 nmol per min per mg of microsomal protein, respectively. Highly purified NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase incorporated into liposomes prepared from dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine in the presence or absence of cytochrome P-450 possesses no SC reductase activity. These liposomal preparations did, however, catalyze mixed function oxidations of benzphetamine and testosterone. Rabbit antibody to rat liver NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase had little to no effect on the conversion of crotonyl-CoA and trans-2-hexenoyl-CoA, suggesting that the SC reductase accepts reducing equivalents directly from NADPH. When acetoacetyl-CoA was incubated with hepatic microsomes and either NADH or NADPH, no formation of butyrate was detected; however, when both cofactors were present, a rate of formation of 3 nmol of butyrate was determined per min per mg of microsomal protein. These results suggest the presence of a previously unknown short chain beta-ketoreductase which catalyzes the reduction of short chain beta-keto acids, only in the presence of NADH. Our results also indicate that the electrons from NADH to the beta-ketoreductase bypass cytochrome b5. The physiological significance is discussed in terms of lipogenesis and ketone body utilization by the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2075344447,"Genetic suppression was studied in the purple mutant of Drosophila melanogaster and in suppressed purple by measurement of sepiapterin synthase activity. The addition of ammonium sulfate fractions from adult Drosophila that contain one, two, three or four doses of su(s)+ to the suppressed purple sepiapterin synthase resulted in an inhibition that increased progressively as the dosage of su(s)+ increased; the wild-type sepiapterin synthase was not inhibited. This inhibition is caused by a heat-labile macromolecule. We suggest that the mechanism of suppression is neither transcriptional nor translational but is the result of decreased amounts, or altered properties, of the normal product of the su(s)+ locus when su(s)+ is replaced by su(s)2 or su(s)e6."

This RNA contains 106 nucleotides including an AGA sequence at the 5'-end not found in other chloroplast 4.5 S RNAs and a seven-nucleotide segment absent in the sequences of wheat and maize 4.5 S RNAs. Except for these differences, the sequence of spinach 4.5 S RNA is highly homologous with those of other species. It shows 95% sequence homology to that of tobacco and 78% homology to those of wheat and maize. The secondary structure was probed using limited ribonuclease T1 and nuclease S1 digestions. The results support the 5'-half of the secondary structure model previously proposed for 4.5 S RNA (Machatt, M. A., Ebel, J.-P., and Branlant, C. (1981) Nucleic Acids Res. 9, 1533-1549) but are inconsistent with the rest of that model. An alternative model for spinach 4.5 S RNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488951235,"The enzyme dihydropterin oxidase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This enzyme uses a variety of 2-amino-4-oxo-7,8-dihydropteridine compounds as substrates, including 2-amino-4-oxo-7,8-dihydropteridine (called dihydropterin), Km = 0.11 microM; 6-lactoyl-7,8-dihydropterin, Km = 1.80 microM; and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, Km = 1.25 microM. The products in each case are the corresponding fully oxidized compounds 2-amino-4-oxopteridine, oxidized 6-lactoyl-7,8-dihydropterin, and 6-L-erythro-dihydroxypropylpterin, respectively. During the reaction, 1 mol of molecular oxygen is consumed per mole of substrate oxidized, and hydrogen peroxide is produced. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 51,500. The enzyme apparently contains two polypeptide chains of identical molecular weight. The prosthetic group of the enzyme has been identified as FAD. From the determination of the occurrence of the enzyme in the various stages of the life cycle of D. melanogaster and from other considerations, the tentative conclusion is reached that the physiological role of dihydropterin oxidase is to convert dihydropterin to 2-amino-4-oxopteridine, a reaction that is believed to be essential in the formation of 2-amino-4-oxo-7-hydroxypterin in D. melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W1935724673,"The rate of arachidonic acid metabolism by prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide synthetase by the rabbit renal cortex (approximately 200 pmol/mg of protein/min) is very slow compared to medulla (approximately 2000 pmol/mg/min). However, by using PGH2 as a substrate and limiting reaction times, we were able to directly measure the endoperoxide-dependent PGE2 isomerase and found that both the cortex and medulla possess high levels of this activity (approximately pmol/mg/min). The PG endoperoxide E2 isomerase is dependent on reduced glutathione, but not cysteine, and is inactivated by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate or boiling. Thus, the renal medulla appears to exhibit an efficient coupling of cyclooxygenase and PG endoperoxide E2 isomerase, whereas the cortex has a vast excess of endoperoxide-dependent enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1577576196,"Activities of the various components of the human factor VIII complex in citrated and heparinized human plasma have been determined following radiation inactivation of the plasma in a high energy electron beam at -135 degrees C in order to determine the molecular size of the functional units. In citrated and in heparinized plasma the functional size of VIII:C was 120,000 +/- 9,700 and 140,000 +/- 10,000, respectively. Taken together with previously published data, these results suggest that VIII:C exists in plasma as a dimer of noncovalently bonded functional subunits. The size of the functional unit of the ristocetin cofactor of the factor VIII complex was determined as being approximately 330,000 in both citrated and heparinized samples. Immunological assays for VIII:C (inhibitor neutralization assay), the VIII:C antigen, and the VIII:vWF-related antigen suggest that these may not be reliable under conditions favoring the activation and inactivation of factor VIII components by thrombin or other proteases."
