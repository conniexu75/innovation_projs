https://openalex.org/W2076097089,The dispersal of radioactive airborne-particles from two nuclear tests in the Pacific Proving Grounds of the AEC was traced by counting the activity on sheets of gummed film exposed at stations located throughout the world. A series of maps illustrate the fallout dispersal pattern at various times following the test shots. The effects of prevailing meteorological conditions on fallout dispersal and deposition are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2068007194,"Marked regional differences in the Sr content of human bones were observed as a result of the analyses of 277 human bones from a world-wide sampling. The % Sr/% Ca x 10/sup 3/ ratio was determined on bones ashed at 8000/sup 0/ for 12 to 24 hours. This ratio was not affected by bone type, age, or sex. Bones from Brazil and Liberia had high average ratios, Denmark, Italy and Japan, intermediate average ratios, and Cologne, Switzerland, and Bonn low average ratios (1.33, 1.25, 0.89, 0.71, 0.70, 0.36, 0.35, and 0.35 respectively). Analyses of bones of 9 other regions were also reported."

https://openalex.org/W1967695629,"ELECTRON microscopy of ultra-thin sections of avian tubercle bacilli growing on various solid media has revealed details of their internal anatomy. In the initial phase of growth, the structure was similar to that described in the ordinary bacteria1–3. Each rod contained a central dense core in the form of a thread or group of granules within an electron-transparent area (Fig. 1). This structure is believed to represent the nuclear apparatus. There appeared to be some correlation between the phase of growth of the bacillus and the configuration of the dense core. When division by transverse fission took place, each daughter cell contained its own nuclear apparatus. The cytoplasm of the avian tubercle bacilli showed certain differences from the bacteria, and contained large, fairly dense granules (300 A.); but the general pattern of reproduction appeared to be the same."

https://openalex.org/W1965176431,"IT has been shown that about 0.5 per cent of human sera possess a thermostable factor agglutinating O Rh + red cells sensitized with anti-D antibodies. Only those sera were taken into account which agglutinated sensitized red cells at least in 1 in 8 dilution in saline. Weaker sera gave unreproducible reactions. The strongest serum observed had a titre of 128. According to our experiments1, the agglutinating factor in the sera observed is an anti-globulin antibody. It may be absorbed from the sera by sensitized red cells and it may be neutralized in the sera by incomplete antibodies regained at 56° C. from cells. This antiglobulin antibody reacts only with immune antibodies after their denaturation in serological reaction, and therefore it is not neutralized by normal serum or by immune serum containing unchanged antibodies (Fig. 1). The discussion on the nature of this antibody and on its eventual role in pathology will be given elsewhere. Here we wish to stress the practical application of our findings."

https://openalex.org/W2066038018,"IN the course of our investigations of Echinocystis lobata seeds, it became desirable to locate triterpenoid glycosides on paper chromatograms by means of a colour reaction. A modification of the Liebermann–Burchard test described by Neher and Wettstein1 was unsatisfactory for this purpose. We found that the original Liebermann–Burchard reaction applied to paper chromatograms with comparatively little alterations gave more satisfactory results, permitting a reliable detection of the spots."
