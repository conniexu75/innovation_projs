The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway integrates multiple environmental cues to regulate translation in response to nutrient availability and stress, suggesting it as a candidate for O2 regulation. We show here that hypoxia rapidly and reversibly triggers hypophosphorylation of mTOR and its effectors 4E-BP1, p70S6K, rpS6, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. Hypoxic regulation of these translational control proteins is dominant to activation via multiple distinct signaling pathways such as insulin, amino acids, phorbol esters, and serum and is independent of Akt/protein kinase B and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, ATP levels, ATP:ADP ratios, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Finally, hypoxia appears to repress phosphorylation of translational control proteins in a manner analogous to rapamycin and independent of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. These data demonstrate a new mode of regulation of the mTOR pathway and position this pathway as a powerful point of control by O2 of cellular metabolism and energetics.

In mammalian systems, low O2 (hypoxia) has two types of effects on cellular metabolism and gene expression. Rapid and reversible effects on cell signaling, contractility, ion flux, and redox state (for review, see Ref. 1Seta, K. A., Spicer, Z., Yuan, Y., Lu, G., and Millhorn, D. E.

Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The two central mechanisms for regulating translation initiation are the assembly of (i) active eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F and (ii) eIF2·GTP·Met·tRNAi ternary complexes (for review, see Ref. 19Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), whose assembly and activity can be rapidly and reversibly modulated by changes in the phosphorylation states of subunits or interacting proteins. Functional eIF4F complex binds to the m7GTP cap of mRNA, unwinds mRNA secondary structure, and recruits the 40 S ribosome and other translation factors to mRNA. The eIF2·GTP·Met·tRNAi complex is required for initiation codon recognition and 60 S ribosome recruitment and is locked in its inactive GDP-bound form by stress-induced phosphorylation of the eIF2α subunit by its kinases (for review, see Ref. 19Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase, is central to the control of translation in response to stress and nutrient deprivation. In growth-promoting conditions, mTOR sustains translation by phosphorylating the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) and ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) and activating the phosphorylation of eIF4G, although the mechanism of the last is not well understood (for review, see Ref. 20Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Hierarchical phosphorylation of 4E-BPs at several conserved serine and threonine residues renders them unable to inhibit eIF4F activity, thereby activating translation initiation. Phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389 of its linker domain is closely correlated with in vivo activity, as is phosphorylation at Thr421 and Ser424 of the pseudosubstrate domain, which is thought to relieve autoinhibition by this domain (21Saitoh M. Pullen N. Brennan P. Cantrell D. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20104-20112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Activated p70S6K phosphorylates both eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase, increasing the activity of elongation factor 2 (22Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) and the ribosomal protein S6. Although the phosphorylation of eIF4G and rpS6 are strongly correlated with activated translation, the precise role of phosphorylation of these two regulatory proteins is unclear. Both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR pathways appear to be required for full phosphorylation of mTOR substrates (20Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), and there is clearly extensive, although incompletely understood, cross-talk between PI3K/Akt signaling and mTOR. Recent reports propose that PI3K/Akt signaling up-regulates mTOR activity by relieving repression of mTOR by the TSC2 complex (23Marygold S.J. Leevers S.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 785-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Many animals possess the ability to alter their metabolism in responses to changes in O2, a phenomenon known as oxygen conformance (24Boutilier R.G. St-Pierre J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2000; 126: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Hochachka P.W. Lutz P.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 130: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) in which cells down-regulate nonessential anabolic processes in advance of energetic crisis. In particular, reversible inhibition of translation has been shown in many organisms to play a role in conformance. In mammals, models of ischemic disease demonstrate both eIF4F (26Martin de la Vega C. Burda J. Nemethova M. Quevedo C. Alcazar A. Martin M.E. Danielisova V. Fando J.L. Salinas M. Biochem.

Severe hypoxia (0.02%) results in the phosphorylation and inhibition of eIF2α by the ER-resident kinase PERK (37Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7405-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), implicating ER stress in the translational response to pathophysiological hypoxia. Mammalian tissues can encounter O2 concentrations anywhere from ≈0 to 10%, and little is known about the effects of physiological hypoxia on translation initiation and whether it differs from more severe ischemic conditions. Reversible inhibition of translation occurs between 0.5 and 1% O2 (38Lang K.J. Kappel A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 39Gorlach A. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Vogt L. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and a study comparing 95% O2 with 5% O2 showed differences in the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 and its association with eIF4E (40Tinton S.A. Buc-Calderon P.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In this report we demonstrate for the first time coordinated regulation of the mTOR pathway by O2. Hypoxia, defined here as 1.5% O2, caused rapid and reversible hypophosphorylation of mTOR and its effectors 4E-BP1, p70S6K, rpS6, and eIF4G. Hypoxic regulation of these translational control proteins was independent of Akt phosphorylation and was dominant to leucine-, phorbol ester-, and serum-induced phosphorylation of mTOR targets. This suggests that hypoxia acts at or downstream of mTOR, the putative point of convergence of multiple stress- and nutrient-sensing signaling pathways. Hypoxia effects were also independent of HIF-1 and did not correlate with changes in cellular ATP levels or AMPK signaling, demonstrating that O2 regulation of the mTOR pathway is not secondary to hypoxic effects on HIF-1 or cellular energetics. Hypoxic regulation of mTOR targets was also independent of PP2A. Together, these data show that hypoxia triggers molecular events that result in the coordinate inhibition of central effectors of the cellular translational apparatus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—All cells were propagated in D/10% medium (DMEM (Cellgro), 10% FBS (Gemini Bioproducts), 20 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 nm nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen)). Hypoxic conditions were defined as 1.5% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C and were generated using an InVivo2 hypoxic work station (Biotrace Inc.). For all experiments except the time course and hepatocyte experiments, 3 × 106 or 7 × 106 HEK293 cells (ATCC) were plated, respectively, in 60- or 100-mm tissue culture dishes in D/10% medium and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were serum-starved for 2 h in leucine-free DMEM (Specialty Media) for leucine stimulation experiments or 48 h in basal medium eagle with 20 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin for insulin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) experiments. Cells were then incubated in normoxia, hypoxia, or the indicated pharmacological compound for 30 min before stimulation with 200 nm insulin (Sigma), 105 mg/liter leucine (Specialty Media), or 100 nm PMA (Calbiochem) for 45 min. Where indicated, cells were reoxygenated (standard tissue culture conditions) for 30–60 min. For the time course and AMPK experiments, 293 cells were plated at 2.5–3 × 106/100-mm dish and allowed to adhere overnight before being incubated in D/10% medium in normoxia, hypoxia, hypoxia followed by normoxia, or 100 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose (Sigma) for the indicated times.

Chem. 1983; 258: 3523-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were plated at 3 × 106/100-mm dish in D/10% medium and allowed to adhere overnight before 1 h of hypoxic treatment.All hypoxic cultures were washed and scraped under hypoxic conditions using hypoxia-equilibrated phosphate-buffered saline before centrifugation and lysis in whole cell extract buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 250 μm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)).m7GTP Affinity Purification—7 × 106 293 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes treated as described above before lysis in affinity purification buffer (0.5% Triton X, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 250 μm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). 250 μg of extracts were incubated in a 25% slurry of m7GTP-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in affinity purification buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. After 3 washes in 4 °C affinity purification buffer, beads were boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer, and supernatants were run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels alongside 25 μg of unpurified lysate.Western Blots—Extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred, and immunoblotted according to standard protocols or manufacturers' instructions using 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween. Blots were stained with Ponceau S to ensure equal loading. Anti-human HIF-1α was purchased from BD Transduction Labs (#610958), anti-eIF4G (sc-11373) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and all others including mouse and rabbit secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies. ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Blots were stripped in 61.50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 1 h before being blocked and reprobed according to standard protocols.ATP and ATP:ADP Measurements—293 cells were plated at 3 × 105/well of a 6-well plate (total ATP) or 1 × 104/well of a 96-well plate (ATP:ADP) in D/10% and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then exposed to 30 min of hypoxia, 30 min of hypoxia followed by 30 min of reoxygenation, or medium containing 100 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose (Sigma) for 30 min. Overall ATP levels were determined using the ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science) after lysis with buffer from ATP bioluminescence assay kit HS II (Roche Applied Science). Values are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments of four wells of cells for each condition tested. ATP:ADP ratios were determined using the ApoGlow assay (BioWhittaker) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Values are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments of five wells of cells for each condition.RESULTSHypoxia Causes Hypophosphorylation of mTOR and Its Targets—Serum-starved HEK293 cells were incubated under hypoxic (1.5% O2) or normoxic (20% O2) conditions for 30 min before a 45-min insulin stimulation during which the indicated O2 concentrations were maintained. Hypoxic treatment resulted in dephosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2481 (Fig. 1a), which was rapidly reversed after 1 h of reoxygenation. This hypoxia-induced hypophosphorylation was not observed at Ser2448 of mTOR. Ser2481 has been shown to be a site of mTOR autophosphorylation (43Peterson R.T. Beal P.A. Comb M.J. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7416-7423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas Ser2448 is phosphorylated upon activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting that hypoxia reversibly inhibits mTOR activity but not PI3K or Akt activity.Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of mTOR effectors 4E-BP1, p70S6K, and eIF4G as well as the mTOR-independent phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B (second lanes of Figs. 1, b–e). As a positive indicator of hypoxic responses in this and other experiments, Western blots for HIF-1α were performed (Fig. 1e). After 30 min of hypoxia, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr37 and Ser65 (third lane, Fig. 1b) was suppressed to below base-line levels. Overall 4E-BP1 phosphorylation can also be visualized by changes in mobility; the shift to faster mobility (i.e. hypophosphorylated) bands upon hypoxic treatment is evident in Western blots for total 4E-BP1. Hypoxic hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was reversed after1hof reoxygenation at 20% O2 (fourth lane).Similar to 4E-BP1, insulin-induced phosphorylation of the p70 and p85 isoforms of the p70S6K gene at Thr389, Thr421, and/or Ser424 (Fig. 1c) was suppressed by hypoxic treatment and restored upon reoxygenation. Although the phospho-specific antibodies are reactive against both isoforms, the antibody against total p70S6K only appears to detect the p70 isoform. This may reflect the relative abundance and phosphorylation states of these two isoforms or may be a result of differential sensitivity of the antibodies. Phosphorylation of eIF4G at Ser1108 (Fig. 1d) is also induced by insulin and is thought to be mediated indirectly by mTOR activity (20Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this site, like 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, was repressed below base-line levels by hypoxic treatment and return to 20% O2 relieved this repression. Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, which is induced by insulin in a PI3K-dependent and mTOR-independent fashion, is unaffected by hypoxic treatment (Fig. 1e), demonstrating that hypophosphorylation of mTOR and its effectors is not a result of either repression of PI3K/Akt signaling or global repression of protein phosphorylation. Although recent results demonstrate that more severe or longer hypoxic treatments can result in PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α (37Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7405-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), this was not observed under the less severe, short term conditions used here (Fig. 1e).Hypoxia Enhances 4E-BP1 Association with eIF4E and Suppresses Phosphorylation of rpS6 —The phosphorylation data from Fig. 1 predict changes in the activities of downstream effectors of mTOR signaling. 4E-BP1 hypophosphorylation results in an increased association with its target, eIF4E, and we used m7GTP-conjugated Sepharose beads to affinity-purify eIF4E-containing, m7GTP binding complexes from 293 cells (Fig. 2a). Insulin stimulation, as expected, strongly inhibited the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E compared with serum-starved cells, indicative of a translationally active state. By contrast, hypoxia prevented the dissociation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E to the same degree as rapamycin, whereas reoxygenation restored their insulin-stimulated dissociation. The formation of active eIF4F translation initiation complexes is therefore tightly regulated by O2.Fig. 2Hypoxia enhances 4E-BP1 association with eIF4E and suppresses phosphorylation of rpS6. a, serum-starved 293 cells were incubated in normoxia with or without 20 nm rapamycin (or Me2SO control) or hypoxia for 30 min before insulin stimulation for 45 min and reoxygenation for 1 h where indicated. 250 μg of extract were affinity-purified with m7GTP-conjugated Sepharose beads and Western-blotted alongside 25 μg of total lysate. b, whole cell extracts from Fig. 1 were blotted for phospho- or total rpS6. Results were reproduced in at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)rpS6 is a p70S6K target that is phosphorylated at serines 235, 236, 240, and 244 in response to insulin stimulation (Fig. 2b). This stimulation was completely suppressed by hypoxia and was rapidly restored upon return of hypoxic cells to normal O2 concentrations. rpS6 phosphorylation closely reflects the phosphorylation state of p70S6K and, taken together with the 4E-BP1/eIF4E association data, demonstrates that hypoxia suppresses the activity of 4E-BP1 and the phosphorylation of a p70S6K target.Hypoxia Suppresses Leucine-, Phorbol Ester-, and Serum-stimulated Phosphorylation of mTOR Targets—Amino acids, most potently leucine (for review, see Ref. 44Kimball S.R.

To ascertain whether hypoxia regulates translational control by multiple activating stimuli, we tested the ability of hypoxia to suppress translational activators other than insulin. Leucine (Fig. 3a) or PMA (Fig. 3b) stimulation of serum-starved cells induced the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, p70S6K, and rpS6. In both cases, this induction was suppressed by hypoxia. In exponentially growing cells in standard (10% FBS) conditions, 4E-BP1, p70S6K, and rpS6 were all hypophosphorylated after 15 min of hypoxia (Fig. 3c). After 1 h of hypoxia, phosphorylation of all 3 proteins returned to basal levels after as little as 15 min of reoxygenation. Insulin, leucine, and PMA activate distinct upstream signaling cascades, and it seems unlikely that hypoxia specifically inhibits proximal signaling events in each of the pathways tested. Together with the mTOR and Akt phosphorylation data from Fig. 1, these data suggest that hypoxic regulation of mTOR targets is a generalized mechanism capable of opposing a variety of stimuli and that hypoxia exerts its control at potential sites of convergence for the signaling pathways tested.Fig. 3Hypoxia suppresses leucine-, phorbol ester-, and serum-stimulated phosphorylation of mTOR targets. a, serum-starved 293 cells were additionally starved of leucine for 2 h before incubation in normoxia or hypoxia for 30 min followed by leucine stimulation. b, serum-starved 293 cells were incubated in normoxia or hypoxia for 30 min before stimulation with PMA (or Me2SO control) where indicated. c, exponentially growing cells in DMEM, 10% FBS were exposed to hypoxia or to 1 h of hypoxia followed by the indicated lengths (min) of reoxygenation.

We therefore determined whether HIF-1 activity was necessary for hypoxia effects on translational control proteins using BpRc1 cells, a murine hepatoma line that lacks ARNT/HIF-1β, and thus, functional HIF-1 complex (41Miller A.G.

In BpRc1 cells expressing either vector alone or ARNT/HIF-1β, hypoxia resulted in hypophosphorylation of both rpS6 and 4E-BP1, indicating that HIF-1 is not necessary for hypoxia effects on mTOR targets (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4HIF-1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for hypoxic regulation of the mTOR pathway. a, ARNT/HIF-1β null BpRc1 cells expressing vector alone or ARNT (HIF-1β) were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 1 h. b, serum-starved 293 cells were incubated for 30 min in normoxia with or without the hypoxia mimetics 50 μm CoCl2 or 1 mm desferrioxamine (DFX) or hypoxia before insulin stimulation of all cells.

We therefore screened GFI1 as a candidate for association with neutropenia in affected individuals without mutations in ELA2 (encoding neutrophil elastase), the most common cause of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN; ref. 3). We found dominant negative zinc finger mutations that disable transcriptional repressor activity. The phenotype also includes immunodeficient lymphocytes and production of a circulating population of myeloid cells that appear immature. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation, gel shift, reporter assays and elevated expression of ELA2 in vivo in neutropenic individuals that GFI1 represses ELA2, linking these two genes in a common pathway involved in myeloid differentiation."

We found that induction of β-sheet structures in recombinant prion proteins is associated with increased solvent accessibility of tyrosine. Antibodies directed against the prion protein repeat motif, tyrosine-tyrosine-arginine, recognize the pathological isoform of the prion protein but not the normal cellular isoform, as assessed by immunoprecipitation, plate capture immunoassay and flow cytometry. Antibody binding to the pathological epitope is saturable and specific, and can be created in vitro by partial denaturation of normal brain prion protein.

https://openalex.org/W2056801995,"The Rho family small GTPases play a crucial role in mediating cellular responses to stretch. However, it remains unclear how force is transduced to Rho signaling pathways. We investigated the effect of stretch on the activation and caveolar localization of RhoA and Rac1 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In unstretched cardiomyocytes, RhoA and Rac1 were detected in both caveolar and non-caveolar fractions as assessed using detergent-free floatation analysis. Stretching myocytes for 4 min activated RhoA and Rac1. By 15 min of stretch, RhoA and Rac1 had dissociated from caveolae, and there was decreased coprecipitation of RhoA and Rac1 with caveolin-3. To determine whether compartmentation of RhoA and Rac1 within caveolae was necessary for stretch signaling, we disrupted caveolae with methyl β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Treatment with 5 mm MβCD for 1 h dissociated both RhoA and Rac1 from caveolae. Under this condition, stretch failed to activate RhoA or Rac1. Stretch-induced actin cytoskeletal organization was concomitantly impaired. Interestingly the ability of stretch to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was unaffected by MβCD treatment, but ERK translocation to the nucleus was impaired. Stretch-induced hypertrophy was also inhibited. Actin cytoskeletal disruption with cytochalasin-D also prevented stretch from increasing nuclear ERK, whereas actin polymerization with jasplakinolide restored nuclear translocation of activated ERK in the presence of MβCD.

Mechanical stress is recognized as an important extracellular stimulus facilitating cell growth, one example of which is cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

The cytoskeleton communicates with the extracellular matrix through integrins, which have been considered as potential mechanosensors (1Ruwhof C. van der Laarse A. Cardiovasc.

There is also evidence that integrins transduce signals via Rho-dependent pathways (9Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which mechanical force is transduced and the steps leading to recruitment of Rho family small GTPases in mechanotransduction in cardiomyocytes are poorly understood. Caveolae are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane invaginations, which are considered to be important platforms for signal transduction (10Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar, 12Smart E.J.

Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). There is considerable support for the notion that signaling molecules converge in caveolae (14Lohn M. Furstenau M.

However, the possibility that mechanotransduction signals through caveolar-localized molecular pathways in cardiomyocytes has not been addressed previously. There are two functionally distinct features of caveolae that are critical to their role in signal transduction (17Feron O. Zhao Y.Y. Kelly R.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 874: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). First, caveolae are considered to function as reservoirs of signaling proteins, with caveolin serving as a negative regulator of these molecules in quiescent cells. Second, caveolae function as clustering sites for ligand-activated G-protein-coupled receptors such as the muscarinic cholinergic or sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor (18Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T.

Several studies indicate that the caveolar scaffolding protein, caveolin-1, can directly interact with signaling molecules (e.g. G-protein subunits, Src family tyrosine kinases, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase C, or Ras) within caveolae to negatively regulate their functions (12Smart E.J.

Accordingly, some of these molecules have been shown to be activated and liberated from caveolae upon hormonal stimulation (24Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat.

In light of the findings cited above, we hypothesized that mechanical force might be transduced into cellular signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes via caveolae. In particular, we focused on the localization and activity of Rho family GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, in caveolar microdomains and examined the effect of stretch on their compartmentation and downstream signaling. The data presented here demonstrate that activation of RhoA and Rac1 by stretch requires their proper localization within caveolae and that stretch leads to their dissociation from this compartment. Disruption of caveolae not only prevents RhoA and Rac1 activation but also impairs stretch-induced actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and nuclear localization of ERK. Materials—Anti-caveolin-3, anti-RhoA, anti-Rac1, anti-Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), and anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratory. Anti-RhoA and anti-Rac1 polyclonal antibodies for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphospecific ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Protein G-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from ICN. Jasplakinolide and rhodamine-phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (27Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Brown J.H.

Briefly, hearts were obtained from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups and digested with collagenase, and myocytes were purified by passage through a Percoll gradient. Cells were plated onto silicon membrane coated with collagen type I (0.5 μg/cm2), which assembled in a biaxial stretch device. Myocytes were maintained overnight in 4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199, supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were then serum-starved for 24 h prior to intervention. Purification of Caveolin-rich Membrane Fractions—Caveolin-rich microdomains were isolated using the methods of Song et al. (20Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, myocytes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed directly with 600 μl of 0.5 m Na2CO3 (pH 11). Cells were passed 20 times through a 25-gauge needle and sonicated with three 20-s bursts with minimal output of Micro Ultrasonic cell disrupter (Kontes). A 0.54-ml aliquot of cell lysates was adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 0.54 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MES-buffered saline (25 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 6.5, 75 mm NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. The 45% sucrose-cell lysate mixture was overlaid with 1.08 ml of 35% sucrose and 1.08 ml of 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline containing 0.2 m Na2CO3. The gradients were centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 20 h in an SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Twelve 0.27-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The proteins in each fraction were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated proteins were washed once with 95% ethanol and then resolved with Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were boiled, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and subjected to immunoblotting. Enhanced chemiluminescence was then performed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Preparation of Purified Glutathione S-transferase Fusion Protein— The coding sequence for the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin (RBD) or Rac1-binding domain of p21-activated kinase 1 (PBD) cloned into the pGEX vector expression systems were gifts from Dr. Martin Alexander Schwartz (University of Virginia). The recombinant protein was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (27Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were induced with isopropyl β d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were stored at –80 °C until use. Pull-down Assay—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 250 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 × g to remove nuclei and cell debris. Equal volumes of supernatants were incubated with RBD or PBD beads for 60 min at 4 °C. After washing the beads for three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), the beads were collected and resolved with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were boiled for 5 min and then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—Myocytes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitation of RhoA or Rac1 from cell lysates was carried out by incubating 300 μl of total cell lysates with 1 μg of anti-RhoA or anti-Rac1 polyclonal antibody in the presence of protein G-Sepharose (10 μl) overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-RhoA, anti-Rac1, or anti-caveolin-3 antibodies. Immunocytochemistry—Myocytes on stretchers were fixed for 20 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized for 3 min in 0.4% Triton X-100, and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. The silicon membrane was cut and then stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibody and rhodamine-phalloidin for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was mounted on a coverslip, and images were captured with a DeltaVision deconvolution microscope system (Applied Precision, Inc., Issaquah, WA). The system includes a Photometrics CCD mounted on a Nikon TE-200 inverted epifluorescence microscope. In general, between 30 and 80 optical sections spaced by ∼0.1–0.3 μm were taken. Exposure times were set such that the camera response was in the linear range for each fluorophore. The data sets were deconvolved and analyzed using SoftWorx software (Applied Precision, Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station. Characterization of Isolated Caveolae from Cardiomyocytes—Caveolin-3 is a heart and muscle cell predominant isoform of caveolin. We isolated cardiac caveolae from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (Fig. 1A) using caveolin-3 as a specific marker for cardiac caveolae. Non-caveolar components were defined by the absence of caveolin-3 and by the presence of FAK and of Rho-GDI, an endogenous inhibitor of RhoA and Rac1 that sequesters them in the cytoplasm. The caveolin-3-positive bands were concentrated in fractions 5 and 6 in preparations made by the detergent-free purification procedure detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” In contrast, FAK and Rho-GDI were detected in fractions 9–12 (Fig. 1A). The protein concentration profile obtained using this isolation method was also consistent with that of previous reports (Fig. 1B) (29Doyle D.D. Goings G. Upshaw-Earley J. Ambler S.K. Mondul A. Palfrey H.C. Page E. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Activation of RhoA and Rac1 in Response to Stretch—We next determined whether stretch led to the activation of RhoA and Rac1 in cardiomyocytes. Pull-down assays revealed rapid and transient increases in activated (GTP-bound) RhoA and Rac1 in response to 20% equibiaxial stretch (Fig. 2A). The activation of both RhoA and Rac1 peaked at 3–5 min after the onset of stretch and returned to the basal level by 10 min of stretch (Fig. 2B). RhoA and Rac1 activation at 4 min of stretch is also shown quantitatively in Fig. 5.Fig. 5Effects of stretch with or without MβCD on the activation of RhoA and Rac1. Cardiomyocytes were plated on silastic membranes but not stretched, or were subjected to 20% stretch for 4 min, with or without prior treatment with 5 mm MβCD for 1 h. Pull-down assays were performed, and then blots were probed with antibody against RhoA (left) or Rac1 (right). Bar graphs show the relative band intensities of active RhoA or Rac1 divided by total RhoA or Rac1. The experiments were repeated four times, and averages ± S.E. are shown. *, p < 0.05 as compared with unstimulated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Segregation of RhoA and Rac1 from Caveolae in Response to Stretch—Changes in the subcellular localization of RhoA and Rac1 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes subjected to stretch were assessed using the fractionation procedure described in Fig. 1 to purify caveolae. RhoA and Rac1 were distributed in both caveolar and non-caveolar fractions in unstretched cardiomyocytes. Equibiaxial stretch for 4 min did not affect the distribution of RhoA or Rac1 in caveolar and non-caveolar fractions (data not shown). However, when equibiaxial stretch was applied to the myocytes for 15 min, redistribution of RhoA and Rac1 from the caveolar to a non-caveolar fraction was observed (Fig. 3A). Densitometric analysis of the distribution of caveolin-3, RhoA, and Rac1 in caveolar fractions (5 and 6) versus non-caveolar fractions (9Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 10Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 11Simons K.

Concomitant increases in non-caveolar fractions were observed. Importantly, caveolin-3 distribution was not affected by stretch (Fig. 3B). Effect of Methyl β-Cyclodextrin (MβCD) on Stretch-induced RhoA and Rac1 Distribution—The observation that activation of RhoA and Rac1 by stretch appeared to precede their dissociation from caveolae suggested that caveolar compartmentation might be necessary for their initial activation. To address this issue, we used cholesterol depletion with MβCD to disrupt caveolae. Cardiomyocytes were incubated with 5 mm MβCD for 1 h prior to stretch. The impact of this intervention on the activation and subcellular distribution of RhoA and Rac1 was then examined. Although the destruction of caveolae was not complete (as evidenced by retention of some caveolin-3 immunoreactivity in fractions 5 and 6), this treatment was sufficient to dissociate both RhoA and Rac1 from caveolae (Fig. 4A). The association of RhoA and Rac1 with caveolin-3 was also examined in immunoprecipitation studies. As expected, caveolin-3 co-precipitated with RhoA and with Rac1 in unstretched myocytes (Fig. 4B). Following 15 min of stretch, the amount of caveolin-3 associated with RhoA and Rac1 was diminished, consistent with their dissociation from the caveolar fractions. In addition, the amount of caveolin-3 that co-precipitated with RhoA and Rac1 was decreased by MβCD treatment, confirming dissociation of these small GTPases from caveolar microdomains (Fig. 4B). Effect of MβCD on Stretch-induced RhoA and Rac1 Activation—The ability of stretch to activate RhoA and Rac1 was then assessed in cells treated with MβCD. As shown in Fig. 5, 4 min of stretch activated both RhoA and Rac1 in untreated cells. Pretreatment with MβCD did not significantly affect the basal activity of RhoA and Rac1; however, stretch failed to activate either RhoA or Rac1. These observations suggest that the initiation of stretch-induced RhoA and Rac1 activation requires intact caveolar microdomains. Effect of MβCD on ERK Activity during Stretch—Recent findings from studies of caveolin-3 and -1/3-null mouse demonstrated that chronic loss of caveolae resulted in hyperactivation of ERK in the heart (30Park D.S. Woodman S.E. Schubert W. Cohen A.W. Frank P.G. Chandra M. Shirani J. Razani B. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Factor S.M. Weiss L.M. Tanowitz H.B. Lisanti M.P. Am. J.

We, therefore, determined whether ERK was activated in myocytes when caveolar structure was acutely disrupted with MβCD. As shown in Fig. 6, MβCD treatment alone did not lead to significant activation of ERK, nor was ERK activation by stretch impaired by MβCD treatment (Fig. 6). Cytoplasmic Retention of Active ERK by MβCD in Stretched Myocytes—When we investigated the subcellular localization of active ERK by immunostaining with a phosphospecific ERK antibody, a different pattern emerged. As shown in Fig. 7, in unstretched myocytes, weak phospho-ERK fluorescence (green) and disorganized striated actin filaments (red) were detected in the cytoplasm. One hour of stretch increased the intensity of phospho-ERK staining, and nuclear staining was evident in ∼90% of the cells. Stretch concomitantly elicited actin fiber alignment. In contrast, in cells treated with MβCD, stretch increased phospho-ERK fluorescence, but phospho-ERK staining was observed only in the cytoplasm, and actin fibers remained disorganized. These data suggest that failure to activate RhoA and Rac1 and to organize the actin cytoskeleton may prevent nuclear translocation of active ERK. Jasplakinolide Restores Nuclear Translocation of Active ERK—To further examine the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in nuclear translocation of ERK, we tested the effect of an actin polymerizer jasplakinolide on the translocation of active ERK by stretch. Actin fibers could not be detected with phalloidin staining in these studies because jasplakinolide competes with phalloidin for binding to actin fibers. We therefore stained for α-actinin, an actin-binding protein. Following jasplakinolide treatment, the actin cytoskeleton was organized, and stretch led to the nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK in a significant fraction (∼40%) of the MβCD-treated cells (Fig. 7). Furthermore we determined that treatment of myocytes with cytochalasin-D, an actin depolymerizer, did not affect ERK activation but prevented stretch-induced organization of the actin cytoskeleton and led to retention of active ERK in the cytoplasm of most cells (Fig. 8). This is consistent with a previous study with cytochalasin-D, which suggested that nuclear translocation of active ERK is facilitated by an organized actin cytoskeleton (32Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The precise molecular relationship among RhoA and Rac1 activation, actin cytoskeletal reorganization, and ERK nuclear translocation remains to be explored. However, ERK signaling in cardiomyocytes has been associated with the development of hypertrophy, characterized by increases in cell size, actin myofilament organization, and ANF expression. Cardiomyocytes stretched continuously for 24 h show clear increases in each of these parameters (Fig. 9). Concomitant treatment with MβCD prevents these changes. Although long term MβCD treatment could disrupt myriad signaling pathways that regulate hypertrophy, the data are consistent with a requirement for caveolae in transduction of stretch to hypertrophic growth, possibly mediated via RhoA, Rac1, and ERK signaling pathways. The findings presented here demonstrate by direct biochemical analysis that stretch increases the amount of activated RhoA and Rac1 in cardiomyocytes. This observation extends published evidence, demonstrating more indirectly that Rho is activated by stretch in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle cells (4Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Zhu W. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 33Numaguchi K. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which mechanical force is transduced into activation of downstream signaling cascades remains unknown. The data presented here suggest that the compartmentation of RhoA and Rac1 in caveolae play a critical role in mechanotransduction in cardiomyocytes. Using a detergent-free purification of caveolae, we determined that a significant fraction of RhoA and Rac1 is localized in caveolar microdomains of cardiomyocytes. Furthermore we demonstrate that mechanical stretch results in the dissociation of RhoA and Rac1 from the caveolar fraction and decreases the amount of caveolin-3 associated with RhoA or Rac1 in immunoprecipitates. We also provide evidence that short term MβCD treatment leads to complete loss of compartmentation of RhoA and Rac1 within caveolae and that this manipulation prevents stretch-induced RhoA and Rac1 activation. These data implicate caveolae as the sites at which RhoA and Rac1 are activated by stretch. From a cellular perspective, electron microscopic studies suggest that caveolar structures open and become flat when cells are stretched beyond 7% of their resting length (34Dulhunty A.F. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 250: 513-539Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be hypothesized that stretch, by altering caveolar morphology, renders caveolar-localized RhoA and Rac1 more accessible to guanine nucleotide exchange factors that catalyze the release of GDP and its replacement by GTP (8Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Cell. 2002; 110: 139-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In addition to affecting RhoA and Rac1 activation, MβCD treatment prevents stretch-induced actin cytoskeletal organization. The role of RhoA and Rac1 in activation of molecules responsible for actin cytoskeletal reorganization (e.g. Rho kinase, LIM kinase, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK-1), cofilin) is well documented (35Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 36Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that filamin, a protein involved in actin cytoskeletal assembly through PAK-1, is a caveolin-binding protein (37Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 38Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The ability of caveolar disruption to prevent stretch-mediated actin cytoskeletal organization could, therefore, result either from failure to activate RhoA and Rac1 or from impaired binding of cytoskeletal regulatory molecules to caveolin/caveolae. Unexpectedly, our data also suggest that stretch-induced actin cytoskeletal rearrangement plays a role in ensuring the proper localization of active ERK. Disruption of caveolae with MβCD did not prevent ERK activation by stretch. Indeed the finding that ERK is activated in the presence of MβCD suggests that some stretch-induced signaling pathways remained intact. Possibly, integrin signaling pathways are engaged and lead to ERK activation in the absence of intact caveolae (Fig. 10). Most notably, however, MβCD treatment led to cytoplasmic retention of activated ERK in response to stretch. The possibility that the impaired ERK localization is related to the failed cytoskeletal organization is consistent with another recent report demonstrating that cytochalasin-D, an actin cytoskeleton-disrupting agent, impairs integrin-stimulated nuclear translocation of active ERK in NIH 3T3 cells (32Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Experiments presented here indicate that this also occurs in cardiomyocytes and in response to stretch. Stretch-induced ERK activation and nuclear translocation in mesangial cells have also been reported to be disrupted via destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton resulting from elevating nitric oxide or treatment with 8-bromo-cGMP (39Ingram A.J. James L. Cai L. Thai K. Ly H. Scholey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40301-40306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Jasplakinolide reverses the destabilization and allows proper ERK localization in mesangial cells (39Ingram A.J. James L. Cai L. Thai K. Ly H. Scholey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40301-40306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, in cardiomyocytes, jasplakinolide restores nuclear translocation of active ERK induced by stretch, even in the presence of MβCD. The mechanism by which an intact actin cytoskeleton participates in the transport of active ERK into the nucleus remains unknown. Nonetheless our data suggest that organization of the actin cytoskeleton is required for mechanotransduction in cardiomyocytes. Mechanotransduction and G-protein-coupled agonists are known to utilize ERK signaling pathways to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (1Ruwhof C. van der Laarse A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 40Ueyama T. Kawashima S. Sakoda T. Rikitake Y. Ishida T. Kawai M. Yamashita T. Ishido S. Hotta H. Yokoyama M. J. Mol.

We demonstrate here that MβCD treatment prevents stretch-induced hypertrophic increases in ANF gene expression and myocyte cell size. Although there are many potential molecular events inhibitable by MβCD, our findings suggest that the ability of MβCD treatment to block RhoA or Rac1 activation, cytoskeletal organization, and ERK translocation affects nuclear responses. In summary, our findings demonstrate that stretch activates and subsequently dissociates RhoA and Rac1 from a caveolar compartment in rat cardiomyocytes. Mechanotransduction via this pathway appears to require organization of the actin cytoskeleton, a response that contributes to the nuclear localization of ERK. We suggest that proper cellular compartmentation of RhoA and Rac1 within caveolae is necessary for transducing mechanical force into spatially regulated ERK signals. We thank D. Goldstein, A-M.

One of them, PGRP-LC, is required for the activation of the imd/Relish pathway and is likely to encode a pattern recognition molecule for the humoral immune response (6Choe K.M. Werner T. Stöven S.

Surprisingly, we found that PGRP-LC mediates the induction by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as peptidoglycan (6Choe K.M. Werner T. Stöven S. Hultmark D. Anderson K.V. Science. 2002; 296: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), although the effect of LPS was recently questioned (15Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J.

We screened between 3 and 11 × 105 plaques with the different probes, corresponding to 0.6–2.2 times the estimated complexity of the library. The probes were made as described for Northern blot detection. Positive pBK-CMV phagemid clones derived from the ZAP Express vector (Stratagene) were obtained by in vivo excision using the ExAssist helper phage (Stratagene). EST clones of PGRP-LF were obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project/Howard Hughes Medical Institute EST Project. The cDNA clones were sequenced using the Dyenamic ET terminator sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and 17- to 18-base-long primers from Cybergene AB (Huddinge, Sweden). RT-PCR—Total RNA from induced flies, induced mbn-2 cells, and untreated mbn-2 cells was used for the superscript one-step RT-PCR with platinum taq (Invitrogen) reactions with one common 5′ PGRP-LC primer and one y-specific 3′ primer. The reaction was run at 50 °C 30 min and 94 °C 2 min, followed by 30 cycles (94 °C 15 s, 50 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min), and ended by 72 °C 7 min.

The bacteria Micrococcus luteus Ml11, Bacillus megaterium Bm11, and Enterobacter cloacae β12 were originally obtained from Hans G. Boman (see Ref. 18Hultmark D. Engström Å. Bennich H. Kapur R.

The Erwinia carotovora carotovora SSC3193 wild type strain was obtained from Kenneth Söderhäll (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden), and Escherichia coli O55:B5 was received from the CCUG (Culture Collection, University of Göteborg, Göteborg, Sweden). The fungus Dipodascopsis uninucleata var. wickerhamii was obtained from the Fungal Biodiversity Center (Utrecht, The Netherlands). Insoluble peptidoglycan was prepared from B. megaterium Bm11, as described in Ref. 19Morishima I. Wiesner A. Dunphy G.B. Marmaras V.J. Morishima I. Sugumaran M. Yamakawa M. Techniques in Insect Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1998: 59-64Google Scholar. LPS from E. coli O55:B5 was obtained from Fluka and taken up in distilled water. Before use, the stock solution was pretreated for 1 h at 62 °C. Peptidoglycan contaminants were removed by incubating LPS preparations (2 mg/ml) with PGRP-SC1B (20 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 12 h. The activity of the enzyme preparation was confirmed on purified peptidoglycan as described in Ref. 13Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol.

In a separate experiment it was shown that LPS (2 mg/ml) did not inhibit the PGRP-SC1B degradation of peptidoglycan (data not shown). To make a fungal cell fragment preparation, 5 ml of D. uninucleata cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 50 ml of sterile Ringer's solution. The cells were fragmented in an ice-chilled Bead Beater chamber in 45 1-min runs, with 50 ml of 0.5-mm glass beads in a total volume of 100 ml. RNAi—We amplified the PGRP regions of interest from cDNA or genomic DNA by PCR with primers containing the T7 sequence. The fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1Topo by using the Topo TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). As templates for in vitro transcription (Ribomax large scale RNA production system T7 kit, Invitrogen), we used 10 μg of linear plasmid DNA containing the PGRP sequences, flanked by a T7-promoter on each side. The dsRNA for the different genes and domains corresponded to the following parts and lengths: PGRP-LC, 861 bp from the common exons 2 and 3; LCa domain, 523 bp; LCx domain, 354 bp; LCy domain, 584 bp; and PGRP-LF, 738 bp covering both domains. For RNAi, we plated 5 ml of mbn-2 cell suspension, 1 million cells/ml, in Schneider's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were kept at 25 °C and transfected 1 day later with 10 μg of dsRNA. Three days after transfection, the mbn-2 cells were induced with washed live bacteria, homogenized fungal cells, insoluble peptidoglycan, LPS, or sterile Ringer's solution as control for 6 h (2 h for LPS). The pellets of bacterial overnight cultures were washed and resuspended 1:100 in sterile Ringer's solution, and 15 μl were used per plate. The quantity of fungal cell fragments used for induction corresponds to 1.5 μl of cell pellet per plate. The final concentration of peptidoglycan and LPS was 1 μg/ml cell culture. The mbn-2 cells were harvested on ice after 6 h, centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g, and total RNA was extracted. RNA Preparation, Northern Blot, and Hybridization—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and dissolved in 50 μl RNase free water. For Northern blots, 5 μl (∼15 μg) of total RNA per lane was run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. Hybridization was performed under high stringency conditions (50% formamide, 42 °C).

The probes were 32P-labeled with the Rediprime II kit from Amersham Biosciences. Radioactivity was monitored using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Alternative Transcripts in the Complex PGRP-LC Locus— The PGRP-LC locus contains five PGRP homology domains (14Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Two of them are expressed in the alternatively spliced PGRP-LCa and PGRP-LCx transcripts (6Choe K.M. Werner T. Stöven S. Hultmark D. Anderson K.V. Science. 2002; 296: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 14Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). To identify transcripts that express the neighboring y, z and w PGRP domains, we screened a hemocyte-enriched cDNA library. We found 8 clones out of 450,000 screened plaques for PGRP-LCx, but only one for LCy out of 1.1 million. This single y clone corresponds to an aberrantly terminated PGRP-LCx transcript, in which the y domain was part of the 3′-untranslated region. We therefore resorted to RT-PCR and could amplify a functional PGRP-LCy-specific band with RNA from mbn-2 cells and immunostimulated adult flies. This PGRP-LCy transcript is completely analogous to PGRP-LCx and uses the same splice donor site in the third exon, 57 bp upstream of the one used for the PGRP-LCa transcript. As a result, the linker between the PGRP domain and the predicted transmembrane region is 19 amino acid residues shorter in PGRP-LCx and LCy than in LCa. Eighteen out of 300,000 clones were positive for the w domain. At least 12, possibly all, of the w-containing clones also hybridized to the z probe, suggesting that both domains are included in a single transcript. This was confirmed by sequencing two of the cDNA clones and is also consistent with one 5′ EST sequence and one fully sequenced transcript from the genome project. It does not overlap with the PGRP-LC transcripts and therefore defines a unique PGRP gene, PGRP-LF. The encoded 369-amino acid PGRP-LF protein includes the z domain in exons 2 and 3 and the w domain in exon 4 (Fig. 1A). Membrane topology prediction suggests that the extracellular PGRP domains are immediately preceded by a transmembrane region and a very short intracellular domain of 23 residues (Fig. 1B). Alternative Splice Forms of PGRP-LC with Different Specificity—The ability of the PGRP-LC gene to express three alternative PGRP domains, x, y, and a, suggests that the PGRP-LC isoforms display different recognition capabilities to various microbial patterns. To investigate the functions of the three PGRP-LC isoforms and of PGRP-LF, we used transcript-specific RNAi in mbn-2 cells. Control experiments show that double-stranded RNA directed against the unique exons suppress the corresponding transcript levels by at least 90%, without affecting the other alternative transcripts (Fig. 2, C–F). We then tested the cells for their ability to respond to the Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus and B. megaterium, the Gram-negative bacteria E. cloacae, E. carotovora, and E. coli, and one fungus, D. uninucleata. We monitored the immune response by Northern blot, using probes for the antimicrobial Diptericin, Attacin A, and Cecropin A genes, which are regulated by the imd/Relish pathway in this cell line. Our results support the suggestion that the PGRP-LC isoforms display distinct recognition abilities. PGRP-LCx is absolutely required for induction by all tested bacteria, and suppression of this transcript has the same effect as suppression of all PGRP-LC transcripts with dsRNA from the common exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, the removal of PGRP-LCa specifically blocks the inducibility of the imd/Relish pathway by Gram-negative bacteria, without affecting the induction by Gram-positive bacteria. This clearly demonstrates a functional difference between PGRP-LCa and LCx. A Specific Role of PGRP-LCa in the Response to LPS—The specific requirement of PGRP-LCa for induction by Gram-negative bacteria strongly suggested that this isoform could be involved in the response to LPS. Since LPS preparations are likely to be contaminated with peptidoglycan, we pretreated E. coli LPS with purified PGRP-SC1B, an amidase that degrades peptidoglycan and removes its immunostimulatory effect on Drosophila cells (13Mellroth P. Karlsson J. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7059-7064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that a peptidoglycan-free LPS preparation induces the mbn-2 cells in a PGRP-LCa-dependent way, while crude LPS signals via PGRP-LCx in a PGRP-LCa-independent manner. This changed pattern confirms the effectiveness of the peptidoglycan removal. The chemical structure of peptidoglycan is identical in E. coli and B. megaterium (23Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and induction by peptidoglycan from the latter species does not require PGRP-LCa (Fig. 3). The PGRP-LCa-dependent induction by LPS can therefore not be due to contaminating peptidoglycan, as suggested by Leulier et al. (15Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). It must be caused by some other factor in the preparation, most likely LPS itself. Thus, we conclude that whereas PGRP-LCx is the only isoform needed for induction by peptidoglycan, the response to LPS or Gram-negative bacteria requires both PGRP-LCa and LCx. This suggests that LPS is indeed the major inducing factor in the Gram-negative bacterial envelope. Quantification of the Northern blot shows that stimulation by peptidoglycan-free LPS is about 7-fold weaker than that of living Gram-negative bacteria. This might be related to how the LPS molecules are presented in the micelles of the purified sample. The colloidal state of LPS is probably important and we obtain more reproducible induction when the stock solution has been heat-treated. 2S. Ekengren, personal communication. Such factors could explain why Leulier et al. (15Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) were unable to detect any effect of LPS in vivo. Besides, free LPS is probably short-lived in hemolymph (24Kato Y. Motoi Y. Taniai K. Kadonookuda K. Hiramatsu M. Yamakawa M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 539-545Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unlike PGRP-LCa and PGRP-LCx, dsRNA against PGRP-LCy and PGRP-LF did not suppress the immune response (Fig. 2B). If anything, the induction is even slightly increased by dsRNA against PGRP-LF, although this could be an indirect effect. Trying to find functions for PGRP-LCy and PGRP-LF, we expanded our experiments by using the yeast-like fungus D. uninucleata, which is highly immunostimulatory in adult flies, in a Relish-dependent manner (25Ekengren S. Hultmark D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Ekengren S. Stress and Immune Defense in Drosophila melanogaster. Ph.D. thesis, the Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Stockholm2001Google Scholar). However, neither intact cells (not shown) nor cell fragments of this microorganism induce any response in the mbn-2 cells (Fig. 2B), most likely due to missing factors in the cell culture system. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate that alternative splicing of PGRP-LC contributes to the capacity of the system to respond to both LPS and peptidoglycan. It is likely that PGRP-LCx acts as a direct pattern recognition molecule for peptidoglycans, 3P. Mellroth and H. Steiner, unpublished data. but we cannot exclude the possibility that other components are also involved. The simultaneous requirement of two splice forms for the response to LPS suggests that the PGRPs may act as heterodimers or perhaps as higher multimers. This would further add to the flexibility of the system.

Recent studies have demonstrated that c-Abl and Arg are activated in the response of cells to oxidative stress. This work demonstrates that catalase, a major effector of the cellular defense against H2O2, interacts with c-Abl and Arg. The results show that H2O2 induced binding of c-Abl and Arg to catalase. The SH3 domains of c-Abl and Arg bound directly to catalase at a P293FNP site. c-Abl and Arg phosphorylated catalase at Tyr231 and Tyr386 in vitro and in the response of cells to H2O2. The functional significance of the interaction is supported by the demonstration that cells deficient in both c-Abl and Arg exhibit substantial increases in H2O2 levels. In addition, c-abl –/– arg –/– cells exhibited a marked increase in H2O2-induced apoptosis compared with that found in the absence of either kinase. These findings indicate that c-Abl and Arg regulate catalase and that this signaling pathway is of importance to apoptosis in the oxidative stress response.

Normal aerobic metabolism is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; SH, Src homology; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSO, l-buthionine sulfoxime; DCF-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. including superoxides, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide. A substantial amount of oxygen reduced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain is converted to superoxide and then to H2O2 by the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (1Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). H2O2 is readily diffusible across cell membranes and functions as a signaling molecule in diverse cellular events. Mitogenic signals induced by certain growth factors and activated Ras are mediated by H2O2 production (2Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T.

In addition, the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p70S6K, and p90rsk are activated by H2O2 signaling (2Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T.

Although few insights are available regarding the mechanisms responsible for ROS-induced cell death, H2O2 activates topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of chromosomal DNA and thereby apoptosis (12Li T.

The predominant enzymatic mechanisms that regulate intracellular H2O2 levels are mediated by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The tetrameric catalase converts H2O2 to H2O and O2 in peroxisomes (17Amstad P. Peskin A. Shah G. Mirault M.E. Moret R. Zbinden I. Cerutti P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9305-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). With the exception of rat myocardial cells, catalase is not detectable in mitochondria (18Radi R. Turrens J.F.

Glutathione peroxidase converts H2O2 to H2O in a reaction that oxidizes GSH to its disulfide form (GSSG). In turn, GSH is regenerated from GSSG by glutathione reductase. Regulation of H2O2 by the glutathione redox cycle is mediated in the cytosol and mitochondria. Little is known about the regulation of catalase or glutathione peroxidase, particularly the effects of post-translational modifications on their activities.

The C-terminal regions of c-Abl and Arg share 29% identity and are distinguished from the other non-receptor tyrosine kinases by the presence of globular and filamentous actin-binding domains (26Van Etten R.A.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). c-Abl differs from Arg by the presence of a nuclear localization signal (26Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D.

Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) in the C-terminal region. c-Abl also differs from Arg by localization to the nucleus and extranuclear organelles, whereas Arg is expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm (28Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic form of c-Abl is activated in the response of cells to H2O2 by a mechanism dependent on protein kinase Cδ (23Sun X.

Mitochondrial targeting of c-Abl in response to oxidative stress is also associated with cytochrome c release and induction of apoptosis (23Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17237-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In concert with these findings, c-Abl-deficient cells exhibit resistance to H2O2-induced cell death (23Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Other studies have shown that Arg is activated by oxidative stress and that this response involves Arg-mediated phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic Siva-1 protein (24Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S.

H2O2-induced apoptosis is attenuated in Arg-deficient cells, and this defect is corrected by reconstituting Arg expression (24Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent findings indicate that ROS induce c-Abl-Arg heterodimers and that both c-Abl and Arg are necessary as effectors in the apoptotic response to oxidative stress (31Cao C. Leng Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that c-Abl and Arg interact with catalase in the response of cells to oxidative stress. The functional significance of these findings is supported by the demonstration that cells deficient in both c-Abl and Arg exhibit elevated intracellular H2O2 levels and a pronounced apoptotic response to oxidative stress. Cell Culture—293 cells, MCF-7, MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) (32Yuan Z. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U-937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were treated with H2O2 (Sigma) and STI571 (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Vectors—FLAG-tagged c-Abl, Arg, and catalase and their mutants were expressed by cloning into the pcDNA3.1-based FLAG vector. His/Express-tagged constructs were prepared by cloning into pcDNA4HisMAX, which contains N-terminal His and Express tags (Invitrogen). Myc-tagged c-Abl and catalase vectors were prepared by cloning into pCMV-Myc (Clontech). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated by expression of pGEX4T2-based vectors in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Soluble protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl (K-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-catalase (Sigma), anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (M5, Sigma), or anti-Express (Invitrogen) antibody. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-catalase (Calbiochem), anti-c-Abl (sc-2411, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Arg (24Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol.

The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Binding Assays—Cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the adsorbates were washed with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. An aliquot of the total lysate (2%, v/v) was included as a control. For direct binding assays, purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled catalase. The adsorbates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Kinase Assays—Purified human catalase (2 μg; Sigma) or GST-catalase (2 μg) was incubated with GST-c-Abl (prepared in Sf9 cells) or GST-Arg (prepared in E. coli) in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MnCl2) containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Assessment of Catalase Activity—For the substrate solution, 0.1 ml of 30% H2O2 was added to 50 ml of 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The A 240 of the solution was adjusted to between 0.550 and 0.520. The reactions were initiated by adding 0.1 ml of the enzyme solution to 2.9 ml of the substrate solution in a silica cuvette (1-cm light path) at 25 °C. The time required for the A 240 to decrease from 0.450 to 0.400 corresponds to the decomposition of 3.45 μmol of H2O2 in the 3-ml assay (Sigma catalog). FLAG-catalase or the FLAG-catalase(Y-F) mutants were expressed in 293 cells with c-Abl, c-Abl(K-R), Arg, or Arg(K-R). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were assayed for catalase activity and by immunoblotting for catalase protein. Densitometric scanning of the signals was compared with that obtained with dilutions of crystalline catalase (Sigma). Measurement of Intracellular H 2 O 2 Levels—Cells were treated with 0.3 mml-buthionine sulfoxime (BSO; Sigma) for 16 h and were then incubated with 5 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were then incubated in the absence and presence of 0.5 mm H2O2 for 30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence of oxidized DCF was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). The geometric mean obtained from 104 cells was used to calculate the relative H2O2 concentration. Apoptosis Assays—DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed and citrate buffer-permeabilized cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (BD Biosciences). The numbers of cells with sub-G1 DNA were determined with a MODFIT LT program (24Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). c-Abl and Arg Associate with Catalase—To determine whether c-Abl associates with catalase in the cellular response to oxidative stress, lysates from H2O2-treated MCF-7 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl antibody. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-catalase antibody demonstrated a low level of constitutive c-Abl binding to catalase (Fig. 1A). However, treatment with 0.25 mm H2O2 resulted in increased formation of c-Abl-catalase complexes (Fig. 1A). Similar findings were obtained when cells were treated with 0.5 and 1.0 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1A). However, exposures to 2.0 mm H2O2 were associated with decreased formation of c-Abl-catalase complexes (Fig. 1A). In the reciprocal experiment, analysis of anti-catalase immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl antibody confirmed that H2O2 induced the association of c-Abl and catalase and that the extent of the interaction was dependent on the concentration of H2O2 (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained for an H2O2-dependent association between Arg and catalase (Fig. 1B). The demonstration that H2O2 induced binding of catalase with c-Abl and Arg in U-937 cells indicates that the interaction with catalase occurs in different cell types (Fig. 1C). To confirm binding of catalase to c-Abl and Arg, 293 cells were transfected to express Myc-tagged catalase and FLAG-tagged c-Abl or Arg. Immunoblot analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-catalase antibody demonstrated constitutive binding of catalase and c-Abl (Fig. 1D). The finding that kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) also associated with catalase demonstrates that binding is independent of the c-Abl kinase function (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained for a constitutive interaction between catalase and Arg or Arg(K-R) (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that c-Abl and Arg associate with catalase and that the interaction is increased in response to oxidative stress. Binding of c-Abl and Arg to Catalase—To further define the association between c-Abl and catalase, lysates from MCF-7 cells were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the c-Abl SH2 or SH3 domain. Analysis of the adsorbates by immunoblotting with anti-catalase antibody demonstrated binding of catalase to the c-Abl SH2 and SH3 domains (Fig. 2A). Similar findings were obtained for binding of catalase to Arg SH2 and Arg SH3 domain (Fig. 2A). As a control, there was no detectable binding of catalase to GST proteins containing the Grb2 SH2 or SH3 domain (Fig. 2A). To assess whether binding of c-Abl and catalase is direct, GST-c-Abl and GST-Arg fusion proteins were incubated with purified 35S-labeled FLAG-catalase. Analysis of the adsorbates by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated binding to the c-Abl and Arg SH3 domains (Fig. 2B). By contrast, there was no detectable binding of catalase to the GST proteins containing the c-Abl or Arg SH2 domain (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that catalase is tyrosine-phosphorylated in MCF-7 cells, but not after in vitro translation. Catalase contains a potential proline-rich site (293PFNP296) for SH3 domain binding. Lysates from 293 cells expressing a FLAG-catalase(P293A) mutant were analyzed for binding to the c-Abl SH3 domain. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to wild-type catalase, binding of the c-Abl SH3 domain was abrogated with catalase(P293A) (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained with the Arg SH3 domain (Fig. 2C). To show that the PFNP motif is important for the interaction between c-Abl and catalase in vivo, lysates from cells expressing Myc-c-Abl and FLAG-catalase or FLAG-catalase(P293A) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated binding of c-Abl to catalase, but not to catalase(P293A) (Fig. 2D). In a similar analysis, there was no detectable binding of Myc-Arg to catalase(P293A) (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg bind directly to catalase through interactions of their SH3 domains and the catalase PFNP site. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Catalase in Response to Oxidative Stress—To determine whether c-Abl phosphorylates catalase, recombinant c-Abl was incubated with purified catalase and [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated phosphorylation of catalase (Fig. 3A, left panel). To confirm these findings, similar reactions were performed in the presence of unlabeled ATP. Immunoblot analysis of the reaction products with anti-Tyr(P) antibody demonstrated that catalase was phosphorylated at tyrosine (Fig. 3A, right panel). In concert with the demonstration that ROS-induced activation of c-Abl is mediated by protein kinase Cδ (23Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17237-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the addition of H2O2 to the reaction had no apparent effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase (data not shown). The results also demonstrate that catalase is a substrate for Arg (Fig. 3B). To assess c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of catalase in vivo, lysates from cells expressing Myc-catalase were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Analysis of the precipitates by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody demonstrated phosphorylation of catalase at tyrosine (Fig. 3C). The finding that treatment of the cells with the c-Abl/Arg kinase inhibitor STI571 (33Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar) decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase provided support for a c-Abl- and/or Arg-dependent mechanism (Fig. 3C). Cells expressing Myc-catalase and c-Abl also showed phosphorylation of catalase at tyrosine (Fig. 3D). By contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase was inhibited in cells expressing c-Abl(K-R) (Fig. 3D). Catalase was also subject to tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing kinase-active Arg, but not kinase-inactive Arg(K-R) (Fig. 3D). To assess tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase in response to oxidative stress, anti-catalase immunoprecipitates from lysates of H2O2-treated MCF-7 cells were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody. The results demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase was increased in response to 1.0 (but not 0.25 or 2.0) mm H2O2 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, H2O2-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase were not found in MCF-7 cells stably expressing c-Abl(K-R) or Arg(K-R) (Fig. 4B). Moreover, pretreatment with 1 and 10 μm STI571 blocked H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of catalase (Fig. 4C). These findings collectively demonstrate that catalase is phosphorylated by a c-Abl- and/or Arg-dependent mechanism in the oxidative stress response. Catalase Is Regulated by Phosphorylation at Tyr231 and Tyr386—To define the phosphorylation sites, catalase was incubated with c-Abl and then subjected to tryptic digestion. Analysis of the fragments by high pressure liquid chromatography separation and Edman sequencing demonstrated phosphorylation at Tyr231 and Tyr386. Compared with wild-type catalase, mutation of Tyr231 to Phe was associated with a decrease in c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Mutation of Tyr386 to Phe was also associated with a decrease in c-Abl phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). The catalase(Y231F/Y386F) double mutant exhibited comparable decreases in c-Abl phosphorylation, but not complete abrogation (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained for Arg-mediated phosphorylation of the catalase mutants (data not shown). Because these findings indicate that phosphorylation of catalase by c-Abl and Arg is not restricted to Tyr231 and Tyr386, we generated mutants at the other 14 tyrosine sites. The absence of a detectable effect of these mutants on c-Abl and Arg phosphorylation indicated that Tyr231 and Tyr386 are the predominant sites (data not shown). To determine whether in vivo phosphorylation of catalase is affected by the tyrosine mutations, 293 cells were transfected to express Myc-c-Abl and FLAG-catalase or FLAG-catalase mutated at Tyr231, Tyr386, or Tyr231/Tyr386. Immunoblot analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) antibody showed a substantial decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of the catalase(Y231F) mutant (Fig. 5B). The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was also decreased with catalase(Y386F) and the double mutant (Fig. 5B). Similar findings were obtained when Express-Arg was expressed with wild-type catalase and the Tyr-to-Phe mutants (Fig. 5C). To determine whether catalase is regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr231 and Tyr386, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from 293 cells expressing FLAG-catalase and c-Abl or c-Abl(K-R) were analyzed for catalase activity. The results demonstrate that, compared with wild-type c-Abl, cotransfection of c-Abl(K-R) substantially decreased catalase activity (Fig. 5D). Compared with wild-type FLAG-catalase, the activity was decreased when FLAG-catalase(Y231F) or FLAG-catalase(Y386F) was expressed with c-Abl (Fig. 5D). The demonstration that the activity of the FLAG-catalase(Y231F/Y386F) double mutant was comparable to that of the single Tyr-to-Phe mutants indicates that phosphorylation at both Tyr231 and Tyr386 is needed for stimulation of catalase activity (Fig. 5D). Moreover, the inhibitory effects of c-Abl(K-R) on catalase activity were much less pronounced with these mutants than with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5D). Similar results were obtained when the wild-type and mutant FLAG-catalase proteins were expressed with Arg or Arg(K-R) (data not shown). These findings indicate that (i) c-Abl and Arg activate catalase by phosphorylation at both Tyr231 and Tyr386, and (ii) expression of c-Abl(K-R) or Arg(K-R) attenuates catalase activity. c-Abl and Arg Regulate Intracellular H 2 O 2 Levels—Intracellular H2O2 levels are controlled predominantly by catalase and the glutathione redox cycle. To assess the protective effects of catalase, BSO was used to inhibit the glutathione redox cycle by depleting intracellular levels of glutathione (7Bai J. Rodriguez A. Melendez J. Cederbaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). MEFs were treated with BSO and monitored for intracellular H2O2 levels by fluorescence spectrophotometry using the oxidant-sensitive dye DCF-DA. The results demonstrate that, compared with wild-type MEFs, arg –/– cells exhibited somewhat higher intracellular H2O2 levels (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Increased H2O2 levels were more apparent in c-abl –/– cells (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Importantly, even higher levels of H2O2 were found in c-abl –/– arg –/– cells (Fig. 6A, upper panel). Treatment of the wild-type MEFs with H2O2 was associated with an increase in H2O2 levels (Fig. 6A, lower panel). H2O2 treatment of c-abl –/– and arg –/– cells was also associated with higher intracellular H2O2 levels (Fig. 6A, lower panel). Moreover, the finding that the c-abl –/– arg –/– cells exhibited a striking increase in H2O2 levels supports more pronounced dysregulation of catalase than that observed in c-abl –/– or arg –/– cells (Fig. 6A, lower panel). Analysis of three experiments confirmed significant differences for H2O2 levels in control and H2O2-treated c-abl –/– arg –/– cells compared with wild-type, c-abl –/–, and arg –/– cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, analysis of two independent clones of c-abl –/– arg –/– cells indicated that the substantial differences were not due to clonal variation (Fig. 6B). To confirm the basis for dysregulation of H2O2 homeostasis, c-abl –/– arg –/– cells were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing Arg (24Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that Arg expression was associated with decreases in H2O2 l"

The TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) or ADAM17, is currently being explored as a target for anti-inflammatory drugs (1Sekut L. Connolly K. Exp. Opin. Invest.

Drug Discovery Today. 2001; 6: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The genes for ADAM8, ADAM15, and MDC-L have been cloned, and proteolytic activity has been demonstrated for the corresponding proteins (3Amour A. Knight C.G. English W.R. Webster A. Slocombe P.M.

They are likely to play roles in ectodomain shedding, the process by which biologically active, soluble forms of cytokines, growth factors, and their receptors are released from membrane-bound precursors.ADAM8 is expressed mainly in cells of the immune system, particularly monocytes and granulocytes (6Yoshiyama K. Higuchi Y. Kataoka M. Matsuura K. Yamamoto S. Genomics. 1997; 41: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, its expression has been shown to be inducible by lipopolysaccharide and γ-interferon (7Kataoka M. Yoshiyama K. Matsuura K. Hijiya N. Higuchi Y. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and by TNFα in the central nervous system (8Schlomann U. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Yamamoto S. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7964-7971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ADAM8 was recently shown to be a novel osteoclast-stimulating factor, induced during osteoclast differentiation from monocytic precursors (9Choi S.J. Han J.H. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ADAM8 is also highly expressed in eosinophils (from Incyte Genomics, Lifeseq® Gold clone tissue distribution), one of the most important effector cell types at the site of inflammation in allergic asthma. ADAM8 may therefore represent a therapeutic target for treatment of allergy and/or asthma.ADAM15 is a membrane-bound disintegrin metalloprotease containing an RGD integrin-binding sequence, which may function in cell adhesion through binding to integrins αvβ3, α5β1, and α6β1 (10Zhang X.-P.

Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ADAM15 is found in human aortic smooth muscle and cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells (14Herren B. Raines E.W. Ross R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although ADAM15 is not expressed in normal blood vessels in vivo, it has been detected in developing atherosclerotic lesions (14Herren B. Raines E.W. Ross R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and has also been shown to be up-regulated in osteoarthritic versus normal human cartilage (15Bohm B.B. Aigner T. Gehrsitz A. Blobel C.P. Kalden J.R. Burkhardt H. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1946-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, ADAM15 may play a role in atherosclerosis and/or cartilage degeneration.Another member of the ADAM family, MDC-L or ADAM28, was shown to be specifically expressed by lymphocytes in two alternative forms, a membrane-bound form, MDC-Lm, and a secreted protein, MDC-Ls (16Roberts C.M. Tani P.H. Bridges L.C. Laszik Z. Bowditch R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29251-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The lymphocyte-specific expression of MDC-L suggests that it may have an important immunological function, but its in vivo substrate(s) are unknown. ADAM28 is also highly expressed in epididymis (17Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to catalyze limited cleavage of myelin basic protein (4Howard L. Zheng Y. Horrocks M. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have characterized the proteolytic specificity of ADAM8, ADAM15. and MDC-L for both synthetic peptides and protein substrates. By screening a library of synthetic peptides, we show that soluble recombinant forms of these three enzymes have similar proteolytic substrate specificity, clearly distinct from that of ADAM17/TACE. We also show that ADAM8 is able to cleave membrane-bound CD23, the low affinity IgE receptor, in transfected cells and human macrophage cell lines. ADAM15 and MDC-L, but not ADAM17, were also able to cleave CD23. ADAM8-dependent, soluble CD23 release required proteolytically active ADAM8, and a physical association of ADAM8 was observed with the membrane-bound form of CD23. The proteolytic release of soluble CD23, by an unidentified metalloprotease activity, has been shown to cause up-regulation of IgE production and the induction of inflammatory cytokines (18Bonnefoy J.-Y.

Because ADAM8 is expressed in the same cell types as CD23, we conclude that ADAM8 can contribute to ectodomain shedding of CD23, and thus is a potential target for intervention in allergy and inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPCR and cDNA Cloning—The pro-domain and protease domain of human ADAM 8 were amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase and the primers 5A8, 5′-GGAATCCGCCATGCGCGGCCTCGGGCTC-3′, and 3FLAGA8, 5′-CGGGATCCTCTAGACTACCCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCCCGGCGAGGCACACCGACTGCGGCCGCTCCAAAAAGCTCTC-3′. The template used for the PCR was a clone from Incyte Genomics (from ovarian tumor tissue) containing the coding sequence for the complete pro-domain but only part of the protease domain of ADAM8. By using the oligonucleotides described above, the resulting PCR product contained the pro-domain and full-length protease domains and a C-terminal FLAG epitope to be used for immunodetection and purification. The cDNA was initially cloned into pZeroBlunt (Invitrogen), the sequence verified, and then sub-cloned into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Similar expression vectors were constructed for ADAM15, MDC-L (ADAM28), and ADAM17/TACE. ADAM17 was amplified from THP-1 cells first-strand cDNA, ADAM15 from human heart cDNA, and MDC-L from human thymus cDNA.The cDNA for full-length ADAM8 was constructed as follows. The cDNA coding for the pro-domain and protease domain was ligated to a human EST clone (IMAGE 1271035, purchased from Human Genetics), encoding the disintegrin, cysteine-rich, membrane-spanning, and cytoplasmic domains of ADAM8. The full-length sequence was then cloned into pCDNA3(–) for expression in mammalian cells. Sequence verification of the resulting cDNA showed an in-frame deletion within the cytoplasmic domain when compared with the published sequences. Similar alternative splicing has been observed for the MDC-L (ADAM28) C-terminal domain (19Haidl I.D. Huber G. Eichmann K. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 283: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to produce a catalytically inactive ADAM8 (H604A and H608A). cDNA clones (Genestorms) for expression of human CD23, CD27L, FasL, CD40L, CD30L, TRAIL, and TNFα were purchased from Invitrogen.Antibodies—M2-anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody and M2-anti-FLAG-agarose, for purification of FLAG-tagged soluble ADAM proteins, were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal antiserum against full-length ADAM8 protein was generated by immunizing rabbits with peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequence, CPIQRKQGAGAPTAP, conjugated to activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the N-terminal cysteine. The resulting antiserum detected a number of specific bands in ADAM8-transfected HEK293 cells that were not detected by pre-immune sera or by the specific antisera in mock-transfected cells (see Fig. 5, A and C). Mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody and FITC anti-V5 were purchased from Invitrogen. FITC anti-human CD23 and anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences and Roche Applied Science, respectively.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Soluble Human ADAM Proteins from the Medium of Sf9 Cells—Recombinant baculovirus for expression of the prodomain and protease domain of ADAM8 was generated from the pFastBac1 construct using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were infected with virus, and the medium was collected after 72 h and analyzed for expression of ADAM8 by SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotting with M2-αFLAG antibody. Media from the infected cells were concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration and exchanged to TBS by repeated addition and reconcentration. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to remove debris, and M2-αFLAG-agarose was added with mixing overnight at 4 °C. The resin was loaded into a column and washed with TBS, followed by elution of the bound material with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, and immediate neutralization by addition of 12.5 μl/ml 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. Fractions from the purification were analyzed as above by Western blotting. Soluble ADAM17, ADAM15, and MDC-L proteins were generated similarly to ADAM8.Detection and Assay of Proteolytic Activity of Recombinant ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, and ADAM17—Forty nine different peptides were synthesized for testing protease activity. The peptides comprised the following: (i) a collection of substrates for other proteases and (ii) a number of sequences corresponding to membrane proximal cleavage sites of various proteins postulated to be released by metalloproteases (including those published by Roghani et al. (21Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3531-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) for ADAM9/MDC9). In order to use the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, or FRET, for the assay, the peptides were labeled at the C terminus with Dabcyl and at the N terminus with Aedans. Cleavage of the peptides could be monitored by the increase in Aedans fluorescence at 460 nm (excitation 360 nm) as a result of the decrease in proximity of the Dabcyl quencher. The assay was performed by diluting the soluble ADAM protease domain in assay buffer, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 0.001% Brij-35. The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate to a final concentration of 20 μm in an assay volume of 100 μl, for initial screening, and then different concentrations, as indicated in figure legends, for analysis of affinities. The assay was run for 20–60 min at room temperature. The cleavage site(s) for ADAM8 within four peptides were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight.Expression of Recombinant ADAM8, CD23, and TNF Family Proteins in Mammalian Cells—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. The cDNA constructs described above were used to transfect the HEK293 cells using Effectene® (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were placed under selection in 500 μg/ml G418 and/or 300 μg/ml Zeocin to create stable transfectants. The medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete® protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitations were performed on both media and cell lysates, using rabbit polyclonal anti-ADAM8 antiserum, or mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody, and protein A-Sepharose. The media, cell lysates, or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (5–15% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-ADAM8 polyclonal antiserum or anti-V5 antibody (for proteins expressed from Genestorms clones), secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and fluorography using ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences).CD23 Release in Macrophage, B Cell, and Transfected HEK293 Lines—U937 cells were harvested, washed, and incubated in HBS or HBS containing soluble recombinant ADAM8 or ADAM17 for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then chilled, washed, and stained for surface expression of intact, endogenous CD23 with FITC anti-human CD23.RPMI8866 cells, JY cells, or HEK293 cells transfected with ADAM8 and CD23 were incubated overnight at 37 °C, in the absence or presence of 0.4–12.5 μm MMP Inhibitor II (Calbiochem), after which the supernatant was analyzed for the presence of soluble CD23 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pharmingen).RESULTSPeptide Substrate Screening of Soluble, Recombinant ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, and ADAM17—Soluble pro-domains and protease domains of ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, and ADAM17, tagged with C-terminal FLAG epitopes, were produced in Sf9 insect cells and purified from the media by FLAG affinity chromatography. Soluble ADAM17 appeared as a doublet at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE (results not shown), corresponding to the predicted size for the metalloprotease domain after furin cleavage of the pro-domain. Activity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by cleavage of a peptide containing the TNFα cleavage site (results not shown). Purified soluble ADAM8 had an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa (results not shown), corresponding to the predicted size for the uncleaved precursor form, containing the pro-domain and metalloprotease domain. This form of the protein showed no cleavage activity on any of 49 different peptides tested. Upon storage for a few weeks at 4 °C, a lower band of ∼25 kDa appeared, and cleavage activity could be demonstrated (as described below) for a number of synthetic peptide substrates. Similar molecular weights (∼50 and ∼34 kDa) were observed by Schlomann et al. (20Schlomann U. Wildeboer D. Webster A. Antropova O. Zeuschner D. Knight C.G. Docherty A.J. Lambert M. Skelton L.

The lower 25-kDa band we obtained was subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing. The resulting sequence was RPRPGD, which corresponds to the region between the pro- and metalloprotease domains, where other ADAM proteases, such as ADAM17, have a furin cleavage site. The cleavage of soluble ADAM8 upon storage suggested an autocatalytic activation mechanism, which was confirmed later by lack of processing of proteolytically inactive human ADAM8 (Fig. 5A) and demonstrated recently by Schlomann et al.

Recombinant ADAM15 and MDC-L were also expressed as soluble uncleaved forms which auto-activated after storage in solution at 4 °C (not shown).Forty nine different peptides were tested as substrates for the active soluble forms of ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, and ADAM17. The peptides included a collection of substrates for other proteases, as well as a number of sequences corresponding to membrane proximal cleavage sites of various proteins postulated to be released by metalloproteases (including those published by Roghani et al.

In order to use the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for the assay, the peptides were labeled at the C terminus with Dabcyl and at the N terminus with Aedans. Cleavage of the peptides was monitored by the increase in Aedans fluorescence at 460 nm (excitation 360 nm) as a result of the decrease in proximity of the Dabcyl quencher at the opposite end of each peptide. Soluble recombinant ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, or ADAM17 (50–100 ng of protein, 1–2 pmol) were diluted in assay buffer, and the reactions were initiated by addition of each of 49 different peptide substrates, respectively, to a final concentration of 20 μm.Fig. 1 shows the relative activities for the different peptides (numbered A1 to H6) expressed in arbitrary units, normalized by setting the activity for peptide F3 to one unit. This peptide was cleaved by all enzymes and thus was chosen to represent a standard by which to compare the relative activity of the various enzymes for their potential to cleave the different peptide substrates. Whereas ADAM8, ADAM15, and MDC-L showed a very similar activity profile for the various peptides, ADAM17 appeared to have a significantly different specificity and was able to cleave fewer of the peptides than the other three proteases. ADAM8, ADAM15, and MDC-L showed the highest activity for peptide C3, followed by B6 and G3. In contrast, the specificity of peptide cleavage for ADAM17 was quite distinct, with maximal cleavage being observed for peptide E6, followed by F3 and D6, both containing the authentic TNFα cleavage site, and peptide H4.Fig. 1Peptide substrate screening of ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, and ADAM17. Soluble recombinant ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, or ADAM17 (50–100 ng of protein, 1–2 pmol) were diluted in assay buffer, and the reaction was initiated by addition of each of 49 different peptide substrates (numbered A1 to H6, every other peptide is labeled in Fig. 1) to a final concentration of 20 μm. The assays were run for 60 min at room temperature, and the rates of the reactions were determined from the slope of the kinetic increase in fluorescence for each peptide. The rates of cleavage of the peptides are plotted as relative fluorescence units per min, normalized by setting the activity for peptide F3 (cleaved by all 4 proteases) to 1 unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to compare directly the concentration dependence of cleavage of different peptides by ADAM8, initial rates of cleavage were measured for peptides C3 (named CatE1), a closely related peptide D2 (CatE), peptide B6 (corresponding to the cleavage site for CD27 ligand), and peptide F3 (corresponding to the TNFα release cleavage site). Fig. 2 shows the proteolytic activity (in relative fluorescence units per min) as a function of peptide concentration for peptides CatE1, CatE, CD27L, and TNFα, respectively. The curves were fitted to the data using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). The best fits for the enzyme kinetic data were obtained using the Hill equation for allosteric behavior. Hill coefficients of 3, for peptides CatE1 and CatE, and 2, for CD27L and TNFα, respectively, were derived, suggesting the existence of cooperative active sites for ADAM8. Substrate inhibition was observed at peptide concentrations higher than those shown on the graphs (data not shown). The peptide for which ADAM8 had the highest apparent affinity was CatE1, and half-maximal cleavage activity was observed at 2.5 μm. Half-maximal cleavage for the other 3 peptides was observed between 5 and 6 μm. Table I shows the major cleavage site, determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, for ADAM8 within each peptide, as indicated by a caret within the peptide sequence.Fig. 2Kinetic analysis of ADAM8 cleavage for four different peptide substrates. Soluble recombinant ADAM8 was diluted in assay buffer, and the reaction was initiated by addition of the substrate to different final concentrations. The assay was run for 30 min at room temperature. The proteolytic activity for each of the peptides is shown in relative fluorescence units (Rfu) per min as a function of substrate concentration. The curves were fitted to the data using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). ADAM8 reached 50% of maximum activity at 2.5 μm for CatE1 peptide, 5 μm for CatE, 6.8 μm for CD27L, and 6.5 μm for TNFα peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICleavage sites for ADAM8 within synthetic peptides (X = Aedans-E, Z = Dabcyl-K)Peptide nameCleavage siteRef.CatE1XKPAKF^FRLZThis study (C3)CatEXKPAAF^FRLZThis study (D2)CD27LXRFAQA^QQQLPZThis study (B6)TNFαXPLAQAVRS^SSZThis study (F3)TNFαSPLA^QAVRSSSRK3Amour A.

In order to investigate substrate specificity for protein substrates, the ability of ADAM8 to cleave a number of membrane-bound proteins was tested. HEK293 cells were transfected with vector alone or cDNA for expression of V5 epitope-tagged CD27 ligand, CD40 ligand, CD30 ligand, or CD23. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, washed, and incubated in HBS or soluble recombinant ADAM8 protease domain diluted in HBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then chilled, washed, and stained for surface expression of the intact membrane protein with FITC anti-V5. As shown in Fig. 3A, CD27 ligand and CD40 ligand were resistant to cleavage by ADAM8. However, CD30 ligand and, in particular, CD23, the low affinity IgE receptor, were susceptible to cleavage by ADAM8, as shown by the downward shift in cell-surface FITC anti-V5 staining. CD30 ligand staining intensity decreased by 26% after treatment with ADAM8. CD23 appeared to be the most susceptible of the proteins tested to ADAM8 ectodomain cleavage, resulting in a 64% decrease in mean fluorescence intensity for CD23 staining. Therefore, cleavage of CD23 by ADAM15, MDC-L, and ADAM17 was compared with that by ADAM8. The data in Fig. 3B show that CD23 was similarly susceptible to cleavage by soluble recombinant ADAM15 and MDC-L but not by an amount of soluble ADAM17 with equivalent activity on a peptide substrate, once again distinguishing their specificity, similarly to that observed with synthetic peptide substrates.Fig. 3Screening for ectodomain cleavage of transfected CD23 and TNF family proteins by soluble ADAM8, ADAM15, MDC-L, and ADAM17.

The goal of the current studies was to characterize the receptor complex mediating the increased transcription of IL-8. We demonstrate that scavenger receptor class A, types I and II, lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, and CD36 are not responsible for the increase in IL-8. Using dominant-negative constructs and antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate a role for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as the ox-PAPC receptor mediating IL-8 transcription. We demonstrate that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein is also necessary because phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C pretreatment inhibited the effect of ox-PAPC. CD14, a GPI-anchored protein that associates with TLR4 in mediating lipopolysaccharide action, did not appear to mediate ox-PAPC action because ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription was not blocked by anti-CD14 neutralizing antibodies nor was it augmented by the addition of soluble CD14 or overexpression of membrane CD14. Instead, anti-TLR4 antibodies immunoprecipitated a 37-kDa protein that also bound ox-PAPC. A protein of this same size was found in aerolysin overlays used to detect GPI-anchored proteins. Therefore, these studies suggest that ox-PAPC may initially bind to a 37-kDa GPI-anchored protein, which interacts with TLR4 to induce IL-8 transcription.

These phospholipids have been shown to accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions of mice and rabbits. Antibodies that recognize these lipids demonstrate their presence in human lesions. Furthermore, PAPC oxidation products are increased in apoptotic cells (4Huber J. Vales A. Mitulovic G. Blumer M. Schmid R. Witztum J.L. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

We have determined that treatment of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and HeLa cells with oxidized PAPC (ox-PAPC) increased the synthesis of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine involved in monocyte transmigration and retention in the vessel wall. We have also determined that isomers of 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PEIPC) and to a lesser extent 1-palmitoyl-2-oxovaleroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (POVPC) are responsible for most of the effect of ox-PAPC to induce IL-8 (5Subbanagounder G.

The increase in IL-8 was shown to be mediated by increased transcription; importantly, native PAPC was not found to have an effect (6Yeh M. Leitinger N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Reddy S.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The goal of these studies was to characterize the receptor responsible for the ability of ox-PAPC to increase IL-8 transcription. Several lines of evidence suggest that the induction of IL-8 by ox-PAPC is receptor-mediated. The increase in message is rapid with accumulation being observed as early as 15 min after treatment with ox-PAPC (6Yeh M. Leitinger N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Reddy S.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PEIPC, the major bioactive lipid in ox-PAPC, is active at concentrations as low as 100 nm, and its effect is saturable and maximal at 1 μg/ml. We first examined the possibility that ox-PAPC and its derivatives act on a receptor belonging to the scavenger receptor family. Recent studies demonstrated that autoantibodies from apoE-deficient mice that bound to oxidized phospholipids (e.g. EO6 antibody) inhibited 60–80% of the binding of copper-oxidized LDL to scavenger receptors on mouse peritoneal macrophages (7Horkko S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Although these particular studies were performed using macrophages, they suggested a possible role for scavenger receptors in endothelial cells mediating the effect of ox-PAPC. The expression of several known scavenger receptors was examined in the current study. Scavenger receptor class A, types I and II (SRA I/II), is a multifunctional receptor that binds to a broad variety of ligands including oxidized LDL (8de Winther M.P. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Another class A receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), binds to modified LDL as well (9Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, binds to the lipid moiety of oxidized LDL (10Nicholson A.C. Frieda S. Pearce A. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). LOX-1, an oxidized LDL receptor belonging structurally to the C-type lectin family, was initially identified in vascular endothelial cells (11Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). We present evidence that these receptors are not responsible for ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis. We also examined the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and associated proteins in mediating the action of ox-PAPC. C3H/HeJ mice have a missense mutation in the Tlr4 gene resulting in nonfunctional TLR4 (12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). These mice are resistant to atherosclerosis, and aortic endothelial cells from these mice are unresponsive to MM-LDL (13Shi W. Haberland M.E. Jien M.L. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We hypothesized a role for TLR4 additionally because of the epitope similarity of bacterial lipids, known regulators of TLR4 (14Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar), and oxidized phospholipids (recognized by the antibody EO6) (7Horkko S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N.

We further hypothesized that, like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the interaction of ox-PAPC with TLR4 may be enhanced by binding to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein. These studies present evidence for a role of both TLR4 and a GPI-anchored protein in mediating ox-PAPC induction of IL-8 synthesis in endothelial cells.

PCR was performed on the resulting cDNA using primers (5′→3′) specific for human TLR4 (forward, TGGATACGTTTCCTTATAAG; reverse, GAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC), human CD14 (forward, GGAAAGAAGCTAAAGCACTT; reverse, TTTAGAAACGGCTCTAGGTT), human MD-2 (forward, GAAGCTCAGAAGCAGTATTGGGTC; reverse, GGTTGGTGTAGGATGACAAACTCC), human CD36 (forward, GCTATAGGGATCCATTTTTGAG; reverse, CTAGCACACCATATGATG), human SRA I/II (forward, TGGGAACATTCTCAGACCTTGAG; reverse, TTGTCCAAAGTGAGCTGCCTTGT), human MARCO (forward, GGTGGTCCAAGTTCTGAATCTG; reverse, GAGACCCAGGTCTCCTTTCTC), human LOX-1 primer set 1 (forward, GATCCAGACTGTGAAGGACCAG; reverse, GCGCCTCGGACTCTAAATAAG), human LOX-1 primer set 2 (forward, TTACTCTCCATGGTGGTGCC; reverse, AGCTTCTTCTGCTTGTTGCC), human LOX-1 primer set 3 (forward, GGCTGCTGCGACTCTAGG; reverse, AGTGGGGCATCAAAGGAG), or human GAPDH (forward, TCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTA; reverse, ATGGACTGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTC). ELISAs—HAEC grown and treated in a 96-well plate were fixed with 2% formaldehyde. Cells were left unpermeabilized or were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 before cell-surface ELISAs were performed using anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibodies (eBioscience), anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies (R & D Systems), irrelevant anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase alone. After incubation with secondary antibodies, o-phenylenediamine substrate was added to the plate, which was then read in a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. Additional cell-surface ELISAs were performed using anti-histones, anti-Rab8, anti-β-coatomer protein, and anti-IκB-α antibodies. For MCP-1/JE and IL-8 ELISAs, cells were treated with test additives in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 4–18 h at 37 °C after preincubation for 16 h in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. ELISAs were performed on the collected cell supernatants using commercially available kits. Transfections—Cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture dishes. Transfections were performed with 0.1–1 μg of DNA/well (dominant-negative TLR4 or empty vector, sense or antisense TLR4 oligonucleotides, human CD14 or empty vector along with the IL-8 promoter/luciferase construct). Superfect reagent or Effectene (Qiagen) was used for transfections according to the manufacturer's protocol. 4–16 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with ox-PAPC, LPS, TNF-α, or PMA for 8–12 h. After treatment, total cell lysates were collected and analyzed for luciferase activity. PI-PLC Treatment—HAEC were pretreated with medium alone or PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml). Cells were rinsed then incubated with medium, ox-PAPC (30 μg/ml), LPS (1 ng/ml), TNF-α (5 ng/ml), or PMA (500 pg/ml) for 4 h. After the treatment period, supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-8. Immunoprecipitations—Cells were grown to confluency, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then scraped twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in a small amount of Buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). This suspension was transferred to a 2-ml tube, spun briefly at 800 × g for 30 s, and resuspended in Buffer A containing Sigma protease inhibitor mixture and 1 μm Na3VO4. This suspension was sonicated (5 times for 5 s each, maximum power), transferred to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatants were then used for immunoprecipitations with anti-human TLR4 polyclonal antibodies using the Seize® Primary Mammalian Immunoprecipitation Kit (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—The protein content of cell lysates was determined by Bio-Rad assay, and equal amounts of protein were denatured by boiling and reduced in β-mercaptoethanol followed by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein was transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) and immunoblotted. Secondary anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used for detection using chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce) and x-ray film exposure (Kodak). GPI-linked proteins were visualized using the pro-aerolysin overlay assay as described previously (22Sotgia F. Razani B. Bonuccelli G. Schubert W. Battista M. Lee H. Capozza F. Schubert A.L. Minetti C. Buckley J.T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3905-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Statistics—The data, analyzed using the StatView computer program (Abacus Concepts), are presented as mean values ± S.D. The data are representative of at least two experiments producing similar results. Role of Scavenger Receptors in Ox-PAPC Induction of IL-8 — Although many studies have been performed regarding scavenger receptors in macrophages, less has been done to elucidate scavenger receptor expression in human aortic endothelial cells. Therefore, to better understand the role of endothelial scavenger receptors in ox-PAPC action, we determined which of the known scavenger receptors are present in HAEC and whether oxidized phospholipids affect their expression. RT-PCR was performed to determine the presence of CD36, LOX-1, SRA I/II, and MARCO on HAEC. HAEC were found to express low levels of CD36 mRNA and no detectable levels of SRA I/II or MARCO mRNA (data not shown). RT-PCR showed LOX-1 to be extremely low or not present with three primer sets being utilized along with modifications of the PCR protocol (varying MgCl2, annealing temperature, cycle length). Our results were confirmed by a study demonstrating that LOX-1 expression was negligible by RT-PCR in aortae without atherosclerosis (23Kataoka H. Kume N. Miyamoto S. Minami M. Moriwaki H. Murase T. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Hashimoto N. Kita T. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Treatment of HAEC with ox-PAPC was found to increase the mRNA levels for CD36, whereas levels for SRA I/II, MARCO, and LOX-1 remained undetectable (data not shown). Next, we sought to determine whether CD36 is necessary for MCP-1/JE production. MAEC from CD36 knockout mice (courtesy of Dr. Maria Feggraio, Cornell University) and parental C57Bl/6 mice were treated with medium alone, LPS (1 ng/ml), MM-LDL (250 μg/ml), or native LDL (250 μg/ml) (Fig. 1). MAEC produced MCP-1/JE in response to both LPS and MM-LDL but not in response to native LDL. MAEC from CD36 knockout mice produced MCP-1/JE in response to MM-LDL at levels comparable with those from cells treated with LPS. In addition, CD36-blocking antibodies and CD36 peptides had no effect on HAEC treated with ox-PAPC and PEIPC (data not shown). These results indicate that CD36 is not required for MM-LDL- and ox-PAPC-induced signaling. Presence and Function of Toll-like Receptor 4 —Previous studies by Zhang et al. (24Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) demonstrated that human dermal microvascular endothelial cells express significant levels of TLR4 mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR, and protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Similarly, Frantz et al. (25Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) found that rat coronary microvascular endothelial cells express high levels of TLR4 mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis. However, no studies have been performed that examine large vessel endothelial cell expression of TLR4. To determine whether HAEC express TLR4 mRNA, two methods were used: RT-PCR to detect mRNA levels and cell-surface ELISAs to detect protein levels. It was determined by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from HAEC that they express TLR4 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Two other ox-PAPC-responsive cell types, HeLa cells and human microvascular endothelial cells, were also found to express TLR4 mRNA (Fig. 2B). Results from cell-surface ELISAs parallel the RT-PCR results (Fig. 2C), indicating that HAEC express TLR4 protein on the cell surface. Next, we determined whether TLR4 is involved in ox-PAPC-induced signaling. We previously demonstrated that ox-PAPC increases IL-8 transcription in HeLa cells and activates an IL-8 promoter/luciferase construct (6Yeh M. Leitinger N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Reddy S.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We used this system to examine the role of TLR4 in the ox-PAPC induction of IL-8. HeLa cells were transfected with a dominant-negative construct of TLR4; an IL-8 promoter/luciferase construct was utilized to detect ox-PAPC-induced signal transduction. The dominant-negative construct of TLR4 had no effect on basal IL-8 transcription; the effect of PMA on transcription was actually stimulated in five separate experiments. However, the effect of ox-PAPC was strongly inhibited in cells expressing dominant-negative TLR4 compared with those transfected with vector alone, suggesting that TLR4 plays a role in ox-PAPC-induced signal transduction (Fig. 3A). In addition, HeLa cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides targeting TLR4 along with the pIL-8/luciferase construct. There was a significant decrease in the luciferase levels of cells transfected with the antisense oligonucleotides compared with those transfected with the sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3B). No effect on TNF-α-induced IL-8 synthesis was observed. Role of GPI-anchored Proteins in Ox-PAPC-induced Signaling—Following the paradigm of the LPS receptor complex (containing GPI-anchored CD14 and TLR4), we hypothesized that ox-PAPC may also bind to a GPI-anchored protein interacting with TLR4. To address this hypothesis, we treated HAEC with bacterial PI-PLC, which releases GPI-anchored proteins from the cell-surface, and then incubated the cells with ox-PAPC. Supernatants were then collected and assayed for IL-8. Pretreatment with PI-PLC was found to decrease IL-8 production in response to ox-PAPC and LPS (Fig. 4), suggesting that a GPI-anchored protein plays a key role in ox-PAPC-induced signaling. PI-PLC did not alter the induction of IL-8 by TNF-α or PMA. We next investigated the role of CD14 in ox-PAPC action because CD14 is known to complex with TLR4 (26Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). HAEC were found to express CD14 mRNA (Fig. 5A). Results from cell-surface ELISAs paralleled the RT-PCR results (Fig. 5B), indicating that HAEC express CD14 on the cell surface. We confirmed that CD14 staining was localized to the cell surface because the staining for the intracellular markers (histones, Rab8, β-coatomer protein, and IκB-α) increased with permeabilization, whereas the staining for CD14 did not (data not shown). To assess the role of CD14 in ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis, neutralizing anti-CD14 antibodies were used. Although these antibodies effectively blocked LPS-induced IL-8 synthesis in HAEC, they did not block the effect of ox-PAPC (Fig. 5C). To better assess the role of CD14, HAEC were treated with ox-PAPC or LPS in the presence of soluble CD14. As shown in Fig. 5D, the induction of IL-8 by ox-PAPC was unchanged in the presence of soluble CD14 compared with medium alone, whereas the effect of LPS was strongly increased. In addition, CHO-K1 cells, which express endogenous TLR4 (27Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), were transfected with a human CD14 construct and an IL-8 promoter/luciferase construct to determine whether membrane CD14 could augment the response to ox-PAPC. Upon ox-PAPC treatment, luciferase expression levels of CHO-K1/CD14 cells did not significantly differ from cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5E). Upon LPS treatment, however, luciferase expression levels of CHO-K1/CD14 cells were three times higher than that of CHO-K1/empty vector. Thus, neither soluble nor membrane CD14 stimulated an ox-PAPC action. In addition, the expression of MD-2, another member of the LPS receptor complex, was examined. Although HeLa cells are responsive to ox-PAPC, they do not express MD-2 mRNA (Fig. 6), indicating that MD-2 is not required for ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis in HeLa cells. After determining that CD14 and MD-2 were not necessary for ox-PAPC induction of-IL-8, we then examined the binding of ox-PAPC to other TLR4-associated proteins. EO6, an antibody which binds to oxidized phospholipids in the free form or bound to protein (7Horkko S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), bound to a protein of ∼37 kDa that was immunoprecipitated from lysates of ox-PAPC-treated cells with anti-TLR4 antibodies (Fig. 7A); binding of EO6 occurred to a much greater extent in ox-PAPC-treated cells versus medium-treated cells. Only one prominent EO6-binding protein was observed in the immunoprecipitations. A protein of this same size was also seen using an aerolysin overlay to detect GPI-anchored proteins (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that ox-PAPC may initially bind to a 37-kDa GPI-anchored protein which interacts with TLR4 to induce signaling. Our previous studies demonstrated that ox-PAPC increases IL-8 transcription in HAEC and HeLa cells (6Yeh M. Leitinger N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Reddy S.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The current studies characterize the receptor responsible for this effect of ox-PAPC. We first examined the hypothesis that scavenger receptors mediate the effect of ox-PAPC. Scavenger receptors have been studied extensively in macrophages in the context of atherosclerosis (28Boullier A. Bird D.A. Chang M.K. Dennis E.A. Friedman P. Gillotre-Taylor K. Horkko S. Palinski W. Quehenberger O. Shaw P. Steinberg D. Terpstra V. Witztum J.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 29Dhaliwal B.S. Steinbrecher U.P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 286: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Linton M.F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but their role in endothelial cells is less clear. We demonstrate that HAEC do not express SRA I/II, MARCO, or LOX-1; expression of these genes did not increase upon ox-PAPC treatment. HAEC express low levels of CD36 mRNA, which is up-regulated by ox-PAPC treatment (data not shown), similar to what was observed in macrophages. However, we present evidence that MAEC lacking CD36 are still responsive to MM-LDL, of which ox-PAPC is a major bioactive component (2Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), and that HAEC treated with CD36-blocking antibodies or CD36 peptides are still responsive to ox-PAPC (data not shown). This suggests that CD36, although important in macrophage activation (31Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), is not necessary for endothelial cell activation by MM-LDL or ox-PAPC. Next we examined the presence and function of TLR4, the signaling component of the LPS receptor complex, in ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 expression. HAEC, HeLa cells, and human microvascular endothelial cells, all of which respond to ox-PAPC, express TLR4 (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, ox-PAPC induced TLR4 synthesis (Fig. 2A). Both dominant-negative constructs (Fig. 3A) and antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3B) specific for TLR4 significantly inhibited IL-8 promoter activation by ox-PAPC, indicating that TLR4 plays an important role in ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis. Previous studies demonstrate that TLR4 is expressed by endothelial cells in atherosclerotic plaques (32Edfeldt K. Swedenborg J. Hansson G.K. Yan Z.Q. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and an D299G TLR4 polymorphism, which attenuates receptor signaling, is associated with a decreased risk of atherosclerosis (33Kiechl S. Lorenz E. Reindl M. Wiedermann C.J. Oberhollenzer F. Bonora E. Willeit J. Schwartz D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). We also present evidence that GPI-anchored proteins are necessary for ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis. PI-PLC pretreatment significantly decreased ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis (Fig. 4). This inhibition could not be explained by the destruction of the bioactive lipids in ox-PAPC because the enzyme and the lipids were not present together. RT-PCR and cell-surface ELISAs demonstrate the presence of CD14 in HAEC (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, early passages of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (but not later passages) were previously shown to express CD14 (34Jersmann H.P. Hii C.S. Hodge G.L. Ferrante A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrate that CD14 is not involved in ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis (Fig. 5, C–E). Furthermore, we demonstrate that MD-2 is not necessary for ox-PAPC induction of IL-8 transcription in HeLa cells, as these cells do not express this molecule (Fig. 6). The role of MD-2 in ox-PAPC induction of IL-8 in endothelial cells is not known. Anti-TLR4 antibodies immunoprecipitate a 37-kDa protein that also binds ox-PAPC (Fig. 7A); a 37-kDa protein was also found in aerolysin overlays used to detect GPI-anchored proteins (Fig. 7B). This band may represent the GPI-anchored protein interacting with TLR4 that is responsible for ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 expression (it is not CD14, which has a molecular mass of 54 kDa). Previous studies by Miller et al. (35Miller Y.I. Viriyakosol S. Binder C.J. Feramisco J.R. Kirkland T.N. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1561-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) have concluded that MM-LDL induces actin polymerization and spreading of macrophages by binding to CD14 and signaling through the LPS receptor complex composed of TLR4 and MD-2. Miller et al. found that MM-LDL binding was significantly higher in macrophages of the J774 cell line and induced a greater F-actin response than in CD14-deficient LR-9 cells. Similar results were seen in CHO cells transfected with human CD14. They also demonstrated that CHO cells transfected with human TLR4 and MD-2 showed a higher F-actin response than cells transfected with TLR4 alone, suggesting that MD-2 is required for maximal responsiveness to MM-LDL. In contrast, our results demonstrate that CD14 is not required for ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis (Fig. 5, C–E) and that MD-2 is not necessary for ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription in HeLa cells. These differences may be due to the fact that MM-LDL is a mixture of possible ligands, including various proteins, cholesterol, and oxidized phospholipids, whereas ox-PAPC only contains oxidized phospholipids. Alternatively, there may exist different pathways leading to either an F-actin response or IL-8 transcription. There are several important similarities between the findings of the Miller studies (35Miller Y.I. Viriyakosol S. Binder C.J. Feramisco J.R. Kirkland T.N. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1561-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and our studies. Both studies suggest an important role for TLR4 in the actions of MM-LDL and ox-PAPC (a major bioactive component of MM-LDL) in macrophages and endothelial cells. Additionally, like our previous findings on ox-PAPC induction of IL-8 (6Yeh M. Leitinger N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Reddy S.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Miller et al. determined that activation of NF-κB, the most well studied downstream target of TLR4, is not required because an inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear translocation did not affect the F-actin response to MM-LDL. Thus, both studies suggest a novel pathway of TLR4 signaling that may be important in chronic inflammatory processes."

Recent studies indicate that an increased expression of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) by exercise may promote mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. To examine whether increased PGC-1α expression was also responsible for an increase of GLUT4 expression, transgenic mice that overexpress PGC-1α in skeletal muscles driven by a human α-skeletal actin promoter were made. PGC-1α was overexpresssed in skeletal muscles including type I and II fiber-rich muscles but not in the heart. With an increase of PGC-1α mRNA, type II fiber-rich muscles were redder, and genes of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were up-regulated in skeletal muscles, whereas the expression of GLUT4 mRNA was unexpectedly down-regulated. In parallel with a decrease of GLUT4 mRNA, an impairment of glycemic control after intraperitoneal insulin administration was observed. Thus, an increase of PGC-1α plays a role in increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation but not in increasing GLUT4 mRNA in skeletal muscles. Exercise training increases mitochondria and GLUT4 in skeletal muscles.

Thus, an increase of PGC-1α plays a role in increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation but not in increasing GLUT4 mRNA in skeletal muscles. Endurance exercise training improves physical performance by an enhancement of skeletal muscle respiratory capacity (1Booth F.W. Baldwin K.M. Rowell L. Shephard J.T. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 1075-1123Google Scholar) and decreases the incidence rate of diabetes mellitus (2Hu F.B. Sigal R.J. Rich-Edwards J.W. Colditz G.A. Solomon C.G. Willett W.C. Speizer F.E. Manson J.E. JAMA. 1999; 282: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). These effects might be related to increased numbers of mitochondria and the GLUT4 isoform of the glucose transporter in skeletal muscles, respectively. GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, is expressed in skeletal muscles, heart, and adipose tissues, and the number of GLUT4 on plasma membrane becomes a rate-limiting step for whole-body glucose clearance under physiological conditions (3Ren J.M.

PGC-1α is an inducible coactivator of nuclear receptors cloned from brown fat cell cDNA library because of its interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (9Puigserver P.

In contrast, although nucleotide sequences of GLUT4 promoter responsible for exercise training-induced up-regulation of GLUT4 expression have been elucidated (13Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Cooke D.W. Lane D.M. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14MacLean P.S. Zheng D. Jones J.P. Olson A.L. Dohm G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), little is known about the transcription factor(s) by which exercise training stimulates GLUT4 expression (15Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of PGC-1α in type II (fast-twitch) fibers drives the formation of type I (slow-twitch) fibers (16Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) and type I fibers express more GLUT4 with an increased glucose uptake than type II fibers (17Henriksen E.J. Bourey R.E. Rodnick K.J. Koranyi L. Permutt M.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E593-E598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PGC-1α may also up-regulate GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscles directly and indirectly. Indeed, adenovirus-mediated expression of PGC-1α in cultured muscle cell lines L6 myotube resulted in a large increase in GLUT4, providing evidence that PGC-1α can also up-regulate GLUT4 gene expression (18Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). However, there has been some evidence against this hypothesis. Starvation increased the capacity for mitochondrial energy production via fatty acid β-oxidation with a marked up-regulation of PGC-1α in the heart (11Lehman J.J. Barger P.M. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), whereas starvation did not increase GLUT4 in skeletal muscles (19Kamei Y. Mizukami J. Miura S. Suzuki M. Takahashi N. Kawada T. Taniguchi T. Ezaki O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A single bout of exercise increased PGC-1α mRNA and protein (20Baar K. Wende A.R. Jones T.E. Marison M. Nolte L.A. Chen M. Kelly D.P. Holloszy J.O. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1879-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), but did not increase GLUT4 mRNA (21Ikeda S. Miyazaki H. Nakatani T. Kai Y. Kamei Y. Miura S. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A significant GLUT4 expression was observed by prolonged exercise or repeated bouts of exercise (21Ikeda S. Miyazaki H. Nakatani T. Kai Y. Kamei Y. Miura S. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To resolve this question, we made mice that overexpressed PGC-1α in skeletal muscle and examined whether PGC-1α increases GLUT4 expression as well as enzymes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Preparation of the Muscle-PGC-1α Construct—The human α-skeletal actin promoter was used to drive skeletal muscle specific expression of a mouse PGC-1α transgene. This promoter is well characterized, and the 2.2-kb fragment used (a kind gift from Drs. E. D. Hardeman and K. Guven at the Children's Medical Research Institute in Australia) contains all necessary elements for selective expression in the skeletal muscle but not the heart (22Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete cDNA of mouse PGC-1α was obtained by PCR from first strand cDNA using mouse skeletal muscle total RNA. First strand cDNA was prepared using an Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech) after DNase I-digestion. For PGC-1α (GenBank accession number AF049330), forward and reverse primer sequences were 5′-ATGGCTTGGGACATGTGC-3′ and 5′-TTACCTGCGCAAGCTTCTCT-3′, respectively. Nucleotide sequences of PGC-1α cDNA were confirmed by sequencing. The transgene construct contains from –2000 to +200 of human α-skeletal actin promoter, 2.4 kb of complete mouse PGC-1α cDNA, and polyadenylation signal encoded by the bovine growth hormone (Fig. 1A). Transgenic Mice—This transgene fragment was used for microinjection into BDF1 mouse eggs at Japan SLC Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan). We examined 40 mouse pups, and six integration-positive mice were obtained. Among these six lines, three lines, B, D, and E, were studied. The male chimeras harboring PGC-1α transgene were mated with C57BL/6J female mice to obtain F1 offspring. The heterozygous F1 male offspring from this breeding were then backcrossed with purebred C57BL/6J females to obtain F2 offspring; this process was continued until the F3 generation of mice was obtained. The mice were maintained at a constant temperature of 22 °C with fixed artificial light cycle (12-h/12-h light/dark). The male heterozygous PGC-1α transgenic mice and their littermate wild-type mice were sacrificed at 13–15 weeks of age. Preparation of cDNA Probe and Northern Blot—The cDNA fragments for mouse, nuclearly encoded COX subunit IV, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and NRF-2 (NRF-2α) were obtained by PCR from first-strand cDNA using mouse brown adipose tissue total RNA. Complete cDNA of mouse PGC-1α and myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) was obtained by PCR from first-strand cDNA using mouse skeletal muscle total RNA. First-strand cDNA was prepared using an Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech) after DNase I digestion. The DNA fragment for mouse mitochondrially encoded COX subunit II was obtained by PCR from mouse mitochondrial DNA. The amplified products were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. The polymerase chain reaction primers used were as follows: COX II (GenBank accession number J01420): forward, 5′-ATGGCCTACCCATTCCAACT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTTAGTGGAACCATTTCTAG-3′; COX IV (GenBank accession number M37829): forward, 5′-GAGCCTGATTGGCAAGAGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCACTTCTTCCACTCATTCT-3′; medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) (GenBank accession number U07159): forward, 5′-ATCGCAATGGGTGCTTTTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TACACGAGGGTGATGCATCG-3′; NRF-2α (GenBank accession number M74515): forward, 5′-AACGTCTTCAACCATGACTA-3′; reverse, 5′-TATTTAAGAAAAACCTTAAG-3′; MEF2C (Genebank accession, L13171): forward, 5′-ATGGGGAGAAAAAAGATTCAGATTA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCATGTTGCCCATCCTTCA-3′. The PPARα and GLUT4 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. T. Osumi (Himeji Institute of Technology, Japan) and by Dr. D. M. Lane (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), respectively. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) cDNA were prepared as described in our previous study (21Ikeda S. Miyazaki H. Nakatani T. Kai Y. Kamei Y. Miura S. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Kim H-J. Takahashi M. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25892-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These cDNA were used as probes for Northern blotting. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. A portion of total RNA (20 μg per lane) was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. After transfer to nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and UV cross-linking, RNA blots were stained with methylene blue to locate 28 S and 18 S rRNAs and to ascertain the amount of loaded RNAs (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 187-206Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with cDNAs, which had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by a random prime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). The filters were washed several times with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, washed twice at 50 °C, and then exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C. The amounts of each mRNA were quantitated with an image analyzer (BAS 1800; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) and expressed as the intensity of phosphostimulated luminescence. Oral Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Test—For oral glucose tolerance test, d-glucose (1 mg/g of body weight, 10% (w/v) glucose solution) was administered after overnight fast by stomach tube. Blood samples were obtained by cutting the tail tip before and 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose administration. For insulin tolerance test, human insulin (Humulin R; Eli Lilly Japan K.K., Kobe, Japan) was injected intraperitoneally (0.75 milliunits/g of body weight) in fed animals. Blood glucose was measured on samples obtained from the tail tip before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after insulin injection. Blood glucose concentrations were measured using TIDEX glucose analyzer (Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical Analysis—The glucose and insulin tolerance curve of each group was compared by repeated measure analysis (Statview 5.0; Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). When they were significant, each group was compared with the others by Fisher's protected least-significant-difference test (Statview 5.0; Abacus Concepts). Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. Values are mean ± S.E. Exogenous Mouse PGC-1α mRNA Are Expressed in Skeletal Muscles from Transgenic Mice—Transgenic lines were made with a DNA construct that was composed of 5′ flanking skeletal muscles specific regulatory region and promoter of the human α-skeletal actin gene (Fig. 1A). Three lines of transgenic mice with a different copy number were examined; line B (copy number is 15), line D (copy number is 3), and line E (copy number is 1). This construct was expected to direct PGC-1α expression to skeletal muscles. Northern blots probed by 1–555 nucleotides of PGC-1α cDNA showed that all these three PGC-1α transgenic mice expressed one transcript (2.8 kb) from transgene PGC-1α in skeletal muscles such as quadriceps and gastrocnemius but not in white adipose tissue, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, brown adipose tissue, and brain (Fig. 1B). Irrespective copy number, highest expression (13-fold increase compared with 6.5-kb PGC-1α mRNA in wild-type mice) of transgene PGC-1α in gastrocnemius was observed in line E, second highest expression (10-fold) was in line D, and lowest (1-fold) was line B (Figs. 1B and 4), possibly by a different integration site in mouse genome. These -fold increases are at physiological levels, because exercise training increased all three sized transcripts by 10–13-fold (data not shown). As described previously, three sizes of endogenous PGC-1α transcripts, 6.5, 5, and 3 kb, possibly caused by utilization of different polyadenylation signals (25Esterbauer H. Oberkofler H. Krempler F. Patsch W. Genomics. 1999; 62: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26Kakuma T. Wang Z.W. Pan W. Unger R.H. Zhou Y.T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), were observed in skeletal muscles, kidney, heart, brown adipose tissue, and brain. We did not observe the smaller 1.5-kb transcript that was described in the previous study (26Kakuma T. Wang Z.W. Pan W. Unger R.H. Zhou Y.T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). With an increase of exogenous PGC-1α, all three of these endogenous PGC-1α transcripts in quadriceps and gastrocnemius were decreased. To examine fiber type-specific expression of this construct, expression level of PGC-1α in tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and soleus was measured in three lines of PGC-1α transgenic mice (Fig. 1C). Transgene PGC-1α expressed in TA that contains both type I and II muscle, EDL that is type II fiber-rich muscle (white muscle), and soleus that is type I fiber-rich muscle (red muscle). This data indicates that the promoter of the human α-skeletal actin gene drive to both type I and II fibers. As observed in quadriceps and gastrocnemius in Fig. 1B, endogenous PGC-1α mRNA in TA, EDL, and soleus muscles also were decreased. Gross Changes in PGC-1α Transgenic Mice—The most striking morphological difference was color of glycolytic muscles (Fig. 2). As indicated in the previous study (16Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar), TA, EDL, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps that were rich in type II fibers were paler in appearance in non-transgenic littermates but became dark red in PGC-1α transgenic mice; also, soleus that were originally red and rich in type I fibers became redder in PGC-1α transgenic mice. These color differences in type II fiber-rich muscles were observed in PGC-1α higher expressed, line D and E transgenic mice that express a high amount of PGC-1α but were not observed visually in line B transgenic mice that express a low amount of PGC-1α. PGC-1α Overexpression Decreased GLUT4 Expression in Skeletal Muscles and Impaired the Insulin-induced Glucose-lowering Effect—Because PGC-1α overexpression increased energy metabolism, it was expected that both lipid and glucose oxidation would be increased. Expression level of GLUT4, a rate-limiting step of glucose oxidation in skeletal muscles, was also expected to increase. Surprisingly, however, overexpression of PGC-1α down-regulated GLUT4 mRNA in gastrocnemius, quadriceps, TA, EDL, and soleus (Fig. 1, B and C). GLUT4 mRNA did not decrease in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and heart, in which transgene PGC-1α did not express (Fig. 1B). To examine whether a decrease of GLUT4 mRNA in skeletal muscles affected glucose homeostasis in the whole body, oral glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were made in line D and E mice. In both mice lines, the blood glucose curve after glucose administration did not differ significantly between transgenic and wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). However, the insulin tolerance test clearly demonstrated that the glucose-lowering effects of insulin were lower in PGC-1α transgenic mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3B). This unfavorable effect was also observed when the insulin tolerance curve was expressed as percentage decrease from its initial value (Fig. 3C). Possible Mechanism(s) for Down-regulation of GLUT4 — Transcription factors which regulate GLUT4 in vivo are still unknown, but using muscle cell lines, MFE2C emerged as a possible transcription factor that up-regulates GLUT4 mRNA (27Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that PGC-1 overexpression down-regulates these transcription factors (Fig. 4). In gastrocnemius, with a decrease of GLUT4 mRNA, expression level of MEF2C decreased. Thus, the decrease of MEF2C might contribute to a decrease of GLUT4 expression. PGC-1α Overexpression in Skeletal Muscles Is Accompanied by Up-regulation of Genes Related to Respiratory Chain Function and Fatty Acid Oxidation—To examine the effect of PGC-1α overexpression on other genes related to energy production, expression levels of genes related to mitochondria, and several target genes of PPARα were measured (Fig. 5). NRF-2, mitochondrially encoded COX subunit II, and nuclearly encoded COX subunit IV increased by 1.1∼2.6 -fold in three mice lines, parallel with expression levels of PGC-1α. PPARα is a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (28Bocher V. Pineda-Torra I. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mRNAs of PPARα itself and its target gene MCAD (a maker of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation) increased by 1.6∼1.8-fold in mice line D and E that expressed a high amount of PGC-1. However, ACO (a maker of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation) and LPL, other PPARα target genes, did not increase. ACO and LPL might be regulated by other transcription factors in skeletal muscles. These data suggest that in skeletal muscles from PGC-1α transgenic mice, up-regulation of PGC-1α and its target genes may lead to mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. In contrast to the previous finding in L6 myotubes, in which adenovirus-mediated expression of PGC-1α resulted in a large increase in GLUT4 (18Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), overexpression of PGC-1α in skeletal muscles did not up-regulate GLUT4; rather, it down-regulated GLUT4 mRNA (Figs. 1 and 4). Because PGC-1α transgenic mice showed red color characteristic of oxidative muscle and up-regulated enzymes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, it was proved that PGC-1α protein derived from the transgene was able to induce mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscles (Figs. 2 and 5). Any discrepancy of PGC-1α effect on GLUT4 expression between these two studies might be related to fundamental differences of GLUT4 expression machinery in vivo and in vitro. Under basal conditions, compared with skeletal muscle tissues, muscle cell lines (L6, C2C12, Sol18) express far less GLUT4 than skeletal muscle tissues, and their insulin responsiveness is minimal (29Tortorella L.L. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E514-E524Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There are several possibilities for the mechanism(s) for down-regulation of GLUT4 mRNA by transgenic PGC-1α. First, endogenous PGC-1α may have at least two forms of PGC-1α protein: a full-length form and a smaller 34-kDa form in skeletal muscles that was identified with the use of a commercially available antibody (20Baar K. Wende A.R. Jones T.E. Marison M. Nolte L.A. Chen M. Kelly D.P. Holloszy J.O. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1879-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Although it has not been proven that this small form is derived from PGC-1α mRNA and has some physiological functions, it might up-regulate GLUT4 mRNA. Thus, a decrease in the smaller 34-kDa form might result in a GLUT4 decrease. In this study, we have not measured PGC-1α and GLUT4 proteins in PGC-1α transgenic mice. Because a marked difference of myofibrillar proteins was observed in PGC-1α transgenic mice, it was very difficult to compare the amount of PGC-1α or GLUT4 proteins on a total protein basis between PGC-1 transgenic and their wild-type littermates. Second, although, it is not known whether MEF2C can up-regulate GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscles as well as in muscle cell lines (27Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), down-regulation of transcription factors, MEF2C might contribute to a decrease of GLUT4 expression (Fig. 4). Third, a decrease of GLUT4 expression observed in transgenic mice that overexpressed PGC-1α was caused by the secondary effects of a marked rearrangement of myofibrillar proteins (16Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Evidence that transgenic mice that overexpressed less PGC-1α (line B) did not up-regulate GLUT4 expression in the absence of a marked phenotypic changes (Figs. 1 and 2) suggests that at least a small PGC-1α overexpression did not up-regulate GLUT4 expression markedly. Exercise training induced both mitochondrial biogenesis and GLUT4 mRNA in skeletal muscles with an increase of PGC-1α (20Baar K. Wende A.R. Jones T.E. Marison M. Nolte L.A. Chen M. Kelly D.P. Holloszy J.O. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1879-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 30Goto M. Terada S. Kato M. Katoh M. Yokozeki T. Tabata I. Shimokawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that PGC-1α overexpression down-regulates GLUT4 mRNA. These findings suggest that exercise training alters other transcription factors that up-regulate GLUT4 mRNA to overcome the PGC-1α effect to down-regulate GLUT4 mRNA (Fig. 6). In liver, PGC-1α plays a key role for gluconeogenesis (31Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Because PGC-1α works as an inducer of diabetes in both skeletal muscle and liver, to increase PGC-1α protein or its activity in vivo may not be a good pharmacological intervention for prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus. We are indebted to Drs. N. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka and T. Nakatani in our laboratory for their helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2156041267,"Tomosyn is a 130-kDa syntaxin-binding protein that contains a large N-terminal domain with WD40 repeats and a C-terminal domain homologous to R-SNAREs. Here we show that tomosyn forms genuine SNARE core complexes with the SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25. <i>In vitro</i> studies with recombinant proteins revealed that complex formation proceeds from unstructured monomers to a stable four-helical bundle. The assembled complex displayed features typical for SNARE core complexes, including a profound hysteresis upon unfolding-refolding transitions. No stable complexes were formed between the SNARE motif of tomosyn and either syntaxin or SNAP-25 alone. Furthermore, both native tomosyn and its isolated C-terminal domain competed with synaptobrevin for binding to endogenous syntaxin and SNAP-25 on inside-out sheets of plasma membranes. Tomosyn-SNARE complexes were effectively disassembled by the ATPase <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor together with its cofactor α-SNAP. Moreover, the C-terminal domain of tomosyn was as effective as the cytoplasmic portion of synaptobrevin in inhibiting evoked exocytosis in a cell-free preparation derived from PC12 cells. Similarly, overexpression of tomosyn in PC12 cells resulted in a massive reduction of exocytosis, but the release parameters of individual exocytotic events remained unchanged. We conclude that tomosyn is a soluble SNARE that directly competes with synaptobrevin in the formation of SNARE complexes and thus may function in down-regulating exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1981986845,"The role of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-5 in human breast cancer cell growth is unclear. We determined the effects of IGFBP-5 expression on the growth of human breast cancer cell lines in vivo and in vitro. Expression of IGFBP-5, both by stable transfection and adenoviral-mediated infection, was inhibitory to the growth of MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T human breast cancer cells over a 13-day period. IGFBP-5 expression resulted in a G2/M cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis in both cell lines, an effect that was abrogated in the presence of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. IGFBP-5-induced apoptosis was associated with a transcriptional increase in expression of the proapoptotic regulator bax and decrease in the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 compared with vector controls. Secreted IGFBP-5 when added exogenously to breast cancer cells was not internalized and had no effect on cell growth or apoptosis, suggesting that IGFBP-5 may elicit its inhibitory effects via a novel, intracrine mechanism. In athymic nude mice, stable expression of IGFBP-5 significantly inhibited both the formation and growth of tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. IGFBP-5-expressing tumors also had a significantly elevated level of bax mRNA and decreased levels of bcl-2 mRNA compared with vector tumors. These data suggest that IGFBP-5 is a potent growth inhibitor and proapoptotic agent in human breast cancer cells via modulation of cell cycle regulation and apoptotic mediators.

The insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; IGFRI, type I IGF receptor; IR, ionizing radiation; FCS, fetal calf serum; SF, serum-free/insulin-free; rh, recombinant human; CM, conditioned media. are a family of proteins that bind with high affinity to IGFs and modulate their mitogenic actions by regulating their ability to interact with their signaling receptor, the type I IGF receptor (IGFRI, reviewed in Ref. 1Jones J.I.

The role of IGFBP-5 in cell growth is complex, with reports that it can either stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation in various experimental systems (5Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. J. Biol.

Duan C. Clemmons D.R. Herman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), vitamin D-related compounds (9Rozen F. Yang X.F. Huynh H. Pollak M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and antiestrogen ICI 182780 (10Huynh H. Yang X.F. Pollak M. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 1501-1506PubMed Google Scholar), with some evidence that it may mediate their growth inhibitory effects (8Higo H. Duan C. Clemmons D.R. Herman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Huynh H. Yang X.F. Pollak M. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 1501-1506PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, growth stimulation of human breast cancer cells by estradiol is associated with a down-regulation of IGFBP-5 expression (10Huynh H. Yang X.F. Pollak M. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 1501-1506PubMed Google Scholar), although exogenous IGFBP-5 had no effect on IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 (11Chen J.C. Shao Z.M. Sheikh M.S. Hussain A. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Fontana J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, there are some conflicting data in vivo, with Chan et al. (12Chan T.W. Pollak M. Huynh H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2545-2554PubMed Google Scholar) reporting a decrease in IGFBP-5 gene expression following growth inhibition of the rat mammary gland with ICI 182780, whereas Huynh et al. (10Huynh H. Yang X.F. Pollak M. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 1501-1506PubMed Google Scholar) observed an ICI-induced increase in IGFBP-5 mRNA in 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene-induced mammary tumors. These results suggest that IGFBP-5 has cell type-specific effects on cellular proliferation. The role of IGFBP-5 in the apoptotic process is also somewhat ambiguous, with conflicting data from in vivo and in vitro studies. In vivo, increased expression of IGFBP-5 has been observed in tissues undergoing apoptosis such as the involuting prostate (13Nickerson T. Pollak M. Huynh H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and mammary (14Tonner E. Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Logan A. Flint D.J.

Reprod. 1996; 55: 1356-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and in the rat brain following hypoxic-ischemic injury (17Beilharz E.J. Klempt N.D. Klempt M. Sirimanne E. Dragunow M. Gluckman P.D. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Allan et al. (18Allan G.J. Flint D.J. Darling S.M. Geh J. Patel K. Anat. Embryol. 2000; 202: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have also reported that IGFBP-5 expression is highly restricted to regions of cell death in the developing mouse limb bud. In vitro, expression of IGFBP-5 mRNA increases following induction of apoptosis in ovine granulosa cells (19Monget P. Pisselet C. Monniaux D. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 177: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, Perks et al. (20Perks C.M. Bowen S. Gill Z.P. Newcomb P.V. Holly J.M.P. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 75: 652-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have reported opposing effects of IGFBP-5 in human breast cancer cells in vitro. They demonstrated that addition of exogenous IGFBP-5 to Hs578T cells protects these cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis, suggesting IGFBP-5 may have a survival function in response to apoptotic stimuli (20Perks C.M. Bowen S. Gill Z.P. Newcomb P.V. Holly J.M.P. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 75: 652-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Perks C.M. McCraig C. Holly J.M.P. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 80: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was reached by Roschier et al. (22Roschier M. Kuusisto E. Suuronen T. Korhonen P. Kyrylenko S. Salminen A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) following their demonstration that induction of apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells is associated with a down-regulation of IGFBP-5 mRNA and protein expression, an effect that is reversed by IGF-I (22Roschier M. Kuusisto E. Suuronen T. Korhonen P. Kyrylenko S. Salminen A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, castration-induced IGFBP-5 expression enhances the mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects of IGFs and accelerates progression to androgen independence in prostate cancer models (23Miyake H. Pollak M. Gleave M.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3058-3064PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 is expressed in breast cancer tissue (24Yee D. Sharma J. Hilsenbeck S.G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1785-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and cell lines (25Figueroa J.A. Yee D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1992; 22: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and is positively correlated with estrogen receptor status. Because of the contradictory data on the role of IGFBP-5 in cancer cell growth, we directly examined the effect of stable expression of IGFBP-5 on the growth of human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, using a transient overexpression system, we have characterized the proapoptotic effects of IGFBP-5 in human breast cancer cells. We show that IGFBP-5 significantly inhibits the growth of human breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and induces a caspase-dependent, intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, these growth effects appear to be mediated by intracellular IGFBP-5, independent of signaling through a cell-surface receptor. Cell Culture of Breast Cancer Cells—The human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 2.92 mg/ml glutamine under standard conditions. Stable Transfection—A 0.9-kb IGFBP-5 cDNA, cloned from U2-OS osteosarcoma cells, was kindly provided by Dr. Sue Firth, Kolling Institute (26Firth S.M. Clemmons D.R. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were stably transfected with the IGFBP-5 cDNA in the expression vector pOP13 (Invitrogen), using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. IGFBP-5 transfectants (MDA/BP-5) and vector controls (MDA/VEC) were selected in media containing 800 μg/ml geneticin for 21 days post-transfection, then mixed populations of transfectants were grown up for subsequent experiments. Adenoviral-mediated Expression of IGFBP-5—The human IGFBP-5 cDNA was subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector, pAd-Track-CMV, and replication-deficient IGFBP-5-expressing adenoviruses were produced essentially as previously described (27Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Poronnik P. Cook D.I. Baxter R.C. Protein Exp. Purif. 1999; 16: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proliferating cultures of MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T were incubated with varying concentrations of adenovirus stock (approximately 4.5 × 1012 plaque forming units/μl) for 6 h in serum-free, insulin-free (SF) media. Virus was then removed and replaced with fresh growth media. As the pAd-Track-CMV vector contains a green fluorescent protein marker, levels of infection were determined by assessing the percentage of green fluorescent protein-positive cells using flow cytometry. For the cell proliferation assays, cells were infected with 0.1 μl of adenovirus stock. For analysis of apoptosis induction, Hs578T cells were infected with 2 μl of adenovirus stock, and MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with 1 μl of adenovirus stock. These concentrations were shown to give >90% infection efficiency and low toxicity as assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Measurement of Cell Proliferation—Cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates in the presence of 10% FCS media. On days 3, 6, 9, and 13 post-seeding, cells were trypsinized and the viable cell numbers were assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Analysis of Cell Cycle Distribution—Cells were plated at 5 × 105 per well in 6-well plates for 24 h, then incubated in SF media for 48 h. Cells were trypsinized and aliquots of 1 × 106 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at –20 °C for at least 24 h. Fixed cells were then washed and suspended in 1 ml of fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml RNase A) for at least 1 h in the dark at 4 °C. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Coulter ELITE flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). 20,000 cells were analyzed for each sample, and quantitation of cell cycle distribution was performed using Multicycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Clonogenic Survival Assays—The long term survival of MDA-MB-231 transfectants following doses of irradiation was assessed by a clonogenic survival assay. 2 × 103 cells were seeded into 6-well plates in triplicate for 24 h. Cells were then washed with fresh media and irradiated with various doses of x-rays (2.5, 5, or 7.5 gray), then incubated for 14 days in 10% FCS. At this time, cells were counted and the percentage survival determined by the proportion of attached cells surviving (assessed by trypan blue exclusion) relative to unirradiated controls. Measurement of DNA Fragmentation by Flow Cytometry—Both floating and adherent cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry. 24 h post-adenoviral infection, cells were rinsed with fresh SF media, then incubated for 48 h with or without the caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (100 μm; Bachem AG, Switzerland). Floating and attached cell populations were combined and 1 × 106 cells were prepared and analyzed as described above. Labeled nuclei were gated on light scatter to remove debris and the percentage of nuclei with a sub-G1 content was determined. Apoptosis Assay—Cells were plated at 5 × 105 per well on sterile glass coverslips in 6-well plates for 24 h then infected with IGFBP-5- or vector-adenovirus. 24 h post-adenoviral infection, cells were washed with SF media and incubated for 48 h. Cell monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min, and then stained with 0.8 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined microscopically as cells with visible nuclear fragmentation. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—For analysis of DNA synthesis, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells were plated in 48-well plates at 5 × 104/well and infected with adenovirus as described above. DNA synthesis was determined using incorporation of [3H]thymidine essentially as previously described (28Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16407-16411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) 24 h post-infection, or following addition of 20 or 100 ng/ml recombinant human (rh) IGF-II or 10 μg/ml IGFRI neutralizing antibody (αIR-3, Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Alexandria, New South Wales, Australia) as indicated for 24 h in SF media. Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared from cells 48 h post-seeding for stable transfectants or post-infection with adenovirus following an incubation in SF media and 50 μg were resolved under reducing conditions on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using standard methods. For analysis of Bax expression post-irradiation, cells were irradiated with various doses of x-rays (2.5, 5, or 7.5 gray), then incubated for 4 days in 10% FCS before preparation of total cell lysates as described above. For IGFBP-5 immunoblots, 50 μg of conditioned media (CM) samples were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-Bax polyclonal (1:1000 dilution; BD Pharmingen), anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal (0.8 μg/ml; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), or chicken anti-human IGFBP-5 (1:100; Ref. 29Baxter R.C. Meka S. Firth S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation with anti-rabbit (for Bax, 1:10,000 dilution) or anti-mouse (for Bcl-2, 1:2000 dilution) IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized with ECL (Pierce). Blots were checked for equal loading by reprobing with anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:10,000, Sigma). Protein bands were quantitated by densitometry (Video Densitometer model 620, Bio-Rad). For IGFBP-5 immunoblots, membranes were incubated with anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; Promega, Madison, WI) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and visualized with colorimetric detection. Purity of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (Fig. 6) was confirmed by immunoblot with CPP32 (1:1000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; Ref. 30Mancini M. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (1:2000 dilution; Roche Molecular Biochemicals; Ref. 31de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) antibodies, respectively. Analysis of IGFBP-5 in Conditioned Media—MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells were infected with adenovirus as described above, then incubated in SF media for 48 h. CM was collected and IGFBP-5 was purified by binding to, and elution from, an affinity column of IGF-I-agarose, followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Jupiter 5μ, 300-Å C18, 250 × 4.6-mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). IGFBP-5 was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 15–24% over 10 min, then 24–33% over 20 min. IGFBP-5 fragments eluted at 26–27 min, and intact IGFBP-5 at 30–32 min. Concentrations of IGFBP-5 in CM from IGFBP-5 expressing cells were quantitated by IGFBP-5-specific radioimmunoassay as previously described (29Baxter R.C. Meka S. Firth S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ligand Blot—To examine intracellular IGFBP-5, cells were infected with adenovirus or treated with exogenous IGFBP-5, then incubated for 48 h in SF media. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein content was estimated and samples were electrophoresed (30 μg for nuclear samples from stable transfectants, 50 μg for all other samples) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, then probed with 125I-IGF-II (1 × 106 cpm/50 ml) overnight. Northern Analysis—RNA extraction and Northern analysis were performed essentially as previously described (32Delhanty P.J.D. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 260-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IGFBP-5 cDNA probe was kindly provided by Dr. S. Shimasaki (University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and the bax cDNA probe was kindly provided by Dr. G. Packham (Kolling Institute of Medical Research, St. Leonards, NSW, Australia). Probes were labeled using a HexaLabel DNA labeling kit (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and [α-32P]deoxy-CTP. Filters were hybridized at 42 °C overnight, then washed in 1× SSC (standard saline citrate) at 42 °C, followed by a wash in 0.1× SSC heated to 42 °C. The ribosomal phosphoprotein, 36B4, was used as a loading control (33Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Filters were quantitated using a phosphorimaging FLA3000 (Fuji, Japan). Data were normalized by expressing the ratio of target mRNA to 36B4 mRNA. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)17 and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase polymerase as previously described (2Butt A.J. Firth S. King M.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39174-39181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Real time quantitative PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad iCycler in combination with SYBRgreen dye and a final concentration of 400 nm gene-specific primers: bcl-2 F, 5′-GTTCGGTGGGGTCATGTGTGTGGAGAGCG; bcl-2 R, 5′-TAGCTGATTCGACGTTTTGCCTGA; bax F, 5′-GGGGACGAACTGGACAGTAA; bax R, 5′-CAGTTGAAGTTGCCGTCAGA. Human actin primers were used as a control for quantitative analysis. Tumor Growth in Vivo—MDA/VEC and MDA/BP-5 cells were trypsinized and resuspended at 1 × 107 viable cells/100 μl in SF media. Cell suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) as a support matrix for initial cell growth. 1 × 107 cells were injected subcutaneously at the dorsal neck into two groups (MDA/VEC and MDA/BP-5) of six mice (in the repeat experiment, seven mice were injected with MDA/BP-5 cells). Tumor growth was monitored weekly by measuring tumor length and width using calipers, and tumor volume (cm3) was calculated using the formula: length × width2 × 0.5. Experiments were terminated when tumors reached ∼1 cm3. Blood samples were taken from all animals at termination and tumors were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA analysis. Results were pooled from two separate experiments and all experiments were carried out with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out using StatView 4.02 (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Differences between groups was evaluated by Fisher's protected least significant difference test after analysis of variance using repeated measures or factorial analysis where appropriate. Stable and Adenoviral-mediated Expression of IGFBP-5 Is Growth Inhibitory to Human Breast Cancer Cells—The effects of IGFBP-5 on the growth of human breast cancer cells were examined using both stable transfection of human IGFBP-5 cDNA as well as transient adenoviral-mediated expression. Cell growth was assessed by cell counting over a 13-day period, and concentrations of IGFBP-5 secreted into the media were also determined at each time point. Secretion of IGFBP-5 remained high throughout the 13-day growth period and was low or undetectable in vector control cells (data not shown). Fig. 1A shows the effects of stable expression of IGFBP-5 on the growth of MDA-MB-231. MDA/BP-5 cells were significantly growth inhibited over the 13-day growth period compared with vector controls (p < 0.03 by repeated measures analysis of variance). Interestingly, despite much higher levels of IGFBP-5 secretion, a similar inhibitory effect was observed following adenoviral-mediated expression of IGFBP-5 in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1B) and Hs578T (Fig. 1C). In both cell lines, transient overexpression of IGFBP-5 significantly inhibited cell growth compared with vector controls (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.005, respectively, by repeated measures analysis of variance). IGFBP-5 Expression Induces a G 2/M Cell Cycle Arrest in Human Breast Cancer Cells—We determined the effects of both stable and transient expression of IGFBP-5 on DNA synthesis using incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Fig. 2A demonstrates that both stable and adenoviral-mediated expression of IGFBP-5 results in a significant decrease in DNA synthesis over 24 h compared with vector controls (p < 0.02 stable transfectants; p < 0.003 MDA-MB-231; p < 0.05 Hs578T). The effects of IGFBP-5 on cell cycle progression were examined by flow cytometric analysis after a 48-h incubation in SF media. Fig. 2B demonstrates that stable expression of IGFBP-5 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a significant accumulation in G2/M phase of the cell cycle compared with vector controls (p < 0.05). Adenoviral-mediated expression of IGFBP-5 also resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells in the G2/M phase compared with vector controls (Fig. 2C, p < 0.005 and p < 0.02, respectively). A significant decrease in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was also observed when compared with vector controls (p < 0.03 and p < 0.01, respectively). Interestingly, no significant differences in the S phase fraction were observed between IGFBP-5-expressing cells and vector controls, which may reflect the relative insensitivity of this method compared with analysis of active DNA synthesis. IGFBP-5 Expression Induces Caspase-dependent Apoptosis via Modulation of Bcl-2 Proteins—The effect of IGFBP-5 on the induction of apoptosis was examined in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells using transient adenoviral-mediated expression. The extent of DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptotic cell death was assessed using both scoring of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei for fragmentation and flow cytometric analysis of the hypodiploid (pre-G1) fraction. Analysis of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei showed a significant increase in nuclear fragmentation in IGFBP-5-infected MDA-MB-231 (from 4.7 ± 0.5 to 7.6% ± 1.1, p < 0.0001) and Hs578T (from 4.8 ± 0.7 to 11.2% ± 1.6, p < 0.0001) cells compared with vector controls (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B illustrates that expression of IGFBP-5 resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of the population in the pre-G1 fraction compared with vector controls in both MDA-MB-231 (from 2.7 ± 0.5 to 7.3% ± 1.1, p < 0.02) and Hs578T (from 2.9 ± 0.8 to 9.0% ± 3.3, p < 0.006) cells. Incubation of IGFBP-5-expressing MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk resulted in a significant decrease in the level of apoptosis (p < 0.01 and p < 0.02, respectively) to levels that were not significantly different from vector controls (Fig. 3B). Levels of apoptosis in vector-infected cells were not significantly affected by z-VAD-fmk (p = 0.2 for MDA, p = 0.9 for Hs578T). The effect of stable IGFBP-5 expression on the long term survival of MDA-MB-231 transfectants following exposure to IR was examined. Cells were irradiated with various doses of x-rays, then radiosensitivity was evaluated using clonogenic survival assays. At doses of 2.5 and 5 gray x-rays, MDA/BP-5 cells showed significantly reduced long term (up to 14 days) survival (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.002, respectively) compared with vector controls (Fig. 3C). At the higher dose of 7.5 gray, the surviving fraction was low in both MDA/VEC and MDA/BP-5 cells. We have previously shown that IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis and radiosensitivity is associated with modulation of members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators (2Butt A.J. Firth S. King M.A. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39174-39181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 3Butt A.J. Fraley K.A. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2693-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the apoptotic effects of IGFBP-5 were mediated via a similar pathway. Fig. 3D shows that IGFBP-5 expression in stable transfectants was associated with elevated levels of Bax protein compared with vector controls, both basally and 4 days after exposure to increasing doses of radiation. This suggests that the increased radiosensitivity of the IGFBP-5-expressing cells might result from Bax-mediated apoptosis. To further investigate these IGFBP-5-mediated effects, both stable transfectants and adenoviral-infected cells were analyzed for expression of the proapoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Levels of bax and bcl-2 mRNA were also determined in these cell populations. Fig. 4A shows that expression of IGFBP-5 in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells was associated with a significant induction in the expression of Bax protein (p < 0.02 stable transfectants; p < 0.04 adenovirus both cell lines). In addition, stable transfection of IGFBP-5 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a significant down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein compared with vector controls (p < 0.005), although no change in Bcl-2 expression was observed following transient, adenoviral-mediated expression of IGFBP-5. Fig. 4B shows the levels of bax mRNA in IGFBP-5-expressing MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells and vector controls, determined by Northern analysis. Densitometric analysis demonstrated that there was a significant increase in bax mRNA levels in IGFBP-5-expressing cells compared with vector controls (p < 0.03 stable MDA, p < 0.04 adenoviral MDA and Hs578T). Also shown is the level of IGFBP-5 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells showing that both stable transfection with IGFBP-5 cDNA and infection with IGFBP-5-adenovirus, resulted in increased expression of IGFBP-5 mRNA compared with controls (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C shows the levels of bcl-2 mRNA in IGFBP-5-expressing MDA-MB-2"
https://openalex.org/W1992462947,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, is the principal intracellular source of NADPH. NADPH is utilized as a cofactor by vascular endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) to generate nitric oxide (NO•). To determine whether G6PD modulates NO•-mediated angiogenesis, we decreased G6PD expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to G6PD or increased G6PD expression by adenoviral gene transfer, and we examined vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and capillary-like tube formation. Deficient G6PD activity was associated with a significant decrease in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, whereas increased G6PD activity promoted these processes. VEGF-stimulated eNOS activity and NO• production were decreased significantly in endothelial cells with deficient G6PD activity and enhanced in G6PD-overexpressing cells. In addition, G6PD-deficient cells demonstrated decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS compared with cells with normal G6PD activity, whereas overexpression of G6PD enhanced phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS. In the Pretsch mouse, a murine model of G6PD deficiency, vessel outgrowth from thoracic aorta segments was impaired compared with C3H wild-type mice. In an in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis assay, cell migration into the plugs was inhibited significantly in G6PD-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice, and gene transfer of G6PD restored the wild-type phenotype in G6PD-deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that G6PD modulates angiogenesis and may represent a novel angiogenic regulator.

VEGF-stimulated eNOS activity and NO• production were decreased significantly in endothelial cells with deficient G6PD activity and enhanced in G6PD-overexpressing cells. In addition, G6PD-deficient cells demonstrated decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS compared with cells with normal G6PD activity, whereas overexpression of G6PD enhanced phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS. In the Pretsch mouse, a murine model of G6PD deficiency, vessel outgrowth from thoracic aorta segments was impaired compared with C3H wild-type mice. In an in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis assay, cell migration into the plugs was inhibited significantly in G6PD-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice, and gene transfer of G6PD restored the wild-type phenotype in G6PD-deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that G6PD modulates angiogenesis and may represent a novel angiogenic regulator. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels in response to tissue ischemia or injury, is dependent upon a coordinated sequence of events involving vascular endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tube formation (1Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3490) Google Scholar, 2Vailhe B. Vittet D. Feige J.J. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Initially, vascular endothelial cells must acquire an angiogenic phenotype to migrate toward an angiogenic stimulus, proliferate behind the front of migration, and differentiate to form endothelial tubes and capillary-like structures. Nitric oxide (NO•) 1The abbreviations used are: NO•, nitric oxide; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; eNOS, endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; BAEC, Bovine aortic endothelial cells; AS, antisense; SS, scrambled sequence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; l-NAME, l-N G-nitroarginine methyl ester; l-NMMA, l-N G-monomethyl arginine citrate; hpf, high powered field; ROS, reactive oxygen species; WT, wild type; HEMI, hemizygous. has been shown to modulate angiogenesis by mediating growth factor-stimulated endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Nitric oxide is permissive for endothelial cell migration and enhances directional migration by inducing a switch from a stationary to a mobile phenotype (3Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Masini E. Amerini S.

Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C794-C802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition NO• promotes endothelial cell proliferation, and proliferating endothelial cells demonstrate increased expression of the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) compared with quiescent cells (5Zollner S. Aberle S. Harvey S.E. Polokoff M.A. Rubanyi G.M. Endothelium. 2000; 7: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In vivo studies utilizing eNOS–/– mice have demonstrated the absolute requirement for endothelium-derived NO• for effective angiogenesis. In this murine model, compared with mice with normal eNOS activity, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated angiogenesis and vascular permeability are significantly attenuated (6Fukumura D. Gohongi T. Kadambi A. Izumi Y. Ang J. Yun C.O. Buerk D.G. Huang P.L. Jain R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2604-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, is the principal intracellular source of NADPH. NADPH, in turn, is utilized directly as a cofactor for eNOS and, indirectly, to maintain levels of another important cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, via de novo synthesis and the dihydrofolate reductase salvage pathway. In this manner, G6PD regulates eNOS activity and NO• levels. In this study, we demonstrate that G6PD activity modulates endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tube formation by mediating NO• levels. G6PD may, therefore, serve as a novel regulatory determinant of the angiogenic phenotype. Antisense Transfection and Recombinant Adenovirus Gene Transfer—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) (Cell Systems Co, Kirkland, WA) were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To decrease G6PD expression, an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide to G6PD mRNA (AS) or a scrambled sequence control (SS) was utilized as described previously (7Leopold J.A. Cap A. Scribner A.W. Stanton R.C. Loscalzo J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To increase G6PD expression, a recombinant adenovirus encoding rat G6PD cDNA under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, AdG6PD, or an empty viral vector, Ad, were utilized as described previously (8Zhang Y.Y. Walker J.L. Huang A. Keaney J.F. Clish C.B. Serhan C.N. Loscalzo J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). G6PD protein expression was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1A), and corresponding NADPH levels were measured as described previously (7Leopold J.A. Cap A. Scribner A.W. Stanton R.C. Loscalzo J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y.Y. Walker J.L. Huang A. Keaney J.F. Clish C.B. Serhan C.N. Loscalzo J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Experiments were conducted on cells from passages 4–10. Thymidine Incorporation Assay—BAEC (1 × 104) were seeded in triplicate 24-well plates, placed in reduced serum (1.0%) media for 24 h, and stimulated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (100 ng/ml) in 1.0% serum for 12 h in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine. After 12 h, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 16 h, washed with 100% ethanol, incubated with 1 n NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C, and neutralized with 10 n HCl. Thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cell Migration—Migration was assessed by a cell wounding assay in BAEC grown to confluence in a P100 dish and synchronized in 1% serum for 24 h. A longitudinal incision was made in the midline of the plate with a sterile scalpel, and cells were scraped from one-half of the plate and stimulated with VEGF (100 ng/ml) for 12 h. After this time, cells that migrated across the midline were visualized using a Nikon TE 300 microscope, and 5 images per high powered field (hpf) per plate were captured digitally. Cells that crossed the midline were counted and averaged per plate. Data are presented as migrated cells/hpf. In addition, cell migration was assayed using a modified Boyden chamber (ChemoTx® plate, Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tube Formation—In vitro formation of capillary-like tube structures was examined using Matrigel. Matrigel (0.5 ml) was polymerized on dual-chamber microscope slides. Cells were then plated on Matrigel in full-growth media for 1 h. Once the cells were seeded, the media were replaced with media containing 1% serum or VEGF (100 ng/ml). Tube formation was visualized using an inverted microscope (Nikon TE 300) equipped with digital imaging. For each treatment, 10 high power field images were captured, and area of tubes/networks formed was quantified using Scion Corp. (NIH Image) area analysis with background subtraction and averaged. Data are presented as density units. eNOS Activity—eNOS activity was measured in intact cells without the addition of exogenous cofactors as described previously (9Uittenbogaard A. Shaul P.W. Yuhanna I.S. Blair A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11278-11283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (9Uittenbogaard A. Shaul P.W. Yuhanna I.S. Blair A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11278-11283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For analysis, equal amounts of cellular proteins (50 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking in 5% milk solution, membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Flk-1/KDR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-eNOS (Ser-1177), or anti-eNOS antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies) overnight at 4 °C. Membrane-bound antibodies were visualized by probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. The lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein-Sepharose A that had been incubated for 24 h with an antibody to eNOS (Transduction Laboratories) or G6PD (Sigma). After boiling, 100 μg of cell protein was loaded per lane, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were blocked with 5% skim milk and developed with antibodies for eNOS (1:500) or G6PD (1:1000) and visualized using the ECL detection system as described previously (7Leopold J.A. Cap A. Scribner A.W. Stanton R.C. Loscalzo J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Real Time NO • Measurements—BAEC were grown to confluence in P100 dishes, washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in a balanced salt solution (130 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 35 mmol/liter phosphoric acid, and 20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4) stimulated with VEGF (100 ng/ml). Real time NO• measurements were obtained using the inNO II Nitric Oxide Measuring System (Innovative Instruments) and the amino-FLAT probe. Data were recorded in real time; peak NO• levels were measured, and the area under the curve was integrated. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate Fluorescence—ROS accumulation was measured using 20 μm 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate di(acetoxymethyl) ester (Molecular Probes) as described previously (10Leopold J.A. Zhang Y.Y. Scribner A.W. Stanton R.C. Loscalzo J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Murine Aortic Ring Model of Angiogenesis—Murine thoracic aortas were harvested and placed in ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The aorta was flushed with ice-cold PBS until free of blood. The adventitia was dissected free, and the aorta was cut into 1-mm rings. The rings were embedded in type I collagen gel such that the lumen was oriented horizontally and placed in MCDB 131 media and maintained at 37 °C. To assess the angiogenic response, the rings were visualized using a Nikon TE300 microscope, digital images captured, and image analysis performed using Scion Corp. (NIH Image) area analysis with background subtraction. Data are presented as density units (11Burbridge M.F. West D.C. Murray J.C. in Angiogenesis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 185-204Google Scholar). G6PD-deficient Mouse Model—The Pretsch mouse, a murine model of G6PD deficiency on a C3H murine background (12Pretsch W. Charles D.J. Merkle S. Biochem. Genet. 1988; 26: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was bred at our institution from frozen embryos obtained from Medical Research Council (Harwell, UK). Hemizygous (XbY) G6PD-deficient male mice (HEMI) and wild-type (XY) C3H control mice (WT) age 12–16 weeks were studied. Animals were genotyped as described previously (13Sanders S. Smith D.P. Thomas G.A. Williams E.D. Mutat. Res. 1997; 374: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The animals were fed standard chow and handled following NIH guidelines. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston University Medical Center. The G6PD-deficient phenotype was confirmed by measuring hepatic G6PD activity and NADPH levels as described previously (7Leopold J.A. Cap A. Scribner A.W. Stanton R.C. Loscalzo J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Liver was harvested from mice at the time of sacrifice, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. G6PD and NADPH levels were measured in liver homogenates. In Vivo Matrigel Plug Assay and Cell Recovery—Matrigel (0.5 ml) was injected subcutaneously in the ventral groin area. One side was injected with Matrigel alone and the other with Matrigel mixed with VEGF (100 ng/ml). In this manner, each animal serves as its own control. After 14 days, the mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Matrigel plugs were excised and fixed in 10% formalin, subjected to an ethanol dehydration series, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (10 μm) were cut using a cryotome and applied to glass slides. Slides were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To recover cells, the excised Matrigel plugs were minced with a sterile scalpel, passed 10 times through a 14-gauge needle, treated with BD™ Cell Recovery Solution for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuged, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above to assay for proteins of interest. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry on deparaffinized slides was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:50, as described previously (14Eberhardt R.T. Forgione M.A. Cap A. Leopold J.A. Rudd M.A. Trolliet M. Heydrick S. Stark R. Klings E.S. Moldovan N.I. Yaghoubi M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Farber H.W. Cohen R. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). An angiogenic response was quantified by cell counts from 10 high power fields per section and image analysis using Scion Corp. (NIH Image) with background subtraction to determine the area occupied by endothelial cells. Statistical Analysis—Continuous data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparison between groups was performed by Student's paired two-tailed t test. Two-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences in response to treatments between groups, with post hoc analysis performed by the method of Student-Newman-Keuls. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. G6PD and Endothelial Cell Proliferation—To examine the role of G6PD in VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation, BAEC were transfected with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to G6PD mRNA with a 36% transfection efficiency to decrease G6PD expression and activity by 76% (AS-EC) or a scrambled control sequence (SS-EC), and cells were stimulated with VEGF (100 ng/ml) for 12 h. Compared with SS-EC, AS-EC demonstrated a significant decrease in basal and VEGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2A). The observed decrease in cell proliferation was not the result of increased cell death as determined by lactate dehydrogenase activity in the media (data not shown). To determine the contribution of NO• to VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, SS-EC and AS-EC were pretreated for 1 h with l-NAME (1 mmol/liter), to inhibit both NO• and superoxide production by eNOS, or l-NMMA (100 μmol/liter), to inhibit NO• generation by eNOS, and stimulated with VEGF in the presence of these inhibitors. In SS-EC stimulated with VEGF, [3H]thymidine incorporation was decreased significantly in cells treated with l-NAME (53,874 ± 3,848 versus 41,932 ± 5,330 cpm, p < 0.01) or l-NMMA (53,874 ± 3,848 versus 44,187 ± 3,267 cpm, p < 0.01). Similarly, AS-EC stimulated with VEGF demonstrated a decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence of l-NAME (32,156 ± 4,561 versus 26,987 ± 2,142 cpm, p < 0.05) and l-NMMA (32,156 ± 4,561 versus 26,116 ± 4,668 cpm, p < 0.05). We next sought to determine whether overexpression of G6PD would augment cell proliferation. To perform these studies, BAEC were infected with AdG6PD (AdG6PD-EC) at a multiplicity of infection = 10 plaque-forming units/cell with a 90–95% infection efficiency to increase G6PD activity 5-fold. Compared with Ad-transfected endothelial cells (Ad-EC), overexpression of G6PD markedly enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation under basal conditions, and this response was enhanced further by VEGF (Fig. 2B). In AdG6PD-EC, the addition of l-NAME significantly decreased cell proliferation in unstimulated (52,178 ± 2,784 versus 38,146 ± 5,399 cpm, p < 0.009) and VEGF-treated cells (79,227 ± 4,110 versus 46,665 ± 5,294 cpm, p < 0.001), suggesting that increased G6PD activity promoted cell proliferation by increasing NO• levels. G6PD and Endothelial Cell Migration—To examine the influence of G6PD on VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration, we performed a cell wounding assay. SS-EC and AS-EC were incubated with VEGF, and cell migration across the midline was observed. After 12 h, VEGF markedly increased cell migration across the midline in SS-EC (44 ± 4 versus 142 ± 16 cells/hpf, p < 0.001), an effect that was not observed in AS-EC (27 ± 11 versus 35 ± 5 cells/hpf, p = not significant) (Fig. 3). These findings were confirmed utilizing a modified Boyden chamber assay to determine whether G6PD activity influenced directed VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration. SS-EC and AS-EC were stimulated with VEGF (100 ng/ml) for 12 h during which time cells could migrate across the membrane. In SS-EC treated with VEGF, there was a significant increase in fluorescence (13.3 ± 2.6 versus 55.3 ± 6.6 units, p < 0.001), indicating an increase in cell migration, that was abrogated in AS-EC with deficient G6PD activity (14.1 ± 4.8 versus 20.2 ± 9.9 units, p = not significant). We next sought to determine the contribution of NO• to endothelial cell migration. By utilizing the modified Boyden chamber assay, SS-EC or AS-EC were stimulated with VEGF for 12 h in the presence or absence of l-NAME (1 mmol/liter) or l-NMMA (100 μmol/liter). In SS-EC, l-NAME significantly decreased cell migration in VEGF-stimulated cells (51.9 ± 4.2 versus 23.6 ± 7.0 units, p < 0.01) as did l-NMMA (51.9 ± 4.2 versus 21.6 ± 7.3 units, p < 0.003). Interestingly, in AS-EC, VEGF did not significantly increase endothelial cell migration, and l-NAME or l-NMMA did not alter this response. To determine whether overexpression of G6PD would promote directed endothelial cell migration, we overexpressed G6PD in endothelial cells and examined migration in a modified Boyden chamber assay. Compared with Ad-EC, AdG6PD-EC demonstrated a significant increase in fluorescence under basal conditions (16.4 ± 3.2 versus 35.1 ± 4.7 units, p < 0.009) and following stimulation with VEGF (51.9 ± 3.1 versus 98.8 ± 7.1 units, p < 0.001). In the presence of l-NAME, fluorescence was decreased in both unstimulated AdG6PD-EC (35.1 ± 4.7 versus 21.5 ± 3.4 units, p < 0.01) and VEGF-stimulated cells (98.8 ± 10.1 versus 36.4 ± 4.3 units, p < 0.001), suggesting that increased G6PD expression mediates endothelial cell migration by increasing NO• levels. G6PD and Endothelial Tube Formation—As endothelial cell proliferation and migration are processes integral to the formation of capillary-like tube structures, we examined the effect of G6PD activity on tube formation using an in vitro Matrigel assay. SS-EC and AS-EC were plated on Matrigel and stimulated with VEGF for 12 h. Under basal conditions, SS-EC plated on Matrigel formed tubes and networks, and the area occupied by SS-EC endothelial tubes was increased significantly following exposure to VEGF (9,911 ± 640 versus 24,729 ± 3,311 units, p < 0.001). Similarly, AS-EC formed endothelial tubes and the area occupied by these networks was not significantly different from that observed with SS-EC (9,911 ± 640 versus 8,424 ± 1,005 units, p = not significant); however, when stimulated with VEGF, AS-EC tube formation was decreased significantly compared with SS-EC (10,554 ± 895 versus 24,729 ± 3,311 units, p < 0.002) (Fig. 4A). To examine the role of NO• in endothelial tube formation, we performed the in vitro Matrigel assay in the presence of l-NAME or l-NMMA. In VEGF-stimulated SS-EC, the area occupied by endothelial tubes was decreased significantly in the presence of l-NAME (24,729 ± 3,311 versus 16,734 ± 2,396 units, p < 0.001) or l-NMMA (24,729 ± 3,311 versus 17,789 ± 1,923 units, p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the area occupied by endothelial tubes in VEGF-stimulated AS-EC in the presence of l-NAME or l-NMMA. As G6PD overexpression was associated with enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, it is not surprising that compared with Ad-EC, tube formation was significantly increased in AdG6PD-EC under basal conditions (10,372 ± 1,286 versus 19,549 ± 1,502 units, p < 0.01). This response was augmented further following stimulation with VEGF (24,994 ± 2,533 versus 43,212 ± 4,208 units, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, NO• played a significant role in this effect as the addition of l-NAME to AdG6PD-EC decreased tube formation in unstimulated (19,549 ± 1,502 versus 14,889 ± 1,321 units, p < 0.005) as well as in VEGF-stimulated (43,212 ± 4,208 versus 21,956 ± 5,367 units, p < 0.001) cells. G6PD, eNOS Activity, and NO • Levels—These observations suggest that one mechanism by which G6PD influences endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation is to regulate eNOS activity and, thereby, bioavailable NO•. To examine the effect of G6PD expression on eNOS activity, we measured eNOS activity in intact cells (without the addition of exogenous cofactors) (Fig. 5A). In AS-EC, compared with SSEC, eNOS activity was significantly decreased (12,728 ± 488 versus 18,534 ± 250 cpm l-[3H]citrulline, p < 0.004) at base line and following stimulation with VEGF (18,622 ± 511 versus 29,749 ± 630 cpm l-[3H]citrulline, p < 0.001). In contrast, overexpression of G6PD significantly increased eNOS activity at base line compared with Ad-EC (14,621 ± 201 versus 42,766 ± 634 cpm l-[3H]citrulline, p < 0.001), and this response was augmented further following exposure to VEGF (23,772 ± 554 versus 62,858 ± 632 cpm l-[3H]citrulline, p < 0.001). This effect was not a consequence of G6PD on eNOS expression (Fig. 5D) (15Bouloumie A. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of decreased or increased G6PD expression on VEGF-mediated NO• production, we measured real time NO• levels using a nitric oxide probe (Fig. 5B). Peak NO• levels were significantly lower in AS-EC compared with SS-EC (14.5 ± 1.5 versus 64.2 ± 10.0 nmol/liter, p < 0.008) as was the integral of area under the curve (2,056.3 ± 471.1 versus 11,790.7 ± 3,104.1 nmol/liter/s, p < 0.04). In contrast, peak NO• levels were significantly higher in AdG6PD-EC compared with Ad-EC (59.8 ± 8.9 versus 211.1 ± 28.0 nmol/liter, p < 0.001) as was the integral of area under the curve (9,822.0 ± 2,992.5 versus 90,123.3 ± 2,667.4 nmol/liter, p < 0.001). To examine the mechanism(s) by which G6PD mediates NO• production, we first performed immunoprecipitation studies to determine whether G6PD co-localizes with eNOS. Under basal conditions, G6PD and eNOS co-localize, and following stimulation with VEGF, co-localization is enhanced (Fig. 5C). We next sought to determine whether G6PD influences activation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR to modulate Akt-eNOS activation. Interestingly, in AS-EC, tyrosine phosphorylation of a 230-kDa band, consistent with Flk-1/KDR, was decreased at both 5 and 15 min compared with what was observed in SS-EC resulting in decreased phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in AS-EC compared with SS-EC (Fig. 5D). In contrast, in AdG6PD-EC, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 230-kDa band was enhanced at 5 and 15 min resulting in increased phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS compared with Ad-EC (Fig. 5D). G6PD, VEGF, and ROS Accumulation—It has been demonstrated recently that VEGF promotes angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by stimulating NAD(P)H oxidase to increase ROS formation (16Ushio-Fukai M. Tang Y. Fukai T. Dikalov S.I. Ma Y. Fujimoto M. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Johnson C. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured ROS levels by 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence in endothelial cells with decreased or increased G6PD activity to determine whether our observations could be explained by changes in ROS levels. Interestingly, in AS-EC exposed to VEGF, ROS levels were significantly higher than in SS-EC (248 ± 27 versus 180 ± 22 units, p < 0.01), and conversely, in AdG6PD-EC, ROS levels were lower than in Ad-EC (156 ± 14 versus 197 ± 12 units, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that G6PD, which is recognized as an antioxidant enzyme in endothelial cells, may additionally modulate ROS accumulation by influencing NO• production to mediate the redox milieu to a level favorable for endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Ex Vivo Aorta Implants and Vessel Outgrowth—We next examined the effect of G6PD on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis using an in vivo model of G6PD deficiency, the Pretsch mouse. Compared with C3H background mice (WT), hemizygous male G6PD mice (HEMI) demonstrate only 31% of WT G6PD activity with a concomitant reduction in NADPH levels (0.6 ± 0.03 versus 0.3 ± 0.01 mmol/mg protein, p < 0.001). To examine specifically the effect of G6PD on aortic vessel outgrowth, we explanted thoracic aortas from WT and HEMI mice, sectioned them into rings, and embedded the rings in a collagen matrix. The rings were then observed over 6 days for vessel outgrowth. By day 3, there was significant outgrowth from the WT rings compared with the rings from the HEMI mice, and by day 6, there was a marked difference between outgrowth observed from WT and HEMI mice rings (Fig. 6). To quantify these observations, the area occupied by vessel outgrowth was determined using area image analysis with background subtraction. At day 3, the area occupied by vessel outgrowth was significantly greater in aortic rings from WT compared with HEMI mice (6,037 ± 975 versus 2,767 ± 391 units, p < 0.04), and this effect was more pronounced by day 6 (10,057 ± 713 versus 3,475 ± 295 units, p < 0.001). In Vivo Matrigel Assay—To examine the effect of G6PD activity on angiogenesis in vivo, we performed an in vivo Matrigel migration assay in WT and HEMI mice. Each mouse was injected on one side with either Matrigel alone or Matrigel supplemented with VEGF, and the plugs were examined after 14 days. In WT mice, there is noticeable cell migration into the Matrigel plug, and this response is increased in Matrigel supplemented with VEGF (12 ± 1 versus 52 ± 2 cells/hpf, p < 0.001). In contrast, in HEMI mice, there is a marked decrease in cell migration into the Matrigel plug compared with WT mice, and exposure to VEGF only modestly improved this response (6 ± 1 versus 9 ± 1 cells/hpf, p < 0.03) (Fig. 7A). These findings confirm that G6PD modulates angiogenesis in vivo. To determine that the cells that migrated into the Matrigel were endothelial cells, the M"

In contrast to γ-secretase inhibitors, Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs do not impair S3 cleavage in the NOTCH receptor and release of the NOTCH intracellular domain, a finding with conceptual implications for the development of safer drugs targeting Aβ production through γ-secretase modulation. Intramembrane cleavage and release of an intracellular signaling domain has recently been demonstrated in a number of additional γ-secretase substrates. We now show in cell-based assays that intramembrane cleavage of APP and ErbB-4 receptor is not impaired by the Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs, sulindac sulfide and ibuprofen. Generation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) was further not inhibited in a cell-free assay at concentrations far exceeding those effective in reducing Aβ42 production. Closer inspection of AICD signaling showed that stabilization of the AICD peptide by FE65 and AICD-mediated transcription were also retained at Aβ42-lowering concentrations. These results demonstrate that S3-like/intramembrane cleavage is preserved by Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs in at least three substrates of γ-secretase APP, ErbB-4, and NOTCH and underline the striking specificity by which these drugs target Aβ42 production.

Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of transmembrane proteins has been established as a mechanism for the liberation of cytosolic signaling domains that enter the nucleus and regulate gene transcription (1Brown M.S.

De Strooper B. Yumoto E. Saya H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In almost all of the γ-secretase substrates examined to date, intramembrane cleavage is preceded and triggered by shedding of their large extracellular domains. Similarities in these proteolytic cascades have been most thoroughly studied in the γ-secretase substrates NOTCH and APP (13Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 14Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the mature NOTCH receptor is cleaved by the metalloprotease tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme. This cleavage event, which has been termed S2 cleavage, releases the extracellular domain from the cell surface and leaves behind a membrane-bound C-terminal Notch fragment termed NEXT (NOTCH extracellular truncation). NEXT undergoes constitutive S3 cleavage within its TMD close to the cytosolic border. S3 cleavage is carried out by γ-secretase activity, releasing the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) to translocate into the nucleus and regulate transcription of genes involved in cell fate decisions (13Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 15Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Release of the soluble APP ectodomain involves either α- or β-secretase cleavage and generates C-terminal APP fragments that are direct substrates for constitutive cleavage by γ-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP by β-secretase (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme) followed by γ-secretase cleavage produces the 40–42-amino acid Aβ peptide, which is hypothesized to initiate the cascade of events resulting in Alzheimer's disease (14Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). In contrast to S3 cleavage in Notch receptors, γ-secretase cleavage generating Aβ peptides occurs in the middle of the TMD, and these differences in cleavage topology have raised doubts as to whether NOTCH and APP are cleaved by the same proteolytic activity (17Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, using epitope-tagged substrates, NEXT was recently shown to also undergo cleavage in the middle of the TMD resulting in the release of Aβ-like NOTCH derived peptides (18Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a novel γ-secretase cleavage site within the TMD of APP was similarly identified that is located close to the cytosolic border and resembles the S3 cleavage site in NOTCH (19Gu Y.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This cleavage event, which was termed ϵ cleavage, releases the 50-amino acid APP intracellular domain (identified as AID, AICD, or CTFγ; hereon referred to as “AICD”) into the cytoplasm, and accumulating data suggest a role for this fragment in the regulation of gene transcription (23Koo E.H. Traffic. 2002; 3: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, γ-secretase activity apparently catalyzes very similar cleavages in the TMDs of APP and NOTCH as well as CD44, with major cleavage sites both in the middle as well as close to the cytosolic border of the TMD (see Fig. 1). Whether these findings further extend to the other γ-secretase substrates is unclear at this time (24Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Because of its essential role in generation of the Aβ peptide, targeting γ-secretase activity remains a viable and important option for drug development in Alzheimer's disease therapeutics (25Wolfe M.S.

However, these inhibitors indiscriminately block all cleavages within the TMD of γ-secretase substrates and prevent formation of the intracellular signaling domains (11Lammich S. Okochi M. Takeda M.

As a result, γ-secretase inhibitors impede NOTCH-dependent thymocyte development and cause phenocopies of NOTCH mutations in flies and fish (36Hadland B.K. Manley N.R. Su D. Longmore G.D. Moore C.L.

Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated that γ-secretase inhibitors also block proteolytic activity of signal peptide peptidase, an intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease with distant homology to PS (40Weihofen A.

Consequently, uncertainty remains about potentially prohibitive side effects and the use of γ-secretase inhibitors in human clinical trials (41Citron M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We recently showed that certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) specifically reduce production of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide without apparent inhibition of NOTCH processing, specifically NICD formation (42Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). NSAIDs most likely achieve the Aβ42 reduction by direct modulation of γ-secretase activity (43Takahashi Y. Hayashi I. Tominari Y. Rikimaru K. Morohashi Y. Kan T. Natsugari H. Fukuyama T. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol.

E., and Koo, E. H. (June 12, 2003) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M303592200. and full elucidation of their mechanism of action could facilitate the development of improved γ-secretase inhibitors that only target generation of a disease relevant subset of Aβ peptides. However, based only on the result that NSAIDs preserve S3 cleavage in NOTCH, it cannot be concluded with confidence that Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs will not impair intramembrane cleavage in other γ-secretase substrates. We therefore investigated APP and ErbB-4 processing after NSAID treatment, specifically assaying γ-secretase-mediated cleavages and signaling events with more sensitive measurements. Our results demonstrated that intramembrane γ-secretase cleavage of APP and ErbB-4 as well as downstream signaling through AICD were unaffected by treatment with Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs. These findings significantly strengthen the concept that these drugs preferentially target Aβ42 production but not other vital γ-secretase mediated cleavage and signaling events.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40288-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), sonicated, and then diluted to 0.1% SDS and cleared by centrifugation at 20000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Nonidet P-40 and SDS extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10. Immunoprecipitated material was separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels, and the APP C50-Myc fragment was detected by Western blotting with antibody CT-15. AICD Reporter Assay—Subconfluent CHO cells were transiently transfected in 12-well plates using FuGENE 6 with the following combinations of plasmids (0.3 μg each): 1) pMST + pG5EIB-luc + pCDNA3; 2) pMST-APP + pG5EIB-luc + pCDNA3; 3) pMST-APP + pG5EIB-luc + pCDNA3-FE65; and 4) pMST-APPΔ + pG5EIB-luc + pCDNA3-FE65. 20 ng of pRL-TK was added to each plasmid mix to control for transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated for additional 24 h with 2.5 μm γ-secretase inhibitor L685,458, 500 μm ibuprofen, 60 μm sulindac sulfide, or Me2SO vehicle. The cells were then lysed, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a dual injector luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Firefly luciferase values were standardized to the corresponding Renilla luciferase values. To control for nonspecific drug effects, these values were then normalized for transactivation observed in cells expressing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone and treated with the respective drug. The values expressed as fold induction over GAL4 are averages of triplicate measurements, and one of two representative experiments is shown. Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs Do Not Impair AICD or ErbB4 C-terminal Fragment Generation—To gain further insight into the specificity of Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs, we investigated intramembrane proteolysis of APP and ErbB-4 by examining the corresponding C-terminal fragments after γ-secretase cleavage. These specific γ-secretase substrates were chosen for several reasons. First, emerging evidence supported a physiological function for the intracellular signaling domains of both of these proteins (7Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 23Koo E.H. Traffic. 2002; 3: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Second, the TMD sequences of other γ-secretase substrates including ErbB-4 are entirely different from APP and NOTCH, and the γ-secretase cleavage sites are unknown (50Ni C.Y. Yuan H. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4561-4565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Consequently, the degree to which the pharmacological properties of these other cleavage substrates are similar to the Aβ42 scissile bond in the APP TMD has not been established. Third, sulindac sulfide was shown to modulate AICD generation in vitro, and ibuprofen suppressed AICD-mediated activation of the KAI1/CD82 promotor (43Takahashi Y. Hayashi I. Tominari Y. Rikimaru K. Morohashi Y. Kan T. Natsugari H. Fukuyama T. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18664-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 51Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A.

Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), indicating that Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs might interfere with AICD function. To analyze AICD generation, APP-PS1ML CHO cells stably transfected with both wild type APP751 and the PS1 mutant M146L were treated with sulindac sulfide (60 μm), ibuprofen (500 μm), γ-secretase inhibitor L685,458, or Me2SO vehicle. We previously showed that at these concentrations of NSAIDs, Aβ42 secretion was reduced by 60–70% (42Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Crude membrane extracts were then prepared and immunoblotted with an antibody against the C terminus of APP. As expected, treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor strongly suppressed AICD formation but markedly elevated APP C-terminal fragments. However, neither sulindac sulfide nor ibuprofen reduced AICD production as compared with Me2SO-treated control CHO cells (Fig. 2). Ectodomain shedding of the ErbB-4 receptor, but not other receptors of the Erb family, can be activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment (47Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This subsequently triggers intramembrane cleavage of the remaining membrane-bound C-terminal fragment and release of a soluble 80-kDa intracellular domain (7Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). To investigate whether γ-secretase-mediated intramembrane cleavage of the ErbB-4 receptor would be compromised by NSAID treatment, T47-14 NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with ErbB-4 were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the presence of the indicated drugs. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were obtained and analyzed by combined immunoprecipitation/Western blotting with antibodies against the C terminus of ErbB-4. Low amounts of the soluble ErbB-4 intracellular domain, but not full-length ErbB-4, were present in the cytosolic fraction of vehicle-treated control cells (Fig. 3A). This fragment was undetectable after treatment with γ-secretase inhibitor. However, as with AICD generation, neither sulindac sulfide nor ibuprofen had an effect on the formation of the soluble ErbB-4 domain as compared with vehicle control (Fig. 3A). There was also no effect on"

To study the physiological consequences of S100A1 in vivo, transgenic mice were developed with cardiac-restricted overexpression of S100A1. Characterization of two independent transgenic mouse lines with ∼4-fold overexpression of S100A1 in the myocardium revealed a marked augmentation of in vivo basal cardiac function that remained elevated after β-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Contractile function and Ca2+ handling properties were increased in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from S100A1 transgenic mice. Enhanced cellular Ca2+ cycling by S100A1 was associated both with increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content and enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, and S100A1 was shown to associate with the cardiac ryanodine receptor. No alterations in β-adrenergic signal transduction or major cardiac Ca2+-cycling proteins occurred, and there were no signs of hypertrophy with chronic cardiac S100A1 overexpression. Our findings suggest that S100A1 plays an important in vivo role in the regulation of cardiac function perhaps through interacting with the ryanodine receptor. Because S100A1 protein expression is down-regulated in heart failure, increasing S100A1 expression in the heart may represent a novel means to augment contractility.

Because S100A1 protein expression is down-regulated in heart failure, increasing S100A1 expression in the heart may represent a novel means to augment contractility. In cardiac muscle, Ca2+ signaling plays a major role in the regulation of the contraction and relaxation cycle. Cardiac myocytes contain specific sensors such as troponin C, a Ca2+-binding protein of the EF-hand type, that can detect the rise in intracellular Ca2+ and initiate the development of active tension (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). S100A1, another EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein and a member of the S100 protein family, may also be important in cardiovascular physiology because it is highly expressed in cardiac myocytes and is the most abundant S100 protein in the heart (2Kato K. Kimura S. Haimoto H. Suzuki F. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have previously found that S100A1 appears to be distributed according to compartmental workloads, with highest protein levels in the left ventricle (LV) 1The abbreviations used are: LV, left ventricle; RV, right ventricle; SV, simian virus; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; NLC, nontransgenic littermate control; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; RyR, ryanodine receptor; CSQ, calsequestrin; SERCA2a, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; PLB, phospholamban; LVSP, LV systolic ejection pressure; HR, heart rate; ANOVA, analysis of variance; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; NS, statistically not significant; AR, adrenergic receptor; AC, adenylyl cyclase.1The abbreviations used are: LV, left ventricle; RV, right ventricle; SV, simian virus; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; NLC, nontransgenic littermate control; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; RyR, ryanodine receptor; CSQ, calsequestrin; SERCA2a, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; PLB, phospholamban; LVSP, LV systolic ejection pressure; HR, heart rate; ANOVA, analysis of variance; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; NS, statistically not significant; AR, adrenergic receptor; AC, adenylyl cyclase. and progressively lower levels in the right ventricle (RV) and the atria (3Remppis A.

Other studies have revealed a co-localization of S100A1 with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the contractile apparatus in myocardium (4Kato K. Kimura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 842: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro studies have shown that S100A1 can interact with numerous intracellular target proteins such as exo- and endoskeletal proteins, metabolic enzymes, signaling molecules, and transcription factors (for review see Ref. 5Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar).Despite these myocardial localization and in vitro studies, a specific in vivo role for S100A1 in the heart and cardiac physiology has remained elusive. Recent in vitro studies from our group in myocytes and myocardial tissue preparations have identified S100A1 as a novel cardiac inotropic factor and a regulator of myocardial contractility (6Most P.

Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of S100A1 protein in cellular cardiac preparations in vitro resulted in marked increases in the rate of contraction and relaxation that was associated both with increased intracellular Ca2+ transients and decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments (6Most P.

In contrast to what was found in the chronically failing heart, S100A1 protein expression was found to be significantly up-regulated in compensated cardiac hypertrophy (12Ehlermann P. Remppis A.

These data coupled with our findings that overexpressed S100A1 can increase myocyte contractile function in vitro indicate that this Ca2+-binding protein may play an important role in myocardial regulation in vivo. Accordingly, in this study we have generated myocardial-targeted S100A1 overexpressing transgenic mice in order to determine the chronic in vivo physiological and morphological consequences of increased S100A1 expression in the heart.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration and Identification of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice with a cardiac-specific overexpression of human S100A1 were created with the use of the murine α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter (13Subramaniam A.

This construct (Fig. 1A) was linearized and purified before pronuclear injections were done by the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center Transgenic Facility. Offspring were screened by Southern blot analysis with a probe for the SV40 sequence as described (14Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J.

Litter sizes and development of transgenic animals were indistinguishable from those of nontransgenic littermate control (NLC) mice. Second-generation animals of the lines S100A1-I and -II both displayed the highest SV40 signals at the age of 5–8 months and were used for all studies in accordance with institutional guidelines.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by standard methods (14Koch W.J.

Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, washed three times with equilibration buffer, and resuspended in 1 ml of the buffer. Fluorescence intensity of bound DM-BODIPY-dihydropyridine at 511 nm was measured with a PerkinElmer LS-50 luminescence spectrophotometer and used as a direct estimation of the DHPR α1-subunit content.Transthoracic Echocardiography—Two-dimensional guided M-mode and Doppler echocardiography was carried out using an HDI 5000 echocardiograph (ATL, Bothell, WA) in conscious mice as previously described (18Kohout T.A.

Three independent echocardiographic measurements were taken in both modes. Left ventricular chamber diameter in endsystole (LVESD) and end-diastole (LVEDD), interventricular septum (IVSth), LV posterior (LVPth) wall thickness in end-diastole, and LV fractional shortening (FS%) were determined in a short-axis M-mode view at the level of the papillary muscles; FS% = LVEDD – LVESD/LVEDD × 100; (%). LV ejection time (LVET) and heart rate (bpm) taken from aortic valve Doppler measurements were used to assess heart rate corrected mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening: mean Vcfc = FS%/ET × √60/bpm × 10; (circ/s).Cardiac Catheterization and Hemodynamic Assessment—Closedchest cardiac catheterization in the same mice that were used for echocardiographic measurements was performed as described previously (18Kohout T.A.

Hemodynamic analysis included heart rate (beats/min), maximal LV systolic ejection (LVSP), end-diastolic pressure, and maximal (LV dP/dtmax) and minimal (LV dp/dtmin) first derivate of LV pressure.Preparation of Adult Ventricular Cardiac Myocytes—Ca2+-tolerant ventricular myocytes from mouse hearts were isolated using a modified collagenase/protease method as previously published (19Adachi-Akahane S. Lu L. Li Z. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. Morad M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were plated with a density of 15,000 cells/cm2 on laminin-coated dishes, stored at 37 °C, 95% O2/5% CO2, and used for experiments up to 4–8 h after isolation.Calibration and Measurement of Ca2 + Transients and SR Ca2 + Load in Cardiomyocytes—Intracellular Ca2+ transients of mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes were calibrated and measured as previously described (7Remppis A.

Briefly, isolated cells were washed in HEPES-modified medium 199 (M199) (Sigma), incubated in 1 ml of M199 (2 mm [Ca2+] e) with 2 μm Fura2-AM for 20 min at room temperature. Calibration and fluorescence measurements were carried out using an inverse Olympus microscope (I×70) with a UV filter connected to a monochromator (Polychrome II, T.I.L.L. Photonics GmbH, Germany). Cells were electrically stimulated with 1 Hz and excited at 340/380 nm. Fluorescence emission was detected at 510 nm, digitized, and analyzed with T.I.L.L.VISION software (v. 3.3). Baseline data from five consecutive steady-state transients were averaged for analysis of transient amplitude (Ca2+ amplitude; (nm)), time to peak (ms), and time to 50% decline (ms). Calibration for Fura2-AM loaded mouse ventricular myocytes on 50 cells yielded a minimal ratio (R min) of 0.38 ± 0.05 and a maximal ratio (R max) of 3.36 ± 0.21, whereas β and Kd were estimated to amount to 5.21 ± 0.24 and 236 ± 29 nm, respectively. Free intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+] i was calculated by the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): [Ca2+] i = Kd × β(R – R min)/(R max – R). Ca2+ transients were investigated at baseline and throughout a stepwise increase of isoproterenol concentrations (10–9-10–5m) under electrical stimulation at 1 Hz and 2 mm [Ca2+] e in M199. SR Ca2+ load was assessed using a standard caffeine pulse protocol (21Ito K. Yan X. Feng X. Manning W.J. Dillmann W.H. Lorrel B.H. Circ.

In brief, myocytes were electrically stimulated to contract at 1 Hz in M199 at room temperature; edge detection measurements were obtained under basal condition and incremental isoproterenol concentrations (10–9-10–5m). Data from five consecutive steady-state twitches were averaged for analysis of fractional cellular shortening (%CS (%)), shortening velocity (-dL/dt, (μm/s)) and relengthening velocity (+dL/dt, (μm/s)).Preparation of Cardiac SR Vesicles—Cardiac SR vesicle preparations from murine myocardium both from NLC and TG S100A1 hearts were carried out as described elsewhere (23Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitations—Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out as previously described (24Asahi M. McKenna E. Kurzydlowski K.

Murine SR cardiac membrane preparations from both TGS100A1 and NLC hearts (1 mg/ml protein) in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 μm CaCl2, 150 mm KCl were mixed with an equal volume of 40 mm HEPESNaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Tween 20. Suspensions were rotated with bovine serum albumin-treated A/G-Sepharose for 30 min and centrifuged to remove proteins bound nonspecifically to A/G-Sepharose. The supernatants were then mixed with A/G-Sepharose and precipitating antibodies either for RyR2 (RDI-RYANRabm), SERCA2a (sc-8094), PLB (Upstate Biotechnology; 05–205) or CSQ (Calbiochem; 208915). The samples were rotated for 30 min and centrifuged (800 × g), and pellets were washed three times with a buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 μm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20. Samples were resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained for S100A1 (SA 5632).Assessment of Ca2 + -induced Ca2 + Release (CICR) from Cardiac SR Vesicles—SR Ca2+ release from isolated SR vesicles from both NLC and TG S100A1 hearts was assessed by determining rapid 45Ca2+ efflux with the Millipore filtration technique from passively preloaded SR vesicles as previously described (25Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 26Rousseau E. Smith J.S. Henderson J.S. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 1009-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).β-AR and PKA Signaling Studies—β-AR binding on crude membrane preparations (15 μg) from either TG S100A1 or NLC mice was performed by using the non-selective β-AR ligand [125I]cyanopindolol as described (14Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 μm alprenolol. For membrane AC activity, aliquots of these membranes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with [α-32P]ATP under basal conditions or in the presence of 10–4m isoproterenol, 10–2m NaF, 10–4m forskolin, and 2 mm CaCl2; cAMP was quantitated as described (15Iaccarino G. Rockman H.A. Shotwell K.F. Tomhave E.D. Koch W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1298-H1306PubMed Google Scholar). For PKA studies, mouse hearts were excised and perfused for 15 min with M199 to wash out endogenous catecholamines (unstimulated group); the β-AR-stimulated group was incubated for 3 min with 10–6m isoproterenol. Hearts were snap-frozen in liquid N2, and γ-32P incorporation in heart extracts was determined and analyzed as described (27Du X.J. Cole T.J. Tenis N. Gao X.M. Kontgen F. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Statistics—Data are generally expressed as mean ± S.E. An unpaired Student's t test and two-way repeated measures ANOVA were performed for statistical comparisons. For all tests, a p value of <0.05 was considered as significant.RESULTSGeneration and Characterization of S100A1 Transgenic Mice—To investigate the physiological role of S100A1 in vivo, we generated transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of the human S100A1 protein under the control of the murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter (Fig. 1A). Two independent lines (designated TG S100A1-I and TG S100A1-II) with nearly identical SV40 signals were identified by Southern and Northern blot analysis and used in parallel throughout the study to exclude an influence of positional effects of transgene integration. Myocardial S100A1 protein levels were determined in TG S100A1 and NLC mice. There was a similar ∼4-fold significant increase of myocardial S100A1 protein levels in both TG S100A1-I and -II animals compared with NLCs (TG S100A1-I, 4.2 ± 0.9-fold versus NLC, p < 0.01, n = 6; TG S100A1-II, 3.8 ± 0.8-fold versus NLC, p < 0.01, n = 6; increase in S100A1 protein for TG S100A1-I versus TG S100A1-II, p = NS, n = 6) (Fig. 1B). Compared with NLC mice, TG S100A1 mice had normal litter sizes; overall, these transgenic mice were grossly indistinguishable and had no increased morbidity or mortality. This included the finding that adult TG S100A1 animals >6 months of age had no cardiac pathology present, including normal cardiac mass. Biometric measurements are found in Table I. Consistent with the lack of cardiac hypertrophy following chronic myocardial S100A1 overexpression, we found no changes in ventricular mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor or α-skeletal actin, two molecular markers of hypertrophy, in TGS100A1 hearts compared with NLC (data not shown).Table IPhysiological and basal hemodynamic parameters in S100A1 transgenic miceNLC (n = 18)TG S100A1 (n = 18)p valueaCompared by paired t-test or ANOVA.Body weight (g)29.77 ± 1.4229.30 ± 1.80NSHeart weight (mg)133.08 ± 5.56128.53 ± 6.87NSHeart/body ratio (mg/g)4.52 ± 0.134.46 ± 0.15NSLung weight (mg)192.38 ± 6.66182.63 ± 3.55NSLiver weight (g)1.41 ± 0.131.21 ± 0.21NSTibia length (mm)17.92 ± 0.1617.86 ± 0.15NSLVSP (mmHg)100 ± 4.15118 ± 6.44<0.03LV dP/dtmax (mm Hg/s)7749 ± 33510274 ± 538<0.001LV dP/dtmin (mm Hg/s)-6936 ± 328-9438 ± 809<0.01LVEDP (mm Hg)6.45 ± 0.566.91 ± 1.14NSHeart rate (HR, beats/min)399 ± 20.6406 ± 13.8NSa Compared by paired t-test or ANOVA. Open table in a new tab Because S100A1 can interact with several Ca2+-regulating proteins such as RyR1 in skeletal muscle (28Treves S. Scutari E. Robert M. Groh S. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Ronjat M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11496-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we investigated the influence of chronic cardiac S100A1 overexpression on levels of major intracellular Ca2+ cycling proteins. Fig. 1B displays representative protein expression results (n = 6) for cardiac RyR (RyR2), α -DHPR, Na+/Ca2+2 exchanger, SERCA2a, CSQ, and PLB (see “Experimental Procedures”). The levels of these proteins were compared in cardiac extracts (cytosolic or membrane preparations) prepared from TG S100A1 and NLC mice. We found no difference in the levels of these proteins in TG S100A1 mice when compared with NLCs (Fig. 1B). In addition to the α2-DHPR, levels of the α1-DHPR subunit, which is the major channel protein of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, were assessed in TG S100A1 and NLC sarcolemmal membrane preparations by quantification of fluorescence DM-BODIPY-dihydropyridine binding (17Knaus H.G. Moshammer T. Friedrich K. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. Glossman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3586-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This revealed no significant difference between the groups (TG S100A1, 0.30 ± 0.03 versus NLC, 0.31 ± 0.06; n = 6; p = NS. Data are given as relative fluorescence units).Hemodynamic Parameters in S100A1 Overexpressing Transgenic Mice—To determine the in vivo functional consequences of myocardial-targeted S100A1 overexpression, cardiac catheterization was performed in closed-chest anesthetized animals. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded under basal conditions and after β-AR stimulation with isoproterenol as described (18Kohout T.A. Takaoka H. McDonald P.H. Perry S.J. Mao L. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, TG S100A1 mice exhibited a marked increase in basal cardiac function compared with NLC animals. TG S100A1 mice showed significantly higher LVSP accompanied by a significant increase in the first derivative of LV systolic pressure rise (LV dP/dtmax) and decline (LV dP/dtmin) compared with NLCs (Table I), demonstrating enhanced contractility and relaxation, respectively. Importantly, both heart rate (HR) and LV end diastolic pressure, parameters that can affect LV contractility, were indistinguishable in TG S100A1 and NLCs (Table I).Interestingly, when TG S100A1 and NLC mice were challenged with isoproterenol, in vivo ventricular performance was significantly enhanced with cardiac S100A1 overexpression. This increased sensitivity to β-AR stimulation was seen with LV dP/dtmax (Fig. 1D), LVSP (Fig. 1E), and LV dP/dtmin (data not shown). HR responses to isoproterenol were identical in TG S100A1 and NLC mice (Fig. 1C).Echocardiographic Function of S100A1 Transgenic Mice—To further investigate the effect of myocardial-targeted S100A1 overexpression on the morphological and functional cardiac phenotype, LV chamber dimensions, wall thickness, and contractile parameters were estimated by echocardiography in conscious TG S100A1 and NLC mice as described (18Kohout T.A. Takaoka H. McDonald P.H. Perry S.J. Mao L. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results are summarized in Table II. LV diameter at end-diastole as well as interventricular septum and LV posterior wall thickness were similar in TG S100A1 and NLC animals. However, LV chamber diameter in end-systole was found to be significantly reduced in TG S100A1 animals (Table II). Moreover, LV systolic ejection time was significantly reduced in S100A1 overexpressing mice, whereas HR again did not differ between groups. Accordingly, calculated values for LV fractional shortening and HR corrected mean Vcfc were significantly higher in TG S100A1 mice compared with NL"

Genetic analyses in yeast have shown that Nop56p plays important roles in the early steps of pre-rRNA processing. However, its precise function remains elusive, especially in higher eukaryotes. Here we describe the proteomic characterization of human Nop56p (hNop56p)-associated pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes. Mass spectrometric analysis of purified pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes identified 61 ribosomal proteins, 16 trans-acting factors probably involved in ribosome biogenesis, and 29 proteins whose function in ribosome biogenesis is unknown. Identification of pre-rRNA species within hNop56p-associated pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes, coupled with the known functions of yeast orthologs of the probable trans-acting factors identified in human, demonstrated that hNop56p functions in the early to middle stages of 60 S subunit synthesis in human cells. Interestingly, the nucleolar phosphoprotein treacle, which is responsible for the craniofacial disorder associated with Treacher Collins syndrome, was found to be a constituent of hNop56p-associated pre-rRNP complexes. The association of hNop56p and treacle within the complexes was independent of rRNA integrity, indicating a direct interaction. In addition, the protein compositions of the treacle-associated and hNop56p-associated pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes were very similar, suggesting functional similarities between these two complexes with respect to ribosome biogenesis in human cells.

The ribosome constitutes one of the most fundamental molecular machines in living cells. Given that protein synthesis is essential for cell growth, proliferation, and adaptation, ribosome biogenesis is intimately coupled to the needs of the cell. Ribosome biogenesis is efficiently coordinated in the nucleolus, a subnuclear compartment in eukaryotic cells. Each mature ribosome in the cytoplasm consists of the large subunit (60 S) and the small subunit (40 S) that together comprise over 80 ribosomal proteins organized within and around mature rRNAs. In mammalian cells, the large subunit is composed of ∼50 ribosomal proteins and three species of rRNA (28 S, 5.8 S, and 5 S), whereas the small subunit consists of ∼30 ribosomal proteins and 18 S rRNA. During ribosome biogenesis, ribosomal DNA for 5.8 S, 18 S, and 28 S rRNAs is transcribed by RNA polymerase I into a large primary precursor (47 S) containing 5′- and 3′-external transcribed spacers (5′-ETS 1The abbreviations used are: ETS, external transcribed spacer; DDX, DEA(D/H) (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp/His) box polypeptide; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; ITS, internal transcribed spacer; LC, liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; MS, mass spectrometer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pre-rRNP, pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; snoRNP, small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein; SRP, signal recognition particle; TCS, Treacher Collins syndrome; SSU, small subunit. and 3′-ETS) and two internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) (1Perry R.P.

Concomitant with the methylation and pseudouridylation of ribose moieties, the 47 S precursor is cleaved at specific sites to produce a series of characteristic intermediates that ultimately result in mature 5.8 S, 18 S, and 28 S rRNAs. Pre-5 S rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III and processed independently of the other three rRNAs (3Geiduschek E.P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During ribosome biogenesis, a multitude of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and trans-acting proteins, neither of which are contained in mature ribosomes, form pre-ribosomal RNP (pre-rRNP) complexes and play crucial roles in the processing and modification of pre-rRNAs as well as the assembly of rRNAs with ribosomal proteins (4Eichler D.C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analyses in yeast over the past 3 decades have identified a number of the trans-acting proteins that are involved in ribosome biogenesis, and their ordered association with and dissociation from pre-rRNP complexes have been outlined (5Tollervey D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Fatica A. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 7Kressler D. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of these trans-acting factors remain obscure. Furthermore, our knowledge of the function of these factors in mammalian cells has been greatly limited by difficulty in identifying mammalian rRNP components because of limited sample availability and the inability to conduct routine genetic analyses. Proteomic methodology has been facilitated by advances in tag-based purification methods for protein complexes as well as the development of highly sensitive mass spectrometric techniques and search engines that access huge amounts of genomic data. The advent of proteomic analyses allows the characterization of large complexes consisting of >100 proteins (8Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K.

In addition to Nop56p, the core proteins Nop58p, Nop1p (fibrillarin), and Snu13p (a 15-kDa protein in human) form the mature box C/D snoRNP complex. The box C/D snoRNP complex has been reconstituted in vitro, and fibrillarin is responsible for its methylation activity (21Omer A. Ziesche S. Ebhardt H. Dennis P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mouse Nop56p is 36% identical and 58% similar to Nop58p at the amino acid level (17Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Shanab G.M. Maxwell E.S. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 861-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because only a single ortholog of Nop56p/Nop58p has been identified in Archaea, these two proteins most likely diverged from the archaeal protein (17Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Shanab G.M. Maxwell E.S. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 861-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of yeast Nop56p indicates that it is responsible for cleaving 35 S pre-rRNA (the primary precursor in yeast) at sites A0,A1, and A2 to produce 25 S rRNA (the mature rRNA corresponding to human 28 S rRNA) (16Gautier T. Berges T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of yeast Nop56p contains repeated KK(E/D) motifs (16Gautier T. Berges T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are also present in the yeast pseudouridine synthetase Cbf5p (22Jiang W. Middleton K. Yoon H.-J. Claire F. John C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4884-4893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a similar motif (KKX) is found in the yeast putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase Dbp3p (27Cavaille J. Nicoloso M. Bachellerie J.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, the KK(E/D) motifs are not essential for Nop56p function in yeast, and therefore the relevance of this motif to Nop56p activity is not clear. Human Nop56p (hNop56p) lacks these specific motifs but contains a stretch of highly basic residues within its C-terminal region (16Gautier T. Berges T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Shanab G.M. Maxwell E.S. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 861-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although Nop56p is known to play a significant role as a protein trans-acting factor in ribosome biogenesis in yeast, the precise function of this protein remains unknown, especially in mammalian cells (16Gautier T. Berges T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present data demonstrate that, within hNop56p-associated pre-rRNPs, hNop56p interacts directly with treacle, the Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) gene product. Materials—Human kidney cell line 293EBNA, Opti-MEM, and LipofectAMINE were obtained from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, FLAG peptide, IGEPAL CA-630, RNase A, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were from Sigma. Hybond N+ membranes, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Trypsin (sequence grade) was from Promega (Madison, WI) and Achromobacter lyticus protease I was from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). ZipTipC18 was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). LATaq DNA polymerase was from Takara (Shiga, Japan). All other reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. Epitope-tagged hNop56p and Treacle Vectors and Expression in 293EBNA Cells—A DNA fragment encoding hNop56p with the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) at its N terminus was amplified by PCR using a human placenta cDNA library template (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) with the primers 5′-ATATAGCTAGCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGGCGGGACGTGGCGCCATGGTG-3′ and 5′-TATATGGATCCTTATTTTCTTCCTTCGACCAT-3′. For treacle, a DNA fragment encoding human treacle with the FLAG tag at its C terminus was amplified as above using the primer set 5′-TATAGCTAGCGCCACCATGGCCGAGGCCAGGAAGCGGCGG-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTCACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTACAGTCTGCTCTGCTGTCTTC-3′. The hNop56p and treacle fragments were cut with the NheI and BamHI, respectively, and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Human 293EBNA cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 μg/ml), and penicillin G (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in an incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells in 90-mm dishes were transfected individually with 10 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the transfected cells were grown for 48 h at 37 °C. Isolation of hNop56p- and Treacle-associated Complexes—At 48 h post-transfection, 293EBNA cells were harvested and washed with PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA630, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 min. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and was incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose with gentle mixing overnight at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate hNop56p- or treacle-associated complexes. After washing the agarose five times with lysis buffer and then once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, the bound complexes were eluted with 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 500 μg/ml of the FLAG peptide. The isolated complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels. Ribonuclease Treatment of hNop56p-associated Complexes—Immunoprecipitated hNop56p-associated complexes (bound to anti-FLAG M2-agarose) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 10 μg/ml RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and eluted with the FLAG peptide in the same manner described above. Immunocytochemistry—293EBNA cells were grown on 8-well culture slides (Biocoat, BD Biosciences). Subconfluent cells were transfected with the expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE as above. Prior to fixation, the cells were washed with PBS, followed by incubation with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. After several washes with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20), the cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then blocked using 3% (w/v) non-fat dried milk in PBS and were incubated with anti-FLAG for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS-T and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS-T. The cells were then examined with a FluoView confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Northern Blotting—RNAs were isolated from hNop56p-associated complexes using the Micro-to-Midi total RNA purification system (Invitrogen). Total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel that was transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with prehybridization solution consisting of 6× SSC (diluted from 20× SSC: 3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution (diluted from 50× Denhardt's solution: 1% Ficoll 400, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured/fragmented salmon sperm DNA for 3 h at 60 °C. Oligonucleotide probes were designed to hybridize to ribonucleotides 221–250 (5′-ETS), 4251–4280 (18 S), 6741–6770 (5.8 S), 7161–7190 (ITS2), and 9411–9440 (28 S), respectively, of the human 47 S rRNA precursor. Each probe was labeled at the 5′-end using MEGALABEL (Takara) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/μmol). Each RNA blot was incubated with prehybridization solution containing a single radio-labeled probe (∼1 × 106 cpm) overnight at 50 °C. The blots were washed twice with 2× SSC at room temperature for 15 min and once with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C. The hybridized blots were exposed to a PhosphorScreen and analyzed by STORM (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Identification by Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—SDS-PAGE gel fragments containing proteins were cut out and subjected to in-gel protease digestion as described (29Yanagida M. Miura Y. Yagasaki K. Taoka M. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1890-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Peptides generated by the digestion were recovered and analyzed for peptide mass fingerprint using a PE Biosystems MALDI-TOF/MS (Voyager DE-STR) as described (29Yanagida M. Miura Y. Yagasaki K. Taoka M. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1890-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Peptide masses were searched with 50 ppm mass accuracy using the data base fitting program MS-Fit (prospector.ucsf.edu), and protein identification was carried out using the criteria described previously (15Fujiyama S. Yanagida M. Hayano T. Miura Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein Identification by LC-MS/MS Analysis—hNop56p-associated complexes were digested with proteases, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by an LC-MS/MS system at the femtomole level as described (30Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The peptide mixture was separated on a frit-less Mightysil-C18 (3-μm particle, Kanto Chemical, Osaka Japan) column (45 × 0.150 mm inner diameter) using a gradient of acetonitrile (0–40%) in 0.1% formic acid over 80 min at a flow rate of either 50 or 25 nl/min by direct nano-LC system (Nanosolution, Tokyo, Japan). The eluted peptides were sprayed directly into a quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-Tof2, Micromass, Manchester, UK). MS/MS spectra were acquired by data-dependent collision-induced dissociation, and the MS/MS data were analyzed using MASCOT software (Matrix Science, Wyndham Place, UK) for peptide assignment. Purification of hNop56p-associated RNPs—To purify hNop56p-associated complexes, we constructed an expression plasmid encoding hNop56p fused to the FLAG epitope (FLAG-hNop56p). In 293EBNA cells, transiently overexpressed FLAG-hNop56p localized primarily to the nucleolus (Fig. 1A). hNop56p-associated complexes that formed in FLAG-hNop56ptransfected cells were purified via immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG-conjugated beads. SDS-PAGE indicated that the hNop56p-associated complexes contained more than 50 proteins spanning a broad molecular weight range (Fig. 2, lane 2). Of these, four proteins were also immunoprecipitated from non-transfected control cells (Fig. 2, lane 4) thus reflecting nonspecific binding. RNase treatment of the complexes while bound to the immunoprecipitating beads resulted in dissociation of almost all protein constituents except for FLAG-hNop56p and its degradation products (Fig. 2, lane 3). These results indicated that the purified complexes were ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and that the association of the protein components was RNA-dependent.Fig. 2Isolation of hNop56p-associated complexes and RNA dependence of protein binding. hNop56p-associated complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation from 293EBNA cells transfected with the hNop56p construct. The immuno-isolated complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel followed by silver staining (14Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Untransfected 293EBNA cells were used in control experiments. RNA dependence of protein association was investigated by RNase A treatment. Lane 1, molecular mass markers; lanes 2 and 3, the hNop56p-associated complexes without and with the RNase treatment; lanes 4 and 5, control without and with RNase treatment. Asterisks indicate FLAG-tagged hNop56p. The nonspecific binding of four proteins to anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads is shown in the control experiment (lane 4). These proteins were identified as SKB1-homolog (NM_006109; gi: 20070219) (a), MEP50 protein (NM_024102; gi:20127622) (b), phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-associated protein 2 (NM_002767; gi: 2253848) (c), and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (NM_002764; gi:19923737) (d), respectively, by MALDI-TOF/MS. hNop56p degradation products are indicated by arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protein Components of hNop56p-associated RNPs—The protein components of the immuno-isolated hNop56p-associated RNP complexes were identified by mass spectrometry. Protein identification was first carried out for individual bands excised from SDS-PAGE gels using in-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF/MS. This analysis yielded 35 ribosomal proteins (29 large subunit proteins and 6 small subunit proteins) and 17 non-ribosomal proteins (Fig. 3, and Supplemental Material Tables I–,III). We described previously a highly sensitive direct nano-flow LC-MS/MS system to identify proteins in limited quantities of multiprotein complexes (30Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, intact immuno-isolated hNop56p-associated RNPs were digested with A. lyticus protease I, and the digest was analyzed directly by nano-LC-MS/MS. More than 2,500 MS/MS spectra were obtained, from which ∼500 peptides were assigned to 104 proteins using the Mascot search software. Of these, 61 were ribosomal proteins (42 large subunit proteins and 19 small subunit proteins) and 43 were non-ribosomal proteins (Tables I and Table II, and Supplemental Material Tables I–III). This LC-MS/MS analysis identified all the proteins documented by the electrophoresisbased analyses except three. A total of 107 proteins were identified in the hNop56p-associated RNP complex using the electrophoresis- and LC-based analyses. Of these, 62 were ribosomal proteins and 45 were non-ribosomal proteins (Tables I and II, and Supplemental Material Tables I–III).Table IhNop56p-associated trans-acting factors involved in ribosome biogenesisProteinKnown function in mammalYeast homologs assigned as protein trans-acting factorsInvolvement in the pre-ribosomal complexes in yeastRefs.Box C/D snoRNP proteins(NM_006392) nucleolar protein 5A (56 kDa with KKE/D repeat)Similar to S. cerevisiae Sik1p, which is a nucleolar KK(E/D) repeat protein involved in pre-rRNA processingSik1/Nop5690 S pre-ribosome16Gautier T.

https://openalex.org/W2093969743,"The synthetic thiazolidinedione ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) improve insulin sensitivity in type II diabetes and induce GLUT4 mRNA expression in fat and muscle. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are still unclear. We studied the regulatory effects of PPARγ and its ligands on GLUT4 gene expression in primary rat adipocytes and CHO-K1 cells cotransfected with PPARγ and the GLUT4 promoter reporter. PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 repressed the activity of the GLUT4 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas this repression was augmented by the natural ligand 15Δ-prostaglandin J2, it was completely alleviated by rosiglitazone (Rg). Ligand binding-defective mutants PPARγ1-L468A/E471A and PPARγ2-L496A/E499A retained the repression effect, which was unaffected by Rg, whereas the PPARγ2-S112A mutant exhibited a 50% reduced capacity to repress GLUT4 promoter activity. The –66/+163 bp GLUT4 promoter region was sufficient to mediate PPARγ inhibitory effects. The PPARγ/retinoid X receptor-α heterodimer directly bound to this region, whereas binding was abolished in the presence of Rg. Thus, we show that PPARγ represses transcriptional activity of the GLUT4 promoter via direct and specific binding of PPARγ/retinoid X receptor-α to the GLUT4 promoter. This effect requires an intact Ser112 phosphorylation site on PPARγ and is completely alleviated by Rg, acting via its ligand-binding domain. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which Rg exerts its antidiabetic effects via detaching PPARγ from the GLUT4 gene promoter, thus leading to increased GLUT4 expression and enhanced insulin sensitivity.

Glucose uptake in eukaryotic cells is mediated by the GLUT family of glucose transport proteins. Six isoforms of GLUT proteins have been identified and cloned, and their tissue specificity has been extensively studied (1Mueckler M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The GLUT4 isoform is expressed in insulin target tissues, i.e. adipose and muscle, where it mediates an increase in glucose uptake in response to acute insulin stimulation. Since glucose transport is a rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism, GLUT4 expression is tightly regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels (2James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The critical importance of tissue-specific regulation of GLUT4 expression for maintaining normal glucose homeostasis is amplified in altered metabolic states. Insulin resistance in type II diabetes, obesity, and aging has been associated with marked reduction in the intracellular pool of GLUT4 proteins; this, in turn, impairs insulin stimulation of glucose transport (3Armoni M. Harel C. Burvin R. Karnieli E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Armoni M. Rafaeloff R. Barzilai A. Eitan A. Karnieli E. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Similarly, in insulin-deficient states such as fasting and streptozotocin-induced diabetes, the intracellular pools of GLUT4 protein were dramatically depleted (6Karnieli E. Hissin P.J. Simpson I.A.

Three PPAR isoforms (α, β, and γ) have been identified and cloned, and these differ in their tissue distribution and ligand specificity (10Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Whereas PPARβ (also called NUC1 in humans) is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, PPARα is found predominantly in hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and entrocytes (11Wahli W. Braissant O. Desvergne B. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). PPARγ is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in adipocyte differentiation and in expression of adipocyte-specific genes (12Spiegelman B.M. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1997; 2: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two human PPARγ isoforms have been identified (PPARγ1 and PPARγ2) that arise from different promoter usage and alternative splicing (13Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

Griffin C.A. Burns D.K. Roth J. Reitman M. Shuldiner A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both isoforms have a ligand-dependent binding domain and a ligand-independent activation domain (referred to as A/B). Transcriptional activity of PPARγ is induced by binding to a diverse group of ligands, including natural fatty acid derivatives, antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (15Henry R.R. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. N. Am. 1997; 26: 553-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Ligand binding by PPARγ, as well as by the entire nuclear receptor superfamily, is independently mediated by the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain of the receptor. The two isoforms differ only in their N termini, with PPARγ2 having an additional 28 amino acids at its amino terminus. These N termini contain distinct ligand-independent activation domains, which confer distinct activation capacities to each isoform and different responsiveness to insulin (16Werman A. Hollenberg A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20230-20235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).The identification of subtype-selective ligands for PPARγ has led to the discovery that these ligands play a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. The antidiabetic thiazolidinedione (TZD) agents have been shown to act as potent agonists of PPARγ (17Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). Both troglitazone (Tg) and rosiglitazone (Rg), novel hypoglycemic agents of the TZD family, were found to increase insulin sensitivity and responsiveness; to correct hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyper-triglyceridemia in type II diabetic patients; and to enhance differentiation, basal glucose uptake, and GLUT1 protein levels in adipose cells (for reviews, see Refs. 12Spiegelman B.M. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1997; 2: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar and 18Murphy G.J. Holder J.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 469-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies regarding GLUT4 gene regulation have thus far provided unclear and even conflicting results. Whereas treatment of obese Zucker fa/fa rats with TZD drugs enhances adipogenic differentiation and increases GLUT4 mRNA levels (19Hallakou S. Doare L. Foufelle F. Kergoat M. Guerre-Millo M.

Furthermore, whereas the TZD ligands are considered beneficial for insulin sensitivity, heterozygous PPARγ knockout mice exhibit improved insulin sensitivity and are protected from the development of insulin resistance due to adipocyte hypertrophy on a high fat diet (22Kubota N.

Thus, PPARγ appears to be a transcription factor that has highly complex and versatile modes of action, including intramolecular communication between its amino-terminal A/B domain and its carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain. The effects of PPARγ depend on the specific ligands, growth factors, cofactors, and kinases present in the tissue(s) where it is expressed. Whereas PPARγ is expressed mainly in adipose tissue, natural PPARγ ligands discovered to date have been rarely evaluated in adipocyte cellular models. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the molecular mechanisms by which PPARγ and its ligands regulate the expression of the GLUT4 gene at the level of transcription in bona fide insulin target cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The thiazolidinedione PPARγ ligand troglitazone was obtained from Parke-Davis, and rosiglitazone was from GlaxoSmithKline (West Sussex, UK). Two commercially available 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15Δ-PGJ2) preparations were used, one from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI) and one from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Compounds were handled exactly as instructed by the manufacturer and used within <1 year. Experiments with either compound yielded similar results. The luciferase reporter assay kit, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from Roche Applied Science (Ottweiler, Germany). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and cell labeling-grade l-[35S]methionine were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK).PPARγ Expression Vectors—pSVSPORT1 expression vectors for wild-type mouse PPARγ2 (mPPARγ2), mutant mPPARγ2-S112A, and wild-type human retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) were kindly provide by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and have been described previously (24Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). mPPARγ2-S112A contains a serine-to-alanine substitution at position 112, which abolishes the MAPK phosphorylation site. The PPARγ2-L496A/E499A double mutant was derived from wild-type mPPARγ2 using mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-GAC-ATG-AGC-CTT-CAC-CCC-GCG-CTC-CAG-GCG-ATC-TAC-AAG-GAC-TTG-3′ and 5′-CAA-GTC-CTT-GTA-GAT-CGC-CTG-GAG-CGC-GGG-GTG-AAG-GCT-CAT-GTC-3′ and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and its sequence was confirmed by direct sequencing. This mutant carries alanine at both positions 496 and 499 to replace the highly conserved residues Leu496 and Glu499 in helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain. Constructs of human PPARγ1 (hPPARγ1), which is 98% homologous to mouse PPARγ1, and its mutant PPARγ1-L468A/E471A, corresponding to the same sites in mPPARγ2-L496A/E499A, were obtained from Dr. V. K. Chatterjee (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) and have been described (25Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J.

Both hPPARγ1 constructs were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector.GLUT4- and PPRE-Luciferase Promoter Reporters—The pGEM7-Luc construct was generated as described by Quon et al. (27Quon M.J. Zarnowski M.J. Guerre-Millo M. de la Luz Sierra M. Taylor S.I. Cushman S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) by subcloning the firefly luciferase gene (as a HindIII/SmaI fragment from pRSV-Luc) into the pGEM7zf(+) plasmid (Promega). This vector is referred to as p0-Luc, as it is devoid of any eukaryotic promoter, and was used as a negative control throughout these experiments. The GLUT4 promoter reporter (pGLUT4-P-Luc) was generated by subcloning the upstream 5′-region of the rat GLUT4 gene (from –2213 to +163 bp relative to the transcription start site) into p0-Luc upstream of the luciferase gene. GLUT4 promoter deletion mutants were generated from pGLUT4-P-Luc by excising specific fragments with the appropriate restriction endonuclease enzymes, followed by religation. The (AOX)3-Luc reporter, containing an acyl-coenzyme A oxidase triple PPAR-response element (PPRE), was obtained from Dr. Christopher Glass (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and has been described previously (28Wang C. Fu M. D'Amico M. Albanese C. Zhou J.N. Brownlee M. Lisanti M.P. Chatterjee V.K. Lazar M.A. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3057-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Transient Transfection and GLUT4 Promoter Activity Assays— CHO-K1 fibroblasts were plated in 100-mm dishes (750,000 cell/dish) and transfected 24 h later with a total of 15 μg of affinity-purified plasmid DNA (EndoFree plasmid purification kit, QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, Germany) using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of pGLUT4-P-Luc reporter cDNA, 0–6 μg of PPARγ cDNA (wild-type γ1 or γ2 isoform or a related mutant), and 1.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector. Five hours later, the DNA-containing medium was washed and replaced with incubation medium (supplemented with stripped fetal bovine serum), and the cells were incubated for additional 48 h at 37 °C.For experiments in insulin target cells, isolated adipocytes were prepared from rat epididymal fat pads according to procedures detailed by us previously (3Armoni M. Harel C. Burvin R. Karnieli E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in primary cultures and transfected according to the technique originally developed by Quon (30Quon M.J. Ravid K. Freshney R.I. DNA Transfer to Cultured Cells. Vol. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New, York1996: 93-109Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were cotransfected by electroporation (three pulses at 960 V, 50 microfarads; Bio-Rad GenePulser) with 2.0 μg of pGLUT4-P-Luc reporter DNA, 0–6 μg of expression vector for PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 (wild-type or mutant), and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. One hour later, an equal volume of incubation medium (supplemented with 7% bovine serum albumin) was added to the DNA-containing medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 18 h at 37 °C.One set of dishes cotransfected with the (AOX)3-Luc promoter reporter was used as a positive control for PPARγ transcriptional activation. To determine nonspecific activity, one set of dishes was cotransfected with the control vector p0-Luc and either 0 or 6 μg of PPARγ expression vector. In each set of experiments, this promoterless p0-Luc reporter exhibited only background levels of activity that were unaffected by PPARγ itself (data not shown), thus ruling out the possibility of global, nonspecific activity of the expression vectors tested. In each experiment, the total amount of DNA transfected was held constant by adding the relevant insertless expression vector to account for squelching by the promoter itself. Luciferase activity was assayed at room temperature using the luciferase reporter assay kit and a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems Inc., Nashua, NH). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity as an internal control (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Within each experiment, values are expressed as a percentage of the induced basal GLUT4 promoter activity, i.e. the activity obtained in cells transfected with the pGLUT4-P-Luc reporter alone. Cell viability was assesses by trypan blue exclusion, and transfection efficiency was monitored by fluorescence microscopy of pCIS2-EGFP-transfected cells. Each experiment was repeated three to six times, with each sample analyzed in triplicates (CHO-K1 cells) or in quadruplicates (adipocytes).In Vitro Translation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The TnT SP6/T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to generate in vitro translated RXRα and PPARγ proteins from the corresponding cDNA. The resulting protein lysate was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, followed by PhosphorImager analysis of proteins translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro translation reactions generated sufficient protein to use in EMSA studies. EMSA studies were performed as detailed by us before (31Armoni M. Quon M.J. Maor G. Avigad S. Shapiro D.N. Harel C. Esposito D. Goshen Y. Yaniv I. Karnieli E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5312-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, a GLUT4 promoter-derived –66/+163 bp DNA probe was prepared by NcoI/Hin- dIII digestion of pGLUT4-P-Luc and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of polynucleotide kinase. EMSA was then performed using the gel shift assay system kit from Pharmacia, with minor modifications. Protein/DNA binding reactions were assembled in a total volume of 20 μl, which included 2–4 μl of in vitro translated PPARγ2 and/or RXRα protein lysate, ∼50,000 cpm radiolabeled probe, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll, and 50 mm KCl. Competition experiments were performed in the presence of a 50–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA probe, which was added 10 min prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe. An OCT1-derived oligonucleotide (supplied with the kit and containing no known PPRE motifs) was included as a nonspecific inhibitor. For supershift assays, 2 μl of anti-PPARγ antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were preincubated with the protein lysate for 10 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. After incubating the samples for 30 min at 25 °C, protein·DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 150 V at 4 °C in 0.5× buffer containing 45 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 45 mm borate, and 1.0 mm EDTA. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 15 min, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging.Statistical Analysis—Wherever stated, the data were analyzed statistically using two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired samples and were considered significant at p < 0.05. Group results are expressed as means ± S.E. of individual data from three to six assays, with each sample analyzed in triplicates (CHO-K1 cells) or in quadruplicates (adipocytes).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWild-type PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 Repress Transcriptional Activity of the GLUT4 PromoterThe effects of PPARγ on transcriptional activity of the GLUT4 promoter were studied in primary cultures of rat adipocytes as well as in CHO-K1 cells, and the data are shown in Fig. 1. Surprisingly, we found that coexpression of wild-type PPARγ2 repressed transcriptional activity of the GLUT4 promoter reporter in a dose-dependent manner to as much as 40–50% below basal levels (i.e. levels obtained in cells transfected with the reporter alone) in both CHO-K1 fibroblasts and rat adipocytes (Fig. 1, A and C, respectively). The wild-type PPARγ1 isoform also repressed GLUT4 promoter activity, but to a much greater extent compared with PPARγ2, reaching a maximum effect of 75% trans-repression in both cell types (Fig. 1, B and D). Under similar conditions, both PPARγ isoforms dose-dependently activated the PPRE from the (AOX)3-Luc reporter, which was used as a positive control (Fig. 1, E and F), thus excluding the possibility of either cytotoxic or squelching effects in the expression system. The two isoforms differ only in their N termini, with PPARγ2 having an additional 28 amino acids at its amino terminus. Werman et al. (16Werman A. Hollenberg A. Solanes G. Bjorbaek C. Vidal-Puig A.J. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20230-20235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have found that the N termini of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 have distinct ligand-independent activation capacities. Indeed, the present data show that PPARγ1 is a more potent transcriptional repressor than PPARγ2, at least with respect to the GLUT4 gene. Thus, our data indicate that, in the absence of any ligand, both the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms exhibit an inherent ligand-independent capacity to trans-repress transcriptional activity of the GLUT4 promoter. These findings appear to contradict the current dogma of PPARγ biology, at least with respect to glucose homeostasis. However, Miles et al. (23Miles P.D. Barak Y. He W. Evans R.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) found that insulin sensitivity is enhanced in knockout mice heterozygous for PPARγ deficiency, although the molecular basis for this effect is unknown. These investigators suggested that, whereas exogenous pharmacological activation of PPARγ improves insulin sensitivity, endogenous activation of the receptor by its natural ligands might serve to dampen insulin action, thereby promoting insulin resistance. Our present data support this hypothesis and, for the first time, provide evidence for a molecular mechanism by which PPARγ can inhibit insulin action.Various PPARγ Domains Make Differential Contributions to GLUT4 Promoter RepressionLike other members of the nuclear receptor/transcription factor family, PPARγ can exert its transcriptional regulatory effects via either ligand-independent or ligand-dependent pathways. Distinct domains of the PPARγ protein mediate these activities; AF-1 mediates ligand-independent activity and AF-2 mediates ligand-dependent activity, respectively. To further characterize the specific contribution of the various PPARγ functional domains to GLUT4 repression, we used PPARγ mutants that are defective in either AF-1 (ligand-independent) or AF-2 (ligand-dependent) activity.Contribution of the AF-1 Domain of PPARγ—The contribution of the AF-1 ligand-independent component(s) of PPARγ trans-repression was studied in cells cotransfected with mPPARγ2-S112A. In the absence of ligands, PPARγ demonstrates a basal transcriptional activity that is exerted in a ligand-independent pathway via MAPK phosphorylation of serine at position 112 (32Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In mPPARγ2-S112A, Ser112 (which corresponds to Ser114 in the human ortholog) was substituted with alanine, thereby rendering the protein unable to be phosphorylated by MAPK and hence defective in its AF-1 function. Our data show that this non-phosphorylatable mutant exhibits significantly reduced capacity to trans-repress transcription from the GLUT4 promoter in both CHO-K1 cells and primary adipocytes (Fig. 1, A and C, respectively).Contribution of the AF-2 Domain of PPARγ—The contribution of the AF-2 ligand-dependent component(s) of PPARγ trans-repression was studied in cells cotransfected with either hPPARγ1-L468A/E471A or the corresponding mutant mPPARγ2-L496A/E499A. These mutants were constructed following heterozygous mutations in the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ that were found in three subjects with severe insulin resistance, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (25Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). In the PPARγ crystal structure, these mutations destabilized helix 12, which mediates transactivation, consistent with marked impairment in transcriptional activation and dominant-negative inhibition of coexpressed wild-type PPARγ. Our data show that both the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 double mutants, although lacking ligand binding capacity, retain the capacity to repress transcription from the GLUT4 promoter, similar to wild-type PPARγ, in both CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 1, A and B) and primary adipocytes (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that impairment of the AF-1 ligand-independent (but not AF-2 ligand-dependent) function of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 significantly impairs the basal capacity of this transcription factor to trans-repress transcriptional activity of the GLUT4 promoter compared with the intact protein.Effects of TZD on GLUT4 Promoter Regulation by PPARγ1 and PPARγ2Because TZDs enhance insulin sensitivity, it has been assumed that PPARγ (and its ligands) enhances insulin sensitivity by ensuring proper expression levels of key glucoregulatory genes. However, our findings show that PPARγ repressed transcription of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 gene. Therefore, we studied the molecular basis of TZD action affecting PPARγ-induced repression of the GLUT4 promoter. We examined the effects of two hypoglycemic TZD drugs that are well known synthetic ligands of PPARγ, troglitazone and rosiglitazone. Isolated primary adipocytes as well as CHO-K1 fibroblasts that had been cotransfected with pGLUT4-P-Luc and with either wild-type PPARγ2 or the expression vector alone were incubated in the presence of the indicated levels of Rg or Tg (and in otherwise ligand-free medium). These levels were chosen based on the range of TZD levels measured in the sera of patients treated with a single oral dose of TZD (3"

The mechanism of pore formation for these toxins involves a complex series of events that are known to include binding, oligomerization, and insertion of a transmembrane β-barrel. Several features of this mechanism remain poorly understood and controversial. Whereas a prepore mechanism has been proposed for perfringolysin O, a very different mechanism has been proposed for the homologous member of the family, streptolysin O. To distinguish between the two models, a novel approach that directly measures the dimension of transmembranes pores was used. Pore formation itself was examined for both cytolysins by encapsulating fluorescein-labeled peptides and proteins of different sizes into liposomes. When these liposomes were re-suspended in a solution containing anti-fluorescein antibodies, toxin-mediated pore formation was monitored directly by the quenching of fluorescein emission as the encapsulated molecules were released, and the dyes were bound by the antibodies. The analysis of pore formation determined using this approach reveals that only large pores are produced by perfringolysin O and streptolysin O during insertion (and not small pores that grow in size). These results are consistent only with the formation of a prepore complex intermediate prior to insertion of the transmembrane β-barrel into the bilayer. Fluorescence quenching experiments also revealed that PFO in the prepore complex contacts the membrane via domain 4, and that the individual transmembrane β-hairpins in domain 3 are not exposed to the nonpolar core of the bilayer at this intermediate stage.

The monomeric forms of the CDCs are highly water soluble, but the proteins bind to cholesterol-containing membranes and then spontaneously self-associate to form large aqueous pores in the bilayer. These oligomeric complexes vary in size and may contain up to 50 individual monomers (3Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect.

The crystal structure of a membrane-inserted oligomer of a CDC is not presently available. However, several fluorescence-based studies have identified the regions of PFO that form a transmembrane β-barrel and have also provided other structural information about the membrane-inserted oligomer. Domain 3 of PFO contains two stretches of amino acids (190–217 and 288–311) that interact with the membrane during pore formation and create an amphipathic β-sheet that serves as an aqueous-lipid interface after insertion into the membrane (7Shepard L.A.

The relative timing of oligomer formation and of the insertion of individual transmembrane β-hairpins (TMHs) has been a subject of controversy (1Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Curr. Top.

Two different models have been proposed to explain the insertion of the CDC β-sheet into the membrane, one based on the prepore mechanism that has been shown to mediate the formation of small pores by several toxins (Fig. 1A; Refs. 22Walker B.

Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Shepard et al. (16Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) showed that a PFO oligomeric complex is formed on liposomes at both 4 and 37 °C, and also showed by SDS-agarose electrophoresis that this oligomer is large and relatively uniform in size. At low temperatures, these authors were able to identify the formation of a prepore complex formed in the absence of significant insertion of the TMHs. Furthermore, they showed that PFO was found to increase the ion conductivity through a planar bilayer by large and discrete stepwise changes in conductance that are consistent with the insertion of a preassembled pore complex into the bilayer. In contrast, Palmer et al. (15Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) proposed that individual SLO monomers are inserted and added to the pre-existing oligomers on erythrocyte membranes to produce a pore that grows in size continuously until it reaches its final state. To establish unambiguously whether PFO and SLO only form pores of a discrete, large size or, alternatively, pores whose diameter is continually increasing, we have analyzed the mechanism of pore formation using fluorophores of different sizes to monitor pore dimensions. Several fluorescein-labeled peptides and proteins with different hydrodynamic radii were encapsulated into cholesterol-containing liposomes, and the kinetics of pore formation was detected by the rate of fluorophore exposure to quenchers (fluorescein-specific antibodies) located in the external medium. If a prepore complex is an obligatory intermediate for the insertion of the transmembrane β-barrel, all sizes of trapped molecules should be released at the same time from the liposomes. On the contrary, if the pore starts small and grows continuously, the smaller trapped molecules should be released faster than the larger ones. As we have pointed out (10Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struc. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827PubMed Google Scholar), major conformational changes in the elongated monomeric PFO structure (6Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. Mckinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) are required to bring the TMHs to the membrane surface while leaving only the tip of domain 4 exposed to the bilayer. Thus, an important question is to what extent the conformational changes have occurred by the time the prepore complex is formed. In other words, what structural changes have occurred at the stage where the PFO prepore complex is poised to insert its TMHs into the bilayer, but cannot because of a lack of energy (16Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), a mutation (19Hotze E.M. Heuck A.P. Czajkowsky D.M. Shao Z. Johnson A.E.

Are its TMHs lying on the surface of the membrane prior to the cooperative insertion of the TMHs to form the β-barrel (19Hotze E.M. Heuck A.P. Czajkowsky D.M. Shao Z. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11597-11605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)? If so, have the nonpolar sides of the hairpins already been exposed to the hydrophobic core of the bilayer? Does domain 4 sit on the membrane surface with the same orientation that it has in the membrane-inserted oligomer? Because so little is known about the prepore structure, we have also addressed the above important questions. Fluorescence quenching analyses of the mechanism of pore formation for a functional PFO molecule reveal the following. (i) The insertion of the oligomeric transmembrane β-barrel for PFO requires the formation of a prepore complex. (ii) Neither PFO nor SLO are able to form small pores on cholesterol-containing membranes, and (iii) the interaction of PFO with the bilayer during binding and prepore assembly does not result in small molecule leakage through the membrane. In addition, the topographical examination of the prepore complex reveals that only the tip of domain 4 is embedded in the membrane bilayer, a topography similar to that observed in the final membrane-inserted oligomer. In contrast, the domain 3 TMHs are not exposed to the nonpolar interior of the membrane in the prepore complex. Preparation of Toxin Derivatives—The gene for PFOC459A, the cysteine-less derivative of PFO in which Cys-459 was replaced by alanine, was cloned in pTrcHisA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (7Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This plasmid (named pRT20) was used as the template for all cysteine-substitution mutagenesis. The generation of cysteine-substituted derivatives of PFOC459A, their expression, and their purification have been described previously (7Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Single cysteine mutants of PFO were 90–100% labeled with NBD and purified as before (7Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The toxin concentration was calculated using a molar absorptivity (ϵ) at 280 nm of 84,000 cm–1m–1 for PFO and of 71,300 cm–1m–1 for SLO (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). Peptide and Protein Labeling with FITC—The labeling of carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes (CA), β-amylase from sweet potato (Amy), and thyroglobulin from bovine thyroid (Thy) (all from Sigma) with fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (FITC, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was performed as described by Heuck and Wolosiuk (27Heuck A.P. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1997; 34: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins (10 mg/ml) were incubated with FITC (molar ratio 1:2, protein/FITC) in 50 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) for 12 h at room temperature with gentle mixing. Unreacted FITC was removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25 or G-50, 1.5 cm inner diameter × 20 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl (buffer A), and the homogeneity of the sample was determined by FPLC using a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to a single symmetric peak of the expected molecular weight were pooled and storaged at –20 °C until use. Reduced l-glutathione (Sigma) was incubated with FITC (molar ratio 1:1) in buffer A for 18 h and stored at –20 °C until use. Liposome Preparation—All phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol was obtained from Steraloids (Newport, RI). Large unilamellar liposomes were generated using an Avestin Inc. (Ottawa, Canada) Liposofast extruder. A mixture of cholesterol and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) (55:45 mole%, respectively) in chloroform was dried at 37 °C under N2 and kept under vacuum for at least 3 h. To hydrate the lipid mixture, 0.55 ml of buffer A was added to the dried phospholipid/sterol mixture (final total lipid concentration 10 mm), and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The lipids were then resuspended by vortexing. The suspended phospholipid/sterol mixture was frozen in liquid N2 and thawed at 37 °C a total of five times to reduce the number of multilamellar liposomes and to enhance the trapped volumes of the vesicles (28Nayar R. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 986: 200-206Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Then the sample was passed 21 times through the extruder, equipped with both a 100-nm and a 200-nm pore size polycarbonate filter, at room temperature (20–25 °C). Whereas the 100-nm filter dictates the final size of the vesicles (mean diameter ∼110 nm; 28), the 200 nm filter faces the initial incoming solution and reduces the chances of contamination with larger particles or foreign material. The resulting liposomes were stored at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks of production. Liposomes used in lipophilic quenching experiments were prepared using POPC and cholesterol in the same way, except that 10 mole% of the POPC (i.e. 4.5% of the total lipids) was replaced by a nitroxide-labeled phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(x-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (x-doxyl-PC, where x is equal to 5, 7, or 12 and indicates the location of the quencher in the acyl chain of the phospholipid). The composition of these liposomes was therefore 55:40.5:4.5 mole% for cholesterol, POPC, and doxyl-PC, respectively. Liposomes containing Tb(DPA)33- and the fluorescein-labeled peptides or proteins were prepared as above, except that buffer A included 3 mm TbCl3 (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA), 9 mm 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA, Sigma, neutralized to pH 7), and 20 μm fluorescein (attached to the indicated protein), and was added to the lipid film to yield a final total lipid concentration of 30 mm (final volume, 0.35 ml). The resulting liposomes were separated from non-encapsulated Tb(DPA)33- and fluorescein-labeled proteins by gel filtration (Sepharose CL-6B-200, 0.7 cm inner diameter × 50 cm) in buffer A. Traces of l-3-phosphatidylcholine-1,2-di[14C]oleoyl (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the lipid mixture in order to quantify the lipid concentration and recovery after gel filtration. The Tb(DPA)33- complex was included in each preparation to allow simultaneous analysis of the formation of small and large pores, as well as an internal control for differences in the leakage properties of each preparation. When these liposome preparations were exposed to PFOC459A, the rate of quenching of the Tb(DPA)33- complex by 5 mm EDTA in the extravesicular medium was identical in each case (not shown). Steady State Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intensity measurements were performed using the same instrumentation described earlier (7Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength and bandpass, and the emission wavelength and bandpass, were, respectively: 470, 4, 530, and 4 nm for NBD; 295, 2, 348, and 4 nm for Trp; 495, 4, 520, and 4 nm for fluorescein; and 278, 2, 544, 4 nm for Tb(DPA)33- . For Tb(DPA)33- measurements, an Oriel 5215 cutoff filter (0% transmittance below 350 nm) was placed in the emission light path to block any second-order excitation light. When measurements were performed at low temperature, the cuvette chamber was continuously flushed with N2 to prevent condensation of water on the cuvettes. Kinetics measurements were done using 1 × 1 cm quartz cells, and the samples were continuously stirred using a magnetic stirring bar (1.5 × 8 mm). End-point measurements were done in 4 × 4 mm quartz microcells that were coated with POPC vesicles to minimize protein adsorption (29Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When additions were made to micro-cells, the contents were mixed thoroughly with a 2 × 2 mm magnetic stirring bar as described previously (30Dell V.A. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Time-dependent Detection of PFO NBD or Trp Emission—A sample containing the water-soluble PFO monomer (final concentration 25–100 nm) in buffer A was placed in the temperature-controlled cuvette chamber and measurements were taken until a stable signal was obtained (F 0). The kinetic analysis was started by the addition of liposomes (final concentration 50–100 μm in buffer A, final volume 1.6 ml), and data acquisition was initiated 15 s later, after complete mixing of the sample. Emission intensities were recorded at the appropriate intervals and at least sixty measurements were taken for each experiment. Blank measurements were made using an otherwise identical sample that lacked the fluorophore. The blank data were subtracted from the corresponding sample data, and the net F 0 value was then dilution-corrected. For experiments using doxyl quenchers, the emission intensities of 50 nm aliquots of the indicated monomeric NBD-labeled PFO sample in buffer A were measured at the indicated temperature as explained above. Time-dependent data acquisition was started after the addition of liposomes (final concentration 50 μm) that either contained or lacked 5-, 7-, or 12-doxyl-PC. Detection of Pore Formation—(a) End point measurements: liposomes (100 μm total lipids) were suspended in 280 μl of buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA and 4 μl of a 1:10-diluted (in buffer A) solution of anti-fluorescein antibody (0.5 μl of this rabbit polyclonal IgG fraction quenches ∼95% of the emission intensity of 0.8 fmol of GSH-Fl in buffer A; lot 84B1, Molecular Probes). The net initial emission intensity (F 0) was determined after equilibration of the sample at 25 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of 20 μl containing the amount of toxin that gives the indicated final concentration were added and the samples were incubated 30 min at 37 °C. After re-equilibration at 25 °C, the final net emission intensity (F f) of the sample was determined (i.e. after blank subtraction and dilution correction) and the fraction of marker quenched was estimated using (F 0 – F f)/(F 0 – F T), where F T is the net emission intensity obtained when the same liposomes are treated with an excess of toxin (i.e. under conditions of maximal release of the fluorophore). Typical values of F T/F 0 for Tb(DPA)33- , GSH-Fl, and Amy-Fl are 0.07, 0.12, and 0.23, respectively. (b) Kinetics measurements: liposomes (50 μm total lipids) loaded with Tb(DPA)33- and the fluorescein-labeled protein were suspended in buffer A supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and 20 μl of a 1:10-diluted (in buffer A) solution of anti-fluorescein antibody. After equilibration of the sample at 25 °C, the net initial emission intensity was determined and PFOC459A was added to a final concentration of 25 nm (final volume of 1.6 ml). Unless indicated, data collection and analysis were performed as described above. Determining the Size of Pores in Liposomal Membranes—A detailed analysis of the mechanism of PFO pore formation requires an assay that can directly measure and efficiently discriminate between transmembrane pores having different diameters. To achieve this, we have used a spectroscopic approach that detects the release of liposome-encapsulated fluorophores following toxin addition. By surrounding the liposomes with quenchers of the fluorophores, any release of fluorophore into the medium is detected by a reduction in emission intensity as a quencher contacts a fluorophore. Such an approach monitors the co-localization of fluorophore and quencher because no quenching will be observed if the quencher cannot access and interact with the fluorophore (e.g. Refs. 31Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 32Sharpe J.C. London E. J. Membrane Biol. 1999; 171: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Heuck A.P. Johnson A.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, as soon as a pore is formed in the liposomal membrane, a fluorophore can diffuse out of the liposome and its release will be detected by the quenching of the emission intensity. The size of the pore can then be estimated by using fluorophores of different sizes within the liposomes because a fluorophore will only move through pores that are larger than the fluorophore (32Sharpe J.C. London E. J. Membrane Biol. 1999; 171: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (αHL) is a β-barrel poreforming toxin that forms a transmembrane pore that is ∼16 Å in diameter (24Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). When liposomes encapsulating fluorescent molecules of different sizes were incubated with αHL, only the small fluorophores with a diameter of about 10 Å were able to pass through the αHL pore and be quenched (Fig. 2A, Table I). A large molecule like Amy-Fl (∼100 Å in diameter) was unable to pass through the αHL transmembrane pore.Table IMolecular dimensions of the fluorophores and quenchers employed to determine the size of transmembrane poresMoleculeMWDiameterDaÅTb(DPA)33-650∼10Glutathione-FI600∼10Carbonic Anhydrase-FI29,000∼45β-Amylase-FI200,000∼100Thyroglobulin-FI669,000∼140EDTA4-290∼10Anti-FI antibody150,00060 × 120 × 150 Open table in a new tab To confirm that the observed fluorescence quenching was dictated by the size of the pore, and not by the nature of the fluorophore-quencher pair used in the assay, liposomes containing both a small fluorophore (Tb(DPA)33-) and a large fluorescent molecule (Amy-Fl) were incubated with αHL (Fig. 2B). The fast quenching of the emission intensity of Tb(DPA)33- after addition of αHL clearly shows that the integrity of the membrane has been disrupted by the formation of pores that are at least 10 Å in diameter (the diameter of the pore required for the mixing of encapsulated Tb(DPA)33- and extraliposomal EDTA). In contrast, Amy-Fl was not quenched because the fluorescent molecule and its quencher (the anti-fluorescein antibody) are too big to pass through the αHL pore. Thus, the emission intensity of fluorescein was unaffected by αHL addition. However, when PFO (pore diameter ∼250 Å) was added to the same sample, efficient quenching of Amy-Fl intensity was observed. This fluorescence approach therefore not only allows direct detection of the formation of a transmembrane pore, but it also permits a direct estimation of the diameter of the newly formed pore. Hence, this spectroscopic assay is both efficient and informative. PFO Pore Formation: a Growing Pore or a Prepore Complex Assembly?—Using the fluorescence approach described above, we can analyze pore-formation directly using a functional toxin and discriminate between the two models of pore formation proposed for the CDCs. If, as suggested by Palmer et al. (15Palmer M. Harris R."
https://openalex.org/W2139691749,"Talin is an essential component of focal adhesions that couples β-integrin cytodomains to F-actin and provides a scaffold for signaling proteins. Recently, the integrin β3 cytodomain and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) kinase type 1γ (a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-synthesizing enzyme) were shown to bind to the talin FERM domain (subdomain F3). We have characterized the PIP kinase-binding site by NMR using a 15N-labeled talin F2F3 polypeptide. A PIP kinase peptide containing the minimal talin-binding site formed a 1:1 complex with F2F3, causing a substantial number of chemical shift changes. In particular, two of the three Arg residues (Arg339 and Arg358), four of eight Ile residues, and one of seven Val residues in F3 were affected. Although a R339A mutation did not affect the exchange kinetics, R358A or R358K mutations markedly weakened binding. The K d for the interaction determined by Trp fluorescence was 6 μm, and the R358A mutation increased the K d to 35 μm. Comparison of these results with those of the crystal structure of a β3-integrin cytodomain talin F2F3 chimera shows that both PIP kinase and integrins bind to the same surface of the talin F3 subdomain. Indeed, binding of talin present in rat brain extracts to a glutathione S-transferase integrin β1-cytodomain polypeptide was inhibited by the PIP kinase peptide. The results suggest that ternary complex formation with a single talin FERM domain is unlikely, although both integrins and PIP kinase may bind simultaneously to the talin anti-parallel dimer.

As such, they support a wide variety of processes that are dependent on cell-ECM interactions including cell proliferation, the suppression of apoptosis, cell migration, and the organization of cells into tissues (1Hynes R.O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21749-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), suggesting that talin directly regulates integrin affinity, possibly by disrupting the interaction between the highly conserved membrane-proximal regions of the αβ-subunit cytodomains (10O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Talin co-localizes with integrins in cell-ECM junctions (focal adhesions; FAs), and microinjection of talin antibodies leads to the disruption of these structures and associated actin stress fibers (11Nuckolls G.H.

Cytoskelet. 1997; 36: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of talin expression in HeLa cells using antisense RNA slows down the rate of cell spreading and leads to a reduction in the size of FAs (13Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse embryonic stem cells in which both copies of the talin gene have been disrupted showed spreading defects and were unable to assemble FAs (14Priddle H.

However, analysis of talin function in mammalian systems is complicated by the recent discovery of a second talin gene (TLN2), which we have shown encodes a closely related protein (also 2541 residues, 74% identity) but with a more restricted pattern of expression (15Monkley S.J. Pritchard C.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mouse embryos with the TLN1 (–/–) genotype failed to complete gastrulation (16Monkley S.J. Zho X.-H. Kinston S.J. Giblett S.M. Hemmings L. Priddle H. Brown J.E. Pritchard C.A. Critchley D.R. Fassler R Dev. Dynamics. 2000; 219: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), probably because of a failure of mesoderm migration, and in Drosophila, deletion of the single talin gene gives rise to phenotypes very similar to integrin null alleles (17Brown N.H.

The known biochemical properties of talin are also consistent with a role in linking integrins to F-actin. It is a large (270 kDa) flexible rod-shaped (600 nm) (18Winkler J. Lunsdorf H. Jockusch B.M.

It also contains a second lower affinity integrin-binding site (residues 1984–2541) (25Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which in turn has multiple binding partners. The recently determined crystal structure of the talin FERM domain (subdomains F2/F3) fused to part of the β3-integrin cytodomain shows that the F3 subdomain resembles a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (31Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D.R. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) that typically recognize NPXpY motifs in proteins. Indeed, the membraneproximal NPXY motif in the integrin cytoplasmic domain is essential for talin binding (3Calderwood D.A. Yan B. de Pereda J.M. Alvarez B.G. Fujioka Y. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21749-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Integrin binding occurs through a mainly hydrophobic area in the talin F3 subdomain centered on the β5-strand and involving residues of the β6-strand, the C-terminal half of helix 5, and the β4-β5 loop. Integrin residues Trp739–Tyr747 all make direct contact with talin with the exception of Asn743. As expected, mutation of talin residues predicted to be involved in integrin binding (Arg358, Trp359, and Ile396 to alanine) abolishes or markedly reduced binding of a GST-talin F2/F3 polypeptide to a His-tagged integrin β3-subunit cytodomain peptide immobilized on nickel-coated beads. Interestingly, the talin F3 subdomain has also recently been shown to bind to the C-terminal 28 residues of an alternatively spliced isoform of PIP4′P-5′ kinase type 1γ, which is localized in FAs (32Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The talin/PIP kinase interaction is adhesion-dependent (33Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and activates the PIP kinase (32Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), which is then reported to drive talin from a cytoplasmic pool to the plasma membrane and to facilitate its incorporation into FAs (33Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A PIP kinase-dead mutant can support the translocation of talin to the membrane but disrupts talin and FAK localization to FAs (33Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This suggests a model in which cell/ECM interaction somehow triggers the assembly of a talin/PIP kinase type 1γ complex that translocates to the plasma membrane, resulting in a highly localized increase in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) concentration. The integrin-binding sites in talin are masked and have been shown to be activated by PIP2 in vitro (34Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Talin activated in this way might then bind to and in turn activate integrins, rendering them competent to engage the ECM. Such an ECM/integrin/talin complex might then interact with F-actin leading to FA assembly and be further stabilized by the recruitment of vinculin (35Galbraith C.G. Yamada K.M. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), which also binds to and is activated by PIP2 (36Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 37Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Such a model is consistent with the fact that cell adhesion to fibronectin increases PIP2 levels (38McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 39Oude Weernink P.A. Guo Y. Zhang C. Schmidt M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that PIP2 increases the strength of the adhesion energy between the membrane and the actin cytoskeleton (40Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). One of the questions raised by this study is whether an ECM/integrin/talin complex might also include PIP kinase or whether both integrins and PIP kinase compete for binding to the same pocket on the talin F3 subdomain. To address this question, we have used NMR and fluorescence to assay the interaction between a talin F2/F3 subdomain polypeptide and a synthetic PIP kinase peptide containing the minimal talin-binding sequence. The results show that Arg358 in the talin F3 subdomain is involved in binding both the PIP kinase type 1γ and the β-integrin. Moreover, the ability of the GST-β1-integrin cytoplasmic domain to bind talin is inhibited by a PIP kinase type 1γ peptide. Protein Expression and Purification—All of the talin constructs were amplified by PCR from a mouse cDNA (20Rees D.J.G. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET15b prokaryotic expression vector. Uniformly 15N-labeled His-tagged proteins were expressed at 37 °C as described by Marley et al. (41Marley J.A. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) or were selectively labeled with 15N-Ile or 15N-Val (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc). The proteins were purified using a nickel affinity column and cleaved with thrombin following standard protocols (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protein was further purified using a SP Sepharose cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5 (NMR buffer). All of the proteins were stable and could be concentrated to ∼1 mm without any significant effect on the quality of the NMR spectra. Binding of Talin Polypeptides to PIP Kinase Analyzed by NMR and Fluorescence—A PIP kinase peptide containing the minimal talin-binding site (32Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R.

Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (underlined) 642TDERSWVYSPLHYSAQA658 was synthesized, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Purity of >85% was estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography. The protein and peptide concentrations were determined from the UV absorbance at 280 nm. Binding of the PIP kinase peptide (10 mm stock solution in NMR buffer) to talin polypeptides was followed using one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H,15N-HSQC spectra acquired at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer at 25 °C. The spectra were processed and analyzed using XWINNMR 3.1 software (Bruker) and were referenced to the external DSS standard at 0.000 ppm. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using an SLM 48000 spectrofluorimeter or a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorimeter at 20 °C and were corrected for background emission. Stopped flow records were captured using an Applied Photophysics SX18MV instrument with excitation at 297 nm and the emission collected through WG320 and UG11 filters as described previously (42Málnási-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The data were fitted to single exponentials to extract an observed rate constant k obs = k +1[PIP kinase] + k –1. where k +1 and k –1 represent the association and the dissociation rate constant, respectively. Single exponential fits were satisfactory at low concentrations of the PIP kinase peptide, despite approaching second order conditions caused by the dominating contribution from k –1. Affinity Chromatography of Talin from Rat Brain Extract—The affinity chromatography experiments were performed as previously described (32Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-mg rat brain Triton X-100 extracts were affinity-purified on Sepharose 4B columns containing 200 μg of GST or GST fusions of the 28-amino acid C-terminal tail of human PIP kinase Iγ 90 (641–668) as well as of the integrin β1 cytodomain (43Kaapa A. Peter K. Ylanne J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. Following four washes with the same buffer, affinity-purified material was eluted in sample buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or Coomassie Blue staining. In competition experiments, the brain extracts were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a PIP kinase synthetic peptide containing the minimal talin-binding site (32Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (underlined) 643DERSWVYSPLHYS655 and a control peptide W647A, P651A at various concentrations. Analysis of the Talin FERM Domain by NMR—Comparison of 15N-HSQC spectra of the complete talin FERM domain (F1F2F3; residues 86–410), the F2F3 subdomains (residues 196–400), and the F2 subdomain alone (residues 196–309) is presented in Fig. 1. The notable feature of the F1F2F3 spectra is the presence of ∼30 relatively sharp and intense cross-peaks, indicative of an unstructured and highly mobile region (Fig. 1, a and b). This region is localized to the F1 subdomain because the spectra of F2F3 (Fig. 1c) or F2 (Fig. 1d) alone do not have this feature and probably represents the insert predicted to exist in F1 based on sequence alignments (22Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The absence of extensive unstructured regions in the F2F3 and F2 polypeptides demonstrates that fragments of the FERM domain expressed separately retain a globular structure that includes the N- and C-terminal regions. Moreover, superimposition of the spectra of the F2 and F2F3 polypeptides with that of the complete FERM domain reveals that the majority of the cross-peaks have the same position, indicating that the smaller polypeptides adopt the native structure. However, some cross-peaks of the smaller polypeptides do not have a corresponding cross-peak at the same position in the F1F2F3 polypeptide, indicating direct contact between the individual subdomains. All of these observations are entirely consistent with the known structural characteristics of FERM domains, which consist of three globular subdomains connected by short linkers (22Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Analysis of Binding of the Talin FERM Domain to PIP Kinase Type 1γ by NMR—Addition of the PIP kinase peptide 642TDERSWVYSPLHYSAQA658 resulted in significant changes in the 15N-HSQC spectra of all three uniformly labeled talin polypeptides. In the case of F2F3 (Fig. 2a) and F1F2F3 (data not shown), the exchange between the free and the bound states was slow on the NMR time scale as shown by the appearance of new cross-peaks in the 15N-HSQC spectra upon the addition of peptide. The intensity of these peaks increased with increasing peptide concentration and reached a maximum at a 1:1 molar ratio. In parallel, a similar number of resonances decreased in intensity and disappeared at a 1:1 molar ratio. Further addition of peptide did not produce any changes in the 15N-HSQC spectrum, and sharp resonances corresponding to the signals of the free peptide appeared in the proton spectrum. The PIP kinase peptide also caused specific changes in the F2 spectra (Fig. 2b), but the number of affected resonances and the extent of the changes were substantially smaller than with the F2F3 polypeptide. Moreover, titration of F2 with peptide lead to a gradual shift of the affected cross-peaks, corresponding to fast exchange on the NMR time scale. The data demonstrate that the interaction of the PIP kinase peptide with the F1F2F3 and F2F3 subdomains is much stronger than that with the F2 subdomain and that the number of residues involved in binding is much larger in the former case. This suggests that the F3 subdomain contains the main binding site for PIP kinase. This result is in complete agreement with the data of Di Paolo et al. (32Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), who mapped the PIP kinase-binding site to the talin F3 subdomain using pull-down assays. At the same time the specific changes observed in the F2 spectra upon peptide binding may indicate a significant contribution from this domain to the binding interaction. Characterization of the PIP Kinase-binding Site in the Talin F3 Subdomain—The location of the PIP kinase-binding site within F3 was deduced from analysis of the peptide-induced perturbations in the 15N-HSQC spectra of the F2F3 subdomain. Initially, we used the well resolved cross-peaks corresponding to the Arg side chains. Seven cross-peaks were observed for F2F3 and four for F2 (Fig. 3), in agreement with the four Arg residues in F2 and three in F3. The cross-peaks of the three Arg residues from the F3 subdomain are easily identified from spectra comparisons, and addition of the PIP kinase peptide affects the position of two of these cross-peaks (Fig. 3b). None of the F2 cross-peaks are affected (data not shown). We assigned the F3 Arg side chain resonances to specific residues using site-directed mutagenesis. Single-residue substitutions at R328A, R339A, and R358A (or R358K) each led to the disappearance of a single cross-peak in the 15N-HSQC spectra, whereas the other Arg side chain resonances were observed in positions close to those of the wild type. The resonance assignments derived in this way show that PIP kinase binding affects the side chains of Arg339 and Arg358. Titration experiments demonstrate different roles for these residues in PIP kinase binding. For the R339A mutant, slow exchange on the NMR time scale was observed, similar to that of the wild type. For the R358A and R358K mutants, the exchange between the free and the bound forms was on the intermediate NMR time scale, as shown by the extensive broadening of a large number of resonances in the F2F3 spectra at a 1:0.5 molar ratio of F2F3/peptide. This indicates a direct involvement of R358 in peptide binding, whereas the lack of affect of the R339A mutation suggests that this residue is located in the vicinity of the binding site but is not in direct contact. Further refinement of the PIP kinase-binding site was achieved through the use of residue-specific 15N labeling. The distribution of Ile and Val residues in the F3 crystal structure (31Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D.R. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 4a. The majority of Ile residues are located in the long C-terminal helix H5 in the vicinity of Arg358 but almost on the opposite face of the molecule from Arg339. In contrast, most of Val residues are located in the vicinity of Arg328 and Arg339 distant from helix H5. We observed very large chemical shift changes of the backbone HN groups of four of eight Ile, and a much smaller change in the position of one of the seven Val cross-peaks (Fig. 5), clearly indicating the involvement of helix H5 in the interaction with the peptide. This helix contains five Ile residues with Ile392, Ile396, and Ile399 being the most likely to contribute to binding as their side chains are exposed. Additionally, the side chain of Ile356 is directed toward the helix H5 and could also be involved. The only Val residue that has an exposed side chain on the same surface is Val380, which agrees with the smaller effect of peptide binding on the Val resonances.Fig. 5Comparison of the Ile and Val side chain 15N,15H-HSQC resonances of the talin F2F3 plus or minus the PIP kinase peptide. 15N,1H-HSQC spectra of the talin F2F3 polypeptide selectively 15N-labeled at Ile (a) or Val (b) residues in the free form (black) and in the presence of equimolar amount of PIP kinase peptide (red) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of Talin FERM Domain/PIP Kinase Peptide Binding by Fluorescence—The presence of a Trp residue in the PIP kinase peptide allowed us to use fluorescence to monitor the protein/peptide interactions. The emission maximum of the free PIP kinase peptide was 365 nm, typical of a Trp ring in an aqueous environment, whereas the Trp in the talin fragments emitted at 338 nm indicative of buried residues. In the presence of the F2F3 fragment, the PIP kinase Trp emission shifted to a shorter wavelength, and the observed fluorescence was enhanced at 340 nm by 10% compared with the computed sum of the free talin and PIP kinase emission (Fig. 6a). The time course of the fluorescence enhancement upon binding was resolved by the stopped flow technique (Fig. 6b), allowing evaluation of the association and dissociation rate constants for the binding process. Kinetic parameters were evaluated from stopped flow fluorescence experiments performed on the wild type F2F3 polypeptide, as well as the Arg mutants and are summarized in Table I. The R358K and R358A mutants show a large reduction in binding affinity. The increase in k off for the Arg358 mutants would be predicted to alter the exchange characteristics from slow to intermediate on the NMR time scale. As can be seen in Fig. 5a, the chemical shift difference between the free and the bound states are 0.2–0.4 ppm for 1H, corresponding to 120–240 Hz at 600 MHz. These values are much larger than k off for the wild type F2F3 polypeptide, compatible with slow exchange but are comparable with the k off for the Arg358 mutants, consistent with intermediate exchange and the strong exchange broadening observed.Table IKinetic parameters for the interaction between the PIP kinase peptide and talin F2F3 assayed by fluorescence stopped flowF2F3 polypeptidekoffkonkoff/kons-1μ m-1 s-1μ mWild type274.46R328A453.612R339A423.612R358A952.735 Open table in a new tab A Model of the Talin F3 Subdomain/PIP Kinase Interaction— The observed NMR spectral changes in the talin F3 subdomain upon PIP kinase binding and the effect of F3 mutations on the interaction maps the minimal PIP kinase-binding site in F3 to the area marked in yellow in Fig. 4b. This includes the surface formed by the β5 strand and the helix H5. The same surface had been identified as the main binding area for the integrin cytodomain by crystallographic studies on a talin F2F3-integrin chimera (31Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M.

According to this structure, the side chain of the Trp residue present in the integrin cytodomain at position –8 relative to the NPXY motif serves as one of the main determinants of the interaction. This side chain is slotted into a hydrophobic pocket in the talin F3 subdomain formed by the side chains of Arg358, Ala360, and Tyr377. The guanidinium group of Arg358 forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr377 and a salt bridge to Asp369 that leads to the stabilization of the pocket. Mutation of Arg358 to Ala markedly reduces binding of talin F2F3 to the β3-integrin cytodomain in pull-down assays (31Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D.R. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The integrin polypeptide chain runs along the hydrophilic stretch of the F3 surface formed by the β5 strand and the helix H5 (31Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D.R. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4) in the proximity of Ile392, Ile396, and Ile398. The turn in the C-terminal part of the integrin cytodomain at Pro745 brings the chain into contact with Ile356 in talin F3. The linker region at the N-terminal part of the integrin sequence is in proximity with Val380. Overall, the mode of binding of the integrin peptide fits well with our experimental data on talin/PIP kinase interaction. Thus, R358A or R358K mutations in F3 substantially increase the K d value for the PIP kinase peptide. The similarities between integrin and PIP kinase binding also extend to the fact that both also interact weakly with the F2 subdomain (3Calderwood D.A. Yan B. de Pereda J.M. Alvarez B.G. Fujioka Y. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21749-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Alignment of the PIP kinase peptide with integrin sequences show that substitutions of integrin residues Asp740 and Thr741 to Val and Tyr, respectively, in PIP kinase (Fig. 4c) make it more suitable for binding to the hydrophobic stretch present on the talin F3 surface. Stronger binding of PIP kinase is therefore predicted. Indeed, we failed to detect any binding of a synthetic integrin β3 subunit cytodomain peptide EERARAKWDTANNPLYKEATS (the NPXY motif is underlined) to talin F2F3 either by NMR or by fluorescence. This suggests that although the WDTANNPLY region is required, it is not sufficient for integrin binding, and that other regions of the integrin cytodomain must be involved as reported previously (29Xing B. Jedsadayanmata A. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44373-44378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, talin binding results in NMR chemical shift changes in the membrane-proximal region of the integrin cytodomain (44Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Binding of Talin to GST β1 -Integrin Cytoplasmic Domain Is Inhibited by a PIP Kinase Type 1γ Peptide—To confirm that the PIP kinase type 1γ90 isoform and the integrin β-cytodomain binds to the same or an overlapping site in the talin F3 subdomain, we sought to establish whether a PIP kinase peptide containing a minimal talin-binding site could inhibit the integrin/talin interaction. The results in Fig. 7 (top panel) show that talin present in a rat brain detergent extract binds specifically to a GST-PIP kinase fusion protein and that a short PIP kinase peptide containing the sequence WVYSPL competes out binding, whereas a peptide in which the Trp/Pro residues were mutated to alanine had no such activity. These PIP kinase peptides were then examined for their ability to inhibit binding of talin to a GST integrin β1-cytodomain construct. Talin present in the brain extract bound specifically to the GST β1-cytodomain, and binding was significantly inhibited by the wild type PIP kinase peptide but not that containing the Trp/Pro to alanine substitution (Fig. 7, bottom panel). These results provide compelling evidence that the integrin β1-cytodomain binds to the talin FERM domain at or close to the same site as PIP kinase. Previous studies have shown that an adhesion-dependent interaction between talin and PIP kinase results in activation of the kinase and translocation of the complex to the plasma membrane (33Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Here, localized synthesis of PIP2 might activate the integrin-binding sites in talin (34Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and facilitate the assembly of integrin/talin complexes. However, because integrins and PIP kinase both bind to the same region in the talin FERM domain, the question arises of whether a mechanism is required to facilitate transfer of talin from PIP kinase to integrins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PIP kinase by FAK is reported to increase the affinity of the interaction between talin and PIP kinase (33Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and a tyrosine phosphatase such as Shp2, which regulates FA turnover (45Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Zhao Z.J. Lacalle R.A. Martinez A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), may be required to weaken the link. Alternatively, synthesis and subsequent binding of PIP2 to the talin head (46Niggli V. Kaufmann S. Goldmann W.H. Weber T.A. Isenberg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) may simultaneously increase its affinity for integrins and decrease that for PIP kinase. However, because talin is reported to contain a second integrin-binding site in the rod region (25Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 29Xing B. Jedsadayanmata A. Lam S.C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is possible that both PIP kinase and integrins may co-exist within talin complexes, and indeed PIP kinase type 1γ co-localizes with talin in FAs (32Di Paolo G.

Specific cellular functions are proposed for each of the three enzymes, and a scenario for evolution of isoprenyl synthases in plants is presented. Plants synthesize a vast array of structurally diverse isoprenoid molecules (1Connolly J.D. Hill R.A. Dictionary of Terpenoids. Chapman & Hall, New York1992Google Scholar). These compounds have important functional roles in plants, and many are useful in industry, agriculture, and medicine. As a result there are intense research efforts under way to characterize the isoprenoid pathway, its enzymes, and its regulation in vivo. Some isoprenoid compounds in plants, such as phytosterols, growth hormones, and plastidic pigments, are essential for development. Others, such as mono-, sesqui-, and some diterpenes, are not necessary for cell viability but frequently act as important mediators in plant ecology (2McGarvey D.J. Croteau R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Plants are able to alter isoprenoid production in response to their environment, and elucidation of the isoprenoid pathway and its regulation is important if one wishes to alter the flux of isoprenoid metabolites for production of industrially useful compounds and pharmaceuticals. Among the complexities associated with deciphering isoprenoid regulatory mechanisms is the presence of gene families or multiple copies of the same genes, the selective synthesis of isoprenoid compounds in specific organelles, and the operation of two independent pathways for synthesis of the C5 building blocks isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) 1The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; CPP, chrysanthemyl diphosphate; CDS, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; FDS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GDS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GGDS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; ORF, open reading frame; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; LPP, lavandulyl diphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; CPP, chrysanthemyl diphosphate; CDS, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; FDS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GDS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GGDS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; ORF, open reading frame; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; LPP, lavandulyl diphosphate. and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (3Schwarz, M. (1994) Terpen Biosynthese in Ginko Biloba: Eine Überraschende Geschichte. Ph.D. thesis 10951, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, Zürich, SwitzerlandGoogle Scholar). The mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP is located in the cytosol where the triterpenoids, including phytosterols, sesquiterpenoids, and prenylated proteins, are synthesized, whereas the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway operates in plant plastids, where isoprenoids involved in photosynthesis (carotenoids, chlorophyll, and plastoquinone) and many secondary metabolites are synthesized (4Lichtenthaler H.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial isoprenoids, such as ubiquinones, are synthesized directly in the mitochondria from IPPs imported from the cytosol (5Disch A. Hemmerlin A. Bach T.J. Rohmer M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The metabolic flux through different pathways and in different compartments of the plant cell can vary substantially depending upon its particular requirements. Understanding how common isoprenoid intermediates, such as IPP and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), are managed is an important step in understanding the regulation of isoprenoid metabolism within a plant cell. Several isoprenoid enzymes are encoded by gene families. A prominent example is farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS), (EC 2.5.1.10). FDS catalyzes the sequential 1′-4 condensations of IPP with DMAPP to produce geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and with GPP to give FPP. At least two different FDS isoforms are found in rice (Oryza sativa) (6Sanmiya K. Ueno O. Matsuoka M. Yamamoto N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), guayule (7Pan Z. Herickhoff L. Backhaus R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and white lupin (8Attucci S. Aitken S.M. Gulick P.J. Ibrahim R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The presence of isogenes coupled with the fact that FPP is located at a multiple branch point in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway suggests that FPP biosynthesis is tightly regulated. Evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by Cunillera et al., who demonstrated that Arabidopsis thaliana contains at least two differentially regulated genes coding for FDS (9Cunillera N. Arró M. Delourme D. Karst F. Boronat A. Ferrer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7774-7780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and later showed that one of these genes is controlled at the transcriptional level. It can be transcribed and translated into an FDS isoform that bears a mitochondrial targeting peptide or an FDS protein without the signaling sequence (10Cunillera N. Boronat A. Ferrer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15381-15388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, synthesis of FPP is tightly controlled and is catalyzed by enzymes localized to different compartments. Recently, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), an enzyme with ∼80% sequence similarity to FDS in Artemisia annua, was isolated from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium (11Rivera S.B. Swedlund B.D. King G.J. Bell R.N. Hussey Jr., C.E. Shattuck-Eidens D.M. Wrobel W.M. Peiser G.D. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 93: 5888-5893Google Scholar). Instead of catalyzing chain elongation to produce FPP, CDS condenses two molecules of DMAPP to produce an irregular monoterpene, chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP). This reaction is the committed step for biosynthesis of the monoterpene component of the industrially important pyrethrin insecticides (12Ellenberger, S. R., Peiser, G. D., Bell, R. N., Hussey, C. E., Jr., Shattuck-Eidens, D. M., and Swedlund, B. D. (August 22, 1995) U. S. Patent 5,443,978Google Scholar). The cyclopropane structure of CPP is similar to those of presqualene diphosphate and prephytoene diphosphate, the transient intermediates formed by squalene synthase and phytoene synthase during the committed steps of sterol and carotenoid biosynthesis, respectively (13Poulter C.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1990; 23: 70-77Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CDS has very low sequence homology with either squalene synthase or phytoene synthase. The high sequence homology between FDS and CDS from closely related plants suggests that the mechanisms for chain elongation catalyzed by FDS and the cyclopropanation reactions are similar (11Rivera S.B. Swedlund B.D. King G.J. Bell R.N. Hussey Jr., C.E. Shattuck-Eidens D.M. Wrobel W.M. Peiser G.D. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 93: 5888-5893Google Scholar). We thought that identification and characterization of genes for FDS and CDS from the same organism might provide an insight into how biosynthesis of FPP and CPP is regulated in plants. Artemisia tridentata ssp. spiciformis, a plant found in the Great Basin region of the Western United States, was selected as an ideal candidate for this investigation for several reasons. Natural products derived from CPP, GPP, and FPP have been isolated from members of the Artemisia genus (14Welch B.L. McArthur E.D. J. Range Manage. 1981; 34: 380-384Crossref Google Scholar, 15Byrd D.W. McArthur E.D. Wang H. Graham J.H. Freeman D.C. Biochem. Syst. Ecol. 1999; 27: 11-25Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of these materials, artemisinin, is a sesquiterpenoid derived from FPP with antimalarial properties (16Butler A.R. Wu Y. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1992; 21: 85-90Crossref Google Scholar, 17Phillipson J.D. Phytochemistry. 2001; 56: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Also, Artemisia plants produce a great variety of irregular or non-head-to-tail structures, including chrysanthemol (18Alexander K. Epstein W.W. J. Org. Chem. 1975; 40: 2576Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Epstein W.W. Klobus M.A. Edison A.S. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 4451-4456Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and lavandulol (20Epstein W.W.

We now describe the isolation of genes for two isoforms of FDS and a gene for CDS from an A. tridentata ssp. spiciformis cDNA library. The genes were cloned into expression vectors, and the recombinant enzymes were characterized. A model for the evolution of isoprenoid synthases in plants is described. Materials—A. tridentata ssp. spiciformis shoots were collected from the Wasatch Mountains, Utah in late June 1998, from a stand of genetically pure plants. They were immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Escherichia coli XA-90 and pKEN2 were provided by Gregory Verdine (Harvard University, Boston, MA). [4-14C]IPP (58 mCi/mmol) and [1,2,4-14C]FPP (50 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Invitrogen, respectively, and [1-14C]DMAPP (55 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Saint Louis, MI. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen, Stratagene, or Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled DMAPP, GPP, and IPP were synthesized by the procedure of Davisson et al. (22Davisson V.J.

Plasmid DNA was purified with the Qiagen Tip-100 Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). PCR amplifications were performed in a PerkinElmer Gene-Amp PCR System 2400 DNA thermal cycler and the polymerase mix provided in the Advantage PCR kit (Clontech). DNA electrophoresis was conducted with 0.8% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R according to the procedure of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad protein assay) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cloning of FDS Isogenes—A guanidinium thiocyanate, phenol-chloroform procedure (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar) was used to isolate total RNA from A. tridentata shoots. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Dynal, Great Neck, NY). Double-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using 2 μg of mRNA, 1 μg of the oligonucleotide (dT)18 NotI, and the SuperScript™ system for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A SalI adapter was used to extend the 5′ blunt end of the double-stranded cDNA. Template cDNA was PCR-amplified with two sets of degenerated primers designed from conserved motifs (domain II and domain V) in FDS (28Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.4 μm each sense (PTSIIa or PTSIIb) and antisense (PTSVa or PTSVb) primer, 1 μl of cDNA, 240 μm dNTP and 50× Advantage Klentaq polymerase mix with the provided buffer (Clontech, San Diego, CA) was performed using a step cycle (30 cycles) program of 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min. The ∼450-bp products were cloned into pGEMT-easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced from the 5′ end of the cDNA. The PCR fragments were classified in groups depending on the determined sequence, and for each group a specific forward primer P3 was designed. This primer in combination with the reverse B31 primer specific to the poly(A)+ region of the cDNAs was used to amplify the 3′ region of the gene. Finally a fourth reverse and specific primer, P4, was designed in the noncoding region of each gene, and a third PCR step allowed the amplification of the full-length cDNA using the forward B29 primer, which is specific to the SalI adapter. This three-step PCR was performed at least twice to avoid mistakes introduced by the use of Taq polymerase. Heterologous Expression in E. coli and Purification of Recombinant Poly-His-FDS Isoenzymes—PCR was performed using the sense NdeIH6-Xa-FY and the antisense BamHI-FY primers under the standard conditions described above (Y indicates the numbering of each gene, and Xa corresponds to nucleotide fragment coding for the recognition sequence of the Xa factor, which can be used to remove the N-terminal His6 tag from the enzymes). The products were subcloned into pMPM3B, a derivative of pKEN2, which was digested with NdeI and BamHI to generate pKEN-His6-FDS-1, pKEN-His6-FDS-2, and pKEN-His6-FDS-5. E. coli XA-90 was transformed with pKEN-His6-FDS-1, pKEN-His6-FDS-2, or pKEN-His6-FDS-5, and overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm when the A 600 reached 0.4. Cells were incubated at 23 °C for 12–16 h after induction and were harvested by centrifugation. Proteins were purified using either Ni2+ spin columns or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and stored at –80 °C in the presence of 20% of glycerol. Activities of the enzymes were checked immediately and after 1 month. Construction and Expression of FDS-5 with an N-terminal GFP Fusion—The ORF encoding the targeting sequence corresponding to the first 52 amino acids of AtsFDS-5 was modified by PCR using the respective primer sets PT5GFPF (sense) and PT5GFPR (antisense). Amplified DNA fragments were digested with NcoI and cloned in-frame into the NcoI site of the GFP expression vector pGFP-MRC (29Rodríguez-Concepción M. Yalovsky S. Zik M. Fromm H. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This resulted in a fusion of the transit peptide to the N terminus of GFP (pGFP-PT-FDS-5). The plasmids pGFP-MRC and pGFP-PT-FDS-5 under the control of the cauliflower virus 35 S promoter, were transiently transformed into tobacco Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi suspension cells by tungsten particle shooting with an inflow gun. After bombarding, the cells were incubated for 16 h at 23 °C, and transformed cells were selected using a Leica MZ12 epifluorescence loupe equipped with an HBO 50 lamp and examined using a Zeiss (Jena, Germany) LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 10 m microscope and a 63×, 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective. GFP was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser, and emission spectra were recorded from 505 to 530 nm. Chlorophyll was excited at 543 nm using a helium laser, and emission was recorded at wavelengths higher then 585 nm. Images were handled with the Zeiss LSM Image Browser Version 2.50.0929 software and exported as TIFF files before being processed for printing using Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountains View, CA). Enzyme Assays—FDS activity was assayed by the acid lability method (30Bartlett D.L. King C.H. Poulter C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in 100 μl (total volume) of 30 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) bovine serum albumin, and an appropriate amount of enzyme (between 30 ng and 1 μg). After preincubation for 5 min at 30 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of substrates (allylic diphosphate and radiolabeled IPP). For routine assays 50 μm [4-14C]IPP (5 μCi/μmol) and 150 μm DMAPP or GPP were used. After 15 min, reactions were quenched by the addition of 200 μl of methanol-HCl (3:1 v/v) and incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C. Acid-labile material was extracted three times with n-hexane and analyzed for radioactivity. CDS activity was assayed as previously described (11Rivera S.B. Swedlund B.D. King G.J. Bell R.N. Hussey Jr., C.E. Shattuck-Eidens D.M. Wrobel W.M. Peiser G.D. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 93: 5888-5893Google Scholar) with one change; the silica plate was developed in 30:70:16:10 (v/v/v/v) chloroform:pyridine:formic acid:water (88% solution). pH Dependence—Reactions were incubated as described above, except that a poly buffer with overlapping pK a values consisting of 60 mm PIPES, HEPES, and TRIS was used. The pH range was from 6 to 9. Product Analysis by TLC—Reactions were carried out in 20 μl of 35 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and the appropriate substrate (50 μm [4-14C]IPP (10 μCi/μmol), 150 μm DMAPP, 150 μm GPP, or 200 μm [1-14C]DMAPP (1.0 μCi/μmol). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5–10 μg of enzyme and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C before a 5-μl portion was removed and spotted on a 20 × 20-cm 60-Å silica plate (Merck). The plates were developed in 25:15:4:2 (v/v/v/v) CHCl3:methanol:water:acetic acid and dried for 10 min with a gentle stream of air. The TLC plates were imaged (Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager), and the resulting autoradiogram was analyzed to determine the Rf of the radiolabeled products. Product Analysis by GC and GC-MS—Purified CDS (100 μg) was added to 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 4.0 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm IPP, and 200 μm DMAPP to a final volume of 200 μl. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The isoprenoid diphosphate products were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols by the addition of 40 μl of 500 mm glycine, pH 10.5, containing 5 mm ZnCl2 and 40 units of calf alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Approximately 0.2 g of NaCl was added, and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with 100 μlof tert-butyl methyl ether. The volume of the extract was reduced to ∼5 μl with a stream of dry nitrogen, and 50 μl of fresh methyl t-butyl ether were added. A 1-μl portion of the extract was analyzed by gas chromatography on a 30-m × 0.252-mm × 0.25-μm DB-5 capillary column (J&W Scientific) with a temperature gradient from 70 to 150 °C at 2 °C/min. The mass spectra of eluted peaks were compared with authentic samples of lavandulol, geraniol, and trans-chrysanthemol. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of cDNA Members of the Farnesyl Diphosphate Synthase Gene Family in A. tridentata— Initial screening of more than 300 sequenced 450-bp PCR products gave 5 different groups with strong FDS sequence homologies (FDS-1, FDS-2, FDS-3, FDS-4, and FDS-5). Group 1 showed high identity with group 4 and group 3 with group 5. A Southern blot analysis did not show the presence of additional genes. Consequently, full-length cDNAs coding for the isozymes FDS-1, FDS-2, and FDS-5 were isolated in a ratio of 40:2:1 for FDS-1:FDS-2:FDS-5. Assuming that the primers recognized each isogene equally, FDS-1 was highly expressed in A. tridentata shoots. Full-length cDNAs were cloned using the three-step PCR reaction as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the nucleotide sequence of each gene was determined. cFDS-1 contained 1378 bp with an ORF of 1038 bp, flanked by a 70-bp 5′-untranslated region and a 270-bp 3′-untranslated region including a poly(A) tail of 16 bp. A polyadenylation signal was identified at 1265 bp (AATAAA). The gene codes for a 346-amino acid protein with a theoretical pI of 5.82 and a theoretical molecular mass 39,705.6 Da. cFDS-2 contained 1221 bp, with an ORF of 1026 bp, flanked by a 177-bp 5′-untranslated region containing a TATA box and a 18-bp 3′-untranslated region. The gene encodes a 342-amino acid protein with a theoretical pI of 5.57 and a theoretical molecular mass of 39,570.45 Da. Finally, cFDS-5 contained 1360 bp, with an ORF of 1182 bp, flanked by a 39-bp 5′-untranslated region and a 139-bp 3′ untranslated region. A polyadenylation signal was identified at 1339 bp (AATAAA). The gene codes for a 394-amino acid protein with a theoretical pI of 5.97 and a theoretical molecular mass of 45,022.41 Da. Despite several attempts, we were not able to isolate full-length cDNA corresponding to cFDS-3 or cFDS-4. At this point we don't know if the partial sequences represent poorly expressed genes or perhaps PCR mistakes. The three full-length cDNAs showed greater than 69% overall identity. Pairwise, FDS-1 had 83% identity with FDS-2 and 75% with FDS-5. FDS-2 had 78% identity with FDS-5. FDS-1 had 97% identity to the FDS-1 orthologue in A. annua (31Matsushita Y. Kang W. Charlwood B.V. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 172: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A second A. annua gene encoding a putative FDS, called FDS-2, is reported in databases (accession number AAD32648). Because of its high identity to FDS-1, the A. annua gene may correspond to FDS-4 cDNA in A. tridentata. The full-length FDS-2 cDNA from A. tridentata did not match the sequences available from A. annua. Sequence Alignments of Prenyltransferases and Construction of a Phylogenetic Tree—A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences for FDS-1, FDS-2, and FDS-5 with those of other prenyltransferases (farnesyl diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase, and geranyl diphosphate synthase) was performed using ClustalX (32Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35300) Google Scholar) (downloaded at ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr). With one exception, the three isozymes had the five conserved regions identified by Chen et al. (28Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) that are characteristic of the chain elongation prenyltransferase that synthesizes isoprenoid diphosphates with E-double bonds. FDS-5 had a T → G substitution in region IV and a D → N substitution in the first aspartate in region V (Fig. 1A). Other amino acids known to be important for FDS activity or substrate binding are conserved in FDS-1, FDS-2, and FDS-5 (33Dolence J.M. Poulter C.D. Poulter C.D. Comprehensive Natural Product Chemistry, Enzymes, Enzyme Mechanisms, Proteins, and Aspects of NO Chemistry. Vol. 5. Pergamon Press, Inc., Tarrytown, NY1999: 315-341Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) indicates that FDS-5 is closely related to CDS isolated from C. cinerariaefolium. The striking similarity between plant FDS and CDS indicates that the proteins evolved recently from the same FDS ancestor. Interestingly, plant GPP synthase (GDS), which synthesizes GPP from IPP and DMAPP, is more closely related to plant geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases. FDS-1 and FDS-2 cluster with other plant FDS proteins. Pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences in FDS-1, FDS-2, and FDS-5 showed >69% identity and >89% similarity among the three proteins, suggesting that the three genes are very closely related. One notable difference between the DNA sequences was a 5′ extension in the ORF of FDS-5. This sequence encodes 52 amino acids not found in FDS-1 or FDS-2 and was identified as a potential chloroplastidial targeting peptide by the TargetP Version 1.01 program for prediction of subcellular location, with a probability of 93% (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP) (34Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar). Despite multiple attempts, a 3′ sequence encoding a putative mitochondrial-targeting peptide was not found in any of the FDS proteins. Identification of the Function of the 52-Amino Acid N-terminal Extension in FDS-5—To confirm the function of the putative plastidial transit peptide, the DNA sequence coding for the N-terminal of the ORF was fused to the 5′ end of a mutated version of the gene for jellyfish Aequorea victoria GFP (29Rodríguez-Concepción M.

https://openalex.org/W2032676869,"Recently, the gene PTPRJ (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J) was identified as the candidate gene for the mouse colon cancer susceptibility locus Scc1. Its human homologue PTPRJ is frequently deleted in several cancer types, including colorectal cancer. To elucidate the role of PTPRJ loss in different stages of colorectal cancer and in its pathways of progression, we expanded the previously published comparative genomic hybridization results with novel data on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the PTPRJ locus. We identified a strong association between the LOH of PTPRJ and the loss of chromosomal region 18q12-21 (P=0.009). This observation is specific for progressed colorectal adenomas, suggesting that an interaction between LOH of PTPRJ and loss of 18q12-21 may be involved in the development of a more progressed form of adenomas."
https://openalex.org/W1999671926,"An increasing number of C-type lectin receptors are being discovered on dendritic cells, but their signaling abilities and underlying mechanisms require further definition. Among these, dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR) induces negative signals through an inhibitory immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail. Here we identify a novel C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell immunoactivating receptor (DCAR), whose extracellular lectin domain is highly homologous to that of DCIR. DCAR is expressed similarly in tissues to DCIR, but its short cytoplasmic portion lacks signaling motifs like ITIM. However, a positively charged arginine residue is present in the transmembrane region of the DCAR, which may explain its association with Fc receptor γ chain and its stable expression on the cell surface. Furthermore, cross-linking of DCAR in the presence of γ chain activates calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. These signals are mediated by the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM) of the γ chain. Thus, DCAR is closely related to DCIR, but it introduces activating signals into antigen-presenting cells through its physical and functional association with ITAM-bearing γ chain. The identification of this activating immunoreceptor provides an example of signaling via a dendritic cell-expressed C-type lectin receptor.

Such pairs of receptors, when expressed on the same cell, allow for a balance between positive and negative cell signaling. In most cases, activating receptors are formed as complexes of a ligand-binding subunit with a short cytoplasmic tail and an ITAM-bearing signal-transducing subunit. This signal-transducing subunit can be shared by several receptors. These activating receptors were first identified on effector cells such as natural killer (NK), T, B, and mast cells and subsequently detected on myeloid cells including granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC). Now it is evident that such receptors are used rather ubiquitously, including in platelets (5Gibbins J.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and even nonhematopoietic cells (6Oshima K. Ruhul Amin A.R.M. Suzuki A. Hamaguchi M. Matsuda S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on their domain structures, these receptors are divided into two subgroups, Ig superfamily and Ca2+-dependent (C-type) lectin family. Besides their structural similarity, the genes for these families are clustered (e.g. the Ig superfamily in the leukocyte receptor complex on human chromosome 19 or syntenic mouse chromosome 7, and the C-type lectin family in the NK gene complex (NKC) on human chromosome 12 or syntenic mouse chromosome 6, respectively) (7Trowsdale J. Immunity. 2001; 15: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there have been many C-type lectin receptors detected on DC. Based on their molecular structures, they include two types of receptors: type I C-type lectin as a type I transmembrane protein with several carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) and type II C-type lectin as a type II transmembrane protein with a single CRD. Both types are considered to function mainly as pattern recognition receptors for antigen capture (8Lebecque S. Vaccine. 2000; 18: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and additionally in interactions of DC with other cells (9Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). For example, macrophage mannose receptor and DC-SIGN may act in DC trafficking (10Leteux C. Chai W. Loveless R.W. Yuen C. Uhlin-Hansen L. Combarnous Y. Jankovic M. Maric S.C. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig M.C. Feizi T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Since some of the genes for type II lectin receptors on DC are mapped close to the NKC, one might suspect their additional functions in cellular signaling. We have previously shown that one of these receptors, DC immunoreceptor (DCIR), originally identified as an ITIM-bearing type II lectin immunoreceptor expressed on antigen-presenting cells (14Bates E.E.M. Fournier N. Garcia E. Valladeau J. Durand I. Pin J. Zurawski S.M. Patel S. Abrams J.S. Lebecque S. Garrone P. Saeland S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1973-1983PubMed Google Scholar), actually acts as an ITIM-dependent inhibitory receptor in B cells (15Kanazawa N. Okazaki T. Nishimura H. Tashiro K. Inaba K. Miyachi Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here we describe the further identification of DC immunoactivating receptor (DCAR) as a novel immunoreceptor closely related with DCIR, and we successfully show its activating capacity through the ITAM of its associated Fc receptor (FcR) γ chain. Our findings illustrate that DC can express potentially paired signaling immunoreceptors with C-type lectin external domains. Cloning of Full-length Mouse DCAR cDNA—Total RNA, which was isolated from ICR mouse spleen using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)12–18 primer and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Using this cDNA as a template, PCR was performed. TaKaRa Taq™ (Takara Shuzo Co.

Bonnerot C. Latour S. Fridman W.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1365-1373PubMed Google Scholar). The F(ab′)2 fragment of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal Ab PY20 (BD Pharmingen) were also purchased. RT-PCR Analysis—Oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs of ICR mouse tissues, BM-DC, and BM-NK cells were prepared and provided for PCR under the same conditions as described above (30 cycles for DCAR and DCIR and 25 cycles for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). The following primer pairs were used: for DCAR, 5′-GAG TTC TGG CCT GTT TGA AAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GGC AAC AGC TCC AGA CTT TG-3′ (reverse primer); for DCIR, 5′-GAT CTA AGA AAG CCT GGT TC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCA AGA GAT ATC GTT CCA GC-3′ (reverse primer); for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-AAT GGT GAA GGT CGG TGT GAA CG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TCT TGC TCA GTG TCC TTG CTG G-3′ (reverse primer). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—To detect association of DCAR and γ chain, transfected 293T cells were solubilized in 1% digitonin buffer (1% digitonin, 0.12% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8) (28Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Precleared cell lysates were incubated with preformed recombinant Protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc. conjugated with anti-FLAG M2. To see expression of intact or mutant γ chain, transfected 293T or A20 IIA1.6 cells were solubilized in 1% digitonin buffer, and the precleared lysates were incubated with anti-γ-conjugated recombinant Protein A-Sepharose. For detection of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, A20 IIA1.6 transformants (1.5 × 107 cells/ml) were stimulated with IC (mixture of 2.5 μg/ml 2.4G2 and 75 μg/ml mouse anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2) or 25 μg/ml F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG at 37 °C for 1 min until the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and sequentially solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.4) (29Okazaki T. Maeda A. Nishimura H. Kurosaki T. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13866-13871Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Precleared lysates were incubated with agarose-conjugated PY20 (BD Pharmingen). Complete™ protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science) were added to both lysis buffers. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with appropriate Abs. Immuno-blotted proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Calcium Mobilization Assay—A20 IIA1.6 transformants (8 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded with 10 μm Fura Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in 10 mm Hepes-containing medium at 37 °C for 30 min, inverted frequently (15Kanazawa N. Okazaki T. Nishimura H. Tashiro K. Inaba K. Miyachi Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Collected cells were resuspended in the same medium (1.6 × 106 cells/ml). After the addition of IC (mixture of 1 μg/ml 2.4G2 and 30 μg/ml mouse anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2) or 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG, the cells were analyzed with FCM. Identification of the cDNA of DCAR—Using a search of cDNA and amino acid sequences homologous to the mouse DCIR, one uncharacterized but highly homologous gene was found. This gene, 1810046I24Rik, was originally obtained from the full-length cDNA library of mouse pancreas and appears in GenBank™ under the accession number NM_027218 (30The RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase II Team and the FANTOM ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). To confirm the nucleotide sequence of its predicted coding region, heminested RT-PCR was performed using spleen mRNA as a template. The obtained products were separated in agarose gel electrophoresis, and one major band and minor bands with various sizes were observed. DNA was extracted from the major band to determine its base sequence, and two isoforms were identified as the result. The major isoform was 99 base pairs longer than the other minor one, identical to NM_027218, and these were named DCAR α and β, respectively. To isolate the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of DCAR, RACE experiments were performed, and the base sequences of the obtained cDNA fragments were determined. A contiguous contig representing the full-length cDNA of DCAR was composed by alignment of these three sequences including results of 5′-RACE, RT-PCR, and 3′-RACE, each of which represented at least six different clones. This contig is 737 base pairs in length, excluding the poly(A) tail, and contains a putative open reading frame of 627 base pairs (Fig. 1A). Given a potential start codon is present in the consensus Kozak sequence (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) and a stop codon exists at an upstream position (TAG: nucleotides 89–91), the encoded protein should contain 209 amino acids. The presence of a putative hydrophobic signal anchor, consisting of 27 amino acids (residues 15–41; underlined in Fig. 1A), indicates that this polypeptide is a type II transmembrane protein. Since its extracellular domain contains a single CRD, DCAR represents a type II C-type lectin. Genomic Structure and Localization of the DCAR Gene—The 1810046I24Rik gene, identical to DCARβ, is localized on mouse chromosome 6 supercontig Mm6_WIFeb01_114 (GenBank™ accession number NW_000264). Nucleotide sequence alignment of DCAR and this supercontig enabled us to demonstrate the genomic structure of the DCAR gene with appropriate exon-intron boundaries except for exon III, which was deleted in the β isoform. The DNA fragments containing introns II and III were obtained by PCR, and their exon-intron boundaries were confirmed. The whole structure of the DCAR gene is shown in Fig. 1B. It is composed of six exons representing functional domains. Exon I encodes the 5′-untranslated region and 8 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain, exon II encodes 30 amino acids mainly containing the transmembrane domain (TM in Fig. 1), exon III encodes 33 amino acids representing the neck domain, and the remaining CRD is encoded by 3 exons (IV, V, and VI). DCAR maps close to DCIR, and their genes form a cluster with other related C-type lectins including Dectin-2, macrophage-restricted C-type lectin (MCL) (32Balch S.G. McKnight A.J. Seldin M.F. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18656-18664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) (33Matsumoto M. Tanaka T. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5039-5048PubMed Google Scholar) in a short region of the NW_000264 supercontig (Fig. 1C). The human genomic locus syntenic to this cluster is reportedly located on the telomeric end of the NKC (34Hofer E. Sobanov Y. Brostjan C. Lehrach H. Duchler M. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 181: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DCAR Is Related Closely to DCIR—Amino acid sequence alignment of DCAR and DCIR revealed that their CRDs were highly homologous (91% identity), whereas their cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and neck domains were quite different (Fig. 2A). The cytoplasmic domain of DCAR was much shorter than that of DCIR and lacked tyrosine residue and any signaling motif such as ITIM. These results suggest that DCAR and DCIR form putative paired immunoreceptors. DCAR Contains a Conserved Charged Amino Acid in Its Transmembrane Domain—Dectin-2, identical to NKCL (35Fernandes M.J. Finnegan A.A. Siracusa L.D. Brenner C. Iscove N.N. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2709-2717PubMed Google Scholar), and human BDCA-2 (hBDCA-2) (36Dzionek A. Sohma Y. Nagafune J. Cella M. Colonna M. Facchetti F. Gunther G. Johnston I. Lanzavecchia A. Nagasaka T. Okada T. Vermi W. Winkels G. Yamamoto T. Zysk M. Yamaguchi Y. Schmitz J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1823-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), identical to human DC lectin (37Arce I. Roda-Navarro P. Montoya M.C. Hernanz-Falcon P. Puig-Kroger A. Fernandez-Ruiz E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2733-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), are also C-type lectins, having short cytoplasmic domains without any signal transduction motif. Amino acid sequence alignment of DCAR and these lectins demonstrated that they contain quite similar numbers of amino acids and considerable sequence homology (Fig. 2B), especially the cytoplasmic to neck portions (82% identity for DCAR and Dectin-2). Notably, the charged arginine (DCAR and Dectin-2) and lysine (hBDCA-2) residues were present at the conserved position in their transmembrane domains, and these have been reported to be responsible for an association with adaptor molecules in many immunoreceptors. Expression Profile of DCAR Compared with That of DCIR— Specific expression of DCAR was only examined by RT-PCR, because it was considered to be quite difficult to produce specific Ab recognizing the extracellular domain of DCAR, due to the high sequence homology between the CRDs of DCAR and DCIR as well as the neck domains of DCAR and Dectin-2. The useful forward primer specific for DCAR was prepared in its 5′-untranslated region. Among normal tissues, DCAR transcripts were detected strongly in lung and spleen and weakly in skin and lymph node, whereas DCIR transcripts were more ubiquitously observed (Fig. 3). During differentiation of BM-DC, DCAR expression reached a maximum at day 8 versus day 10 in the case of DCIR. BM-NK cells expressed neither DCAR nor DCIR. These data indicate that the expression pattern of DCAR is similar to but not identical to DCIR. Association of DCAR with FcR γ Chain—When transfected in 293T cells, FLAG-tagged DCAR by itself was expressed very weakly on the cell surface, in contrast to strong expression of DCIR and almost no expression of Dectin-2 on the transfectants (Fig. 4A, top column). To determine whether an adaptor molecule can associate with DCAR, 293T cells were transfected with a mixture of FLAG-tagged DCAR and each one of the known adaptor molecules, including DAP12, DAP10, CD3 ζ chain, and FcR γ chain, and analyzed with FCM. Only in the case of cotransfection with γ chain was surface expression of DCAR significantly enhanced (Fig. 4A, middle two columns). Transfection of γ chain alone could not induce any protein expression on the cell surface detected by anti-FLAG M2 (data not shown). The association of DCAR and γ chain was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation. 293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged DCAR and γ chain were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the associated γ chain was visualized with immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that DCAR and γ chain interact in the cotransfected 293T cells and that this interaction is involved in transport of DCAR to the cell surface. Furthermore, to examine the contribution of membranous arginine residue of DCAR to this association, two kinds of mutant DCAR, whose arginine was mutated to noncharged isoleucine (R/I) and negatively charged aspartic acid (R/D), were prepared and used for cotransfection experiments. Unexpectedly, R/I and R/D mutations only partially but similarly reduced the cell surface expression of DCAR in the presence of γ chain (bottom column of Fig. 4A), indicating that the conserved charged arginine residue in the transmembrane domain of DCAR is at most partly responsible for the association with γ chain. Mutation of ITAM-tyrosines in the γ chain (amino acids 65 and 76 mutated to phenylalanines; Y/F) did not influence the expression level of DCAR cotransfected with intact γ chain (bottom column of Fig. 4A). This result indicates that the ITAM of γ chain has no effect in this association. Calcium Mobilization after Ligation of DCAR-FcR through the ITAM of Associated γ Chain—An Fc γ receptor-negative derivative of mouse A20 B cells, IIA1.6, which we previously used for detection of inhibitory function of DCIR (15Kanazawa N. Okazaki T. Nishimura H. Tashiro K. Inaba K. Miyachi Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), did not express γ chain (28Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We used these cells to detect the activating capacity of DCAR as well as the role of γ chain in DCAR-mediated activation. For this purpose, a chimeric receptor containing the cytoplasmic to transmembrane portion of DCAR and extracellular domain of mouse Fc γ receptor IIB (DCAR-FcR) was constructed and transfected into A20 IIA1.6 cells. After analyzing the expression level of DCAR-FcR on the surface of the transformants with FCM, one clone clearly expressing DCAR-FcR was selected. After sequential transfection of γ chain or Y/F mutant γ chain, the clones showing comparably enhanced surface expression levels of DCAR-FcR were selected (Fig. 5A). The comparable expression levels of γ chain and mutant γ chain in the obtained transformants were confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting using anti-γ (Fig. 5B). We first examined the effect of DCAR-FcR ligation on Ca2+ mobilization using Fura Red as an indicator. IC were composed of anti-Fc γ receptor (CD16/CD32) 2.4G2 and mouse anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2 and used for ligation of DCAR-FcR (27Daeron M. Bonnerot C. Latour S. Fridman W.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1365-1373PubMed Google Scholar). F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG was used as the positive control stimulator, which can aggregate B cell receptor and induce cellular activation (15Kanazawa N. Okazaki T. Nishimura H. Tashiro K. Inaba K. Miyachi Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After the addition of F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG, all of the transformants showed an immediate decrease and gradual recovery of cellular Fura Red, indicating a transient rapid increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6A, lower column). A similar increase in cellular Ca2+ concentration was observed when IC were added to the transformant expressing both DCAR-FcR and γ chain, but not when IC were added to the transformant expressing DCAR-FcR alone or the one expressing DCAR-FcR and Y/F mutant γ chain (Fig. 6A, upper column). These data indicate that ligation of cytoplasmic DCAR connected with γ chain induces Ca2+ mobilization and that the ITAM of γ chain is responsible for this effect. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cellular Proteins after Ligation of DCAR-FcR through the ITAM of Associated γ Chain—We further examined the effect of DCAR-FcR ligation on tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins with immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting using anti-Tyr(P) PY20. Although bands of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were faintly observed before stimulation,"
https://openalex.org/W2017965913,"Sox8 belongs to a family of transcription regulators characterized by a unique DNA-binding domain known as the high mobility group box. Many Sox proteins play fundamental roles in vertebrate development and differentiation processes. Expression of Sox8 is strong during embryonic muscle development and gradually declines postnatally. In this study, we report that in adult skeletal muscle Sox8 is confined to satellite cells. Down-regulation during myogenic differentiation was also detected in cell culture systems and occurred in parallel with down-regulation of the related Sox9. Overexpression of Sox8 or Sox9 on the other hand disrupted myoblasts in their ability to form myotubes. Concomitantly, expression of MyoD and myogenin decreased and basal as well as MyoD-induced activities of the myogenin promoter were strongly reduced in a Sox8-dependent manner. Our data suggest that Sox8 acts as a specific negative regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, possibly by interfering with the function of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins.

Sox proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors characterized by possession of a high mobility group DNA-binding domain. This domain is highly conserved and was first identified in the mammalian sex-determining factor SRY (for review see Ref. 1Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The family is subdivided into eight groups on the basis of sequence similarity among the ∼30 different members (2Schepers G. Teasdale R. Koopman P. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Several Sox proteins have proven to play fundamental roles in vertebrate development and differentiation processes including endoderm formation, sex determination, gliogenesis, chondrogenesis, hemopoesis, neural crest, and lens development (1Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). One of the well characterized groups of Sox proteins is subgroup E. It includes Sox8, Sox9, and Sox10. Sox10 is critical for neural crest specification, development of melanocytes, and the peripheral nervous system as well as terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (3Southard-Smith E.M.

Sox9 in contrast is required for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage development and additionally participates in determination of the male sex (9Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z.

Hall C.M. Pembrey M.E. Young I.D. J. Med. Genet. 1995; 32: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Finally, Sox8 is the most recently found member of subgroup E (13Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Pfeifer D. Poulat F. Holinski-Feder E. Kooy F. Scherer G. Genomics. 2000; 63: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the function of this protein. Despite its expression during mouse embryonic development in many different organs and tissues during critical phases of their development, Sox8-deficient mice appeared grossly normal and developed only minor phenotypic abnormalities in postnatal life such as a reduction in overall body weight (15Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sox8 is mostly co-expressed with either Sox9 or Sox10, arguing that the loss of Sox8 might be compensated by one of the other subgroup E proteins. Overlapping expression with Sox9 is especially prominent in mesodermal derivatives (15Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle has provided a powerful model system for revelation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cell-fate specification, differentiation, and development. Skeletal muscle differentiation is a tightly regulated process during which mitotically quiescent cells are activated in response to diverse stimuli including exercise and injury. These so-called muscle satellite cells are a distinct lineage of myogenic stem cells responsible for postnatal muscle growth and repair (reviewed in Refs. 16Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 17Seale P. Asakura A. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 333-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, satellite cells divide to repopulate the satellite cell pool and give rise to a large number of daughter myoblasts (18Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Rudnicki M.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 19Beauchamp J.R. Heslop L. Yu D.S. Tajbakhsh S. Kelly R.G. Wernig A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Finally, the daughter myoblasts fuse with and to multinucleated myotubes. The population of satellite cells decreases with increasing age. At birth, satellite cells account for ∼30% of muscle nuclei followed by a drop to ∼5% in 2-month-old adult mice (16Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). This reduction in the population of satellite cells reflects fusion of satellite cells to new or with preexisting myofibers. Thus, satellite cells represent specific stem cells, which are distinct from their daughter cells at the biochemical as well as at the biological level. Satellite cells have classically been defined by morphological criteria and by their localization between the basal lamina and sarcolemma of muscle fibers. Additionally, more recently specific markers for satellite cells have been defined including M-cadherin, CD34, and Pax7 (18Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P.

Dyn. 1994; 199: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Myogenic differentiation is controlled at the transcriptional level by a combination of activating and repressing factors. Prominent examples of activators are basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) 1The abbreviations used are: MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Sox, SRY-box; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole; HDAC, histone deacetylase. including MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (16Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Quiescent satellite cells express no detectable amounts of MRFs. Activated satellite cells first express either Myf5 or MyoD and soon after both transcription factors. Following proliferation, MRF4 and myogenin are expressed in cells that start their differentiation program (reviewed in Refs. 16Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 17Seale P. Asakura A. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 333-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although these MRFs and several other genes involved in myogenesis have been extensively studied, the exact mechanisms of myogenic differentiation are still unclear. In this study, we localize Sox8 in muscle satellite cells and find evidence for its potential role in muscle differentiation. Animal Husbandry, Histochemical Staining, and Single Fiber Preparation—Sox8lacZ/lacZ mice were kept and genotyped as previously described (15Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Embryos were isolated at 16.5 days post-coitum from staged pregnancies. Detection of β-galactosidase activity in muscle of embryonic and 3-month-old adult mice followed standard procedures (22Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Embryonic or adult tissue specimen was fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 2–3 days. Prior to cryotome sectioning (14 μm), tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA). For detection of β-galactosidase activity, tissue specimens were incubated at 37 °C in X-gal staining solution (0.75 mg/ml) until blue precipitates were detectable. Single muscle fibers were prepared by dissecting limb muscles with forceps. After detection of β-galactosidase activity, single fibers were subjected to immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis (see below). Plasmids—The plasmid expressing the GFP-Sox8 fusion protein was generated by cloning the murine wild-type Sox8 coding region between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA).

Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the MyoD expression construct pCS26MTMyoD, and the luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the 184-base pair myogenin core promoter are described elsewhere (24Sun J. Kamei C.N. Layne M.D. Jain M.K. Liao J.K. Lee M.E. Chin M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18591-18596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). pCMV5-Sox9 contained the murine Sox9 coding region as an EcoRI/XbaI fragment. Cell Culture, Transfection, Luciferase Assays, RNA Preparation, and Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Mouse myogenic C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. For differentiation assays, cells were grown to confluence before medium was changed to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum). Cells were harvested and analyzed after 48 or 72 h. In some experiments, C2C12 cells were transfected 24 h prior to differentiation with expression plasmids coding for GFP, Sox8, Sox9, or GFPSox8 using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Pluripotent C3H 10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and transfections were performed at 70% confluence with the indicated expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed to differentiation medium, and after 72 h, cells were fixed and analyzed. For luciferase assays, C3H 10T1/2 cells were transfected in triplicates on 35-mm dishes with 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 μg of expression plasmid. After transfection, cells were returned to DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection, and extracts were assayed for luciferase activity (25Peirano R.I. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments were performed as described previously (15Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with RNA being prepared from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed essentially as previously described (26Rosorius O. Reichart B. Kratzer F. Heger P. Dabauvalle M.C. Hauber J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells, muscle fibers, or tissue sections were fixed, blocked, and immunostained with primary antibodies, and after extensive washing, they were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to Cy2 or Cy3 (Biotrends, Cologne, Germany). The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-skeletal myosin antiserum (1:40 dilution; Sigma), rabbit anti-M-cadherin antiserum (1:50 dilution) (see Ref. 21Irintchev A. Zeschnigk M. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wernig A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal Sox class E antibody (originally generated against Sox10 but cross-reactive with Sox8 and Sox9, 1:50 dilution) (see Ref. 27Paratore C. Goerich D.E. Suter U. Wegner M. Sommer L. Development. 2001; 128: 3949-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mouse anti-CD34 (1:100 dilution; Sigma), mouse anti-MyoD (1:100 dilution; BD Biosciences), and mouse anti-myogenin (1:100 dilution; BD Biosciences). Mounted samples were analyzed using a Leica inverted microscope (model DMIRB) and documented with a cooled MicroMax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Stanford, CA) and the IPLab spectrum and Adobe PhotoShop software packages. Sox8 Is Expressed in Muscle Satellite Cells—It was previously shown that Sox8 is expressed in developing skeletal muscle and gradually down-regulated during late embryonic and early postnatal skeletal muscle development (15Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Starting from this initial observation, we investigated the expression pattern of Sox8 in detail. Because of the high sensitivity of the X-gal staining technique and the fact that expression of Sox8 and the lacZ marker in the Sox8-deficient mouse is highly similar during development, we monitored the expression pattern of Sox8 by β-galactosidase activity. In cryosections of embryos at 16.5 days postcoitum, we found strong Sox8 expression throughout skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A). However, the expression dropped dramatically during development and was confined to numerous, small cells that are evenly dispersed throughout the muscle in 3-month-old adult mice (Fig. 1B). To further characterize the localization of Sox8 in the adult skeletal muscle, we prepared single muscle fibers from the lower limb musculature. This procedure produces intact single fibers together with associated satellite cells surrounded by an intact basal lamina but free of nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. Fig. 1, C and D, show that β-galactosidase activity was restricted to a few small cells, which by their association with the surface of muscle fibers could be satellite cells. It was previously shown that M-cadherin is uniformly expressed in the myotome at early stages of embryonic development. However, in the postnatal muscle, M-cadherin is restricted to satellite cells and the adjacent region of the underlying fiber (21Irintchev A. Zeschnigk M. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wernig A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Because the reduction of Sox8 expression during development and the distribution of Sox8 in the adult muscle resembled expression and localization of M-cadherin, we tested whether Sox8 is also exclusively expressed in satellite cells in the adult skeletal muscle by a combination of X-gal staining and indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against M-cadherin. The results clearly showed that Sox8-positive cells (Fig. 2B) also expressed M-cadherin (Fig. 2D). Moreover, we found no Sox8-positive cells that were negative for M-cadherin. CD34 is a second marker for satellite cells in the adult skeletal muscle (19Beauchamp J.R. Heslop L. Yu D.S. Tajbakhsh S. Kelly R.G. Wernig A. Buckingham M.E. Partridge T.A. Zammit P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1221-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Corroborating our studies with M-cadherin, Sox8 expression within isolated fibers also coincided with CD34 expression (Fig. 2, A and C). These findings showed that the expression of Sox8 is down-regulated during myogenesis and that Sox8 expression is restricted to satellite cells in the adult muscle. Localization and Expression of Sox8 and Sox9 Are Regulated in C2C12 Cells—We next analyzed the expression of Sox proteins from subgroup E in C2C12 cells, a well established myoblast-to-myotube in vitro differentiation system (28Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1978; 15: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Under conditions of high cell density and low serum, C2C12 myoblasts fuse spontaneously and show a dramatic increase in the expression of genes specific for the differentiating (e.g. MyoD, myogenin) or differentiated (e.g. skeletal muscle myosin) state. Immunocytochemistry with an antibody that recognizes all of the three class E Sox proteins revealed that class E Sox proteins are endogenously expressed in undifferentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Sox E proteins are localized in the nucleus in the vast majority of undifferentiated cells (Fig. 3, compare A with B). After differentiation and fusion of C2C12 cells (Fig. 3F), total levels of class E Sox proteins were reduced (compare staining intensity in Fig. 3, B and E). Interestingly, the remaining signal within myotubes was mainly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, E with F). To determine which class E Sox proteins are expressed in C2C12 cells, we prepared total cellular RNA from undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells. These RNAs were reversed-transcribed into cDNAs and analyzed by semiquantitative PCR using specific oligonucleotide primer pairs for Sox8, Sox9, and Sox10. We detected both Sox8 and Sox9 in undifferentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, Sox10 expression was undetectable. When we compared Sox8 and Sox9 expression in undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells, we found a significant reduction of both in differentiated cells. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels remained constant (Fig. 4). Sox11, another distantly related Sox protein, was also expressed in C2C12 cells. In contrast to Sox8 and Sox9, Sox11 expression levels slightly increased during differentiation, showing that not all of the Sox proteins are down-regulated. During myogenic differentiation, Sox8 expression is thus strongly reduced similar to expression of the related Sox9. Overexpression of Sox8 or Sox9 Inhibits Myoblast Differentiation—As Sox8 and Sox9 are down-regulated during myogenic differentiation in the C2C12 system, we investigated the effect of their overexpression on myotube formation. A Sox8 fusion protein with GFP behaved in a manner identical to Sox8 (data not shown) so that both proteins were interchangeably used. GFP-Sox8, a combination of Sox9 and GFP or GFP alone, was transfected into C2C12 myoblasts. After 24 h in proliferation medium, cells were incubated in differentiation medium for an additional three days. Cells were fixed, immunostained for skeletal myosin, and counterstained with DAPI before analysis by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Cell densities were comparable among all of the samples (for phase-contrast microscopy, see Fig. 5, A, D, and G; for DAPI, see Fig. 5, C, F, and I). Myoblasts expressing GFP-Sox8 (Fig. 5, D–F) or Sox9 (Fig. 5, G–I) failed to efficiently form multinucleated myotubes after 3 days in differentiation medium as evident from myosin staining (Fig. 5, E–H). In contrast, expression of GFP alone had no effect on the efficiency of myotube formation of C2C12 cells (Fig. 5, A–C). We next analyzed the effect of Sox8 or Sox9 overexpression on the appearance of MyoD as an early marker of myogenic differentiation. GFP was transfected alone and in combination with Sox8 or Sox9 into C2C12 myoblasts. For these experiments, C2C12 cells were plated at a lower density than before so that myotube formation did not happen. After 24 h in proliferation medium, cells were further incubated in differentiation medium for another 48 h. As published previously (29Rosorius O. Fries B. Stauber R.H. Hirschmann N. Bevec D. Hauber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12061-12068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), expression of GFP resulted in nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic signals (Fig. 6, A, C, and E). Approximately, half of the untransfected or GFP-transfected cells had started to express significant amounts of MyoD after 48 h in differentiation medium (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the majority of cells overexpressing Sox8 or Sox9 remained negative for MyoD (86% for Sox8 and 84% for Sox9 with at least 300 cells from three independent transfections counted; for examples see Fig. 6, D and F). Sox8 and Sox9 thus appear to repress differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts as measured both by conversion into myotubes and by MyoD expression. Sox8 and Sox9 Inhibit Myogenic Conversion of C3H 10T1/2 Cells—To further analyze the role of Sox8 and Sox9 in muscle differentiation, we performed a myogenic conversion assay with C3H 10T1/2 cells (24Sun J. Kamei C.N. Layne M.D. Jain M.K. Liao J.K. Lee M.E. Chin M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18591-18596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Conversion of C3H 10T1/2 cells into myoblasts was achieved by transfection with an expression plasmid coding for MyoD. Subsequently cells were incubated in differentiation medium to induce myogenesis. We tested the effect of Sox8 and Sox9 overexpression on MyoD-dependent myogenin expression. C3H 10T1/2 cells were cotransfected with (i) MyoD and GFP, (ii) MyoD and GFP-Sox8, and (iii) MyoD, GFP, and Sox9. Under our assay conditions, >90% transfected cells co-expressed MyoD and the co-transfected plasmids (data not shown). After 48 h in differentiation medium, cells were fixed, immunostained for myogenin, and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7, cells expressing GFP and MyoD (Fig. 7A) were also positive for myogenin (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the majority of cells expressing GFP-Sox8 and MyoD (Fig. 7C) or Sox9, GFP, and MyoD (Fig. 7E) were negative for myogenin (Fig. 7, D and F). Quantification revealed that 80% GFP-positive cells expressed myogenin, whereas <10% GFP-Sox8 overexpressing cells and ∼20% Sox9 overexpressing cells were myogenin-positive, respectively (Fig. 7G). The signal in the few remaining myogenin-positive cells furthermore exhibited a strongly reduced intensity (data not shown). In conjunction with Sox8/Sox9-dependent inhibition of MyoD expression in differentiating C2C12 cells, these data point to the possibility that Sox8 functions by repression of important myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors with Sox9 being able to functionally compensate in vivo. To analyze the influence of Sox8 and Sox9 on expression of these myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, we tested their function on the myogenin promoter (24Sun J. Kamei C.N. Layne M.D. Jain M.K. Liao J.K. Lee M.E. Chin M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18591-18596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by cotransfection experiments in C3H 10T1/2 cells. As shown in Fig. 8, the presence of Sox8 or Sox9 in transfected cells already resulted in a decreased activity of the myogenin promoter. This decrease amounted to a 4-fold repression in case of Sox8 and a 2-fold repression in case of Sox9. In contrast, the distantly related Sox11 did not significantly reduce the activity of the myogenin promoter in most experiments. On the other hand, co-transfection of MyoD with the myogenin promoter construct led to a 15-fold induction of reporter gene activity. When Sox8 or Sox9 was transfected into C3H 10T1/2 cells in addition to MyoD, all of the MyoD-dependent activation of the myogenin promoter was abolished. Instead, we observed a 2-fold inhibition of the myogenin promoter, which amounted to a 30-fold change in the overall expression rate. Sox11, in contrast, increased the MyoD-dependent reporter gene expression from 15- to 28-fold induction rates. Taken together, these findings suggest that Sox8 and Sox9 act as specific negative regulators of myogenin expression. The regeneration of terminal differentiated adult tissues is ensured by several populations of stem cells that are capable of both self-renewal and generating progressively lineage-restricted progenitors that finally undergo terminal differentiation (30Weissman I.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 31Watt F.M. Hogan B.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). In tissues with a high rate of turnover including blood and skin, the requirements of regeneration need a constant flow of precursors for terminal differentiation. In these cases, progression from progenitors to functional and differentiated cells seems to be continuous. In contrast, in adult skeletal muscle new myofibers are only needed for repair and growth. In accordance, satellite cells are normally quiescent and activated only in response to specific signals provoked by physiological stimuli (16Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The fact that Sox proteins are important developmental regulators in diverse tissues is nicely exemplified by Sox proteins of the subgroup E. Sox9 participates in skeletal development and sex determination. Sox10 is an essential component of neural crest and glial cell development. Sox8, the third member of this particular subgroup of Sox proteins, is widely expressed during embryonic development in various ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives in a pattern largely overlapping with the expression sites of Sox9 and Sox10. Especially, the nervous system and musculature are two prominent sites of embryonic Sox8 expression. Surprisingly, the deletion of Sox8 by homologous recombination led to viable mice with no gross anatomical abnormalities in any of the organ systems tested. We did, however, observe a primarily postnatal reduction in overall body weight. Taking the contribution of muscle to overall body weight into account, we embarked on an analysis of Sox8 in muscle development. Consistent with previously published data (15Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we observed that Sox8 expression in muscle is much higher during development than in the adult. This is due to the fact that differentiated muscle fibers do no longer express Sox8. However, there is persistent expression of Sox8 in a fraction of cells, which could be identified as satellite cells by localization, morphology, and marker expression. These satellite cells present a pool of cells from which muscle fibers can be generated during adulthood in response to damage or growth stimuli. To fulfill this function, they need to exhibit characteristic features of stem cells such as the ability to reenter the cell cycle when stimulated and to leave it without undergoing differentiation (17Seale P. Asakura A. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 333-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, Sox8 does not only appear to be a new and reliable marker of these satellite cells but might also be required for keeping these cells in their undifferentiated state. This latter hypothesis prompted us to analyze expression and function of Sox8 in tissue culture systems in which myogenic differentiation can be modeled, such as C2C12 cells, which under conditions of high density and low serum differentiate and fuse spontaneously to form myotubes. Whereas Sox8 was strongly expressed in proliferating undifferentiated C2C12 cells, there was a severe down-regulation concomitant with myotube formation. Thus, we can conclude that similar reductions of Sox8 expression take place during C2C12 cell differentiation as during myotube formation from satellite cells in vivo. Additionally, we found Sox9 to be co-expressed with Sox8 during all of the phases of differentiation in C2C12 cells. Concomitant with the reduction of expression levels, we also observed an efficient exclusion of the remaining Sox8 and Sox9 proteins from the nuclei of forming myotubes. This might indicate that subcellular relocalization of Sox8 and Sox9 might be a second method of regulating its activity during myogenic differentiation. We and others (32Gasca S. Canizares J. De Santa Barbara P. Mejan C. Poulat F. Berta P. Boizet-Bonhoure B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11199-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Rehberg S. Lischka P. Glaser G. Stamminger T. Wegner M. Rosorius O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5826-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have previously shown that Sox10 and Sox9 possess a nuclear export signal and can shuttle between the nuclear and cytosolic compartment. The corresponding region is fully conserved and active in Sox8 2K. Schmidt, M. Wegner, and O. Rosorius, unpublished results. as are the two nuclear localization signals present in all of the Sox proteins. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that subcellular relocalization during myogenic differentiation results from altered nuclear import or export and serves as a fast means to inactivate the existing protein and to respond to myogenic stimuli. At the moment, we do not know in which way the subcellular localization of Sox8 and Sox9 in differentiating C2C12 cells is regulated. One can speculate that the Sox proteins receive a posttranscriptional modification in the nucleus and are then rapidly exported into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, they are modified in the cytoplasm, which results in a specific inhibition of nuclear import. A similar phenomenon is observed for class II HDACs (reviewed in Ref. 34McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the unphosphorylated form, which occurs in proliferating myoblasts, HDAC5 is mainly localized in the nucleus and interacts with muscle enhancer binding factor 2. This association results in the repression of muscle genes including MyoD. Induction of myogenic differentiation leads to the phosphorylation of two conserved serine residues that flank the nuclear localization signal of HDAC5, resulting in the recruitment of 14-3-3 and dissociation from muscle enhancer binding factor 2. The binding of 14-3-3 masks the nuclear localization signal and activates the nuclear export signal of HDAC5, leading to nuclear export of the repressor protein. Re-entry of HDAC5 into the nucleus probably needs protein phosphatase activity. Co-expression of Sox8 and Sox9 may also exist during muscle development. Given the close relationship between Sox8 and Sox9, we assume that both proteins behave similarly and can substitute for each other to a large extent. At least in tissue culture, such functional redundancy was indeed observed both with regards to myotube formation of C2C12 cells and myogenic conversion of C3H 10T1/2 cells. Compensatory Sox9 function might also explain why so far we failed to see significant abnormalities in skeletal muscles of Sox8-deficient mice (15Sock E. Schmidt K. Hermanns-Borgmeyer I. Bosl M.R. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). More distantly related Sox proteins are also expressed in C2C12 cells such as the subgroup C Sox protein Sox11 detected in this study. However, in contrast to Sox8 and Sox9, there was no down-regulation during myogenic differentiation but rather a mild increase in expression levels, arguing that distantly related Sox proteins might have different and specific functions during muscle development. The possibility of such a divergent function is corroborated by our study for Sox11, which has an opposite effect on myogenin promoter activity as Sox8 and Sox9. A previous study (35Beranger F. Mejean C. Moniot B. Berta P. Vandromme M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16103-16109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) had additionally revealed the existence of several other Sox proteins including Sox4 and Sox15. The reported expression profile for Sox15 strongly resembled that shown here for Sox8 and Sox9. Assuming causality between the inverse correlation of Sox8/Sox9 expression and myogenic differentiation, we analyzed the consequences of ectopic expression in C2C12 cells under conditions that normally promote differentiation. In the continued presence of Sox8 or Sox9, C2C12 cells were strongly impaired in their ability to undergo differentiation as evidenced both by the significant reduction in myotube formation and the reduced expression of MyoD, an early effector of myogenic differentiation. Sox8 and Sox9 might thus be responsible for maintaining myoblasts in an undifferentiated state and prevent untimely or precocious differentiation into myotubes. Such a function is compatible with results from a second cell culture system. It is known that a myogenic program can be turned on in mesodermal 10T1/2 cells upon transfection with the early myogenic effector MyoD as indicated by the appearance of late myogenic effectors such as myogenin. Co-transfection of Sox8 or Sox9 with MyoD prevented the appearance of myogenin, supporting a role of Sox8 and Sox9 in preventing myogenic differentiation. A similar function has also been invoked for Sox15. The relation between the function of Sox8 and Sox9 on the one and Sox15 on the other side in muscle is currently unknown. Future experiments will help to clarify whether Sox15 functions in an identical manner and, thus redundantly to Sox8 and Sox9, cooperates with Sox8 and Sox9 or participates in completely different pathways to achieve comparable outcomes on myogenic differentiation. It is equally unclear how Sox8 and Sox9 interfere with myogenic differentiation. However, our results favor a complex mode of action. Some experiments support a model in which Sox8 and Sox9 interfere with expression of factors required for myogenic differentiation. Neither is MyoD expression up-regulated in C2C12 cells nor is myogenin up-regulated in 10T1/2 cells in the presence of Sox8 or Sox9 despite differentiating conditions. In that respect, it is interesting that Sox8 and Sox9 repressed basal as well as stimulated activity of the myogenin promoter. This repression was observed despite the obvious absence of potential binding sites for subgroup E Sox proteins in the promoter, arguing that Sox8/Sox9 must interact with other transcription factors binding to the myogenin promoter or with components of the general transcription machinery. Given a recent report of an association of Sox9 with the splicing machinery (36Ohe K. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), another option would be that Sox8 and Sox9 exert their function on myogenic differentiation at the posttranscriptional level. Importantly, the effects observed for Sox8 and Sox9 do not appear to be unspecific as the myogenin promoter responded in a completely different manner to the distantly related Sox11, which functioned as a synergistic activator. Sox11 is furthermore not down-regulated during C2C12 cell differentiation, arguing that its influence on the myogenin promoter could be of physiological importance. Some experiments point to the possibility that Sox8 and Sox9 also interfere with the function of important myogenic regulators. Thus, MyoD loses its ability to activate the myogenic program in 10T1/2 cells in the presence of Sox8 or Sox9 and is no longer able to effectively activate the myogenin promoter. It is not clear at present whether this involves direct interaction between MyoD and Sox proteins or whether it involves indirect interaction. Thus, class II histone deacetylases specifically suppress myogenesis not by direct interaction with MyoD, instead they inhibit myogenic activity through association with Mef2 which is essential for MyoD function (37Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that Sox8 expression is associated in muscle with the undifferentiated state both during development and in the adult. Its expression and mode of action in cell culture models of myogenic differentiation support a function of Sox8 in maintaining this undifferentiated state. Thus, Sox8 is not only a useful new marker for satellite cells but might also be important for the maintenance of a proper pool of satellite cells during adulthood, an issue with important implications for cause and therapy of myopathies. Whether its function in satellite cells is fully overlapping with the related Sox9, which can clearly substitute for Sox8 in cell culture systems of muscle differentiation, or whether there are functional differences will be an interesting topic for future detailed analysis in mouse models of degenerative muscle diseases.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; hs6st, heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase; mHS6ST, mouse HS6ST; HS2ST, heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase; GlcNSO3, N-sulfoglucosamine; GlcNSO3(6SO4), N-sulfoglucosamine 6-sulfate; IdoUA-(2SO4), iduronic acid 2-O-sulfate; ΔDi-OS, 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose; ΔDi-6S, 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose; ΔDi-NS, 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose; ΔDi-(N,6)diS, 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic eg acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose; ΔDi-(N,2)diS, 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose; ΔDi-(N,6,2)triS, 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; CDSNS-heparin, completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin; NS-heparosan, deacetylated, and N-sulfated heparosan; CDSNAc-heparin, completely desulfated N-acetylated heparin; EHS, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; hpf, hours post fertilization. are macromolecules with divergent structures and functions. They are located on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix and are composed of a core protein to which highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sugar chains are attached. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a GAG of repeating disaccharide subunits that consists of glucosamine and glucuronic/iduronic acid and is modified in a complex series of steps involving deacetylation, sulfation, and epimerization (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). In each of these modification steps only part of the substrate is modified resulting in a high sequence diversity, which is thought to give HSPGs their functional specificity and versatility. HSs specifically bind to various extracellular molecules including growth factors, adhesion molecules, proteases, and receptors to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation during various developmental processes (2Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In Xenopus ectodermal explants, removal of GAGs from proteoglycans by heparinase results in inhibition of elongation and mesodermal differentiation in response to activin, FGF, and Wnt (3Itoh K. Sokol S.Y. Development. 1994; 120: 2703-2711PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments in cockroach embryos perturbed the directed growth of axon pioneer fibers (4Wang L. Denburg J.L. Neuron. 1992; 8: 701-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, this function is conserved as it has been shown that exogenous addition of heparan sulfate causes misrouting of retinal axons at the tectal border (5Walz A. McFarlane S. Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Holt C.E. Development. 1997; 124: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, this misrouting of axon targeting was attributed to inhibition of sulfation of heparan sulfate (6Irie A. Yates E.A. Turnbull J.E. Holt C.E. Development. 2002; 129: 61-70PubMed Google Scholar). The zebrafish mutant knypek (kny) displays impaired convergent extension movements and the gene responsible for the mutant phenotype encodes a member of the glypican family of HSPGs. Kny is involved in the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway enhancing Wnt11 signaling in overexpression experiments and the kny mutation exacerbates the convergent extension defect of silberblick(slb)/wnt11 mutants (7Topczewski J. Sepich D.S. Myers D.C. Walker C. Amores A. Lele Z. Hammerschmidt M. Postlethwait J. Solnica-Krezel L. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Genetic screens in Drosophila have yielded the sugarless (sgl) and sulfateless (sfl) mutants that are involved in HSPG biosynthesis as they encode UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, respectively (8Hacker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development. 1997; 124: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lin X. Buff E.M. Perrimon N. Michelson A.M. Development. 1999; 126: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their pleiotropic mutant phenotypes suggest that they have diverse functions in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt signaling (8Hacker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development. 1997; 124: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lin X. Buff E.M. Perrimon N. Michelson A.M. Development. 1999; 126: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, examination of the Drosophila tout-velu mutant and the Ext1-deficient mouse, that both lack heparan sulfate co-polymerase, indicate that HSPGs are essential for Hedgehog signaling (10Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 11Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev.

Recently, it has also been demonstrated that the heparan-specific sulfatase, QSulf1, alters the sulfation state of GAGs, which in turn regulate Wnt signaling (13Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson C.P.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). One major challenge in understanding the function of various HSPGs in development is to clarify the specific role the different side-chain modifications play in altering their function. The importance of number and position specificity of sulfate groups on heparan sulfate is demonstrated by the mouse heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase knock-out that exhibits renal, eye, and skeletal defects (14Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and by mice lacking proper N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 function resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia, atelectasis and respiratory distress syndrome (15Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellen L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and characterization of zebrafish heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (hs6st). We demonstrate that Hs6st transfers sulfate specifically to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine. During early development, hs6st is expressed most prominently in the somites, the brain, and the fins. A loss-of-function phenotype obtained by injection of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides results in a significant and specific inhibition of 6-O-sulfation and affects structures that express hs6st. Importantly, morphants display disrupted somitic muscle development due to the combined effect of impaired anterior somite specification and later defects in muscle differentiation, which eventually leads to severe muscle degeneration. Zebrafish and Embryos—Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were kept and bred according to standard protocols (16Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1994Google Scholar). EST Clone, Chemicals, and Morpholinos—The zebrafish EST clone (RZPD CloneID MPMGp609N1048; accession no. fd09d05.y1) was purchased from the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH (RZPD). Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), II and III (EC 4.2.2.7), chondroitin, CDSNS-heparin, 6ODS-heparin, heparan sulfate from pig aorta, heparan sulfate from EHS tumor and an unsaturated heparan sulfate disaccharide kit were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. NS-heparosan was prepared by chemical deacetylation and N-sulfation from N-acetyl heparosan, which was prepared from Escherichia coli K5 by Dr. Terumi Saito, Kanagawa University. [35S]PAPS was prepared as described previously (17Delfert D.M. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Standards of unsaturated disaccharides were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. Morpholinos were designed by and obtained from Gene Tools, LLC. Sequences were as follows: Hs6st-MO (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar), 5′-GATTTCCCATCCATCTTCTCGCTGG-3′, Hs6st-MO (2Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), 5′-GTGAAAGCATTACTCGGTTGTGCGG-3′, inverted Hs6st-MO, 5′-GGTCGCTCTTCTACCTACCCTTTAG-3′. Morpholinos were solubilized in injection buffer (18Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar) at the concentration of 50 mg/ml. The resulting stock solution was diluted to working concentrations as indicated, in injection buffer prior to injection into one to four-cell stage zebrafish embryos. Genetic Mapping Analysis—Radiation hybrid mapping was carried out as described previously (19Geisler R. Rauch G.J. Baier H. van Bebber F. Brobeta L. Dekens M.P. Finger K. Fricke C. Gates M.A. Geiger H. Geiger-Rudolph S. Gilmour D. Glaser S. Gnugge L. Habeck H. Hingst K. Holley S. Keenan J. Kirn A. Knaut H. Lashkari D. Maderspacher F. Martyn U. Neuhauss S. Haffter P. Nat.

Pelegri F. Mullins M.C. Kane D.A. van Eeden F.J. Granato M. Brand M. Furutani-Seiki M. Haffter P. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Kelsh R.N. Odenthal J. Warga R.M. Nusslein-Volhard C. Development. 1996; 123: 95-102PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of pFLAG-CMV2-hs6st—For the construction of the expression vector, the PCR product containing the open reading frame of hs6st was inserted into the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). Tranfection of cDNAs and Transient Expression of Hs6st in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells (5.5 × 105) precultured for 48 h in a 60-mm culture dish were transfected with 5 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-hs6st or pFLAG-CMV2 alone using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (TransFact, Promega). After incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics for 72 h, the cells were washed with PBS(–), scraped, and homogenized in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. The homogenates were subjected to stirring for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. FLAG fusion proteins in the supernatant (cell extract) were isolated by anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the activities of Hs6sts in the supernatants and FLAG-bound fractions were measured as described below. Assay for Sulfotransferase Activities—Sulfotransferase activities were determined as described previously (23Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 25 nmol (as hexosamine; 500 μm) of acceptor glycosaminoglycans, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5 × 105 cpm, 1 μm), and enzyme. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. Carrier chondroitin sulfate A (0.1 μmol as glucuronic acid) was added to the reaction mixture and the 35S-labeled polysaccharides were isolated by precipitation with ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and 0.5 mm EDTA, followed by gel chromatography on a Fast Desalting column to remove [35S]PAPS and its degradation products. The amounts of enzymes added to the reaction mixture were chosen so as to obtain a linear incorporation of [35S]sulfate. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount required to transfer 1 pmol of sulfate/min to CDSNS-heparin. Analysis of the reaction products for the specificity and sulfation position was performed by HPLC as described previously (23Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 35S-labeled products were digested with a mixture of 10 milliunits of heparitinase I, 5 milliunits of heparitinase II, and 10 milliunits of heparitinase III in 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 4 μg of bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 2 h. The digests were subjected to gel chromatography on Superdex 30 pg equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The 35S-labeled disaccharide fractions were injected into a PAMN column together with standard unsaturated disaccharides of the kit. Fractions of 0.6 ml were collected and radioactivity was measured. Chromatographic Analysis of Isolated Glycosaminoglycans of Zebrafish Embryos—Embryos at the one-cell stage were injected with 1.0 ng of Hs6st-MO (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) and 1.5 ng Hs6st-MO (2Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) simultaneously. Embryos were collected at the 48 hpf stage and freeze-dried. The dried samples were treated with 0.2 m NaOH for 16 h at room temperature. Subsequently, samples were neutralized with 4 m HAc, DNase, and RNase were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Then proteinase K was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.2) and loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. The columns were washed with 10 column volumes of Tris-HCl buffer and then eluted with 4 column volumes of 2 m NaCl in Tris-HCl buffer. The eluates were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of cold 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and the glycosaminoglycans were recovered by centrifugation. The GAGs were digested with a mixture of 10 milliunits of heparitinase I, 5 milliunits of heparitinase II, and 10 milliunits of heparitinase III in 40 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, 1 mm CaCl2 and 4 μl of bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 2 h. After filtration of the digests with Ultrafree-MC, unsaturated disaccharides in the filtrates were analyzed by a reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography using Senshu Pak column Docosil and determined with a fluorescence detector. Bodipy-ceramide Staining—Bodipy-ceramide labeling was performed as described (21Lele Z. Folchert A. Concha M. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Rosa F. Wilson S.W. Hammerschmidt M. Bally-Cuif L. Development. 2002; 129: 3281-3294PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of Zebrafish hs6st—To isolate genes that may participate in neural plate regionalization, a subtractive hybridization experiment was performed. 2R. J. Bink, J. Joore, S. van de Water, and D. Zivkovic, manuscript in preparation. One of the resulting cDNA clones, R1, was sequenced and appeared to be a partial hs6st cDNA clone. We obtained the full-length clone by searching the zebrafish EST data base. One clone (MPMGp609N1048) was 100% identical to the cDNA fragment so we sequenced it to completion. The largest open reading frame encoded a protein of 469 amino acids (Fig. 1A), which was homologous to HS6STs from various organisms (Table I). Highest homology was found to the human and murine HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2 proteins. However, by amino acid comparison (Table I) and phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig. 1B) we could not assign zebrafish Hs6st to one of the two homologues. By calculating a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot of the Hs6st protein sequence, a hydrophobic segment was found in the amino-terminal part (data not shown) that is characteristic for heparan sulfotransferases (23Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic segment suggests that Hs6st is a type II transmembrane protein located in the Golgi apparatus where HSPGs are synthesized initially (24Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar).Table IAmino acid sequence comparison of zebrafish Hs6st with HS6ST homologues of other species (23Habuchi H. Tanaka M.

Determination of Heparan Sulfate 6-O-Sulfotransferase Activity—The hs6st cDNA was transfected into cultured cells, and the expressed protein was examined for the HS6ST activity. The HS6ST activity, defined as the amount required to transfer 1 pmol of sulfate/minute to CDSNS-heparin, in cells transfected with hs6st was more than 3-fold higher as compared with the control vector (Table II). The HS2ST activity was not changed upon transfection of hs6st. These results demonstrate that recombinant Hs6st transfers sulfate to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine residues in CDSNS-heparin.Table IIOverexpression of zebrafish heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase in COS-7 cellsPlasmidsHS2ST activityHS6ST activitypmol/min/mg proteinpmol/min/mg proteinFLAG-CMV2-hs6st1.6 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.1FLAG-CMV2 (control)1.5 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab To compare the sulfotransferase activity of zebrafish Hs6st to that of other organisms, we investigated its sulfotransferase activity for various heparin derivatives, heparan sulfates from different sources, and other GAGs (Table III) including: CDSNS-heparin, CDSNAc-heparin, NS-heparosan, heparan sulfate from mouse EHS tumor and pig aorta, 6ODS-heparin, and chondroitin. Hs6st was able to transfer sulfate to CDSNS-heparin, NS-heparosan, and heparan sulfate but not to CDSNAc-heparin, 6ODS-heparin, and chondroitin. Furthermore, the ratio of the activity between NS-heparosan and CDSNS-heparin was less than 0.1 at all the concentrations tested (Table III, Fig. 2A). This indicates that Hs6st preferred iduronosyl N-sulfoglucosamine since NS-heparosan contains only glucuronic acid and not its epimer iduronic acid. These data are very similar to the sulfotransferase activity values found for mHS6ST-1 and not to values for mHS6ST-2 (23Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Table IIIAcceptor substrate specificities of the recombinant zebrafish heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase purified by anti-FLAG antibody affinity column chromatographySubstrateRelative sulfotransferase activity of Hs6st%CDSNS-heparin100CDSNAc-heparin2.6NS-heparosan9.1Heparan sulfate (mouse EHS tumor)27.4Heparan sulfate (pig aorta)10.96ODS-heparin2.1Chondroitin0 Open table in a new tab To further determine the specificity of Hs6st function, the structure of the 35S-labeled products was analyzed after incubation of purified Hs6st, 35S-labeled PAPS and CDSNS-heparin or heparan sulfate of pig aorta (Fig. 2, B and C). Most of the radioactivity in the disaccharide fractions derived from both acceptor substrates was recovered at the position of ΔDi-(N,6)diS, and a low level of radioactivity eluted in an unknown peak between ΔDi-6S and ΔDi-NS. Furthermore, 35S-labeled ΔDi-(N,6,2)triS was also produced using heparan sulfate as acceptor. These results show that Hs6st transfers sulfate groups to position 6 of GlcNSO3 residues and to position 6 of GlcNSO3(6SO4) residues. Expression Pattern of hs6st during Zebrafish Embryonic Development—Northern blot analysis revealed that hs6st was not maternally expressed (data not shown). The spatio-temporal pattern of zygotic hs6st expression was analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization. At the onset of gastrulation, hs6st is ubiquitiously expressed in the entire blastoderm (Fig. 3A). During early somitogenesis the staining seems to concentrate to the anterior CNS (Fig. 3B). Consistently, at 24 hpf the brain and the eyes of the embryo show intense staining. Importantly, expression was also restricted to the somitic boundaries as well as to the ventral part of the tail (Fig. 3, C–E). The rostral expression persisted until at least the 48 hpf stage when the fin buds contained high levels of the hs6st transcripts as well (Fig. 3F). Morpholino-mediated Knockdown of Hs6st Results in Specific 6-O-Sulfation Inhibition—To assess the developmental function of Hs6st, we have selectively blocked the translation of the hs6st mRNA using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, which have been proven to be effective and specific translational inhibitors in zebrafish (18Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar) and were shown to phenocopy a wide variety of earlier described mutations (25Lele Z. Bakkers J. Hammerschmidt M. Genesis. 2000; 30: 190-194Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For knockdown experiments we used two morpholinos of non-overlapping sequence as this method yielded a higher frequency of knockdown phenotypes whereas possible nonspecific undesired mistargeting effects were reduced (Ref. 26Ekker S.C. Larson J.D. Genesis. 2001; 30: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, data not shown). This technique allowed us to specifically inhibit 6-O-sulfation, which is a great advantage when compared with the more general inhibition of proteoglycan/protein sulfation by for example chlorate (27Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 28Humphries D.E. Silbert J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

As controls, inverted morpholinos were used (see “Experimental Procedures”) that resulted in wild-type embryos upon injection. Specificity of the injected morpholinos was assessed by determining the sulfation profile of disaccharide components of wild-type versus morpholino-injected embryos that showed the morphant phenotype. In 48 hpf embryos, highest decrease of sulfation (40.3%) in morphants was found for 6-O-sulfation of N-sulfoglucosamine residues (production of ΔDi(N, 6)diS (Table IV)). As compared with the disaccharide components of wild-type embryos, N-sulfation increased, and 2-O-sulfation decreased slightly (Table IV). Analysis of heparan sulfate compositions was performed in duplicate with a similar outcome. From these results, we conclude that Hs6st morpholino injection inhibits 6-O-sulfation specifically albeit not completely.Table IVDisaccharide composition analysis in wild-type and Hs6st morphantsWild typeMorpholino injectedRelative in/decrease%Di-OS53.057.3+8.1Di-NS15.417.2+11.7Di-6S5.54.4-20.0Di-(N,6)diS6.23.7-40.3Di-(N,U)diS9.78.7-10.3Di-(N,6,U)triS10.28.8-13.7 Open table in a new tab Phenotypic Characteristics of Hs6st Morphants—The morpholino-mediated knockdown of Hs6st activity resulted in dramatic phenotypic abnormalities that were already visible during somitogenesis (Fig. 4). Control experiments in which embryos were injected with inverted Hs6st-morpholinos did not alter the wild-type phenotype throughout development indicating the specificity of the morpholinos (Fig. 4, A and B). Embryos injected with Hs6st morpholinos demonstrated convergent-extension defects, reminiscent of knypek (kny)/glypican zebrafish mutants (7Topczewski J. Sepich D.S. Myers D.C. Walker C. Amores A.

Often the tail was curled and to a certain extent, morphants displayed transient and variable brain apoptosis between 24 and 48 hpf (Fig. 4C). As a consequence, the size of the head in morphants was reduced later in development (Fig. 4, D and E). In contrast, the brain ventricles had an inflated and oedemic appearance possibly due to the overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid. Transverse sections of the brain of 48 hpf embryos show that both the size of the white matter composed of the nerve tracts and the gray matter composed of somata, were significantly reduced in Hs6st morphants although the gray matter was relatively less affected (Fig. 4, F and G). Strikingly, we also regularly observed a reduction in the size of the pectoral fins at 96 hpf (Fig. 4, D and E), a structure that showed expression of hs6st (Fig. 3F).Fig. 6Hs6st morphants display normal somite oscillator function but have impaired anterior somite specification as shown by qualitative analysis of expression of marker genes.

The precise mechanism, however, remains unclear. This study investigated the relation between the polyol pathway, PKC-β, ROS, JAK2, and Ang II in the development of diabetic macroangiopathy. VSMC cultured in high glucose (HG; 25 mm) showed significant increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, production of ROS, and proliferation activities when compared with VSMC cultured in normal glucose (5.5 mm (NG)). Both the aldose reductase specific inhibitor (zopolrestat) or transfection with aldose reductase antisense oligonucleotide blocked the phosphorylation of JAK2, the production of ROS, and proliferation of VSMC induced by HG, but it had no effect on the Ang II-induced activation of these parameters in both NG and HG. However, transfection with PKC-β antisense oligonucleotide, preincubation with a PKC-β-specific inhibitor (LY379196) or apocynin (NADPH oxidase-specific inhibitor), or electroporation of NADPH oxidase antibodies blocked the Ang II-induced JAK2 phosphorylation, production of ROS, and proliferation of VSMC in both NG and HG. These observations suggest that the polyol pathway hyperactivity induced by HG contributes to the development of diabetic macroangiopathy through a PKC-β-ROS activation of JAK2.

These observations suggest that the polyol pathway hyperactivity induced by HG contributes to the development of diabetic macroangiopathy through a PKC-β-ROS activation of JAK2.

Current studies suggest that HG, via the polyol pathway, induces a rapid increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2, which stimulates intracellular signal events similar to those activated by Ang II including stimulation of growth-promoting kinases such as JAK2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (3Berk B.C.

Rai U. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1640-C1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, in VSMC H2O2 has been shown to play an important role in regulating cell growth (5Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). It has also recently been reported that Ang II induces a rapid increase in intracellular H2O2 via NADPH oxidase, which subsequently activates growth-related responses plus the activation of JAK2 (5Ushio-Fukai M.

Similar results have also been found for PDGF-induced cell proliferation, which was shown to be dependent on H2O2 (8Simon A.R. Rai U. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1640-C1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDGF uses H2O2 as a second messenger to regulate the activation of JAK2 in rat fibroblasts (8Simon A.R. Rai U. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1640-C1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HG-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has also been recently shown to increase the production of ROS and to enhance VSMC proliferation. In addition, the synthesis and characterization of a specific inhibitor for PKC-β isoforms has confirmed the role of PKC activation in mediating HG effects on VSMC, and it provides in vivo evidence that the activation of the PKC-β isoform could be responsible for the abnormal ROS production and vascular growth in diabetic animals (10Ishii H. Koya D. King G.L. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 76: 21-31Google Scholar). For example, a recent study has concluded that VSMC can produce ROS through NADPH oxidase via activation of PKC. The study found that exposure of cultured VSMC to HG significantly increased ROS production and that treatment of the cells with phorbol myristic acid, a PKC activator, also increased ROS production. Furthermore, it was also found that the HG-induced ROS production was completely inhibited by GF109203X, a PKC-specific inhibitor. These results suggest that HG stimulates ROS production through PKC-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase in VSMC (11Inoguchi T. Li P. Umeda F. Yu H.Y. Kakimoto M. Imamura M. Aoki T. Etoh T. Hashimoto T. Naruse M. Sano H. Utsumi H. Nawata H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). In addition, a very recent study has also shown that the PKC-β2 isoform was essential for the activation of NADPH oxidase (12Korchack H.M. Kilpatrick L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8910-8917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study we have inhibited by either pharmacological or molecular methods the polyol pathway or PKC-β to examine their effects on the Ang II, HG, and Ang II plus HG-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, ROS production, and VSMC proliferation. We hypothesize that HG augments the Ang II-induced activation of JAK2 and growth responses in VSMC through ROS generated via the polyol pathway activation of PKC-β.

After 12 h, medium was removed, calf serum (0.1%) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in NG (normal glucose) was added, and the cells were allowed to recover for 30 min. The VSMC were washed once with serum-free DMEM and growth-arrested in serum-free DMEM in NG for 24 h. Afterward, the VSMC were placed in either NG or HG media for 24 more hours. Western Blotting of JAK2—To ascertain the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, growth-arrested VSMC were placed in either NG or HG for 24 h and stimulated with 0.1 μm Ang II or 0.33 mm PDGF for various times ranging from 0 to 10 min. At the end of stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4. Each dish was then treated for 60 min with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mmol/liter Na4P2O7, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The supernatant fraction was obtained as cell lysate by centrifugation at 58,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the lysate was measured with the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible assay kit and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Subsequently, samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked by a 60-min incubation at room temperature (22 °C) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, plus 5% skimmed milk powder. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified anti-phospho-specific JAK2 antibodies or non-phospho anti-JAK2 antibodies. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membranes were washed twice for 10 min each with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, and incubated for various times with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. After extensive washing, bound antibody was visualized on Kodak Biomax film with a Pierce Supersignal substrate chemiluminescence detection kit. Molecular weight markers assessed specificity of the bands. Immunoprecipitation Studies of SHP-1 and SHP-2—To determine the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, serum-starved VSMC grown in HG for 24 h were stimulated with 0.1 μm Ang II for various times ranging from 0 to 10 min. At the end of stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4. Each dish was then treated for 60 min with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mmol/liter Na4P2O7, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the supernatant fraction was obtained as cell lysate by centrifugation at 58,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was incubated with 10 μg/ml either anti-SHP-1 or anti-SHP-2 monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h and precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were then recovered by centrifugation and washed 3 times with ice-cold wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4). Immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and 80 μl of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked by 60-min incubation at 22 °C in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, plus 5% skimmed milk powder. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of affinity-purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized using a Pierce Supersignal chemiluminescence detection kit. PKC Assay—PKC activation was determine by the method of Tardif et al. (19Tardif M. Savard M. Flamand L. Gosselin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24148-24154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved VSMC grown in either NG or HG for 24 h were treated with Ang II (0.1 μm) for 1 min. Cells were washed, resuspended in buffer, and sonicated, and homogenates were ultracentrifuged to isolate the plasma membrane fractions. Equal amounts of plasma membrane protein levels in each sample were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the plasma membrane distribution of PKC-β1 and PKC-β2 was visualized by Western blot using specific monoclonal antibodies against each isoform of PKC-β. Electroporation Procedure—Cells were plated in 100-mm cell plates and growth-arrested in serum-deprived DMEM for 24 h before experiments. As previously described (2Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C2019-C2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), VSMC were electroporated using a Multi-Coaxial electrode (Model P/N 747, BTX Inc., San Diego, CA) that performed in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing anti-p47phox antibodies at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After electroporation, cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, washed once with serum-free DMEM, and left in serum-free DMEM before the experiments. Assay of Intracellular ROS—Intracellular ROS production was measured by the method of Ushio-Fukai et al. (5Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, dishes of confluent cells after stimulation with Ang II were washed with modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and incubated in the dark for 5 min in Krebs-Ringer solution containing 5 mm DCFH diacetate. DCFH diacetate is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the non-fluorescent polar derivative DCFH and thereby trapped within the cells (5Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In the presence of a proper oxidant, DCFH is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. Culture dishes were transferred to a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a ×20 Neofluor objective and Zeiss LSM 410 confocal attachment, and ROS generation was detected as a result of the oxidation of DCFH (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 515–540 nm). The effect of DCFH photo-oxidation was minimized by collecting the fluorescent image with a single rapid scan (line average, 4; total scan time, 4.33 s) and identical parameters, such as contrast and brightness, for all samples. The cells were then imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy. Five groups of 20–30 cells each were randomly selected from the image in the digital interference contrast channel for each sample, the fluorescence intensity was then measured for each group from the fluorescence image, and the relative fluorescence intensity was taken as the average of the five values. Therefore, the relative fluorescence intensity (given in arbitrary units) reflects measurements performed on a minimum of 100 cells for each sample. All experiments were repeated at least six times. Cell Proliferation Assay—VSMC proliferation was measured using the Cell Titer 96™ AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) (21Buttke T.M. McCubrey J.A. Owen T.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 157: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the cellular conversion of the colorimetric reagent 3,4-(5-demethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) into soluble formazan by dehydrogenase enzymes found only in metabolically active, proliferating cells. MTS in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.0, was mixed with the electron-coupling reagent phenazine methyl sulfate. The absorbance of formazan, measured at 490 nm using a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader interfaced with a personal computer is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. To confirm the accuracy of our MTS proliferation assay, the actual increase in cell number was also directly assessed with a Coulter counter (Model ZM, Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). The cells were grown in a 75-mm2 flask to confluence and detached with trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mol/liter EDTA). 20,000 cells were plated into 96-well plates and allowed to settle for 4 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Before the experiments, cells were growth-arrested in serum-deprived DMEM for 24 h and then stimulated with the various ligands. After timed ligand exposure, the phenazine methyl sulfate/MTS mix was added to each well (final volume of 20 μl/100 μl of medium) and then incubated for an additional 60 min. A 10% SDS solution was then added to stop the reaction, and the absorbance of formazan was measured at 490 nm. Apoptosis Assessment—To assess apoptosis VSMC are exposed to either NG or HG for 48 h with or without Ang II or to NG for 48 h followed by 15 min of ultraviolet light. VSMC are then washed with 3× phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, fixed with 100% methanol for 5–7 min, stained with a modified Wright-Giemsa stain, and analyzed by light microscopy for increased nuclear particulate staining (representing apoptosis). Average nuclear pixel intensity was measured using NIH Image analysis software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Data Analysis—All statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test for paired data and analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effects of the Aldose Reductase Inhibitor, Zopolrestat, on Both the Basal and Ang II-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of JAK2 in VSMC Preincubated in HG—Preincubation of VSMC with zopolrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor (22Kapor-Drezgic J. Zhou X. Babazono T. Dlugosz J.A. Hohman T. Whiteside C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1193-1203PubMed Google Scholar, 23Beyer-Mears A. Mistry K. Diecke F.P. Cruz E. Pharmacology. 1996; 52: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was found to inhibit the HG stimulation of the Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1). However, zopolrestat had no effect on the Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the Ang II-induced JAK2 activation is not dependent on the polyol pathway, but rather, that Ang II and the polyol pathway induce JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation separately, perhaps via a common system. PKC-β2 and the Effects of HG and Ang II on Both the H 2 O 2 Production and JAK2 Activation in VSMC—The PKC-β2 isozyme has been shown to play an important part in the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells, a characteristic feature of diabetic macroangiopathy (24Nakamura J. Kasuya Y. Hamada Y. Nakashima E. Naruse K. Yasuda Y. Kato K. Hotta N. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, in these studies we investigated the effects of a PKC-β-specific inhibitor LY379196 (10Ishii H. Koya D. King G.L. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 76: 21-31Google Scholar) on the Ang II- and HG-induced and HG augmentation of the Ang II-induced H2O2 production and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. We found that incubation with 0.2 μg/ml LY379196 completely suppressed the increase in both the HG- and Ang II-induced H2O2 production (Fig. 2) and JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that both the HG or Ang II induce production of H2O2, and JAK2 activation occurs through either PKC-β1 or PKC-β2. Therefore, we next tried to determine the effects of HG and Ang II on the activation of the PKC-β1 and PKC-β2 isoforms in VSMC. The PKC isoforms were characterized by using monospecific polyclonal antibodies against PKC-β1 or PKC-β2 isoforms. Expression of PKC-β2 isoform protein in the plasma membrane fraction of VSMC was significantly (#, p < 0.01) increased by Ang II in NG and HG (*, p < 0.01) alone when compared with those VSMC cultured in NG (Fig. 4). Zopolrestat blocked the HG-induced activation of PKC-2, but it had no effect on the Ang II activation in both NG and HG (Fig. 4). No significant differences in expression of the PKC-β1 isoform were detected between the HG- and NG- and Ang II-treated VSMC plasma membrane fractions (data not shown). These studies provide evidence that both HG and Ang II induced the production of H2O2 or JAK2 activation via activation of the PKC-β2 isoform.Fig. 3Effects of the PKC-β inhibitor LY379196 on Ang II- and high glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. Quiescent VSMC were incubated with or without 0.2 μg/ml of LY379196 in serum-free medium containing either NG (5.5 mm) or HG (25 mm) and treated with Ang II (0.1 μm) for 5 and 10 min. Cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoblotted with either phosphotyrosine-specific or nonphospho-specific anti-JAK2 antibodies. Representative immunoblots (of three experiments) probed with either the JAK2 phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (pJAK2) or JAK2 antibody (JAK2) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Effects of zopolrestat on the high glucose-induced activation of PKC-β1 and PKC-β2. PKC isoforms were characterized by using monospecific antibodies against PKC-β1 or PKC-β2 isoforms. The expression of PKC-β2 isoform protein in the plasma membrane fraction of VSMC cultured in HG or exposed to Ang II were significant (p < 0.01) when compared with those VSMC cultured in NG. Zopolrestat blocked the HG-induced activation of PKC-β2, but it had no effect on the Ang II activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antisense Studies—Our studies with the aldose reductase inhibitor (zopolrestat) and the PKC-β isoform inhibitor (LY379196) suggest that HG augments the Ang II-induced production of H2O2 and activation of JAK2 via the polyol pathway. However, most inhibitors are usually not very specific, and acknowledging that not all antibodies block or neutralize biologic activities, we consider the antisense approach to further confirm the roles of both aldose reductase and PKC-β in the HG augmentation of the Ang II-induced production of H2O2 and activation of JAK2. We have experience and success in designing and using antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit gene expression in VSMC cultures (e.g. blocking the expression of MKP-1, JAK2, and the Src kinases Src and Fyn in studying the regulation of STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation in VSMC (17Venema R.C.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3049-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the synthesis of these two proteins. VSMC were treated for various times with either the antisense or the sense oligonucleotide to aldose reductase and PKC-β, and the levels of expression of these two proteins were demonstrated by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, both aldose reductase and the PKC-β antisense completely suppressed their expression after 12 h of treatment. In contrast, the sense oligonucleotides had no effect. Experiments were then carried out in VSMC, which were treated with either the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for 12 h before stimulation of the cells with HG alone or Ang II in either NG or HG. We found that preincubating the VSMC with the aldose reductase antisense oligonucleotide (but not the JAK2 sense oligonucleotide) significantly inhibited the HG stimulation of the Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6). However, just like with zopolrestat, the aldose reductase antisense oligonucleotide had no effect on the Ang II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6). These results further support our previous findings, which showed that the Ang II-induced JAK2 activation is not dependent on the polyol pathway but, rather, that Ang II and the polyol pathway induce JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation separately perhaps via a common system.Fig. 6Effects of aldose reductase antisense on the high glucose augmentation on the angiotensin II-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Quiescent VSMC were transfected with either aldose reductase (AR) sense or antisense without for 12 h in serum-free medium in NG. Afterward the VSMC were further incubated for an additional 24 h in serum-free medium containing either NG (5.5 mm) or HG (25 mm) and treated with Ang II (0.1 μm) for 5 and 10 min. Cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoblotted with either phosphotyrosine-specific or nonphospho-specific anti-JAK2 antibodies.

Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) generates reactive oxygen species and promotes lipid peroxidation. In this study induction of HO-1 by CYP2E1 and the possible role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in this process were evaluated. HO-1 induction was observed in the livers of chronic alcohol-fed mice or pyrazole-treated rats, conditions known to elevate CYP2E1 levels. Increased levels of HO-1 were observed in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1 (E47 cells) compared with control HepG2 cells or HepG2 cells expressing CYP3A4. Expression of CYP2E1 in HepG2 cells transcriptionally activated the HO-1 gene, increasing HO-1 mRNA and protein expression and activity of a HO-1 reporter construct. CYP2E1 inhibitors and catalase blocked the increased production of reactive oxygen species as well as HO-1 induction. Increasing oxidative stress by the addition of arachidonic acid or depletion of glutathione further increased HO-1 induction. The phosphorylated form of ERK MAPK but not that of p38 or JNK MAPK was increased in E47 cells compared with the control C34 HepG2 cells. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK MAPK, blocked the activity of a HO-1 reporter in E47 cells but not in C34 cells. These results suggest that increased CYP2E1 activity leads to induction of the HO-1 gene, and the ERK MAPK pathway is important in mediating this process.

Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Three HO isoforms have been identified; they are inducible HO-1, also known as heat shock protein 32, constitutively expressed HO-2, and a related but less well characterized HO-3 (2Akagi R. Takahashi T. Sassa S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 88: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under physiologic conditions, HO-2 is the major HO isoform found in mammalian tissues, particularly in brain and testis (3Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). In contrast, HO-1 expression is relatively low, with the exception of the spleen, in which HO-1 levels are constitutively high. Up-regulation of HO-1 may be among the most critical cytoprotective mechanisms that are activated during cellular stress, such as inflammation, ischemia, hypoxia, hyperoxia, hyperthermia, or radiation (1Choi A. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), and thus, is thought to play a key role in maintaining antioxidant and oxidant homeostasis when cellular injury occurs (2Akagi R.

HO-1 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, although there are interspecies variations in the regulation of HO-1 (5Rizzardini M. Terao M. Falciani F. Cantoni L. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Agarwal A. Shiraishi F. Visner G.A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fogg S.

Res. 1997; 80: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are components of signaling cascades that respond to extracellular stimuli by targeting transcription factors, resulting in the modulation of gene expression. Three major MAP kinase subfamilies have been described; they are extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38. ERK was the first cascade to be elucidated; it is activated by mitogens and is primarily involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. The remaining two cascades respond to cellular stress signals and are, hence, sometimes referred to as stress-activated protein kinases. There is a good deal of overlap among the cascades both in their targets and upstream activators. The signal transduction pathways that regulate HO-1 gene activation under the multiplicity of inducing conditions remain only partially understood. ERK and/or p38 MAPK have been reported to participate in the activation of the HO-1 gene by inducing xenobiotics (9Ryter S.W. Otterbein L.E. Morse D. Choi A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234/235: 249-263Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 10Morse D. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), the ethanol-inducible form, metabolizes and activates many toxicologically important substrates including ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, and N-nitrosodimethylamine to more toxic products (11Guengerich F.P. Kim D.H. Iwasaki M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 12Koop D.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 13Yang C.S. Yoo J.S. Ishizaki H. Hong J.Y. Drug Metab. Rev. 1990; 22: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Induction of CYP2E1 by ethanol is one of the central pathways by which ethanol generates a state of oxidative stress in hepatocytes. To study the biochemical and toxicological effects of CYP2E1 induction, our laboratory established a HepG2 cell line that constitutively overexpresses CYP2E1 (E47 cells) or a control HepG2 cell line transfected with the empty vector (C34 cells) (14Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). CYP2E1-dependent toxicity in the presence of ethanol, arachidonic acid (AA), and AA plus iron has been characterized in these cell lines; these agents did not produce significant toxicity in C34 cells, whereas their addition to E47 cells decreased cell viability and caused either necrosis or apoptosis (14Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Toxicity by these agents was enhanced when cellular glutathione (GSH) levels were lowered by treatment with l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). Moreover, treatment of E47 cells with only BSO, an irreversible inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase, resulted in apoptosis and necrosis (18Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas no toxicity was found in C34 cells or HepG2 cells that expressed CYP3A4 instead of CYP2E1. Antioxidants such as GSH-ethyl ester and N-acetylcysteine partially prevented the apoptosis and necrosis after BSO treatment, whereas diallyl sulfide, a CYP2E1 inhibitor, was fully protective. In response to the increased oxidative stress caused by induction of CYP2E1 activity in hepatocytes, antioxidant enzymes such as glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase were found to be up-regulated (19Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15563-15571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we present data showing that HO-1 is transcriptionally activated in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1 and that the ERK MAPK pathway plays an important role in mediating this activation. Animal Models—Male CD-1 mice (30 ∼ 40 g) and male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 ∼ 170 g) were housed in a facility approved by The American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Mice were fed with commercially available ethanol (35%) and control diets (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ), which were equicaloric and had the same composition with respect to fat (42% of calories) and protein (16% of calories) for 59 days. To induce liver CYP2E1, rats were injected intraperitoneally with pyrazole, 200 mg/kg body weight, once per day for 2 days followed by overnight fast (21Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 1468-1473PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection Experiments—This study was performed using HepG2 cells, which constitutively express CYP2E1 (E47 cells) or control HepG2 cells (C34 cells), which have undetectable P450 activity (14Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml of G418 supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and 2 mm l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The expression of CYP2E1 was routinely monitored by assaying for the rate of oxidation of p-nitrophenol as described below. For each experiment, cells were plated and incubated in minimal essential medium overnight, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the different treatments were added. Plasmid pHHO-1 containing human HO-1 cDNA and pHHOSV15luc containing a 15-kilobase upstream promoter region of human HO-1 gene linked to a luciferase reporter gene were generous gifts from Dr. S. Shibahara (Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan). The CYP2E1 containing plasmid (pCI-2E1) and the empty vector pCI-neo have been previously described (22Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pRL-null plasmid was from Promega (Madison, WI). Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as the DNA carrier. General Methodology—CYP2E1 activity in microsomes (23Reinke L.A. Moyer M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1985; 13: 548-552PubMed Google Scholar) was measured by studying the oxidation of p-nitrophenol to p-nitrocatechol as described previously. HO activity was determined by detecting bilirubin production from heme oxidation by isolated microsomes (24Chen J.X. Zeng H. Chen X. Su C.Y. Lai C.C. Pharmacol. Res. 2001; 43: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ROS was determined by flow cytometry with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (25Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Western Blotting—HO-1, HO-2, and CYP2E1 protein expression were detected by Western blotting as described previously (26Gong P. Stewart D. Hu B. Li N. Cook J. Nel A. Alam J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Each sample containing 30 μg of total protein was loaded on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Protein concentration was determined using the Protein DC-20 assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein immunoblot analysis was carried out using the following: anti-human HO-1 (1:5000) and anti-rat HO-1 (1:5000) monoclonal antibody, anti-human HO-2 polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (StressGen Biotech, Victoria, BC, Canada); anti-human CYP2E1 polyclonal antibody (1:30,000) (kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Lasker, Hackensack Biomedical Research Institute, NJ); ERK, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase rat polyclonal antibody (1:1000) or phosphorylated ERK, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mouse monoclonal antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as primary antibody; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:4000) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) (Sigma) as secondary antibody. Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence immunoblot-detecting reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 5 μg of RNA were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions in 0.9% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred onto nylon membranes, and hybridized to random-primed 32P-labeled HO-1 or ribosomal S3 cDNA probes as described previously (27Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Ellerbe M. Figueroa Y.G. Blank V. Beckman B.S. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27018-27025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HO-1 cDNA was produced by digesting the plasmid pHHO1 with XhoI and XbaI. Statistics—Data are presented as average ± S.E. (n = 3). Student's t test for unpaired data was used to evaluate the differences between the compared groups. HO-1 Protein Expression Is Induced in Liver of Mice Chronically Fed Ethanol—Although CYP2E1 is induced by ethanol, little is known about changes of HO-1 expression if any in the liver of animals treated with ethanol. In this study, male CD-1 mice (30 ∼ 40 g) were fed with a control diet or a diet containing 35% ethanol for 59 days. CYP2E1 and HO-1 protein expression in liver was detected by Western blotting. CYP2E1 protein was significantly increased in mice fed ethanol compared with control mice (4-fold, p < 0.001). Although HO-1 protein could not be detected in the liver of control mice, it was detectable in mice fed ethanol (Fig. 1A). Induction of CYP2E1 in Vivo by Pyrazole Increases HO-1 Protein Expression in Rat Liver—Pyrazole induces CYP2E1 by stabilizing the protein against degradation. Increased CYP2E1 activity results in increased oxidative stress (16Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 28Cederbaum A.I. Wu D. Mari M. Bai J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether there were any changes in HO-1 levels by the increased CYP2E1 activity in hepatocytes, rats were treated with 0.9% NaCl (control) or pyrazole (200 mg/kg of body weight/day for 2 days followed by an overnight fast). After sacrificing the rats, the livers were removed, and CYP2E1 and HO-1 content were determined by Western blotting. CYP2E1 protein was increased about 5.6-fold, whereas HO-1 protein was induced about 3.2-fold in the liver of pyrazole-treated rats compared with the saline-treated rats (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of CYP2E1 in HepG2 Cells Induces HO-1 Protein and HO Activity—To determine whether there is any link between the induction of CYP2E1 and HO-1 levels, HepG2 cells stably transfected with CYP2E1 (E47 cells) or with the empty vector (C34 cells) were used. HepG2 cells transfected with CYP3A4 (3A4 cells), another isoform of the cytochrome P450 family, were also studied as a parallel control. HO-2, the constitutive isoform of HO, was unchanged by expression of either CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 (Fig. 2A). HO-1 protein and HO activity were low in the control C34 and 3A4 cells (Fig. 2, A and B), which have undetectable CYP2E1 protein levels (Fig. 2A) and very low basal CYP2E1 activity (Fig. 2C). However, HO-1 protein and HO activity were increased (about 2.2- and 2.1-fold, respectively) in E47 cells (Fig. 2, A and B), which have high levels of CYP2E1 protein (Fig. 2A) and high CYP2E1 activity (Fig. 2C), suggesting a potential association between increased CYP2E1 expression and induction of HO-1 protein and activity in HepG2 cells. HO-1 Gene Is Transcriptionally Activated by CYP2E1-Overexpression—Because HO-1 protein was increased in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1, we examined whether such an increase was also present at the mRNA level. HO-1 mRNA was increased about 2-fold in E47 cells but not in 3A4 cells when compared with the control C34 cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting the possibility that CYP2E1 overexpression affects HO-1 gene expression at the transcription level. Increased mRNA levels may be because of an increase in transcription or to an increase in stability. To study whether this increase of HO-1 mRNA involves changes in mRNA stability, actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), a general inhibitor of mRNA transcription, was used to block HO-1 gene transcription, and the decline in the remaining HO-1 mRNA levels was followed as a function of time after the addition of actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 3, B–C, the degradation rate of HO-1 mRNA in E47 cells was similar to that in C34 cells (p > 0.05 at all time points, half-life about 8 h), suggesting that increased HO-1 mRNA expression in E47 cells is not due to increased stability of the HO-1 mRNA. Transient transfection studies were carried out with a HO-1 promoter construct (pHHO15SVluc) that contained the 15-kilobase upstream region of the human HO-1 gene (29Shibahara S. Sato M. Muller R.M. Yoshida T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity in E47 cells transfected with pHHO15SVluc was 1.8-fold higher (p < 0.05) than that in control C34 cells transfected with the same construct (Fig. 4A), an increase similar to the HO-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). To rule out changes in clonal selection as an explanation for the increase in HO-1, the C34 cells were transfected with CYP2E1. Luciferase activity of C34 cells co-transfected with CYP2E1 (pCI-2E1) and pHHO15SVluc was 3.4-fold higher than that of C34 cells co-transfected with the empty vector pCI-neo and pHHO15SVluc (Fig. 4B), validating that CYP2E1 expression enhances HO-1 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that the HO-1 gene is transcriptionally activated by overexpression of CYP2E1 in HepG2 cells.Fig. 4Overexpression of CYP2E1 increases HO-1 reporter activity. A, C34 or E47 cells were co-transfected with pHHO15SVluc (1 μg) and pRL-null (50 ng) for 24 h. B, C34 cells were co-transfected with pHHO15SVluc (1 μg) plus pCI-2E1 or pHHO15SVluc (1 μg) plus pCI-neo (1 μg) and pRL-null (50 ng) for 24 h. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of the Renilla luciferase activity. Normalized luciferase activities were expressed as fold induction compared with that of the C34 cells. Data are expressed as the average ± S.E.

Med. 2001; 31: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To examine whether the induction of HO-1 in E47 cells was caused by an increase in ROS production, the effect of CYP2E1 inhibitors such as diallyl sulfide (DAS) (30Wu C.C. Sheen L.Y. Chen H.W. Tsai S.J. Lii C.K. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2001; 39: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) (31Feierman D.E. Cederbaum A.I. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (32Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Curr. Topics Pharmacol. 1997; 3: 67-76Google Scholar) on HO-1 induction was determined. ROS production was assayed by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin fluorescence. E47 cells showed an elevated basal ROS production (1.8-fold, p < 0.05) compared with control C34 cells (Fig. 5A). Incubation with 1 mm DAS, 5 mm 4-MP, or 211 mm Me2SO for 3 days significantly inhibited the increase in ROS production in E47 cells (from 1.8-fold to 1.2-, 1.1-, and 0.7-fold, respectively), whereas these compounds did not significantly affect ROS production in C34 cells (p > 0.05) (Fig. 5A). In a similar manner to the inhibition of CYP2E1 activity and decrease in ROS production, HO-1 induction in E47 cells was also prevented by these inhibitors. Incubation of E47 cells with 1 mm DAS, 5 mm 4-MP, or 211 mm Me2SO for 3 days significantly inhibited the HO-1 mRNA induction in E47 cells (from 2.2-fold to 1.2-, 0.8-, and 0.7-fold, respectively) when compared with control C34 cells (Fig. 5, B–C). E47 cells also had an elevated HO-1 protein level (about 3-fold) compared with control C34 cells in the absence of any addition (Fig. 6, A–B). This induction of HO-1 protein was also prevented by DAS, 4-MP, or Me2SO (from 3.2-fold to 1.58-, 0.65-, and 0.70-fold, respectively) compared with control C34 cells. These three inhibitors did not show significant effects on HO-1 protein expression in C34 cells (Fig. 6, A–B), validating their specificity for effects on CYP2E1. Catalase Inhibits the Induction of HO-1 by CYP2E1 Overexpression—Increased CYP2E1 activity by overexpressing CYP2E1 increases production of ROS such as H2O2, O2·¯ , and lipid peroxidation end products (14Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Curr. Topics Pharmacol. 1997; 3: 67-76Google Scholar). Catalase effectively decomposes hydrogen peroxide, whereas vitamin E, the principal lipid-soluble antioxidant in biological tissues, is widely used to prevent the onset of cell damage due to the induction of lipid peroxidation (33Pratico D. Iuliano L. Basili S. Ferro D. Camastra C. Cordova C. FitzGerald G.A. Violi F. J. Investig. Med. 1998; 46: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the role of ROS in the mechanism of HO-1 induction by CYP2E1, 5000 units/ml catalase or 100 μm vitamin E were added to the culture medium for 48 h. Both the increases in HO-1 mRNA and protein in E47 cells were almost completely inhibited by catalase (93 and 89%, respectively), whereas vitamin E had no effect (Fig. 7, A–B), suggesting a potential role for hydrogen peroxide in the induction of the HO-1 gene by CYP2E1 overexpression. ERK MAPK Is Activated by Overexpression of CYP2E1—To determine the role, if any, of MAPKs in HO-1 gene activation by overexpression of CYP2E1, we first examined the effect of overexpression of CYP2E1 on MAPK activities. MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues located in the “activation lip” of the conserved core kinase sequence (34Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn A.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the activated species can be detected by antibodies directed against phosphorylated peptides encompassing these residues. Untreated C34 or E47 cells were incubated overnight, and cell extracts were analyzed for phosphorylated and total MAPKs by Western blotting. Although the phosphorylated form of all three MAPKs (ERK, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase) can be detected in both C34 and E47 cells, only the phosphorylated ERK was increased in E47 cells compared with C34 cells (Fig. 8, A–B), suggesting that ERK MAPK is activated by overexpression of CYP2E1. The increase in the levels of phosphorylated ERK was not due to a concomitant elevation in the amount of ERK since the level of ERK (ERK1 or ERK2) in E47 cells was unchanged compared with C34 cells (Fig. 8, A–B), suggesting that ERK MAPK is activated by overexpression of CYP2E1. ERK MAPK Pathway Is Important for the Induction of HO-1 by Overexpression of CYP2E1—To address the role of individual MAPK pathways in HO-1 gene activation by overexpression of CYP2E1, we examined the effects of PD98059, an ERK pathway inhibitor, and SB203580, an inhibitor of p38, on pHHOSV15luc expression. The effect of wortmannin, an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, on pHHOSV15luc expression was also studied. C34 and E47 cells were transfected with the HO-1 reporter gene construct (pHHO15SVluc) and then treated with 10 μm SB203580, 10 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem), or 10 μm Wortmannin (Sigma) for 6 h. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. Consistent with higher expression of HO-1 mRNA, E47 cells have about a 1.8-fold higher pHHO15SVluc activity than C34 cells (Fig. 8C). PD98059 blocked the increased HO-1 reporter activity in E47 cells (from 178 to 101%), whereas it did not have any effect on the reporter activity of C34 cells (from 100 to 101%) (Fig. 8C), suggesting that ERK MAPK plays an important role for the activation of HO-1 by overexpression of CYP2E1. SB203580 significantly and comparably attenuated HO-1 reporter activity in both C34 and E47 cells (from 100 and 178% to 41 and 45%, respectively) (Fig. 8C), suggesting that the p38 MAPK pathway may be important for the basal HO-1 expression in HepG2 cells. In contrast, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not have any effects on HO-1 reporter activity either in C34 or E47 cells (Fig. 8C), suggesting that this pathway is not important for HO-1 gene expression in HepG2 cells. HO-1 mRNA and Protein Are further Induced after Treatment with AA and BSO in the E47 Cells—AA and BSO have been shown to increase oxidative stress and cause toxicity in E47 cells but not in C34 cells (14Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

To evaluate the response of HO-1 to these CYP2E1-dependent pro-oxidants, E47 and C34 cells were incubated with or without 50 μm AA or 100 μm BSO for 48 h. Both HO-1 mRNA and protein were further elevated about 3-fold in the E47 cells after treatment with AA or BSO (Figs. 9A and 10A). HO-1 mRNA and protein were only slightly increased by AA or BSO in the C34 cells (1.6- and 1.2-fold, respectively) (Figs. 9B and 10B). HO-2 protein expression was not affected by AA or BSO treatment (Fig. 10, A–B). Because HO-1 induction is a good indicator of a response to oxidative stress, the further increases of HO-1 expression in E47 cells most likely reflect the increased oxidative stress generated by AA and BSO.Fig. 10HO-1 protein expression is further induced by AA and BSO in E47 cells. E47 cells (A) and C34 cells (B) were untreated (control) or treated with 50 μm AA or 100 μm BSO for 48 h. HO-1, HO-2, and CYP2E1 proteins were detected by Western blotting. The protein bands were quantified and expressed as fold induction compared with that of untreated cells. Data are expressed under the blotting bands as average ± S.E.

Riviere C. Rouach H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 36Tsukamoto H. Lu S.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1335-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, little is known about changes of HO-1, an important antioxidant gene, in alcoholic liver disease. The present study shows that in chronic ethanol-fed mice, liver HO-1 protein expression is increased. This induction of HO-1 may be caused by induction of CYP2E1, although this remains to be studied. Chronic alcohol feeding of mice increases CYP2E1 expression, and induction of CYP2E1 is one of the central pathways by which ethanol generates a state of oxidative stress (28Cederbaum A.I. Wu D. Mari M. Bai J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Induction of CYP2E1 by injecting pyrazole to rats was found to induce HO-1 protein expression. In addition, HO-1 is induced in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1 but not in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP3A4, another isoform of the P450 family. Increased expression of CYP2E1 induces HO-1; this conclusion is also supported by a recent study in which CYP2E1 was transfected into a human hepatoma cell line HLE (37Takahashi S. Takahashi T. Mizobuchi S. Matsumi M. Yokoyama M. Morita K. Miyazaki M. Namba M. Akagi R. Sassa S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 11: 57-62PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have used a HepG2 cell line that overexpresses CYP2E1 to determine the mechanism of induction of HO-1. CYP2E1, when reduced by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, is a loosely coupled enzyme that displays high NADPH oxidase activity and is very reactive in catalysis of lipid peroxidation and production of ROS relative to other P450 isoforms (38Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ekstrom G. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Increased CYP2E1 activity is usually accompanied by increased ROS production and lipid peroxidation (14Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Wu C.C. Sheen L.Y. Chen H.W. Tsai S.J. Lii C.K. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2001; 39: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). E47 cells were found to have increased HO-1 protein and mRNA expression as well as elevated HO activity. Up-regulation of HO-1 by CYP2E1 may be an adaptive response of cells to the increased oxidative stress caused by the increased CYP2E1 activity. Effective inhibitors of CYP2E1 activity, such as DAS, 4-MP, and Me2SO, which inhibited the increased ROS production in E47 cells, also inhibited HO-1 induction in these cells. Other antioxidant genes such as glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase are also up-regulated by overexpression of CYP2E1 (19Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15563-15571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and, like HO-1, may reflect adaptive responses to the overexpression of CYP2E1. HO-1 is transcriptionally activated in HepG2 cells by overexpression of CYP2E1. E47 cells have increased HO-1 mRNA expression, whereas HO-1 mRNA degradation rates are unchanged compared with control HepG2 cells (C34 cells). Transfection of a human HO-1 promoter-reporter gene construct (pHHO15SVluc) into E47 and C34 cells further confirmed that the HO-1 promoter is activated by expression of CYP2E1. Hydrogen peroxide may possibly play a role in mediating this transactivation of the HO-1 gene by CYP2E1, since the addition of catalase, which decomposes hydrogen peroxide, blocked the induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein in E47 cells. It is not clear whether the added catalase is operating intracellularly or extracellularly; uptake of catalase by hepatocytes by an endocytosis-dependent mechanism has been reported (40Kyle M.E. Nakae D. Sakaida I. Miccadei S. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3784-3789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, because hydrogen peroxide is diffusible, extracellular catalase may function as an extracellular sink, removing intracellular hydrogen peroxide down its concentration gradient (17Sakurai K. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide has been reported to increase the DNA binding activity of the cadmium-response element on the promoter region of the human HO-1 gene (41Favatier F. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and activate HO-1 gene transcription in HepG2 cells (42Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Yoshimi T. Miura T. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1998; 16: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Increased CYP2E1 activity also increases lipid peroxidation in E47 cells (14Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, lipid peroxidation reactions do not appear to play an important role in explaining the up-regulation of the HO-1 gene in the untreated E47 cells, since the addition of the classical inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, vitamin E, does not prevent the induction of HO-1 protein and mRNA. MAPK pathways, including ERK and/or p38 MAPK, have been reported to participate in the activation of the HO-1 gene by inducing xenobiotics (9Ryter S.W. Otterbein L.E. Morse D. Choi A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234/235: 249-263Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 10Morse D. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this study we found that the ERK MAPK pathway possibly mediates the HO-1 gene activation by overexpression of CYP2E1 in HepG2 cells, whereas p38 MAPK is important for the basal HO-1 expression in HepG2 cells. ERK is activated by overexpression of CYP2E1 in HepG2 cells. Compared with the control C34 cells, E47 cells have higher levels of phosphorylated ERK, whereas the levels of phosphorylated p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are not changed. Inhibition of the ERK MAPK pathway by PD98059 blocked the increase of a HO-1 reporter gene (pHHOSV15luc) activity in E47 cells but had no effect in the control C34 cells, providing a correlation between the HO-1 promoter activity and ERK MAPK pathway. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by the specific inhibitor SB203580 significantly attenuated the HO-1 reporter basal activity in the control HepG2 cells (C34 cells) as well as HO-1 reporter activity in E47 cells, suggesting an essential role of the p38 MAPK pathway in maintaining the basal activity of the HO-1 promoter and supporting subsequent response to HO-1 inducers in HepG2 cells. We hypothesize that CYP2E1-derived oxidative stress results in activation of the ERK MAPK pathway, which is then followed by increased transcription of the HO-1 gene by a signaling mechanism also dependent on p38 MAPK activity. Increased production of ROS by overexpression of CYP2E1 is likely the link between activation of ERK and the up-regulation of HO-1 expression. As shown in previous studies (18Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 1468-1473PubMed Google Scholar), AA and BSO caused significant increases in ROS production and lipid peroxidation and toxicity in the E47 cells but had little effect in C34 cells. AA and BSO also significantly increased HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in the E47 cells in contrast to a slight increase in C34 cells. HO-1 induction is a good indicator of oxidative stress. Induction of HO-1 in E47 cells by AA and BSO may reflect the further increase in oxidative stress caused by AA and BSO over the basal stress generated by CYP2E1 expression, since AA and BSO significantly increase ROS production and lipid peroxidation in E47 cells. The functional significance of this induction of HO-1 is currently under investigation; preliminary studies show that inhibitors of HO-1 potentiate the CYP2E1 plus AA- or CYP2E1 plus BSO-dependent toxicities in E47 cells, in association with an increase in oxidative stress. 2P.

https://openalex.org/W2061467267,"We performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and high-resolution deletion mapping of the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q) in invasive cervical carcinoma (CC). The CGH analyses on 52 CCs identified genetic losses at 2q33-q36, gain of 3q26-q29, and frequent chromosomal amplifications. Characterization of 2q deletions by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 60 primary tumors identified two sites of minimal deleted regions at 2q35-q36.1 and 2q36.3-q37.1. To delineate the stage at which these genetic alterations occur in CC progression, we analysed 33 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) for LOH. We found that 89% of high-grade (CINII and CINIII) and 40% of low-grade (CINI) CINs exhibited LOH at 2q. To identify the target tumor suppressor gene (TSG), we performed an extensive genetic and epigenetic analyses of a number of candidate genes mapped to the deleted regions. We did not find inactivating mutations in CASP10, BARD1, XRCC5, or PPP1R7 genes mapped to the deleted regions. However, we did find evidence of downregulated gene expression in CFLAR, CASP10 and PPP1R7 in CC cell lines. We also found reactivated gene expression in CC cell lines in vitro after exposure to demethylating and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting agents. Thus, these data identify frequent chromosomal amplifications in CC, and sites of TSGs at 2q35-q36.1 and 2q36.3-q37.1 that are critical in CC development."

Yet, pol ι has unique features that appear to differentiate it from other Y-family polymerases.

Second, it has a tendency to abort DNA synthesis at positions where the template residue is a T consistent with the frequent misinsertion of G at this templating base (18Tissier A. McDonald J.P.

Finally, pol ι has been shown to have deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activity, a feature that is consistent with a role in base excision repair (BER) (24Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This feature could, in fact, be related to the pol ι requirement for somatic hypermutation, since error-prone DNA synthesis during BER may be an integral event in the process (23Faili A. Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Gueranger Q. Reynaud C.A. Weill J.C. Nature. 2002; 419: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The dRP lyase activity of pol ι proceeds by a β-elimination mechanism involving formation of a Schiff base intermediate between an enzyme primary amine and the Cl′ carbon of the deoxyribose phosphate to be released (24Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The location of the dRP lyase active site and the primary amine that serves as the nucleophile in Schiff base formation are unknown.In view of the interesting biochemical features and biological importance of pol ι, we characterized its domain structure by controlled proteolysis. This approach has been applied with many DNA enzymes for preparation of domain peptides that can be used to gain mechanistic and structural information. Recombinant human pol ι was expressed as a fusion peptide with glutathione S-transferase (GST), purified to homogeneity, and then digested with a panel of proteases. The GST region was released rapidly, and the COOH-terminal region of the enzyme was found to be hypersensitive, as no protease resistant peptides were observed. However, a relatively protease resistant 48-kDa NH2-terminal domain of pol ι was identified. This domain could be further digested to a protease-resistant 40-kDa domain. We made use of this information to map the location of the dRP lyase active site on the domain structure of the enzyme. The implications of these results are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides purified by high pressure liquid chromatography were from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). [α-32P]ddATP (3000 Ci/mmol), RESOURCE Q column, glutathione-Sepharose, glutathione HCl, and dNTPs were from Amersham Biosciences; [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Biomedicals; T4 polynucleotide kinase and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase were from Promega. Human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) with 84 amino acids deleted from the amino terminus were purified as described (25Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B.

Cell extracts from DNA polymerase β (pol β) null mouse fibroblasts were prepared as described previously (27Horton J.K. Prasad R. Hou E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2211-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Overproduction and Purification of GST-tagged Pol ι—SF9 insect cells were infected with a high titer stock of pJM299-derived baculovious. After 60-h incubation, the cells were collected by centrifugation. Pol ι was then purified as described previously (18Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar), except that in the final step of purification a RESOURCE Q column (fast protein liquid chromatography) was used instead of hydroxylapatite ion-exchange chromatography.3′-End Labeling—A 34-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing uracil at position 16 was labeled on its 3′-end by terminal deoxynucleotyltransferase using [α-32P]ddATP. This strand was then annealed with a complementary 34-mer template strand with a G at a position that pairs with U, by heating the mixture at 90 °C for 3 min, followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. 32P-Labeled duplex oligonucleotide was separated from unincorporated [α-32P]ddATP using a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide duplex was stored at –30 °C.5′-End Labeling—A uracil-containing 19-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide was 5′-phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The 34-mer template strand (described above) was then annealed with complementary 15-mer and 19-mer 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. The duplex was purified by a MicroSpin G-25 column and stored as described above.dRP Lyase Assay for Column Fractions—dRP lyase activity of pol ι was measured using a 34-base pair substrate DNA as described previously (28Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 32P-labeled uracil-containing duplex DNA was pretreated with 10 nm UDG and AP endonuclease. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 50 nm32P-labeled AP site-containing DNA. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 μl of the indicated fraction from a RESOURCE Q column (Fig. 1) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by transfer to 0–1 °C, and the DNA product was stabilized by addition of 2 m sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to a final concentration of 340 mm. Incubation was continued for 30 min on ice. The stabilized DNA products were recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of gel-loading dye buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA. Gels were scanned on a PhosphorImager 450 (Amersham Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using ImageQuant software.Kinetic Measurement of dRP Lyase Activity—Kinetic analysis of dRP lyase activity of pol ι was performed using a 34-base pair substrate DNA that contained a 32P-labeled uracil at position 16 and a nick between positions 15 and 16. The duplex DNA (100 nm) was pretreated (20 min at 30 °C) with 20 nm UDG in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. The dRP lyase reaction mixture (50 μl) was assembled at 0–1 °C in the above buffer. Reactions were initiated by adding appropriate dilutions of pol ι and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals and transferred to 0–1 °C to stop the reaction. The DNA product was stabilized by addition of 20 mm NaBH4 and incubated 30 min on ice. Then, an equal volume of gel-loading buffer was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 75 °C for 2 min. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen, precast gel) for 30 min at constant voltage (200 V). To quantify the reaction products, gels were scanned on a PhosphorImager and the data were analyzed using ImageQuant software. Due to dRP instability and the slow turnover number for the pol ι-dependent dRP lyase reaction, high enzyme concentrations were utilized. Under these conditions, the first-order rate constants of the exponential time courses are dependent on enzyme concentration. A secondary plot of the concentration dependence of k obs was fitted to the Michaelis equation.Covalent Cross-linking of DNA to Pol ι—To prepare the covalently cross-linked pol ι-DNA complex, the NaBH4 trapping technique was used (29Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 200 nm32P-labeled UDG-treated duplex DNA, and 1 μm pol ι. NaBH4 was added immediately to the reaction mixture (1 mm final concentration) and incubated for 30 min on ice. SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10 μl) was then added. The sample was boiled for 2 min, and the covalent complexes were resolved by NuPAGE, 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen), and the gel was scanned on a PhosphorImager.Proteolysis of the Pol ι-DNA Complex with Chymotrypsin—After NaBH4 reduction to achieve cross-linking of pol ι to 32P-labeled DNA, the reaction mixture was supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2, and the complex was treated with micrococcal nuclease (0.5 μg/ml). After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 8.0 by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 100 mm. Cross-linked complex was then treated with chymotrypsin by mixing chymotrypsin to complex (w/w; 1:6) and incubating at 30 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min intervals, mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min. The digested products were analyzed by NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel. When pol ι alone was digested with chymotrypsin, a ratio of 1:50 (chymotrypsin to pol ι) was used.DNA Polymerase Assay—Radiolabeled template-primer DNA was prepared by annealing the 5′-32P-labeled 21-mer primer to the 40-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide template at a molar ratio of 1:1. The standard DNA polymerase reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm dNTPs, 2.5% glycerol, and 200 nm32P-labeled DNA. The reactions were initiated by adding the appropriate dilution of pol ι. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of gel-loading buffer and the reaction products were analyzed as above.Steady-state and Single Turnover Measurements of Pol ι Utilizing Gapped DNA—Steady-state (enzyme ≪ substrate DNA) and single turnover (enzyme ≫ substrate DNA) measurements were performed with a templating G residue in a single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate described previously (30Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sequence of the single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate was: primer, 5′-CTGCAGCTGATGCGC-3′; downstream oligonucleotide, 5′-GTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′; and template, 3′-GACGTCGACTACGCGGCATGCCTAGGGGCCCATG-5′, where the underlined guanine serves as the templating base. Briefly, GST-tagged pol ι and DNA substrate were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated with Mg2+·dCTP. The final concentrations in the reaction mixture were 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 100 μm dCTP. Aliquots were withdrawn at various time intervals and quenched by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA. For the steadystate time course, the concentrations of GST-pol ι and DNA substrate were 5 and 200 nm, respectively, in contrast to the single turnover time course where the ratio of GST-pol ι /DNA was 5 (i.e. 250 nm/50 nm). Products were separated by 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the reaction products were analyzed as above. Data were fitted to the appropriate equations by nonlinear least squares methods.Base Excision Repair Assay—The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm diTris-phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 mm NAD, a 20 μm concentration each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and 2 μm [(α-32P]dCTP (specific activity: 1 × 106 dpm/pmol), 250 nm 35-bp DNA substrate with a uracil at position 15, and 10 μg of cell extract with or without supplemental pol ι (100 nm). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl gel-loading dye, and the reaction products containing radiolabeled dCMP were processed as above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEnzymatic Activities—To further examine the relationship between the polymerase and lyase activities of the recombinant pol ι protein, we purified the protein to near-homogeneity and then subjected the preparation to RESOURCE Q column chromatography (Fig. 1A). Fractions from the RESOURCE Q column containing most of the protein (fractions 9–13) were pooled and represented the final purified enzyme. There is a single peak for both the lyase and polymerase activities observed in these fractions (Fig. 1, B and C). Since most of the 108 kDa pol ι protein elutes in these fractions, the results are consistent with the interpretation that these enzymatic activities are intrinsic to pol ι.Domain Mapping of Pol ι—To examine the domain organization of pol ι, we subjected the purified enzyme (i.e. GST-Pol ι fusion protein) to controlled proteolysis with endoproteinase Glu-C, endoproteinase Lys-C, chymotrypsin, or trypsin. Results after chymotrypsin digestion are described in the legend to Fig. 2A. After 5 or 10 min, this digestion produced four major polypeptides (designated I–IV; Fig. 2A) with molecular masses of about 8-, 28-, 40-, and 48-kDa. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of these four polypeptides was undertaken (Fig. 2B). The results revealed that the 8- and 48-kDa polypeptides corresponded to the NH2 terminus of the pol ι sequence, whereas the 40-kDa polypeptide started at residue Met79 of pol ι. Sequencing of the 28-kDa proteolytic fragment revealed it to be the GST tag. With longer incubation, the 48-kDa polypeptide was no longer observed, whereas the 40-kDa pol ι polypeptide and the 28-kDa GST tag polypeptide persisted. These results indicated that the 40-kDa polypeptide is a protease-resistant domain of pol ι derived from the NH2-terminal and central regions of the 80-kDa enzyme. The 40-kDa region is designated as the core domain (Fig. 2C). This 40-kDa core domain was also observed after digestion with other proteases, e.g. trypsin and endoproteinase GluC (not shown). Finally, we note that no stable proteolytic fragments were obtained from the COOH-terminal region, ∼35% of the pol ι sequence, indicating that this region is hypersensitive to proteolytic digestion. The COOH-terminal region has been shown to interact with pol η and is necessary for “targeting” to stalled replication forks following DNA damaging treatment (31Kannouche P. Fernandez de Henestrosa A.R. Coull B. Vidal A.E. Gray C. Zicha D. Woodgate R. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Proteolysis of pol ι with chymotrypsin. A, a photograph of a Coomassie Blue-stained gel, illustrating the results of chymotrypsin digestion of pol ι, is shown. Purified GST-pol ι was digested with chymotrypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The digested samples were analyzed by 4–12% Nu-PAGE gel, and the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for sequencing. The positions of pol ι and chymotryptic peptides are indicated. B, amino-terminal sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer. The amino-terminal sequence of the polypeptides (I–IV) is shown. C, summary of the domain organization of pol ι and designations used in this report.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)dRP Lyase Active Site—In one phase of the β-elimination mechanism proposed for the dRP lyase reaction, an active site primary amine nucleophile attacks the electrophilic Cl′ atom of the substrate sugar yielding a Schiff base. Routinely, this intermediate can be covalently trapped by reduction with NaBH4. The covalent cross-linking approach has been widely exploited for the identification of the domain or amino acid residue bearing the primary amine nucleophile in many DNA repair lyases (32Deterding L.J. Prasad R. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. Tomer K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10463-10471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly, pol ι can be covalently cross-linked to a dRP-containing DNA substrate by NaBH4 reduction (24Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To localize the dRP lyase active site in pol ι, we subjected the cross-linked enzyme-DNA complex first to micrococcal nuclease digestion and then to chymotrypsin digestion (Fig. 3A). Micrococcal nuclease digestion was used to remove extraneous substrate DNA, and hence this preserves the gel migration properties of the labeled enzyme (32Deterding L.J. Prasad R. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. Tomer K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10463-10471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). With shorter periods of proteolytic digestion, label was observed mainly in the 48-kDa polypeptide (peptide I (I), Fig. 3A). But, this species was strongly diminished with prolonged digestion, whereupon most of the labeled material observed corresponded to the 40-kDa core domain (peptide II (II), Fig. 3A). Controls for this experiment confirmed that the DNA substrate was nuclease sensitive, as expected (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3), and that migration of the cross-linked enzyme was slightly faster after removal of the DNA substrate by nuclease digestion. These results indicate that the dRP lyase active site is in the 40-kDa core domain.Fig. 3Proteolysis of the pol ι-DNA complex with chymotrypsin. A, a photograph of an autoradiogram is shown illustrating the results of chymotrypsin digestion of covalently cross-linked pol ι-DNA complex. Pol ι-DNA complex was first digested with micrococcal nuclease and then with chymotrypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubation was at 30 °C for various lengths of time, as indicated at the top of the photograph. The digested samples were analyzed by NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel, and then the gel was scanned with a PhosphorImager. B, a photograph of an autoradiogram, illustrating the results of chymotrypsin digestion of pol ι and its subsequent cross-linking with 32P-labeled DNA, is shown. Pol ι was digested with chymotrypsin under reaction conditions as in Fig. 2. Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time intervals and subjected to cross-linking with 32P-labeled DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cross-linked products were analyzed as in A. Positions of pol ι-DNA complex, chymotryptic cross-linked peptides, and the protein markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In view of the results described to this point, we examined the question of whether any of the chymotryptic fragments retained enough enzymatic activity to be cross-linked in situ. After chymotryptic digestion (see Fig. 2), the peptide fragments were added to a dRP lyase reaction mixture and subjected to cross-linking with radiolabeled substrate DNA. Interestingly, the 48-kDa domain was labeled, but the 40-kDa core domain and other peptides were not (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that the 48-kDa domain was capable of dRP lyase activity and that its 8-kDa NH2-terminal segment, which was removed by prolonged proteolytic digestion, was required for this domain peptide to be active.Base Excision Repair Activities of Pol ι—We examined several features of purified human pol ι related to BER. First, kinetic features of single-nucleotide gap-filling DNA synthesis and dRP lyase were measured and compared with those of human pol β. To study kinetic parameters of dRP removal by pol ι, a duplex DNA (34-bp) that contained uracil at position 16 and a nick between positions 15 and 16 was prepared by annealing a 15-mer and 5′-end 32P-lableled 19-mer to the 34-mer complementary DNA strand; the resulting duplex DNA was treated with UDG to create a dRP-containing DNA substrate. Thus, this DNA substrate contained a 32P-lableled dRP flap in a single-nucleotide gap (Fig. 4A; 18-mer+ 32P-dRP). The time course of dRP removal from this substrate by pol ι was assayed as a function of enzyme concentration. The apparent K m and k cat for the dRP lyase of pol ι were 0.4 μm and 0.002 s–1, respectively (Fig. 4), resulting in a catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of 5 nm–1 s–1. Utilizing an optimized protocol to measure dRP lyase activity, this is ∼30-fold lower than that found earlier for pol β (28Prasad R. B"
https://openalex.org/W2167106271,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) plays a key role in the adaptive immune response by pumping antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for subsequent loading of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. TAP is a heterodimer consisting of TAP1 and TAP2. Each subunit is composed of a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain, which energizes the peptide transport. To analyze ATP hydrolysis of each subunit we developed a method of trapping 8-azido-nucleotides to TAP in the presence of phosphate transition state analogs followed by photocross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and high resolution SDS-PAGE. Strikingly, trapping of both TAP subunits by beryllium fluoride is peptide-specific. The peptide concentration required for half-maximal trapping is identical for TAP1 and TAP2 and directly correlates with the peptide binding affinity. Only a background level of trapping was observed for low affinity peptides or in the presence of the herpes simplex viral protein ICP47, which specifically blocks peptide binding to TAP. Importantly, the peptide-induced trapped state is reached after ATP hydrolysis and not in a backward reaction of ADP binding and trapping. In the trapped state, TAP can neither bind nor exchange nucleotides, whereas peptide binding is not affected. In summary, these data support the model that peptide binding induces a conformation that triggers ATP hydrolysis in both subunits of the TAP complex within the catalytic cycle.

These antigenic peptides, which are derived from endogenous proteins, are degraded within the proteasomal pathway in the cytosolic compartment. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) translocates these peptides into the ER lumen, where loading of peptides on MHC class I molecules takes place (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Subsequently, fully assembled MHC·peptide complexes can pass the ER quality control and traffic to the cell surface, where they are inspected by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. TAP belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily, whose members share the common structural organization of four domains: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (2Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). The TMDs are generally formed by 5–10 transmembrane helices, whereas the NBDs are defined by three consensus motifs: Walker A, Walker B, and C-signature sequences. Functional TAP is a heterodimer consisting of TAP1 and TAP2, each of which contains one N-terminal TMD followed by a C-terminal NBD (3Abele R. Tampé R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domains determine the peptide specificity and form a putative translocation pore across the membrane, whereas the nucleotide-binding domains catalyze the ATP hydrolysis and provide the energy for peptide translocation. TAP binds peptides with a preferential length of 8–16 amino acids (4van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Substrate selectivity is determined by the three amino-terminal residues and the carboxyl-terminal residue of the peptide (5Uebel S. Kraas W. Kienle S. Wiesmüller K.H. Jung G. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8976-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Peptide binding induces a drastic structural reorganization of the TAP complex as shown recently by kinetic and thermodynamic studies (6Neumann L. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Neumann L. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This structural rearrangement triggers ATP hydrolysis and peptide transport as deduced from the allosteric coupling between peptide binding and ATP hydrolysis (8Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to being an energy source, nucleotides are important regulatory factors. The release of MHC class I molecules from the loading complex, consisting of TAP1, TAP2, tapasin, and MHC class I molecules, was proposed to be tightly regulated by nucleotide binding (9Knittler M.R. Alberts P. Deverson E.V. Howard J.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 999-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding of ATP or ADP stabilizes TAP (10van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14632-14638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Deficiency of TAP in ATP binding and hydrolysis was also reported to be related to viral infection: The human cytomegaloviral protein US6 interferes with MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation by blocking ATP binding to TAP, although interacting in the ER lumen with the peptide transporter (11Hewitt E.W. Gupta S.S. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Kyritsis C. Gorbulev S. Hutschenreiter S. Pawlitschko K. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol.

In contrast, ICP47 from herpes simplex virus inhibits ATP hydrolysis of TAP by blocking peptide binding to TAP (8Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Peptide translocation is strictly dependent on ATP hydrolysis (4van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F.

Several groups have recently addressed the function of the two NBDs in the peptide transport process (reviewed in Ref. 14van Endert P.M. Saveanu L. Hewitt E.W. Lehner P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 454-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Exchanging the highly conserved, catalytic active lysine residue of the Walker A site impairs the transport activity strongly. Interestingly, although mutations of this residue in TAP2 fully interrupt peptide transport, TAP1 mutants show still low transport activity, suggesting distinct functions of both subunits during peptide transport (15Karttunen J.T.

A functional non-equivalence of the two NBDs has also been reported in studies exchanging the NBDs within the TAP complex. The chimera with switched NBDs has substantial higher transport activity than chimeras with two identical NBDs, indicating that two different NBDs are important for TAP function (18Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Daumke O. Knittler M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, so far it is not clear whether both TAP subunits catalyze ATP hydrolysis. This question could neither be answered by measuring ATPase activity of TAP, nor could mutagenesis studies clarify this point directly. In this study, the ATP hydrolysis properties of the two TAP subunits were studied for the first time by photolabeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP combined with BeFx trapping. It was demonstrated that the trapping reaction reflects the ATP hydrolysis of TAP. Peptides specifically induce BeFx trapping, whereas the TAP inhibitor ICP47 from herpes simplex virus blocks it. Very importantly, peptide-stimulated nucleotide trapping was found to occur at both subunits. In the BeFx-trapped state, TAP can neither bind nor exchange nucleotides, whereas peptide binding is not affected. Here, we provide direct evidence that TAP1 and TAP2 hydrolyze ATP within the peptide translocation process. Material—8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies. Sodium orthovanadate was freshly prepared before use according to the method of Goodno (20Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All metal fluorides were prepared before use by mixing metal chloride with sodium fluoride. Peptides used in this study were RRYQKSTEL (R9LQK), RRYQNSTEL, EPGNTWDED (E9D), and a d-isomer of R9LQK (d-R9LQK), in which all residues were exchanged by d-amino acids. In inhibition experiments, the active domain of ICP47 (residue 3–34) was used (21Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Preparation of Microsomes—Human Burkitt lymphoma cells (Raji cells) were cultured in roller bottles in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 40 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were grown in Sf900II medium (Invitrogen) following standard procedures. Infection with the baculovirus encoding human TAP1 and TAP2 was routinely performed with a multiplicity of infection of 3–5 (22Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Microsomes were prepared as described previously (22Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C. Iodination of Peptides—All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase technique applying conventional Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The identity of the peptides was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Radiolabeled peptides were prepared as described previously (22Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) with the following modification. In brief, the reaction was carried out with 1.5 nmol of peptides, 100 μCi of Na125I, and 10 μg of chloramine T in a volume of 60 μl. The reaction was stopped by addition of 120 μl of 0.17 mg/ml Na2S2O5. Free iodide was removed by Dowex 1X8 (Serva). Peptide Binding and Transport Assay—Peptide binding to TAP in microsomes was analyzed in AP buffer (phosphate-buffered saline buffer, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0). Microsomes (250 μg of protein) were mixed with 125I-labeled peptide R9LQK in a volume of 150 μl. After 15 min of incubation on ice, 1 ml of AP buffer was added and microsomes were centrifuged at 20,000 χ g for 8 min. After washing with 500 μl of AP buffer, the radioactivity associated with microsomes was quantified by γ-counting. The amount of unspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 400-fold excess of unlabeled peptide. To analyze peptide transport, microsomes (250 μg of protein) were incubated with 1 μm125I-labeled RRYQNSTEL, 3 mm ATP, or ADP in 50 μl of AP buffer for 2 min at 32 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of ice-cold AP buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, the pellets were solubilized in 900 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Igepal, pH 7.5) by incubation for 15 min on ice. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with 60 μl of concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose (50%, v/v) for 1 h. After three washing steps, the radioactivity associated with ConA-Sepharose was quantified by γ-counting. Inhibition of Peptide Transport by BeF x —To induce the formation of a BeFx-trapped complex, microsomes (250 μg of protein) were preincubated with 3 mm ATP, 5 mm BeFx (BeCl2:NaF = 1:10 mol/mol), and 1 μm R9LQK in 50 μl of transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm EGTA, 15% glycerol, pH 7.5) for 15 min at 27 °C. Subsequently, free ligands were removed by washing with 1 ml of transport buffer. Before use, microsomes were resuspended in 50 μl of transport buffer containing 3 mm ATP. Photolabeling of TAP with 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP—Microsomes were suspended in 25 μl of transport buffer containing 1 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. After 5-min incubation at indicated temperature, samples were irradiated with UV light for 5 min on ice. 500 μl of ice-cold IP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, pH 7.5) was added. Subsequently samples were immunoprecipitated (see below) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (11%). Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak BIOMAX™ MS films with an intensifying screen at –80 °C. Trapping of the TAP Complex by ATPase Inhibitors—Microsomes were incubated in 25 μl of transport buffer containing 2 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 0.5 mm ATPase inhibitors (orthovanadate, BeFx, AlFx, or ScFx) in the presence or absence of peptides for 15 min at 27 °C. In this assay, all metal fluorides were prepared by mixing metal chloride and sodium fluoride in a molar ratio of 1 to 100. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (transport buffer containing 10 mm ATP and 0.5 mm ATPase inhibitors). Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 20,000 χ g, pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of washing buffer. Finally, samples were irradiated with UV light for 5 min and then subjected to immunoprecipitation (see below). To determine the peptide concentration at which half-maximal trapping occurs (EC50), the intensities of photolabeled TAP (I) were quantified and fitted by Equation 1. I/Imax=[peptide]/(EC50+[peptide])(Eq. 1) Immunoprecipitation—After photolabeling, TAP was immunoprecipitated either as a complex or as disassembled TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. These two methods differ in the solubilization procedure. In the former case, microsomes were solubilized in 0.9 ml of IP lysis buffer for 15 min on ice. In the latter case, microsomes were solubilized in 200 μl of IP lysis buffer for 15 min on ice. To disassemble the TAP complex, SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 37 °C. Finally, 700 μl of ice-cold IP lysis buffer was added. In both methods, samples were centrifuged at 20,000 χ g for 8 min to remove insoluble material after solubilization. Antibodies were added to the supernatant and incubated for2hon ice. 50 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A/G-agarose Fast Flow (Sigma) were added, and incubation was continued for2hat4 °C. After washing three times with 1 ml of ice-cold IP washing buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, pH 7.5), proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE (11%). Antibodies used were monoclonal antibody 148.3 (anti-TAP1), rabbit antiserum 1p2 (anti-TAP1), and 2p4 (anti-TAP2). The BeFx-trapped TAP complex was immunoprecipitated by a combination of polyclonal 1p2 and 2p4. Polyclonal antibodies 1p2 and 2p4 were raised against the peptide epitopes ETEFFQQNQTGNIMSR (TAP1) and VGAAEKVFSYMDRQPN (TAP2) according to Nijenhuis and Hämmerling (23Nijenhuis M. Hämmerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5467-5477PubMed Google Scholar). 8-Azido-ATP Energizes Peptide Transport as Efficiently as ATP—8-Azido-ATP has been used to study the characteristics of binding and/or hydrolysis of ABC transporters such as P-gp, CFTR, and sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) (24Szabo K.

A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Before using 8-azido-ATP to probe ATP hydrolysis by TAP, we determined whether this ATP-analog drives peptide transport. Therefore, peptide transport quantified by the amount of glycosylated, radiolabeled peptide was analyzed in the presence of ATP or 8-azido-ATP. The accumulation of peptides in microsomes increases linearly within the first 2 min (data not shown). The initial transport rates were determined at increasing ATP or 8-azido-ATP concentrations and fitted with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 1). The apparent K m values for both nucleotides show only a slight difference, which are 197 ± 35 μm for ATP and 103 ± 24 μm for 8-azido-ATP, whereas the V max for both nucleotides is equal. From these results, we conclude that 8-azido-ATP support peptide translocation as efficiently as ATP and modification of the C8 position of the adenine base does not change the properties of the nucleotide during the catalytic cycle. 8-Azido-ATP Binds Specifically to TAP1 and TAP2—Next, we examined the nucleotide binding property of TAP by 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP photocross-linking. After immunoprecipitation, TAP1 and TAP2 (apparent molecular mass, 71 and 75 kDa) were separated by high resolution SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The identity of the two TAP subunits was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of disassembled TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. The photocross-linking is specific, because it was inhibited by 1 mm ATP, demonstrating its specificity. Interestingly, even after immunoprecipitation of the TAP complex with an anti-TAP1 antibody, TAP2 shows stronger photolabeling than TAP1. This preferential labeling of TAP2 was observed both for TAP derived from Raji cells and for TAP expressed in insect cells lacking factors of the MHC loading complex. These results demonstrate that both subunits bind 8-azido-ATP specifically, and TAP2 is photolabeled more efficiently than TAP1. 8-Azido-ATP Binding to TAP1 and TAP2 Is Magnesium- and Temperature-dependent—Magnesium is well known to be required for ATP hydrolysis by most ATPases. It has also been shown that Mg2+ can have different effects on ATP binding to two subunits of an ABC transporter (29Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the influence of magnesium on 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP photolabeling of the TAP complex. No photolabeling of TAP1 and TAP2 was observed in the absence of magnesium either at 4 °C or 37 °C, indicating that ATP binding to both TAP subunits is magnesium-dependent (Fig. 3A). Nucleotide binding to the TAP complex is temperature-dependent. At 4 °C, photolabeling preferentially occurred at TAP2. However, at 37 °C, TAP1 and TAP2 are equally labeled, and the photolabeling of both subunits is weaker than at 4 °C. Peptides slightly stimulate the labeling of both subunits (Fig. 3B). Phosphate Analogs Trap ADP in TAP1 and TAP2—The contribution of each NBD to the ATPase activity of TAP cannot be directly analyzed by measuring the steady-state release of inorganic phosphate. ATPase inhibitors, such as orthovanadate, BeFx, AlFx, or ScFx, are useful tools to elucidate the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by forming a stable Mg·ADP·inhibitor complex after ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release arresting the enzyme in the catalytic cycle (30Urbatsch I.L.

Therefore, TAP-containing microsomes were incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of different ATPase inhibitors at 37 °C to test their ability to form a trapped Mg·ADP·inhibitor·TAP complex. After trapping, weakly bound nucleotides were removed by washing the microsomes. Photolabeling of TAP1 and TAP2 was observed in the presence of all three metal fluorides, whereas very weak signals were found in the presence of vanadate (Fig. 4). No photolabeling was observed in the absence of trapping reagents. Microsomes derived from insect cells infected with baculovirus wild-type also showed no photolabeling. The trapping reaction was peptide-specific, and this is investigated in detail below. These data demonstrate that metal fluorides form a trapped state with ADP within the NBD of TAP1 and TAP2. This state is very stable, because trapped ADP cannot be competed out even by a 1000-fold excess of ATP. In all cases stronger labeling of TAP1 than TAP2 was observed. In summary, the phosphate analogs trap ADP in TAP with the following efficiencies: BeFx > ScFx > AlFx ≫ Vi. Peptides Induce the Formation of a Trapped Intermediate State of TAP1 and TAP2—It has been recently demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis is coupled to peptide binding and transport (8Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether TAP1 or TAP2, or both subunits are involved in ATP hydrolysis. Here, we investigated the effect of various peptides on BeFx trapping of Mg-8-azido-[α-32P]ADP by incubating TAP with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP under hydrolyzing conditions. Both subunits were strongly labeled in the presence of the high affinity peptide R9LQK and BeFx (Fig. 5A). A very weak labeling for TAP1 and TAP2 was observed in the presence of the herpes simplex virus protein ICP47, which specifically inhibits peptide binding and thus prevents the peptide-stimulated ATPase activity of TAP (8Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempé P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Früh K. Tampé R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a weak labeling of TAP was found in the presence of the low affinity peptides (K D > 1 mm), E9D and d-R9LQK. In the absence of BeFx, no labeling of TAP was detected even when high affinity peptides are present. To analyze the peptide-induced formation of a trapped intermediate quantitatively, BeFx trapping was performed with increasing concentrations of R9LQK. Photolabeling of both TAP subunits was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). The EC50 values (peptide concentration required to achieve half-maximal trapping) for TAP1 and TAP2 are very similar with 16 nm and 18 nm, respectively (Fig. 5C). These values are in good agreement with the affinity constant of fluorescein-labeled R9LQK (12 nm) measured under equilibrium binding condition (6Neumann L. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, under all trapping conditions, TAP1 was preferentially labeled. Taken together, these data demonstrate that peptides specifically induce BeFx trapping of both TAP subunits. BeF x -trapping Reflects ATP Hydrolysis—Peptide-induced BeFx trapping of TAP might be due to two different mechanisms: (i) BeFx substitutes the released phosphate immediately after ATP hydrolysis, forming a stable Mg·ADP·BeFx complex within the NBD (forward reaction); (ii) ATP is hydrolyzed by ATPases present in the microsomal preparation. Trapping is initiated by binding of MgADP to TAP, followed by association of BeFx and by formation of a stable NBD·Mg·ADP·BeFx complex (backward reaction). To distinguish between the two pathways, we compared BeFx trapping in the presence of the 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP. The concentration as well as the radioactivity of the two nucleotides was kept identical to allow direct comparison of the signal intensities. The high affinity peptide R9LQK strongly stimulates the trapping of TAP with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (Fig. 6). Moreover, in the case of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP, the trapping efficiency of TAP is not peptide-dependent and lower than in the presence of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. Therefore, we conclude that efficient BeFx trapping of TAP occurs only after ATP hydrolysis and that the peptide-induced BeFx trapping directly reflects ATP hydrolysis during the catalytic cycle of TAP. Peptide Transport and Nucleotide Binding, but Not Peptide Binding, Is Inhibited in the BeF x -trapped State of TAP—To characterize the BeFx-trapped state of TAP in more detail, peptide and nucleotide binding as well as peptide transport of trapped TAP were analyzed. After incubation of microsomes with BeFx and ATP for 15 min, peptide transport via TAP was reduced to 20% (Fig. 7A). Longer incubation with BeFx blocked the TAP transport activity completely. However, longer incubation time also impaired TAP function. The stability of the trapping state was examined by monitoring the recovery of peptide transport over time. For this purpose, free BeFx was removed to facilitate the dissociation of TAP·Mg·ADP·BeFx complex. It was observed that even after incubation for 45 min on ice, TAP remains in an inhibited state. Longer recovery times were not analyzed, because TAP started to loose activity even at 4 °C. Next, we studied the BeFx-trapped TAP complex with respect to nucleotide and peptide binding. Fig. 7B shows that pretreatment of TAP with BeFx and ATP inhibits the photolabeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP, demonstrating that the trapped state of TAP can neither bind nor exchange added nucleotides. The weaker photolabeling signal of TAP preincubated with ATP compared with that without ATP results from incomplete dissociation of ATP during the washing step. In contrast to nucleotide binding, BeFx trapping does not affect peptide binding (Fig 7C). At half-maximal and saturating peptide concentrations, the amount of peptides bound to the trapped and non-trapped state is equal. These data demonstrate that neither the affinity nor the overall amount of the peptide binding sites was altered. In addition, the same results were obtained when AlFx and ScFx were used for trapping (data not shown). Taken together, BeFx inhibits peptide translocation by trapping TAP in a stable intermediate state to which added nucleotides cannot bind. Importantly, peptide binding to TAP is not affected in this trapped state. In the last decade, major advances have been made in the study of the mechanism of peptide"

The monofunctional catalase (hydrogen peroxide:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.6) is a protective enzyme that degrades hydrogen peroxide to prevent damage from it or its more reactive degradation byproducts. The catalase reaction utilizes hydrogen peroxide as both an electron donor and an electron acceptor as summarized in the overall Reaction 1, which involves two distinct stages. In the first stage (Reaction 2) the resting state enzyme is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to an oxy-ferryl intermediate, compound I, which in the second stage (Reaction 3) is reduced back to the resting state by a second hydrogen peroxide. 2H2O2→2H2O+O2Enz(Por-FeIII)+H2O2→CpdI(Por+·-FeIV=O)+H2OCpdI(Por+·-FeIV=O)+H2O2→Enz(Por-FeIII)+H2O+O2Reactions1-3(Eq. 1) The structures of heme-containing monofunctional catalases isolated from eight different sources have been reported including those from bovine liver (1Murthy M.R.N.

The active center, composed of a heme with a tyrosine as the fifth ligand to the iron, a histidine, and an asparagine, is deeply buried in this core structure.

Both modifications are generated self-catalytically by the catalase and seem to require some degree of catalase activity (15Loewen P.C. Switala J. von Ossowski I. Hillar A. Christie A. Tattrie B. Nicholls P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10159-10164Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Three channels, the main channel oriented perpendicular to the plane of the heme, the lateral channel approaching in the plane of the heme, and a channel leading to the central cavity, connect the active site to the exterior of the enzyme, providing routes for substrate ingress and product egress. A number of catalase HPII variants have been constructed (16Nicholls P. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 51-106Crossref Google Scholar) to study the roles of various residues in the enzyme, including the active site residues. Most recently, the characterization of inactive variants has allowed the identification of substrate H2O2 localized in the main or perpendicular channel (17Melik-Adamyan W. Bravo J. Carpena X. Switala J. Maté M.J. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Proteins. 2001; 44: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The presence of H2O2 in the channel of HPII, the relatively direct route provided by the main channel to the heme in other catalases, and molecular dynamic studies (18Kalko S.G. Gelpi J.L. Fita I. Orozco M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9665-9672Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Amara P. Andreoletti P. Jouve H.M. Field M.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) all suggest that the main channel is the primary route for substrate movement to the active site. On the other hand, evidence has been presented that the lateral channel in HPII does have a role (20Sevinc M.S. Mate M.J. Switala J. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A number of highly conserved residues are situated in the main channel. These include the essential histidine, a valine and an aspartate, (His128, Val169, and Asp181 in HPII) situated 4, 8, and 12 Å from the heme, respectively (Fig. 1). His128 is essential for catalysis in HPII (15Loewen P.C. Switala J. von Ossowski I. Hillar A. Christie A. Tattrie B. Nicholls P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10159-10164Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the importance of Val169 in constricting the narrowest, hydrophobic portion of the channel has been investigated in yeast CATA (7Maté M.J.

The importance of the other residues further up the channel has not been studied, and this paper focuses on a number of these residues in the main channel of HPII. The importance of the highly conserved aspartate, Asp181, in particular the negative charge on its side chain, is revealed. Materials—Standard chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma.

Acta. 1967; 139: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in a Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode. One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2 in 1 min in a 60 mm H2O2 solution at pH 7.0 at 37 °C. The initial rates of oxygen evolution were used to determine the turnover rates to minimize the inactivation caused by high [H2O2] (29Ogura Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1955; 57: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated according to the methods outlined by Layne (30Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-454Crossref Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). The absorption spectra were obtained using a Milton Roy MR3000 spectrophotometer. The samples were dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Enzyme Purification—Cultures of E. coli strain UM255 transformed with plasmids pAMkatE72, pD181A, pD181S, pD181Q, pD181N, and pD181E, encoding HPII or the Ala181, Ser181, Gln181, Asn181, and Glu181 variants, respectively, were grown in Luria broth containing 10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl. Growth of the mutant variants was for 16 h at 37 °C or 22 h at 28 °C and of the wild type HPII was for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking. The cells were harvested, and HPII was isolated as previously described (31Loewen P.C. Switala J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Following resuspension of the ammonium sulfate fraction, the solution was heated at 50 °C for 15 min followed by centrifugation prior to chromatography on DEAE cellulose (Whatman). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement—Crystals of the Asp181 variants of HPII were obtained at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method over a reservoir solution containing 15–17% PEG 3350 (Carbowax), 1.6–1.7 m LiCl (Baker), and 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0. The crystals were monoclinic, space group P21 with one tetrameric molecule in the crystal asymmetric unit and had a solvent content of ∼40%. The diffraction data were obtained from crystals transferred to a solution containing 30% PEG 3350 and flash cooled with a nitrogen cryo-stream giving unit cell parameters listed in Table III. The diffraction data were autoindexed and integrated using programs DENZO and merged using SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Solvent molecules were only introduced when they corresponded to the strongest peaks in the difference Fourier maps that could make at least one hydrogen bond with atoms already in the model. In the final rounds of refinement the four subunits were treated independently with the bulk solvent correction applied and the whole resolution range available used for each variant. The analysis of solvent accessibility and molecular cavities was carried out with program VOIDOO (36Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

All of the figures were prepared using SETOR (37Evans S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The structure factors and coordinates have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank under the accession numbers 1P7Y for D181A, 1P7Z for D181S, 1P80 for D181Q, and 1P81 for D181E. Effect of Changes in Val169 Situated 8 Å from the Heme—A conserved valine is situated in the main channel of all catalases approximately 8 Å from heme. Its side chain causes a constriction or narrowing of the channel to a diameter of approximately 3 Å that prevents any molecules much larger than H2O and H2O2 from gaining access to the active site heme. Changing this valine to alanine in yeast catalase CATA (7Maté M.J. Zamocky M. Nykyri L.M. Herzog C. Alzari P.M. Betzel C. Koller F. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) allowed an increase in peroxidatic activity consistent with the concept that valine restricted access of larger molecules to the active site. Counterintuitively, the valine to alanine change in both CATA and HPII also caused a decrease in catalase activity, leading to the conclusion that the dimensions or volume of the channel were critical in determining the rate of H2O2 movement into the active site. Introducing the possibility for hydrogen bonding between water and protein in the V169S variant (12Carpena X. Soriano M. Klotz M.G. Duckworth H.W. Donald L.J. Melik-Adamyan W. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) also decreased the efficiency of the catalase reaction. To expand the study of Val169, the effect of larger side chains at this location in HPII was investigated with the construction of the V169I, V169F, and V169W variants. Purification and characterization of variants V169I and V169F revealed activities that are 10–15% of wild type (Table II), even lower than those of the V169A and V169S, consistent with the larger side chains interfering with substrate access to the active site. Heme conversion from heme b to heme d was normal despite the lower catalytic rate. The V169W variant did not accumulate protein, presumably because protein folding was adversely affected by the larger side chain, and the nascent protein was proteolyzed.Table IISpecific activity of purified catalase variants and heme compositionVariantSpecific activityHemeunits/mgWild type19,100 ± 900dV169I3,730 ± 400dV169F1,470 ± 120dV169WNDaND, not determined because no protein accumulated.R180A11,200 ± 1,510dR180K22,700 ± 1,650dD181A810 ± 60bD181S2,550 ± 190bD181E21,900 ± 700dD181Q1,770 ± 50bD181N2,800 ± 400bD181I2,330 ± 350bD181WNDa ND, not determined because no protein accumulated. Open table in a new tab Effect of Changes to Asp181 Situated 12 Å from the Heme—A conserved aspartate is present in the main channel of all catalases approximately 12 Å from the heme. The role of this residue has not been investigated in any catalase, and katE was mutated to express the HPII variants D181A, D181S, D181Q, D181N, D181I, D181E, and D181W (Table I). Purified variants D181A, D181S, D181Q, D181N, and D181I all exhibited between 5 and 15% of wild type activity, indicating that the loss of activity was independent of side chain size or ability to form hydrogen bonds with adjacent waters. Significantly, the D181E variant retained wild type levels of activity, revealing that the presence of a negatively charged side chain at this location is critical for the catalytic process. As with the V169W variant, the D181W variant did not accumulate protein, presumably because the large side chain interfered with folding. The crystal structures of D181A, D181S, D181Q, and D181E were determined to provide insight into how Asp181 influenced catalysis (Table III). The structures of the four variants differed from the structure of native HPII only in the immediate vicinity of the changed residue and more distantly with changes in the number and location of solvent molecules in the main channel and active site (Fig. 2). In the active site cavity, the feature common to all three inactive variants, D181A, D181S, and D181Q, is the absence of water 1, the sixth ligand of the heme, whereas nearby water 2 is present in the active sites of all variants. In addition, there are fewer waters in the channels of the less active variants generally (Table IV), even in positions over 20 Å away from the heme. By contrast, the native enzyme and the active variant D181E have water present at most positions in the channel. In particular, position 1, the sixth ligand to the heme, is occupied in three of four subunits of HPII and in all four subunits of D181E. Even the constricted, hydrophobic portion of the channel near Val169 is occupied at 3B in one subunit of HPII and at 3A and 3B in all four subunits of D181E.Table IVWater occupancy in the main or perpendicular channel of catalase HPII subunits listed as B factors (Å2)Water #Subunit ASubunit BSubunit CSubunit DHPII (1.9 Å; 1GGE) average B factor: 9.2 (protein), 17.7 (water)140.028.142.7215.317.416.312.93b32.3424.020.522.529.9530.741.229.027.9610.711.614.810.4728.031.133.324.187.710.918.66.697.19.412.04.71015.317.114.813.41116.718.823.710.9128.819.514.813.81319.335.517.51433.631.325.31530.130.1I3.77.14.86.2II5.16.15.07.1III4.08.96.48.1D181A (2.4 Å) average B factor: 26.2 (protein), 31.9 (water)216.720.022.121.646.18.115.111.5544.128.831.331.4625.434.328.032.5921.818.525.420.01037.025.022.439.01143.01248.934.133.435.01339.945.847.844.31538.0I19.321.213.313.5II17.819.918.812.2III15.515.517.117.2D181E (1.8 Å) average B factor: 16.7 (protein), 26.2 (water)135.143.444.246.1226.524.928.429.43a44.669.639.543.73b34.030.232.125.4435.047.542.341.7537.836.737.732.7616.017.020.116.5820.722.837.317.4912.615.818.114.91026.633.628.924.11124.828.233.720.411b30.135.81219.220.921.323.71327.530.91436.237.448.928.41534.448.9I10.410.39.714.1II9.011.514.07.9III11.713.610.713.3D181Q (1.65 Å) average B factor: 18.8 (protein), 31.2 (water)214.117.918.114.6418.020.924.420.6522.827.427.024.9618.121.218.918.2823.524.327.422.31037.135.339.139.61119.422.421.418.711b23.023.422.911c22.921.825.120.21219.625.924.024.512b30.322.927.431.21325.926.823.526.61434.431.61556.238.6I13.515.312.911.9II11.311.514.213.7II14.314.214.613.2D181S (2.2 Å) average B factor: 22.5 (protein), 29.6 (water)222.918.820.616.0413.914.221.313.94b25.123.226.625.6539.047.553.954.9625.327.233.919.7833.232.237.032.1916.513.716.110b44.840.838.41134.731.340.11244.137.31343.846.81444.1I12.013.613.812.5II10.716.415.511.2III11.710.711.513.5 Open table in a new tab As expected there are some changes in the positions of waters in the vicinity of the modified side chain at residue 181. These changes are most extensive in the D181Q variant where the nearby Gln233 side chain unexpectedly adopts a different conformation. The two waters that are adjacent to and interacting with the side chain of Asp181 at positions 4 and 5 are present in all variants, although they are shifted approximately 0.5 Å in D181A/S/Q, indicating that the interaction with Asp181 is not required for their presence. The three waters surrounding the heme, labeled I, II, and III, are conserved in all catalases for which structures have been determined and are included as controls. Effect of Changes to Arg180—Arg180 is a another highly conserved residue in catalases, and even though it is adjacent to Asp181, its side chain is oriented away from the channel (Fig. 1) and is situated almost 20 Å from the heme. To determine whether the influence of residues in this region of the enzyme was general or specific, katE was mutated to express variants R180A and R180K. Both presented wild type activities and heme d (Table II), indicating that other residues in the vicinity of Asp181 did not exert as great an influence on catalysis. Even with the wealth of knowledge accumulated from over 100 years of investigation, a clear understanding of how catalase maintains high selectivity for substrate hydrogen peroxide while at the same time exhibiting turnover rates in excess of 106/s remains elusive. The issue of selectivity can be explained in part by the active site heme being deeply buried within the β-barrel core of the subunit, necessitating passage of the substrate through 30–50 Å of narrow channels. Such narrow channels might conceivably hinder substrate movement to the active site and creates the conceptual problem of how the product water and oxygen find their way back to the surface of the protein without interfering with substrate ingress. Molecular dynamic simulations support the concept of hydrogen peroxide entering the enzyme through the main channel but do not agree on the route of product exhaust (18Kalko S.G. Gelpi J.L. Fita I. Orozco M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9665-9672Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Amara P. Andreoletti P. Jouve H.M. Field M.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, classical molecular interaction potential calculations carried out on CATA suggest that the substrate arrives in the active site properly oriented for interaction with the heme iron and side chains of the catalytic His and Asn side chains (18Kalko S.G. Gelpi J.L. Fita I. Orozco M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9665-9672Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The demonstration that a negatively charged side chain in the main channel of HPII enhances water occupancy in the access channel, particularly at the sixth ligand position and coincidently enhances enzyme activity provides a valuable insight into the mechanism of the catalase reaction. Both observations can be explained in terms of an electrical potential between the negatively charged carboxylate and the positively charged heme iron, which will influence the orientation of any molecule with an electrical dipole passing through the channel. Furthermore, given the location of the sixth ligand water in roughly the same position as substrate H2O2, on a direct line between the carboxylate and heme irons (Fig. 3), the electrical potential may influence transition state formation. The hydrogens in H2O2 are separated by an angle of approximately 110° when viewed along the O–O axis resulting in an asymmetric or skewed structure. Orbital interactions present an energy barrier to rotation around the O–O bond of approximately 2.5 kcal/mol, limiting H2O2 to one predominant conformation (38Schumb W.C. Satterfield C.N. Wentworth R.L. Hydrogen Peroxide. Reinhold, New York1955: 310-353Google Scholar). The structure gives rise to an electrical dipole of 2.3 Debye, just slightly larger than the 1.9 Debye dipole of water. Consequently, water and hydrogen peroxide passing Asp181 in the main channel will be affected by the electrical potential and be forced into an orientation with the oxygens directed toward the heme iron (Fig. 4). When oxygen O-1 of H2O2 becomes associated with the heme iron, spatial constraints in the active site fix H-1 within hydrogen bond distance of the imidazole ring of the active site histidine and O-2 within hydrogen bonding distance of the NH2 of the active site asparagine. Thus, orientation of the dipole of H2O2 in the potential field presents a simple mechanism to explain the prediction arising from molecular dynamic studies that substrate molecules enter the active site in a preferred orientation. Similarly, the greater occupancy of water in the channel of the native enzyme and the D181E variant, compared with the other less active Asp181 variants, can be attributed to the electrical potential acting on the dipoles of the solvent to create a population of waters with common orientation, thereby favoring the formation of a hydrogen bonded matrix. In the hydrophobic portion of the channel between Asp181 and His128, waters have only other waters to hydrogen bond with, and the bond lengths separating waters 2, 3a, 3b, and 4 are longer than optimal for strong hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3). The favorable orientation of the molecules induced by the electrical potential may be critical in stabilizing the solute matrix in the channel. What cannot be satisfactorily explained is the difference in occupancies between the channels of D181E and the native enzyme. One possibility is that it is simply an artifact of the refinement process, but the resolutions of the two data sets are approximately equivalent, and there are few other differences between the two variants. At this juncture, it seems reasonable to conclude that water occupancy in the hydrophobic portion of the channel is not a prerequisite for catalase activity, but that water can occupy the channel if certain subtle conditions, which we do not yet fully understand, are fulfilled. Certainly a complete explanation for waters in the channel and their impact on reactivity and solute selectivity involves more than simply the length of the hydrophobic region (4Putnam C.D. Arvai A.S. Bourne Y. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 296: 295-309Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). At a minimum, the volume and shape of the hydrophobic region must work in concert with electrostatic influences for optimum substrate access, and electrostatic effects have an additional key role in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2084654188,"Gene silencing associated with aberrant methylation of promoter region CpG islands is one mechanism in which tumor suppressor genes are inactivated in human cancers. Recently, we identified a novel gene, Target of Methylation-associated Silencing-1 (TMS1) (also called ASC), which is aberrantly methylated and silenced in human breast cancers. To further investigate the mechanism of TMS1 silencing, we defined the transcription initiation site and detailed the DNA methylation pattern of the TMS1 CpG island in normal breast epithelial cells, breast cancer cell lines, and primary tumors. We find that in normal cells, the TMS1 CpG island lies within a 1.2 kb unmethylated domain, the 5′ boundary of which is in close proximity to the transcription initiation site. In breast cancer cell lines, this boundary appeared to be unstable in that methylation tended to accumulate in the 5′ end of the CpG island relative to normal epithelial cells. In contrast, the 3′ methylation boundary remained intact. Gene silencing was not correlated with the methylation of specific CpG sites nor the inability to transactivate the TMS1 promoter, but was correlated with the percentage of alleles in the population exhibiting dense methylation across the entire CpG island. Using 5-aza-deoxycytidine to reactivate TMS1 in methylated and silent cell lines, and a cassette methylation strategy to determine the impact of methylation on different parts of the promoter, we find that demethylation of a small region immediately surrounding the transcription start site is critical to TMS1 expression. Our data support the idea that gene silencing and dense methylation are tightly coupled events that affect individual chromosomal copies of TMS1 in an all-or-none manner. The transition to this stably repressed state may be facilitated by spreading of methylation into the proximal promoter and direct effects of methylation on TMS1 transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2002751390,"Humoral factors and extracellular matrix are critical co-regulators of smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation. We reported previously that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-related non-kinase (FRNK) is expressed selectively in SMC and can inhibit platelet-derived growth factor BB homodimer (PDGF-BB)-induced proliferation and migration of SMC by attenuating FAK activity. The goal of the current studies was to identify the mechanism by which FAK/FRNK regulates SMC growth and migration in response to diverse mitogenic signals. Transient overexpression of FRNK in SMC attenuated autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, reduced Src family-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-576, Tyr-577, and Tyr-881, and reduced phosphorylation of the FAK/Src substrates Cas and paxillin. However, FRNK expression did not alter the magnitude or dynamics of ERK activation induced by PDGF-BB or angiotensin II. Instead, FRNK expression markedly attenuated PDGF-BB-, angiotensin II-, and integrin-stimulated Rac1 activity and attenuates downstream signaling to JNK. Importantly, constitutively active Rac1 rescued the proliferation defects in FRNK expressing cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that FAK activation is required to integrate integrin signals with those from receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors through downstream activation of Rac1 and that in SMC, FRNK may control proliferation and migration by buffering FAK-dependent Rac1 activation.

A large number of extrinsic cues (growth factors, extracellular matrix, cell-cell interactions, etc.) have been identified that regulate SMC growth and migration (1Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1054-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the precise cellular signaling mechanisms involved are not completely understood, and very little is known about how (or if) these signaling pathways are integrated. The majority of soluble SMC mitogens can be broadly divided into two groups, activators of receptor tyrosine kinases (i.e. platelet-derived growth factor BB homodimer (PDGF-BB), basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and activators of G protein-coupled receptors (i.e. angiotensin II (Ang II), thrombin, endothelin-1 (ET-1); see Ref. 2Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1054-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence indicates that members of both groups activate (to varying degrees) the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Rac/PAK/JNK kinase cascades, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C signaling pathways, among others (1Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is becoming clear that the mitogenic responses elicited by many of these factors are dependent upon extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin interactions. For example, when cultured fibroblasts are held in suspension, PDGF-, epidermal growth factor-, and lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated ERK activity is markedly reduced compared with cells plated on fibronectin (3Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is a critical step in integrin signaling and may be important for growth factor signaling, as well. In support of this idea, several mitogens (including PDGF-BB, Ang II, IGF-1, and ET-1) stimulate FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in an adhesion-dependent manner (5Polte T.R. Naftilan A.J. Hanks S.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have shown that integrin augmentation of growth factor-mediated signaling to ERK2 appears to be dependent upon FAK activation, because the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation observed in suspended cells can be rescued by overexpression of activated FAK. Furthermore, integrin-mediated autophosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 leads to recruitment and activation of Src and PI3K and subsequent downstream activation of Ras/ERK or Rac/JNK cascades (10Schaller M.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our laboratory showed recently that FAK appears to be regulated in a unique fashion in SMC. We reported that the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of FAK, termed FAK related non-kinase (FRNK), is selectively expressed in SMC with very high levels found in the large arterioles. FRNK transcription results from the utilization of an alternative start site within the FAK gene, and FRNK expression is independently regulated by a distinct promoter embedded within FAK intronic sequences (12Taylor J.M. Mack C.P. Nolan K. Regan C.P. Owens G.K. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Nolan K. Lacoste J. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas FAK protein levels remain relatively constant, FRNK protein levels in vivo are dynamically regulated with increased FRNK expression in the neonatal period and from 2 to 3 weeks following balloon injury. This pattern of expression correlates with the attenuation of SMC proliferation that is known to occur under these circumstances, suggesting that FRNK may be an important regulator of SMC growth (2Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1054-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, we have shown that overexpression of GFP-FRNK in rat aortic SMC completely prevented the PDGF-BB-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation and significantly inhibited the mitogenic effects of serum. In addition, GFP-FRNK also significantly inhibited fibronectin-dependent SMC migration toward PDGF-BB (12Taylor J.M. Mack C.P. Nolan K. Regan C.P. Owens G.K. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that FRNK acts as an endogenous inhibitor of FAK activity and that its expression in vivo may act to buffer FAK-dependent proliferative and migratory signals. In this report we sought to identify the mechanism by which FRNK attenuates growth factor and adhesion signaling in SMC. Our data indicate that in contrast to other cell types, FAK/FRNK signaling does not modify agonist-stimulated ERK activity in SMC. Instead, our data reveal that in SMC, Rac1 activation may be a key convergence point in growth factor- and FAK-dependent integrin-regulated cell proliferation.

Adenovirus Production and Expression Constructs—The GFP and GFP-tagged FRNK viruses (replication-defective ψ5 adenovirus) were plaque-purified by cesium chloride gradients as described previously (12Taylor J.M. Mack C.P. Nolan K. Regan C.P. Owens G.K. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The cDNA construct encoding an N-terminal DsRed-conjugated L61Rac1 was generated by cloning L61Rac1 into the 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI restriction sites in the pDsRed2-CI vector (Clontech). Cell Culture, Infection, Transfection, and Agonist Treatment—Rat aortic SMC were obtained from 8-week rat thoracic aortas by enzymatic digestion as described previously (15Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used from passages 7–21 and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12 (1:1) plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For adenoviral infection, cells were incubated in serum containing medium with either GFP or GFP-FRNK (MOI 10) for 12–15 h prior to treatment. In some experiments, cells were serum-starved for 4 h followed by treatments with PDGF-BB or Ang II for the times indicated. For the adhesion suspension experiments, cells were trypsinized, neutralized in soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml in PBS), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12. Cells were held in suspension or plated on fibronectin-coated (40 μg/ml) dishes for the times indicated. In some experiments, SMC were transfected using Gene Jammer transfection reagent (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemistry—SMC were plated on Lab Tek II chamber slides (5,000 cells/cm2; Nalgene) and infected with virus, as described above. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12, 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and then dosed with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 45 min. Slides were then washed three times with PBS (calcium- and magnesium-free) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Following an additional three washes in PBS, slides were permeabilized for 3 min with 4% Triton X-100 in PBS. Detergent was removed by washing three times with PBS and then slides were blocked with blocking solution (5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with Texas Red phalloidin in PBS (1:1000) to visualize filamentous actin. All steps were performed at room temperature. BrdUrd and WST-1 Proliferation Assays—To detect BrdUrd incorporation, SMC plated on Lab Tek II chamber slides, as described above, were transfected with 0.7 μg of pDsRedC1 vector (DsV) or pDsRedC1-tagged RacL61 (DsRacL61) using Gene Jammer transfection reagent. 48 h following transfection, cells were infected with GFP or GFRNK adenoviruses for 15 h. Cells were serum-starved as described above and then treated with either 10% fetal bovine serum or PDGF-BB (30 ng/ml) overnight. Cells were then incubated with 1/1000 dilution of BrdUrd labeling reagent (Roche) for 1 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed three times for 5 min with PBS and then fixed with ethanol (50 mm glycine, 70% ethanol, pH 2.0) in the dark at –20 °C for 20 min. BrdUrd detection reagent was used following the manufacturers instructions, followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with a cascade blue-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes). Slides were washed and mounted with coverslips, and BrdUrd-positive nuclei were visualized by indirect fluorescence microscopy. For the WST-1 experiments, SMC were plated in 96-well culture dishes (2,000 cells/well) and treated as described above, with the exception that the WST-1 tetrazolium salt (Roche Applied Science) was added to the culture for 2 h to monitor cell proliferation as per the manufacturer's instructions. After this incubation period the production of formazan dye was quantitated using a spectrophotometer (450 nm). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—SMC were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.2) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2 pyrophosphate, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.02 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.05 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin. CAS and paxillin were immunoprecipitated by incubation of 1 mg of cell extract with 5 μg of the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose-conjugated beads (Amersham Biosciences). For paxillin immunoprecipitations, the beads were pre-coupled rabbit anti-mouse Ab (10 μg/ml; Jackson Laboratories). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and two times with Tris-buffered saline (0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Proteins were boiled in sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were performed using the appropriate antibodies at a 1/1000 dilution (except anti-ERK, 1B3B9, which was used at 1:10,000). Blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Triton-X, followed by incubation with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1/2000 dilution. Blots were visualized after incubation with chemiluminescence reagents (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Kinase Activity—Kinase activity was measured by using a p44/p42 MAPK assay kit (Cell Signaling), following the manufacturers protocol. In brief, 250 μg of lysate from PDGF-BB or vehicle treated SMC was incubated with 15 μg of provided immobilized phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibody, and complexes were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with provided 1× lysis buffer and resuspended in provided 1× kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ELK-1 fusion protein. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer. Sample proteins were electrophoresed on an 11% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with phophos-ELK-1 antibody, and processed as described above. GST Pull Down Assay—GST-Pak (amino acid 1–290 of Pak1) was purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). GFP- or GFRNK-infected SMC were serum-starved and treated with PDGF-BB or Ang II as described above. Cells were lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2, plus 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 0.05 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14000 rpm at 4 °C (17Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). 500 μg of lysate was combined with 30 μg of GST-PAK, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed two times in Buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2, plus 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF, and 0.05 trypsin inhibitory units/ml). Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer, electrophoresed (15% SDS-PAGE gel), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed using an anti-Rac1 primary antibody as described above. We reported previously that overexpression of GFP-FRNK in cultured aortic SMCs by adenoviral gene transfer resulted in a modest increase in FRNK protein effectively inducing an exogenous FRNK to endogenous FAK ratio of around 3:1. This FRNK:FAK ratio compares favorably with endogenous ratios observed in neonatal vessels and is sufficient to inhibit both FAK activity and PDGF-BB-stimulated proliferation and migration. To begin to dissect the signaling pathways altered by FRNK expression in SMC, we first examined the effect of FRNK overexpression on total cellular phosphotyrosine levels. In adherent cultures of SMC, three major tyrosine phosphorylated bands were attenuated in GFRNK in comparison with GFP-infected or uninfected control cells (Fig. 1A). The 125-kDa protein is probably FAK because FAK co-migrates with this band, and FRNK overexpression in SMC inhibits autophosphorylation of Tyr-397 as reported previously (12Taylor J.M. Mack C.P. Nolan K. Regan C.P. Owens G.K. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The use of additional phosphospecific antibodies demonstrated that FRNK overexpression in SMC also inhibited phosphorylation of the major Src-dependent phosphorylation sites in FAK namely pY556, pY557, and pY861 (Fig. 1B). The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins migrating at ∼130 and 70 kDa likely represent the FAK binding partners p130Cas and paxillin (Fig. 1C). Because proliferation and migration of SMC in response to PDGF-BB are at least partially dependent on ERK activation (18Yamboliev I.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1680-C1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pukac L. Huangpu J. Karnovsky M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 548-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Bornfeldt K.E.

Sci. 1995; 766: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and because ERK activation has been reported to be dependent on FAK/p130Cas interactions (21Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), we tested whether overexpression of GFP-FRNK could attenuate mitogen-stimulated ERK activity. Surprisingly, dose-dependent stimulation of ERK by PDGF-BB was not altered by overexpression of GFP-FRNK (Fig. 2A, top panel) even though PDGFBB-stimulated FAK activation (in the same lysates) was clearly attenuated (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Because the time course of ERK1/2 activation may also regulate cell cycle progression, (22Tombes R.M. Auer K.L. Mikkelsen R. Valerie K. Wymann M.P. Marshall C.J. McMahon M. Dent P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) we examined whether FRNK might alter the kinetics of PDGF-BB-stimulated ERK activity. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, FRNK expression did not alter the kinetics of PDGF-BB-induced ERK activation at time points ranging from 1 min to 3 h. In addition, we observed no significant difference in the ability of ERK to phosphorylate ELK-1 as assessed by an immune-complex kinase assay that measures direct phosphorylation of a GST-ELK fusion protein (Fig. 2C). These data likely indicate that in SMC, FRNK inhibits PDGF-BB-stimulated migration and proliferation in an ERK-independent fashion. Other major signaling pathways known to regulate both proliferation and migration include activation of the small GTPases of the Rho family. Interestingly, Rac1 has been shown previously (24Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 25Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A.

Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) to be activated both by PDGF receptors and following engagement of certain integrins. We used a well defined assay to examine Rac1 activation in SMC using a GST-PAK1 fusion protein to precipitate active (GTP-bound) but not inactive (GDP-bound) Rac1. As shown in Fig. 3A, this GST fusion protein effectively precipitated activated L61Rac but not inactive N17Rac when these constructs were overexpressed in COS-7 cells. Using this assay, we have shown that PDGF-BB induced a rapid transient activation of Rac1 in SMC. PDGF stimulated an approximate 2–3-fold increase in Rac1 activity, which peaked between 1 and 3 min following stimulation (Fig. 3B, left panel). As shown in Fig. 3B, right panel, overexpression of GFP-FRNK slightly inhibited basal activity and markedly attenuated PDGF-stimulated Rac1 activity in SMC. In addition, activation of JNK (a kinase known to be downstream of Rac1 activation) was also attenuated in the GFP-FRNK expressing cells (Fig. 3C). Because Rac1 activation stimulates the formation of distinct actin-rich lamellipodia, an important event during cell motility (24Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 26Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar, 27Anand-Apte B. Zetter B. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we examined whether FRNK expression in SMC might alter this process in PDGF-BB-stimulated SMC. Indeed, in GFP-infected cells, PDGF-BB stimulated a reorganization of actin filaments and a resultant ruffled morphology (note the dissolution of stress fibers and formation of actin bundles around the periphery of the PDGF-BB-stimulated cells; see Fig. 3D, top panels). In contrast, PDGF treatment of GFP-FRNK-infected cells did not result in noticeable changes in actin rearrangements (Fig. 3D, bottom panels). Taken together, these data indicate that FRNK expression attenuates the activation of Rac1 and Rac1-dependent signals in SMC. To determine whether inhibition of Rac1 was the sole determinant for the proliferative defects induced by FRNK, we examined the ability of activated Rac1 to rescue PDGF-BB-stimulated proliferation in FRNK overexpressing cells. To this end, SMC were transfected with either DsV or DsRacL61 prior to infection with GFP and GFP-FRNK adenoviruses. Following serum starvation, cells were treated with PDGF and analyzed for their capacity to incorporate BrdUrd. Consistent with our previous report, FRNK overexpression attenuated PDGF-stimulated BrdUrd incorporation by ∼40% to a level comparable with cells in serum-free media (p < 0.05 compared with GFP-infected cells; see Fig. 4). Importantly, although Rac1 alone had little effect on BrdUrd incorporation in GFP expressing cells, overexpression of constitutively active L61Rac1 efficiently rescued the effects of FRNK on cell proliferation (p < 0.01 compared with FRNK + DsV). Control experiments indicated that similar amounts of FRNK were expressed under both conditions (Fig. 4, upper panel). These data indicate that Rac1 acts downstream of FAK/FRNK to control SMC proliferation. To determine whether inhibition of Rac1 activity might be a general mechanism by which FRNK attenuates SMC growth, we examined the capacity of FRNK to inhibit Ang II-mediated signal transduction. We found that overexpression of FRNK also inhibits Ang II-stimulated cell growth reducing the proliferative index by 77 ± 12% after a 24-h treatment as assessed colorimetrically by monitoring cleavage of the tetrazolium salt, WST-1. These data corroborate studies reported elsewhere (28Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and suggest that FRNK can inhibit proliferative signals induced by G protein-coupled receptors, as well as receptor tyrosine kinases. Because Ang II has also been shown to stimulate Rac1 activity in SMC (29Schmitz U. Thommes K. Beier I. Wagner W. Sachinidis A. Dusing R. Vetter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22003-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and other cell types, we examined whether this effect might also be altered by FRNK. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5A, Ang II stimulated a rapid transient increase in Rac1 activity in SMC, and this effect was attenuated by ectopic expression of GFP-FRNK. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, neither the kinetics of Ang II-stimulated ERK activation nor the concentrations of Ang II required for maximal ERK activation were significantly altered by overexpression of GFP-FRNK in SMC. Control experiments indicated that Ang II does stimulate FAK activity and that this activity is blocked by overexpression of FRNK. Thus, FRNK appears to attenuate both Ang II- and PDGF-BB-dependent mitogenic signaling without effects on ERK activity. As noted above signaling through many SMC mitogens is dependent on ECM, but the precise mechanisms involved in this regulation have not been clearly defined. In certain cell types, fibronectin-binding integrins have been shown to contribute to the activation of Rac1 (30Mettouchi A. Klein S. Guo W. Lopez-Lago M. Lemichez E. Westwick J.K. Giancotti F.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether plating SMC on fibronectin would stimulate the activation of Rac1 in SMC and if so, whether expression of FRNK might alter integrin-dependent Rac1 activation. As shown in Fig. 6, plating SMC on fibronectin stimulated a transient activation of Rac1 that peaked at 1 h, and overexpression of FRNK attenuated this response at each time point (Fig. 6). In contrast, overexpression of FRNK had little effect on fibronectin-stimulated ERK activity. These data indicate that FRNK attenuates FAK-dependent activation of Rac1 in response to PDGF-BB, Ang II, and integrins. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Rac1 activation may be a key convergence point in growth factor and integrinregulated cell proliferation and migration in SMC and that FRNK may act to regulate signaling through diverse pathways at this level (see Fig. 7).Fig. 7Schematic summarizing mitogenic signaling pathways that"

Comparative sequence analyses, motif search and secondary structure prediction indicated that each of the two P-glycoprotein halves is structurally similar to the MsbA monomer and also suggested that the open dimer structure is valid for P-glycoprotein. Homology modeling was used to predict the structure of P-glycoprotein using MsbA as a template. The resulting modeled structure allowed a detailed study of the interactions between the intracellular domain and the nucleotide binding domain and suggested that these contacts are involved in mediating the coupling between nucleotide binding domain conformational changes and transmembrane helices reorientation during transport. In P-glycoprotein, the internal chamber open to the inner leaflet and the inner medium is significantly different in size and charge than in MsbA. These differences can be related to those of the transported substrates. Moreover an ensemble of 20 conserved aromatic residues appears to border the periphery of each side of the chamber in P-glycoprotein.

Resistance of tumor cells to anticancer drugs is mainly due to the activity of multidrug resistance proteins belonging to the membrane ABC transporters superfamily. These proteins are able to actively transport drugs out of the cell at the expense of the hydrolysis of Mg-ATP (1Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 2Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Zelcer N. Van Helvoort A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 4Small D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of MDR transporters has therefore both biomedical and fundamental relevance.The P-glycoprotein, product of the mdr1 gene in humans, is the most studied multidrug transporter. This transmembrane ATPase is able to extrude chemotherapeutic drugs and other molecules with a broad but defined specificity. Several lines of data suggest that at least part of the drugs is transported from the inner membrane leaflet rather than from the intracellular aqueous phase (5Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Phospholipid and cholesterol transport by P-gp have been reported (6Pohl A. Lage H. Muller P. Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Garrigues A. Escargueil A E. Orlowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10347-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein has an overall molecular architecture similar to all ABC transporters. It is made of two halves, each consisting of a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). In P-gp, both halves are carried by a single polypeptide chain and have highly homologous sequences. Each TMD consists of 6 contiguous transmembrane helices and is linked to its corresponding NBD. The 2 NBDs share a large homology with those of other ABC transporters and contain several consensus structural motifs involved in ATP hydrolysis.Progress in understanding the mechanism of drug transport is still hampered by the lack of detailed information upon the three-dimensional structure of P-gp. However, important progresses have been made recently in this regard. Mutagenesis, photoaffinity labeling, and cross-linking studies have identified the residues involved in the drug binding site, which are located in the TMDs (for reviews see Refs. 2Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar and 8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). EM and single particle analysis of P-gp have provided a 1-nm resolution structure in which the two TMDs form a central chamber, which is accessible from the extracellular aqueous phase as well as from the inner lipid leaflet (9Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). More recently, x-ray analysis of three-dimensional crystals of MsbA, a bacterial lipid ABC transporter with 30% homology to P-gp has yielded a 0.45-nm resolution structure. The two transporter halves are organized as an open structure in which the TMDs interact at their periplasmic ends while the 2 NBD domains are 5-nm apart. Again the two TMDs form a chamber accessible from the inner lipid leaflet (10Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). A similar structure has also been found by EM for YvcC, another lipid/drug ABC transporter, reconstituted in a lipid bilayer (11Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This organization has been suggested to be valid also for P-gp (10Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). More recently, two-dimensional crystals have been obtained for P-gp in a lipid bilayer yielding a two-dimensional projection (12Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The dimensions of the latter are consistent with an organization in which the two transporters halves interact more closely, as indeed found in the recent three-dimensional structure of BtuD, a rather remote ABC transporter (13Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Another recent EM study focusing on the P-gp TMDs led to similar conclusions (14Rosenberg M.F. Kamis A.B. Callaghan R. Higgins C.F. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8294-8299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this closed structure and the MsbA-like open structure represent two distinct conformations of P-gp (12Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, results from three-dimensional structure alignments have indicated that the MsbA NBD has a different conformation than other nucleotide-free NBDs (15Jones P.M. George A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12639-12644Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The structural evaluation of this wealth of data is rendered difficult by the absence of an atom-level three-dimensional structure of P-gp. In the absence of high-resolution experimental data, we have attempted to provide such a structure by molecular modeling. For this purpose we have evaluated in detail the validity of the MsbA structure as a structural model for of P-gp using sequence analyses and secondary structure prediction. On this basis, we have predicted the three-dimensional structure of P-gp by homology modeling using the MsbA structure as a template. We have then examined in detail the modeled P-gp structure and compared these results with available data on P-gp organization, structure-function relationships and sequence conservation.MATERIALS AND METHODSSequence Alignments and Secondary Structure Prediction—All sequences were obtained from the Swiss-Prot-TREMBL data base. Sequence alignments were generated automatically with the ClustalX program (16Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35214) Google Scholar) and optimized manually. Secondary structure prediction of the 3 intracellular domains of P-gp as well as transmembrane helices prediction were performed with the PHD server (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/predictprotein.html) using alignments of all ABC transporters having more than 40% homology with P-gp in the regions to predict. Motif search in the Swiss-Prot-TREMBL data base was performed with the Protein Information Resource server (pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/search/patmatch.html).Homology Modeling—Graphical representations of molecular structures were done with Molscript (17Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Molmol (18Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 51: 29-32Google Scholar), and Raster3d (19Vriend G.J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 526-529Google Scholar). Protein structure files manipulations and modifications were done with Whatif (20Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar) Homology modeling was performed with the Modeller 6.2 software (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10391) Google Scholar). The template structure was based on the MsbA dimer PDB structure (1JSQ), which contains only the coordinates of α carbons (10Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). It was necessary to take into account the fact that several sequence stretches of P-gp have no counterparts in the MsbA structure. This includes regions that exist both in PGP and MsbA but are not resolved in the MsbA structure (for each MsbA monomer: residues 208–237 in ICD2, residues 343–408 and 565–576 in the NBD) as well as regions that correspond to extra sequences stretches in P-gp (P-gp residues 76–84 and 97–109 in EC1, 255–284 in ICD2, 896–987 in ICD5 and smaller insertions). Secondary structure prediction using PHD indicated that part of these sequences stretches, belonging to the TM domains of P-gp have a helical conformation. These correspond to helical extensions of TM2 and of the two helices of the ICD2 and ICD5. Cα atoms corresponding to canonical α-helical geometry were thus added to the template in order to extend these helices with an orientation dictated by the geometry of the residue at their extremity. Secondary structure prediction also indicated that the other P-gp insertion stretches of the TM domain have a loop (i.e. non regular) conformation. These were thus left to be optimized in the second stage of the homology modeling procedure. The missing portions of the 2 NBD were added to the template as the corresponding domains of the TAP1 NBD structure (PDB file 1JJ7) (22Gaudet R. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4964-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) after aligning manually both nucleotide domains. The largest addition was the 505–580 region of the TAP1 NBD, which corresponds to a 3 strands-helix-2 strands-helix motif (β1-β2-β3-α1-β4-β5-α2, in the usual NBD nomenclature, see Ref 22Gaudet R. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4964-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The third strand β3 of this motif was cut off at its C-terminal end and reoriented by ∼20° around its N-terminal residue in order to be included in a β-sheet with β6, β7, and β8 of the MsbA NBD as is current in all known ABC transporter NBDs. All connecting loops were first closed manually and left to be optimized in the second stage of the homology modeling procedure. The conformation of the Walker A motif was not modified by this manipulation. A second addition to the template was a two-helix motif (α8-α9, residue 729–740 of the TAP1 NBD), which was connected at the C-terminal of each of the template NBD, its orientation being dictated by the backbone conformation of the C-terminal residues of the MsbA monomer PDB structure. The 627–693 linker region of P-gp was not considered in the present study since it apparently bears no structural relevance to function apart from a flexibility requirement (23Hrycyna C.A. Airan L.E.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13660-13673Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).The first stage of modeling was performed with the “model” routine of Modeller 6.2 using the modified MsbA template and the alignment of MsbA and P-gp as input.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4964-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) were imposed. 20 structures were generated among which, one was selected which corresponded to low restraints violations and to an adequate bond angles, bond lengths, and backbone dihedrals stereochemistry, as checked with Whatif. In a second stage, the Modeller 6.2 “loop” routine (24Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) was used to optimize the conformations of loops. The small loops (<5 residues) were optimized in a single calculation in which 20 structures were generated. The 20 structures were superimposed, those having minor loop conformations were discarded and the structure with the best bond and angle stereochemistry of the loops was selected. Each of the larger loops was then optimized separately again selecting each time the best among 20 generated structures after eliminating structures with minor loop conformations and evaluating stereochemical quality. Several abnormal ω angles, steric clashes, and abnormal bond lengths and bond angles were corrected using Whatif, respectively by reconstructing the residue from its α carbon, by conformational search debumping and by atom displacement refinement. This procedure was deemed preferable to further energy minimization, which often has detrimental effects on packing. Procheck (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) analysis of the modeled P-gp structure indicated that the quality of the Ramachandran plot (97.6% of the backbone angles in the allowed regions) and other main chain or side-chain geometric properties were equivalent to those of an experimental structure with a 0.25 nm resolution. The modeled structure is such that no polar side-chain is located in the region expected to be in contact with the hydrophobic part of the bilayer confirming the validity of the alignment.Residue Contact and Molecular Surface Analyses—Identification of residues corresponding to the TMD-NDB interfaces and to the monomer-monomer interface in MsbA was performed using Whatif. First an all-atom structure of MsbA was generated from the α carbon coordinates using the “catoal” function of Whatif. Then interface residues were identified as those having a less than 0.45 nm center to center distance between side-chain atoms. This relatively large cutoff was chosen in view of the uncertainties inherent to the all-atom modeled structure. Interface residues involving the ICDs and NBDs in the modeled P-gp structure were identified similarly using a distance cutoff of 0.4 nm. Analysis of side-chain contribution to the P-gp chamber surface was performed with Grasp (36Dawson J.P. Weinger J.S Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Surface potential was calculated with Molmol using a 100 mm ionic strength and dielectric constants of 2 and 80 for protein and solvent.RESULTSMsbA and P-gp Sequence and Secondary Structure Homology—In order to evaluate the validity of MsbA as a structural model for P-gp we have first examined in detail the sequence and secondary structure homology of the two proteins. The alignment of P-gp with two MsbA monomers is shown in Fig. 1. The alignment yields respectively a 31 and 30% identity of MsbA to the two P-gp transporter halves. Recent studies have demonstrated that a sequence identity higher than 25% between 2 proteins is indicative of similar three-dimensional structures (27Yang A.S. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Several conserved sequence motifs are apparent in the regions corresponding to the extracellular domains of as well as in the IC2-TM4 and IC5-TM10 regions. In particular there is a conserved sequence motif encompassing a 29-residue stretch in the first intracellular region. Data base searches indicated that this motif corresponds to the general scheme RX 3(W/F/Y)X 2(L/I/M)X 6(W/F/Y)FDX 4,6(G/T)XLX(S/T)RX 3D. This motif appears to be present in 80 ABC transporter sequence in the Swiss-Prot-TREMBL database. The sequence families correspond to MsbA, ValA (known to be functionally similar to MsbA, see Ref. 28McDonald M.K. Cowley S.C. Nano F.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), YvcC (11Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol.

Acta. 2002; 1555: 13-17Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and HorA (30Sakamoto K. Golles A. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5371-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), several antibiotic resistance transporters from Staphylococcus aureus (31Otto M. Gotz F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a few uncharacterized transporters from extremophiles, an ABC transporter subfamily from plants, the mammalian transporter ABC8 involved in phospholipid-cholesterol transport (32Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch Ozcurumez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), as well as 35 P-gp like sequences including those of all known mammalian P-gps, phosphatidylcholine translocases and bile salt export pumps and those of MDR proteins from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and other organisms. This motif was not found in any bacterial or eukaryotic transporter known not to be involved in lipid or drug transport.The structural similarity between MsbA and P-gp was also investigated at the secondary structure level. Transmembrane helix predictions yielded limits for P-gp that are qualitatively consistent with those of the MsbA structure. A crucial test is the secondary structure prediction of the intracellular regions of P-gp. Indeed an important aspect of the MsbA structure is the fact that all 6 transmembrane helices of the monomer are connected on the intracellular side to largely helical segments (ICD1, ICD2, and ICD3) that also interact with the NBD (10Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The result of secondary structure prediction for the corresponding regions of P-gp is shown in Fig. 1. It indicates that the predicted secondary structure in the intracellular regions of P-gp is largely helical. The residue to residue agreement between the predicted secondary structure of P-gp and the experimental secondary structure of MsbA in the intracellular region is 71%. Considering that the accuracy of such secondary structure prediction is 72% (33Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this shows that the secondary structure of the intracellular region of P-gp is highly similar to the corresponding regions of MsbA.We have also attempted to evaluate whether the relative topology and the interactions between the TMD and NBD in each P-gp half is comparable to that found in the MsbA monomer structure. For this purpose, the residues pairs involved in TMD-NBD contacts in MsbA were identified and their conservation in P-gp was evaluated (Table I). In the crystallographic MsbA structure, we found 13 residue pairs involved in the interaction between the NBD and the ICD1 of the TMD (note that this represents only a part of the actual contact regions since portions of ICD2 and of the NBD are not resolved in this structure). Respectively 9 and 7 of these 13 residue pairs are either conserved or replaced by homologous residue pairs in the 2 P-gp halves. This is a strong indication that the interface between the TMD and the NBD and therefore their relative topology are conserved between MsbA and P-gp.Table IConservation of the TMD-NBD interface between MsbA and P-gpSide-chain contact in MsbAaIdentified as indicated in “Experimental Procedures.”P-gp N-terminal halfP-gp C-terminal halfEquivalent residue pairbResidues that correspond to those of the MsbA pair in the alignment with P-gp.Conservation statuscConserved: both residues are identical in MsbA and P-gp: homologous: both residues are of the same type in MsbA and P-gp.Equivalent residue pairConservation statusR102-E443K149-E493HomologousY790-S1037F105-Y439F152-Y490ConservedF793-Y1033ConservedM109-R493M156-R543ConservedL797-R1188HomologousF115-H427W162-V478W803-I1121F116-L421F163-V472HomologousF804-I1115HomologousK118-L428V165-L479D806-L1127Q119-S423H166-S474HomologousN809-S1117HomologousQ119-N425H166-E476HomologousN809-E1119HomologousQ119-V428H166-P477N809-P1020L124-L314L171-L479ConservedL814-L1177ConservedI128-F429L175-F480HomologousL818-F1123HomologousK328-E330I375-S381I1018-E1024D329-K332D376-H383HomologousD1019-L1026a Identified as indicated in “Experimental Procedures.”b Residues that correspond to those of the MsbA pair in the alignment with P-gp.c Conserved: both residues are identical in MsbA and P-gp: homologous: both residues are of the same type in MsbA and P-gp. Open table in a new tab These data indicate that the three-dimensional structure of each P-gp half is similar to that of the MsbA monomer (excluding a few insertions of limited length, see below). We have also investigated whether the association of the 2 P-gp halves is comparable to the MsbA dimer. As shown in Fig. 2A, the open dimer structure of MsbA mainly involves interactions between residues of TM2 of each monomer and TM5 and TM6 of the other monomer. A few mutual interactions between the EC1 and EC3 loops of each monomer also contribute. Fig. 2B shows alignments of the corresponding regions for representative sequences of several subfamilies of known or putative lipid-drug bacterial and eukaryotic ABC transporters (which all carry the above mentioned intracellular sequence motif). It appears that no exact conservation of specific residues occurs among transporters in these regions. Surprisingly, such absence of exact residue conservation is current even between MsbA and YvcC, which both possess the same open dimer structure (11Chami M. Steinfels E. Orelle C. Jault J.M. Di Pietro A. Rigaud J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), as well as between MsbA and ValA, which have a similar function (28McDonald M.K. Cowley S.C. Nano F.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the characteristic interactions of the open dimer structure are not dependent on exact conserved sequence motifs. On the other hand, among transporter types, there is a definite trend toward conservation of two types of homologous residue: hydrophobic (aromatic or aliphatic) residues and small size residues (Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Pro). For all sequences, the involved regions of the TM helices are characterized by groups of hydrophobic residues separated by small side-chain residues. Recent studies indicate that such motifs are involved in the association of TM helices (34Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 35Eilers M. Shekar S.C. Shieh T. Smith S.O. Fleming P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore for each transporter type these sequence stretches appear highly conserved among homologous sequences (i.e. between 78 and 100%). This suggests (without proving it) that for each transporter, including P-gp, these regions may be involved in similar interactions, namely association of the 2 transporter halves into an open structure as in MsbA.Fig. 2Structure and conservation of the MsbA monomer-monomer interface. A, Cα trace representation of the MsBA dimer emphasizing the monomer-monomer interface. The two monomers are in light and dark gray.

These data also suggest that the MsbA open dimer structure may be also valid for P-gp. As a consequence, it seems justified to attempt to predict the three-dimensional structure of P-gp by homology modeling using the MsbA crystallographic structure as a template. Several regions of the P-gp sequence cannot be modeled from the MsbA PDB coordinates. First, three regions of the MsbA structure are not resolved in the crystallographic structure. These include a part of the ICD2 region of the TMD as well as two regions in the NBD. In addition, there are several insertion stretches in the P-gp sequence that have no counterpart in the MsbA sequence and structure, including parts of the EC1 and EC4 regions. The missing regions of the NBD were taken from the crystallographic structure of the highly homologous NBD domain of the ABC transporter TAP1 (32Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch Ozcurumez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) (TAP1 was chosen because its NBD has the highest homology and the closest secondary structure to those of P-gp). For this purpose the TAP1 NBD was aligned with that of the MsbA NBD. While we have performed this structural alignment manually, it appears to be very similar to the automatically generated alignment between MsbA and the HisP NBD domain shown in (15Jones P.M.

Among the two major forms of diabetes, type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90% of the affected population. The incidence of type 2 diabetes is highly related to obesity. To find novel proteins potentially involved in obesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, a functional expression screen was performed to search for genes that negatively regulate insulin signaling. Specifically, a reporter system comprised of the PEPCK promoter upstream of alkaline phosphatase was used in a hepatocyte cell-based assay to screen an expression cDNA library for genes that reverse insulin-induced repression of PEPCK transcription. The cDNA library used in this study was derived from the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice, which are highly insulin-resistant. The mitogen-activated dual specificity protein kinase phosphatase 4 (MKP-4) was identified as a candidate gene in this screen. Here we show that MKP-4 is expressed in insulin-responsive tissues and that the expression levels are up-regulated in obese insulin-resistant rodent models. Heterologous expression of MKP-4 in preadipocytes significantly blocked insulin-induced adipogenesis, and overexpression of MKP-4 in adipocytes inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Our data suggest that MKP-4 negatively regulates insulin signaling and, consequently, may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.

Our data suggest that MKP-4 negatively regulates insulin signaling and, consequently, may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is growing as a major public health problem in the United States and other industrialized countries (1Bennet P. Rifkin H. Porter Jr., D. Diabetes Mellitus. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1990: 357-377Google Scholar). The rapid increase in the number of people diagnosed with the disease has triggered more interest in finding novel and better therapeutic agents (2Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disease with complicated etiology. Although significant progress has been made in the identification of genes that contribute to the disease, many pieces of the puzzle are still missing. Insulin resistance, characterized by elevated circulating insulin levels and impaired glucose tolerance, usually precedes Type 2 diabetes. Whether an individual with insulin resistance ultimately develops diabetes depends on the secretion capacity of pancreatic β cells (3Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Drugs aiming to stimulate insulin secretion can improve hyperglycemia but only work on patients with relatively mild dysfunction (4Lebovitz H.E. LeRoith D. Taylor S. Diabetes Mellitus, a Fundamental and Clinical Text. Second Ed. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 769-778Google Scholar). Improving insulin sensitivity promises a preferable approach to treat diabetes. Insulin is an anabolic hormone that controls many aspects of metabolism. The MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, mitogen-activated dual specificity protein kinase phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; AP, alkaline phosphatase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PTP-1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B. kinase cascade and the PI3-kinase pathway are two of the signaling networks activated by insulin upon binding to its receptor. The activation of ERK by insulin seems to play a major role in insulin-mediated mitogenesis, whereas PI3-kinase has been implicated as a major key player of the metabolic arm. Defects in the insulin-stimulated metabolic cascade lead to insulin resistance. Therefore, to identify additional genes involved in negatively regulating insulin-stimulated metabolic pathway(s), we employed an expression cloning approach using the promoter of the phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase gene (PEPCK) placed upstream of secreted alkaline phosphatase as a surrogate reporter system for the metabolic effects of insulin. The action of insulin modifies the activity of a multitude of proteins within minutes and regulates expression of about 100 genes in a matter of hours (5Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B- Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Among the genes regulated by insulin, the expression of PEPCK, a key enzyme in hepatic gluconeogenesis, has been studied most extensively (6O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). There has been no evidence to support post-translational modification or allosteric activation of PEPCK by insulin, and transcriptional regulation is thought to be the only way by which insulin regulates PEPCK levels (5Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B- Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PEPCK promoter is an ideal tool in a functional screening to reflect transcriptional changes in response to insulin stimulation. Furthermore, it has been shown that insulin-mediated repression of PEPCK transcription can be completely blocked by wortmannin (a PI3-kinase inhibitor), indicating the essential role of PI3-kinase in this pathway (8Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the other hand, kinase inhibitors and dominant-negative mutants of ERK pathway, which block insulin mitogenic signaling, had no effect on insulin-mediated PEPCK promoter repression (9Sutherland C. Waltner-Law M. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3198-3204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of PEPCK transcription by insulin seems to use the same signaling pathways involved in insulin-mediated metabolic effects. Our hypothesis is that genes blocking the inhibitory effect of insulin on PEPCK transcription are also likely to attenuate the metabolic signaling pathway(s) elicited by insulin. Using this approach, we identified mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 4 (MKP-4), a dual specificity protein phosphatase (11Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), as a candidate gene involved in the negative regulation of insulin signaling. Further experiments in this study provide supporting evidence for a role of MKP-4 in the regulation of other insulin-mediated metabolic effects such as adipocyte differentiation and glucose uptake. This is the first time that a dual specificity protein phosphatase has been implicated in insulin resistance. Cells and Reagents—The rat hepatoma cell line H4IIE was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For the PEPCK promoter assay, H4IIE cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum as well as a mixture of 100 μm cAMP, 1 μm dexamethasone, and/or 10 nm insulin, as indicated in the figures. The 3T3-F442A cell line was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). For differentiation, 3T3-F442A cells were switched to DMEM supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone). Cells were first induced with a mixture of 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl methylxanthine for 3 days and then maintained in 5 μg/ml insulin until they fully differentiated into adipocytes. Construction of the Reporter Construct and cDNA Library—The PEPCK promoter (–548 to +73) (12Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified from rat genomic DNA and cloned upstream of the placental alkaline phosphatase coding sequence (13Millan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3112-3115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the pMet7 vector. For the cDNA library construction, RNA was extracted from the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice and reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT). The cDNAs were then cloned into the pMet7 expression vector. Transfection of H4IIE Cells—Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (1:5 dilution from a confluent 10-cm dish) 1 day prior to transfection. Fresh medium (DMEM/5% fetal calf serum) was added 5 h prior to transfection. The following day, the PEPCK reporter construct (0.156 μg/well) was co-transfected with dominant-negative p85 (DNp85) or single cDNA clones from the white adipose library (0.125 μg/well) into H4IIE cells using FuGene 6 (0.38 μl/well) (Roche Applied Science). Medium was then exchanged, the following morning, to DMEM/0.5% fetal calf serum. Stimulants and/or inhibitors were added 5 h later, as indicated in the figures, and incubated for 16 h. Then, medium was collected on the following day and assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—The medium was collected from transfected H4IIE cells and spun down to remove floating cells. The samples were heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 30 min. The Great EscAPE kit (Clontech) was used to detect the alkaline phosphatase activity in conditioned medium. The samples were read on the Wallac Luminometer (Dynex Tech). Construction of Expression Vectors and Establishment of Cell Lines Stably Expressing MKP-4 —The full-length cDNA of mouse MKP-4 was cloned into a retroviral vector expressing the puromycin resistance gene. The retroviral expression vectors were transfected into a packaging cell line Bosc23 (14Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) by the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen). Forty-eight h after transfection, the conditioned medium containing retrovirus was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. The viral supernatant was then used to infect the recipient 3T3-F442A cells, which were seeded 24 h before infection (15Xu H. Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26287-26295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation, cells were fed with fresh medium, and puromycin was added at the concentration of 5 μg/ml for selection and subsequent maintenance. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA samples were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Following denaturation, RNAs were loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde. After electrophoresis, RNAs were transferred to a Biotran membrane (ICN), UV cross-linked, and baked at 80 °C for 1 h. Hybridization with [α32P[dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-labeled cDNA probes and subsequent washings were done as described previously (16Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6193) Google Scholar). Photographs of ethidium bromide gels were presented for loading adjustment. Glucose Uptake—For glucose uptake experiments, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were infected with adenovirus expressing MKP-4 or vector control on 24-well plates. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to insulin stimulation. Cells were then washed three times with Krebs Ringers Henseleit buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and incubated in 1 ml of Krebs Ringers Henseleit ± insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. Glucose uptake was initiated by the addition of 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H] glucose (1 μci/ml) for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by immediately removing the medium and washing cell monolayers four times with cold Krebs Ringers Henseleit. Cells were then removed in 0.15 ml of 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Identification of MKP-4 —As a Negative Regulator of Insulin Signaling—Individual clones of a cDNA expression library derived from the white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice were co-transfected with a PEPCK promoter (–600 bp) construct into H4IIE cells, an insulin-responsive rat hepatoma cell line (17Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The PEPCK promoter was placed upstream of the secreted alkaline phosphatase (PEPCKp600-SEAP). It is well known that dexamethasone and cAMP strongly stimulate transcription of the PEPCK gene, whereas insulin shuts down the PEPCK gene expression exclusively at transcription level (6O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The 600-bp PEPCK promoter used in this study contains an insulin response unit, a glucocorticoid response unit, and a cAMP response unit (7Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Using the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) as a reporter gene, the rate of transcription is reflected by the activity of AP in the conditioned media. Complementary DNA clones that resulted in high AP activity even in the presence of insulin were selected and confirmed in secondary assays. As a positive control, a dominant-negative form of the regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase, p85 (DNp85) (18Jascur T. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was cotransfected with PEPCKp600-SEAP. The mutant p85 rescued AP activity to ∼50% of the control level in the presence of insulin (Fig. 1). The control level was defined as AP activity stimulated by dexamethasone plus cAMP in the absence of insulin. About 10,000 clones were screened using this system. This study describes the identification of one of the cDNA clones, which reproducibly restored AP activity to a similar extent when compared with the DNp85 (Fig. 1). Follow-up sequence analysis revealed that this clone is the mouse orthologue of human MKP-4 (11Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A.

MKP-4 belongs to the dual specificity protein phosphatase family and was originally identified as a phosphatase that blocks activation of the MAP kinase signaling cascade. Human and mouse MKP-4 sequences have been previously reported (11Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

The sequence identity is 94% between human and rat MKP-4 at the amino acid level and 83% between human and mouse MKP-4 (Fig. 2). The relative lower homology between human and mouse MKP-4 is due to the presence of a 67-residue repetitive sequence, which is present in the N terminus of the mouse enzyme (the insert is 63 residues in the literature (19Dickinson R.J. Williams D.J. Slack D.N. Williamson J. Seternes O.M. Keyse S.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)), absent in the human orthologue, but partially present in the rat orthologue. Since the 67-residue repetitive sequence is also present in genomic DNA, it is unlikely to be an artifact of cloning. It remains to be determined why the repetitive sequence exists in the mouse and rat genome.Fig. 2Amino acid homology among orthologues of MKP-4.

Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, no information was available regarding the expression of MKP-4 in adipose tissue. Therefore, the expression of MKP-4 was examined in various murine tissues including the white and brown adipose tissues. Mouse MKP-4 was only detectable in white adipose tissue, kidney, and testis (Fig. 3A). The adipose expression of this gene was also confirmed in multiple human fat samples (data not shown). To determine the source of MKP-4 signal in adipose tissue, white fat was separated into stromal-vascular cells and adipocytes. The expression of MKP-4 was predominantly in the adipocyte fraction (Fig. 3B), indicating that it is an adipocyte gene. The expression of MKP-4 was also determined in a cultured preadipocyte cell line 3T3-F442A. The expression level of this gene was low in preadipocytes but up-regulated during adipogenesis (Fig. 3C), indicating a role for MKP4 in mature adipocytes. To understand the physiological relevance of this dual specificity phosphatase in obesity and insulin resistance, the MKP-4 expression was examined in insulin-responsive tissues of several rodent obesity models. The expression level of MKP-4 was significantly increased in the white adipose tissue of ob/ob, db/db, and diet-induced rodent obesity models (Fig. 4, top panels, lanes 1–8). In the lean mice on regular diet, MKP-4 was undetectable in brown adipose tissue, liver, and muscle. In the obese state, however, MKP-4 could be detected in each of these tissues (Fig. 4, top right panel, lanes 9–12; bottom left panel, lanes 1–8). Although MKP-4 was also expressed in kidney and testes, no regulation was observed in the above rodent obesity models (Fig. 4, bottom panels, lanes 9–16), suggesting that the up-regulation of MKP-4 is specific to insulin-responsive tissues. Since liver, muscle, white adipose tissue, and brown adipose tissue express high levels of insulin receptor and play important roles in insulin sensitivity, the up-regulation of MKP-4 in insulin-responsive tissues indicates a potential role for MKP-4 in insulin signaling and in obesity-related insulin resistance.Fig. 4Regulation of MKP-4 in rodent obesity models. The expression of MKP-4 RNA in white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), muscle, liver, kidney, and testes was examined in ob/ob, db/db, and diet-induced obese mice. The expression of MKP-4 protein was examined in white adipose tissue of ob/ob, db/db, and diet-induced obese mice. Ob/ob mice, db/db mice, and wild type (WT) littermate controls were 15-week-old males in C57BL/6J background. The diet-induced obese mice and lean controls were 24-week-old males in the same background and were on either high fat diet (HFD, 45% kcal derived from fat) or low fat control diet (10% kcal derived from fat) for 20 weeks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MKP-4 in Adipocyte Function—To further understand the role of MKP-4 in adipocyte biology, MKP-4 was stably expressed in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes by a retroviral approach. Then, the cells were induced to differentiate by either insulin alone or a mixture of insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine. The experiment was terminated when more than 90% of control vector-expressing cells induced by the mixture fully differentiated into adipocytes, which is 7 days after induction. Cells stably expressing MKP-4 differentiated poorly under both induction conditions as shown by oil red O staining (Fig. 5A). This experiment indicates that MKP-4 has an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis under both conditions. The differentiation was quantificated by the percentage of cells stained positive by oil red O with vector-expressing cells arbitrarily set as 100% (Fig. 5B, bottom graph). MKP-4-expressing cells treated with the full mixture did not fully differentiate when kept up to 2 weeks after induction (data not shown). To study the effect of MKP-4 on adipogenesis at the molecular level, two adipocyte differentiation marker genes were examined by Taqman analysis. As shown in Fig. 5B, the expression levels of both glut4 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ were significantly reduced in MKP-4-expressing cells when compared with control cells. The fact that MKP-4 has the ability to inhibit insulin-stimulated adipocyte differentiation prompted more interest in this gene. Since MKP-4 was expressed at higher levels in white adipose when compared with other peripheral insulin-responsive tissues and was also significantly up-regulated in obesity, it might have an impact on adipose glucose disposal. To explore the role of MKP-4 in insulin resistance, glucose uptake experiments were performed using fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing MKP-4. Mature adipocytes were infected by adenovirus expressing either MKP-4 or GFP for 48 h. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was measured 72 h after infection. The capability of adipocytes to take up glucose was blunted about 30% by MKP-4 overexpression when compared with GFP-expressing control cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that elevated MKP-4 plays a role in reducing insulin-regulated glucose disposal. A functional expression cloning approach was applied to identify genes that may play a role in insulin resistance in this specific study. Complementary DNA clones from the insulin-resistant adipose tissue of ob/ob mice were screened. As a result of this screen, MKP-4, a dual specificity protein phosphatase, was found to block insulin signaling in this system. This phosphatase belongs to the MKP family, which leads to the down-regulation of MAPK signaling cascades by dephosphorylating critical tyrosine and serine/threonine residues on MAPKs (20Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that a member of the MKP family inhibits insulin-mediated repression of the PEPCK promoter since complete blockage of ERK-mediated signaling, with kinase inhibitors and dominant negatives, has no effect on PEPCK gene expression (9Sutherland C. Waltner-Law M. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3198-3204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to the ERK pathway, recent studies showed that the stress-induced P38 pathway can also be activated by insulin (21Somwar R. Perreault M. Kapur S. Taha C. Sweeney G. Ramlal T. Kim D.Y. Keen J. Cote C.H. Klip A. Marette A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, P38 is involved in ATF-2-mediated induction of PEPCK transcription (22Cheong J. Coligan J.E. Shuman J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22714-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). MKP-4 has been reported to inactivate both ERK and P38, whereas its effect on JNK remains controversial (11Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Dickinson R.J. Williams D.J. Slack D.N. Williamson J. Seternes O.M. Keyse S.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since both P38 and MKP-4 are capable of enhancing PEPCK transcription, it is unlikely that MKP-4 blocks insulin-mediated repression on PEPCK promoter by inactivating P38. It is well known that a PI3-kinase-dependent pathway is required for repression of PEPCK transcription by insulin. These data suggest that MKP-4 is involved in dephosphorylating kinase components in the insulin-induced metabolic cascade. This piece of evidence demonstrates that the MAP kinase pathway can cross-talk with the metabolic pathway. Further studies are necessary to identify the substrates of MKP-4 in insulin-mediated metabolic responses. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a dual specificity phosphatase has been implicated in insulin resistance. Previous work in the field was focused extensively on protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Among the protein-tyrosine phosphatases that attenuate the insulin signaling pathway, PTP-1B is the most extensively characterized and well validated, whereas the role of leukocyte antigen-related protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LAR) remains controversial (23Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The major impact site of PTP-1B is known to be in liver, and overexpression of PTP-1B in adipocytes did not affect glucose uptake (25Venable C.L. Frevert E.U. Kim Y.B. Fischer B.M. Kamatkar S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that MKP-4 might be a major phosphatase involved in adipose insulin resistance since it is expressed and up-regulated in adipose tissue of several rodent obesity models. Furthermore, MKP-4 can blunt insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes, which supports our hypothesis. In addition, MKP-4 is undetectable in other insulin-responsive tissues under normal circumstances but becomes detectable in brown adipose tissue, liver, and muscle of obese mice, indicating that MKP-4 might also attenuate insulin signaling in other insulin-responsive tissues in the obese state. The mitogen activated dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatase family has nine members (20Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). These phosphatases have distinct tissue distribution patterns and different substrate preferences. The closest homologues of MKP-4 are MKP-3 and MKP-X, sharing sequence identity of 56 and 61%, respectively, at the amino acid level. In fact, MKP-3 was also identified as a weaker candidate gene during the functional expression screen. The appearance of two dual specificity phosphatases in our screen indicates the involvement of a new class of phosphatases in insulin action and insulin resistance. When compared with tyrosine phosphatases, which only dephosphorylate tyrosine residues, dual specificity phosphatases also dephosphorylate serine/threonine residues. One feature of this class of protein phosphatases is that they contain both a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain, whereas PTP-1B is comprised only of a catalytic domain, which is constitutively active. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 on serine residues has been proposed as a mechanism for inducing IRS1 degradation as well as reducing the tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptor (26Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 27Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It remains to be studied whether dual specificity phosphatases such as MKP-4 have any effect on IRS1 serine/threonine phosphorylation. Future loss-of-function studies may further define the role of MKP-4 in insulin resistance in vivo. If confirmed to be an important regulator in obesity-related insulin resistance, MKP-4 presents a new molecular target for pharmaceutical intervention to improve systemic insulin sensitivity.

Lorico A. Fodstad O. Sartorelli A.C. Oncol. Res. 2000; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). So far, the therapeutic use of aminocoumarin antibiotics is limited due to their low solubility in water, toxicity in eukaryotes, and poor penetration in Gram-negative bacteria (7Maxwell A. Mol.

Severin K. Heide L. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); (b) the removal of acetyl-CoA from the side chain of 4-coumaroyl-CoA by an oxidative reaction mechanism, analogous to the β-oxidation of fatty acids, resulting in 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (12Löscher R.

In novobiocin biosynthesis, feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors showed that 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and tyrosine are efficiently incorporated into Ring A (10Li S.-M. Hennig S.

The aminocoumarin moiety of novobiocin (Ring B) is formed from tyrosine via the intermediate β-hydroxytyrosyl-S-NovH. Chen and Walsh (17Chen H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggested that Ring A may also be formed from this intermediate, following the reaction mechanism shown in Fig. 2A, i.e. by a retroaldol reaction to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, oxidation to the acid and prenylation. 3-Prenylation of 4HB has a well-established precedent in ubiquinone biosynthesis (18Melzer M. Heide L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of the biosynthetic gene clusters of novobiocin, clorobiocin, and coumermycin A1 (Fig. 1B) (19Pojer F. Li S.-M. Heide L. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3901-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) first appeared to support this hypothesis. Three genes were identified in the novobiocin and clorobiocin clusters for which no homologues existed in the coumermycin cluster. We speculated that these genes might be involved in the biosynthesis of Ring A (which is absent in coumermycin A1). These genes were: (a) cloR and novR, which showed sequence similarity to putative aldolases; CloR was indeed shown to be involved in Ring A biosynthesis by a gene inactivation experiment (19Pojer F. Li S.-M. Heide L. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3901-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); (b) cloF and novF, which show sequence similarities to dehydrogenases; and (c) cloQ and novQ, which did not show sequence similarities to known genes in the data base. We recently confirmed that CloQ codes for a prenyltransferase (20Pojer F. Wemakor E. Kammerer B. Chen H. Walsh C.T. Li S.-M. Heide L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The substrate of this enzyme, however, was none of the intermediates discussed above but, rather, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP, Fig. 2B). The product of the reaction, i.e. 3-dimethylallyl-4HPP, was easily degraded to 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3DMA-4HBAL), suggesting a biosynthesis of Ring A by the mechanism depicted in Fig. 2B, i.e. via oxidation of 3DMA-4HBAL to the corresponding acid. In the present study, we investigated the conversion of 3DMA-4HPP to Ring A and the role of CloR in this reaction sequence. Unexpectedly, the results showed that the biosynthesis of Ring A follows neither of the two mechanisms depicted in Fig. 2. Rather, the conversion of 3DMA-4HPP to Ring A proceeds in two oxidative decarboxylation steps, via 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxymandelic acid (3DMA-4HMA) as intermediate, and is catalyzed by the bifunctional non-heme iron oxygenase CloR. This represents a new pathway for the formation of benzoic acids in nature.

Chem. 1986; 51: 4481-4483Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ring A (3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid) was prepared as described previously (22Kominek L.A. Meyer H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Oxygen (18O2; 99%) was purchased from Campro Scientific (Berlin, Germany). DNA Manipulation—DNA manipulations and standard genetic techniques in Escherichia coli were carried out as described by Sambrook and Russell (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using a NucleoSpin 2 in 1 extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Isolation of plasmids was carried out with ion-exchange columns (Nucleobond AX kit, Macherey-Nagel). Cloning of cloR—For construction of the plasmid cloR-pGEX4T1, cloR was amplified using the primers cloR-Nterm-BamHI (5′-AGGTGCCCGGGATCCAAGGCTTTGGCGAAC-3′) and cloR-Cterm-XhoI (5′-TCGGCACTCGAGCCTTGCCAGGGCGGGCGTTTG-3′). Introduced restriction sites are underlined. The product was digested with BamHI and XhoI, gel purified and ligated into the same site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to give cloR-pGEX4T1. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for overexpression of CloR as GST (glutathione S-transferase)-tagged protein. Overexpression and Purification of CloR Protein—E. coli BL21(DE3)/cloR-pGEX4T1 cells were grown in 100 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 15 °C until an A 600 of 0.6 was reached (∼20 h). IPTG was added to a final concentration of 250 μm. After 24 h at 15 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 5,000 × g) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme (76,344 units/mg, Fluka). Resuspended cells were broken by sonification (Branson sonifier, 10-min sonification). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min at 20,000 × g). Purification of CloR as a GST fusion protein and subsequent cleavage of the GST tag by thrombin treatment were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and the batch method. Overexpression and Purification of CloQ—Construction of vector cloQ-pGEX4T1, overexpression in E. coli BL21(DE3), and purification of CloQ were carried out as described in Pojer et al. (20Pojer F. Wemakor E. Kammerer B. Chen H. Walsh C.T. Li S.-M. Heide L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Standard protein techniques were used as described in previous studies (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar, 25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of native CloR was determined by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column that has been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with dextran blue 2000 (2000 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences). Incubation of Holo-CloR with CloQ Reaction Products—3DMA-4HPP, the substrate for CloR reaction, was obtained by incubating CloQ with 4HPP and DMAPP as described in Pojer et al. (20Pojer F. Wemakor E. Kammerer B. Chen H. Walsh C.T. Li S.-M. Heide L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mm 4HPP, 0.5 mm DMAPP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and purified CloQ, was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. This reaction produces about 7.5 nmol of 3DMA-4HPP. Holo-CloR was reconstituted by preincubation of apo-CloR (∼4 μg) with 1 mm FeSO4 for 20 min at room temperature. Reaction conditions for the incubation of holo-CloR with 3DMA-4HPP were as described for HmaS (26Hubbard B.K. Thomas M.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27Choroba O.W. Williams D.H. Spencer J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5389-5390Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction (150 μl) contained 50 μl of the CloQ reaction mixture (final concentration of 3DMA-4HPP, ∼50 μm), 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 25 mm ascorbic acid, and 4 μg of holo-CloR. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with 5 μl of formic acid. Product formation was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at 277 nm (absorption maximum for 4-hydroxymandelic acid) with a Multosphere RP18-5 column (250 × 4 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A linear gradient of acetonitrile (25–75%) in 1% aqueous formic acid was used. A control incubation was carried out with denaturated holo-CloR. For incubation of holo-CloR with other substrates, 0.5 mm of the respective substrate (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, β-hydroxytyrosine, 4-hydroxymandelic acid, d-mandelate, l-mandelate, or 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid) were used instead of 3DMA-4HPP, and analysis was carried out by HPLC at 254 nm with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–100%) in 1% aqueous formic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Control incubations were carried out with denaturated holo-CloR. CloQ was also incubated with 4-hydroxymandelic acid or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and DMAPP as described in Pojer et al. (20Pojer F. Wemakor E. Kammerer B. Chen H. Walsh C.T. Li S.-M. Heide L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Isolation of 3-Dimethylallyl-4-hydroxymandelic Acid—The incubation mixture (1 ml) contained 500 μl of CloQ reaction product (∼75 nmol of 3DMA-4HPP), 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 25 mm ascorbic acid, and ∼40 μg of holo-CloR and was incubated for1hat30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of formic acid and extracted twice with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. After evaporation, the residue was dissolved in 150 μl of ethanol. 3DMA-4HMA was isolated by HPLC as described above, and its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Reactions in the Presence of 18O 2 —Two flasks, one containing enzymatically produced 3DMA-4HPP (see above) and one containing holo-CloR reaction mixture (see above) were degassed by application of a vacuum and flushed with argon for three times. The anaerobic holo-CloR solution was transferred to the substrate vial containing 3DMA-4HPP. The argon was removed by application of a vacuum, and finally 18O2 was allowed to enter into the flask. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with formic acid and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (TSQ Quantum, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) in negative ion mode. A linear gradient of acetonitrile (25–75%) in 0.1% aqueous formic acid was used. In a parallel 18O2 labeling experiment, 3DMA-4HMA (isolated as described above) was used as substrate instead of 3DMA-4HPP. Sequence Analysis of CloR and NovR—The gene cloR from the clorobiocin cluster and the corresponding gene novR from the novobiocin cluster (Fig. 1B) encode proteins of 277 and 270 amino acids, respectively, and show 95% identity between each other (GenBank™ accession numbers AAN65240 and AAF67511, respectively). A data base search revealed sequence similarity to class II aldolases, which are represented, e.g., by l-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (28Dreyer M.K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and l-rhamnose-1-phosphate aldolase (29Kroemer M. Schulz G.E. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and to the structurally related l-ribulose-5-phosphate-4-epimerase (30Luo Y. Samuel J. Mosimann S.C. Lee J.E. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14763-14771Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These enzymes contain a catalytic zinc residue in their active center and are involved in the catabolism of sugars in E. coli. cloR is transcriptionally coupled to the gene cloQ (accession number: AF329398), which encodes the aromatic prenyltransferase involved in Ring A formation (20Pojer F. Wemakor E. Kammerer B. Chen H. Walsh C.T. Li S.-M. Heide L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The same situation is found in the novobiocin cluster for the corresponding genes novQ and novR (accession number: AF170880). Expression and Purification of CloR—We decided to express CloR as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein rather than as an His-tagged protein, because CloR showed sequence similarity to class II aldolases, and these enzymes require zinc for there activity (31Dreyer M.K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A purification using the His-tagged protein can lead to a complete loss of the aldolase activity due to interactions between the hexahistidyl tag and the metal ion (Zn2+). E. coli cells harboring CloR expression constructs yielded only insoluble protein when grown at temperatures of 20 °C or higher. To obtain soluble CloR-GST fusion protein, cells were cultured at 15 °C and induced with 250 μm IPTG. After purification, GST was cleaved from CloR by thrombin treatment and removed. This procedure resulted in apparently homogenous CloR protein as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The molecular mass observed in SDS corresponded to the calculated mass of the protein (30.5 kDa). A protein yield of 1 mg of pure CloR per liter of culture was obtained. By using gel chromatography, the molecular mass of native CloR was determined as 124.5 kDa showing that the protein was tetrameric in solution. Characterization of the Reaction Products of the CloR Reaction—To investigate the catalytic activity of CloR, we first produced 3DMA-4HPP (Fig. 2B), the putative substrate of CloR, by incubation of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP) with DMAPP and the prenyltransferase CloQ. Subsequently, CloR and different cofactors, e.g. Zn2+ and NADH (32Wehmeier U.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 197: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were added to the reaction mixture. However, no formation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3DMA-4HBAL) or Ring A could be detected by HPLC. A more sensitive analysis using a radioactive assay with 4HPP and [1-14C]DMAPP as substrates, however, revealed the presence of a small amount of a new radioactive compound (termed product X), with a retention time of 11.1 min in HPLC (Ring A, 16.7 min; 3DMA-4HBAL, 20.7 min; and 3DMA-4HPP, 18.4 min) (data not shown). This product was absent if heat-denaturated CloR was used, or if 4HPP or DMAPP were omitted from the prenylation assay. This indicated that the new metabolite X was derived enzymatically from 3DMA-4HPP. In the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin in Amycolatopsis orientalis, 4HPP is converted to 4-hydroxymandelic acid under catalysis of the non-heme iron dioxygenase HmaS (= ORF21) (26Hubbard B.K. Thomas M.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27Choroba O.W. Williams D.H. Spencer J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5389-5390Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As described by Hubbard et al. (26Hubbard B.K. Thomas M.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), HmaS and similar enzymes need to be activated by preincubation with an excess of Fe2+ immediately before incubation and Fe3+, generated by oxidation, has to be reduced to Fe2+ by ascorbic acid to maintain an active enzyme. Although CloR did not show sequence similarity to HmaS or other non-heme iron-dependent enzymes, we decided to test CloR under similar conditions. After preincubation of CloR for 20 min with 1 mm FeSO4, ascorbic acid and enzymatically generated 3DMA-4HPP were added. After incubation for 1 h, the products of the reaction were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, formation of the new product X was ∼15-fold higher than in the absence of Fe2+ and ascorbate. Furthermore, an additional product was detected that showed the same retention time as an authentic Ring A standard. LC-MS-MS analysis in comparison with an authentic reference compound confirmed that this latter product was indeed Ring A (m/z: 205, 161, 150, 106). When product X was isolated by HPLC and incubated with holo-CloR in the presence of ascorbic acid, again the formation of Ring A was clearly demonstrated by LC-MS-MS analysis (data not shown), proving that product X was an intermediate in the formation of Ring A. LC-MS-MS analysis of product X revealed that this compound showed the calculated mass ([M-H]– = 235) of 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxymandelic acid (3DMA-4HMA). Furthermore, it showed the characteristic fragmentation pattern of a 4-hydroxymandelic acid derivative (m/z: 235 [M-1]–, 191 [M-44]–, and 189 [M-46]–); the same pattern was observed from an authentic 4-hydroxymandelic acid (m/z: 167 [M-1]–, 123 [M-44]–, and 121 [M-46]–). Therefore, CloR catalyzes two consecutive reactions (Fig. 4): first, the conversion of 3DMA-4HPP to 3DMA-4-hydroxymandelic acid (3DMA-4HMA), and second, the conversion of 3DMA-4HMA to 3DMA-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, i.e. Ring A. CloR was found to be specific for 3DMA-4HPP and 3DMA-4HMA as substrates. No product formation was observed with the non-prenylated substrates 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate or dl-4-hydroxymandelic acid, nor with d-mandelic acid, l-mandelic acid, β-hydroxytyrosine, or 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid. Additional experiments confirmed that the prenyltransferase CloQ (20Pojer F. Wemakor E. Kammerer B. Chen H. Walsh C.T. Li S.-M. Heide L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) specifically prenylated 4HPP and was not able to react with dl-4-hydroxymandelic acid or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (data not shown). Replacement of Fe2+ with other monovalent or divalent metal ions (1 mm Cu+, Zn2+, Mg2+, orMn2+) resulted in almost complete (95–98%) loss of enzymatic activity of CloR, as described previously for non-heme iron oxygenases (33Que Jr., L. Ho R.Y. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2607-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Many non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases require, besides Fe2+, an α-ketoacid as cofactor, e.g. α-ketoglutaric acid (27Choroba O.W. Williams D.H. Spencer J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5389-5390Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the activity of CloR was not stimulated by addition of α-ketoglutarate. Purified CloR was a colorless protein. UV-visible spectrometry showed an absorption maximum at 283 nm but no absorption in the visual range. Therefore, CloR is not a heme protein, as are, e.g., the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Investigation of the Reaction Mechanism of CloR—The requirement of CloR for Fe2+ and ascorbate suggested that it belongs to the non-heme iron oxygenases (33Que Jr., L. Ho R.Y. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2607-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 34Serre L. Sailland A. Sy D. Boudec P. Rolland A. Pebay-Peyroula E. Cohen-Addad C. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 977-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To confirm whether indeed molecular oxygen was the substrate of the CloR reaction, and whether one or both oxygen atoms of O2 were incorporated into the product, we carried out isotope-labeling experiments with 18O2. Incorporation of the label was analyzed by LC-MS-MS analysis In the first experiment, CloR (after preincubation with Fe2+) was incubated with 3DMA-4HPP and ascorbate in an 18O2 atmosphere. A control incubation was carried out in the usual 16O2 atmosphere. The reaction products 3DMA-4HMA and 3DMA-4HB were separated by HPLC and analyzed by MS-MS analysis. Fig. 5A shows the molecular ions obtained in a usual atmosphere and in 18O2 atmosphere. Unlabeled 3DMA-4HMA showed the molecular ion at [M-H]– = 235. In contrast, most of the 3DMA-4HMA produced under the 18O2 atmosphere showed the molecular ion at [M-H]– = 239, proving the incorporation of two 18O atoms. The position of the label was revealed by MS-MS analysis: the decarboxylation product (m/z = 193) was 46 Da smaller than the parent compound, proving that one of the 18O atoms had been incorporated into the carboxyl group of 3DMA-4HMA. Both the direct decarboxylation product (m/z = 193) and the corresponding keto compound arising from oxidation (m/z = 191) were 2 Da larger than the corresponding ions of the unlabeled 3DMA-4HMA, indicating that the other 18O2 had been incorporated into the α-hydroxyl group. For the molecular ion of 3DMA-4HMA, also a minor peak at [M-H]– = 237 was detected (Fig. 5A), resulting from the incorporation of a single 18O atom into the product. This shows a certain dilution of the label and has been reported previously for HmaS as well as for other non-heme iron oxygenases (27Choroba O.W. Williams D.H. Spencer J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5389-5390Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This dilution has been suggested to result from an exchange of a presumed FeIV=O intermediate with water (27Choroba O.W. Williams D.H. Spencer J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5389-5390Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The product mixture also contained some unlabeled 3DMA-4HMA ([M-H]– = 235), most likely due to the presence of residual 16O2 in the incubation vial. In addition to 3DMA-4HMA, the CloR reaction also produced 3DMA-4HB. Incorporation of two 18O atoms into this product was demonstrated by the molecular ion at [M-H]– = 209, in comparison to [M-H]– = 205 for the unlabeled compound (Fig. 5A). As expected, both these labeled oxygens were located in the carboxyl group (Fig. 5A). For a second labeling experiment, the intermediate 3DMA-4HMA was first produced in unlabeled form and isolated by HPLC. This compound was then incubated in an 18O2 atmosphere with CloR (preincubated with Fe2+) and ascorbate. The resulting 3DMA-4HB was analyzed by LC-MS-MS (Fig. 5B), and this clearly showed the incorporation of one 18O atom into the carboxyl group of the product, as demonstrated by the molecular ion at [M-H]– = 207, and the decarboxylation product at m/z = 161 (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C summarizes the results of the 18O2 incorporation experiments. Two 18O atoms are incorporated in the first reaction step, and one 18O atom is incorporated in the second reaction step. The other 18O atom involved in the second step is most likely converted to water (see “Discussion”). In the present study, CloR was identified as a bifunctional oxygenase that converts 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (3DMA-4HPP) in two consecutive reaction steps to 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (3DMA-4HB), i.e. to the Ring A moiety of clorobiocin. An 18O2 labeling experiment unequivocally confirmed that molecular oxygen is used as substrate by CloR. The purified CloR protein does not contain a heme prosthetic group, and its activation by Fe2+ and ascorbate indicated that it belongs to the non-heme iron oxygenase. The first reaction catalyzed by CloR, i.e. the conversion of 3DMA-4HPP to 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxymandelic acid (3DMA-4HMA), has a well-established precedent in the HmaS reaction in chloroeremomycin biosynthesis. HmaS belongs to the iron(II)- and α-ketoacid-dependent dioxygenases (reviewed in Refs. 33Que Jr., L. Ho R.Y. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2607-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 35Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Que Jr., L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These enzymes utilize O2 and an α-ketoacid as cosubstrates. During the reaction, the α-ketoacid loses CO2, and the keto function is oxidized to a carboxyl group by introduction of one of the oxygen atoms of O2. The other oxygen may be used for a hydroxylation reaction, exemplified, e.g., by the prolyl 3-hydroxylase reaction. However, iron(II)- and α-ketoacid-dependent oxygenases have been shown to catalyze not only hydroxylations but a wide range of diverse oxidative transformations, including epoxidations, desaturations, ring formation, and ring expansion reactions. Some of these enzymes are bifunctional (e.g. deacetoxy-/deacetylcephalosporin synthase) or even trifunctional (e.g. clavaminic acid synthase or thymine hydroxylase), catalyzing several consecutive oxidative transformations within a single biosynthetic pathway. In the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP) to homogentisate by 4HPP dioxygenase, 4HPP serves as a substrate for hydroxylation and at the same time as α-ketoacid cosubstrate. CloR (in its first reaction step) and HmaS carry out a very similar reaction as 4HPP dioxygenase but hydroxylate the benzylic position of the substrate instead of the phenyl ring. However, although HmaS shows obvious sequence similarity to 4HPP dioxygenase, CloR does not. The second reaction step catalyzed by CloR is the conversion of 3DMA-4HMA to 3DMA-4HB. It is tempting to speculate that this reaction may involve hydroxylation of the α-position of 3DMA-4HMA, resulting in a α,α-gem-diol, which eliminates water to give the corresponding α-ketoacid, i.e. 4-hydroxybenzoylformate. Oxidative decarboxylation of this compound would result in the final product, 3DMA-4HB. Thereby, the overall reaction mechanism would be similar to that of the first reaction and resemble that of other iron(II)- and α-ketoacid-dependent dioxygenases. However, LC-MS-MS analysis did not confirm the presence of 4-hydroxybenzoylformate in the incubation mixture, and the exact mechanism of the CloR reaction remains speculative at present. It is believed that the reactions catalyzed by iron(II)- and α-ketoacid-dependent oxygenases involve a reactive FeIV=O species (35Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 37Rohde J.U. In J.H. Lim M.H. Brennessel W.W. Bukowski M.R. Stubna A. Munck E. Nam W. Que Jr., L. Science. 2003; 299: 1037-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Whether this is true for CloR remains to be shown. The different groups of iron(II)- and α-ketoacid-dependent oxygenases possess little overall sequence similarity to each other (35Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Que Jr., L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and it is therefore not surprising that CloR does not show sequence similarity to known members of this family. However, a data base search reveals that CloR does show significant similarity to several proteins of so far unknown function, deduced from genome sequences of different microorganisms. These may possibly represent enzymes of similar function as CloR. The common structural motif of iron(II)- and α-ketoacid-dependent enzymes is the so-called 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad (36Que Jr., L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 38Hegg E.L. Que Jr., L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). It consists of two histidyl groups and one glutaryl or asparagyl residue, which together anchor the iron atom in the active site of the enzyme. Comparison of the primary sequence of CloR with that of NovR as well as with the sequences of six of the data base entries of unknown function with high sequence similarity to CloR (data not shown) identifies His-161, His-176, His-178, His-241, and Asp-170 of CloR as strictly conserved residues. These amino acids may be candidates for a potential 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad of this oxygenase. The involvement of CloR in the biosynthesis of the prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoate moiety of clorobiocin was proven in vivo by a gene inactivation experiment (19Pojer F. Li S.-M. Heide L. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3901-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The present results now allow the formulation of a detailed hypothesis for the formation of this moiety of clorobiocin, as shown in Fig. 6: CloQ is a prenyltransferase, which converts 4HPP to 3DMA-4HPP (20Pojer F. Wemakor E. Kammerer B. Chen H. Walsh C.T. Li S.-M. Heide L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CloR converts the CloQ reaction product to Ring A, as demonstrated in the present study. CloF shows sequence similarity to prephenate dehydrogenases and is therefore likely to produce 4HPP as the substrate for CloQ, similar to ORF1 of the chloroeremomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (39van Wageningen A.M.

Notably, the coumermycin cluster does not contain a CloF homologue (Fig. 1B). Radioactive feeding experiments with the novobiocin producer (40Calvert R.T. Spring M.S. Stoker J.R. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1972; 24: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) showed that [U-14C]l-tyrosine was incorporated preferentially into Ring B, whereas [U-14C]4HPP was incorporated preferentially in Ring A. This may suggest that a primary metabolic prephenate dehydrogenase provides tyrosine for the formation of Ring B, whereas CloF supplies 4HPP for Ring A biosynthesis, and that cross-talk exists between both pathways probably via a transaminase reaction (Fig. 6). Chen and Walsh (17Chen H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have previously speculated that Ring A and Ring B of novobiocin may both be produced via β-hydroxytyrosyl-S-NovH as a common precursor.

The discovery of CloR adds a new interesting member to the diverse family of the nonheme iron oxygenases and demonstrates the existence of a new pathway for the formation of benzoic acids in nature.

The known proteins originating from the perinuclear theca have implicated the structure in a variety of important cellular processes during spermiogenesis and fertilization. Nonetheless, the composition of the perinuclear theca remains largely unexplored. We have isolated a group of low molecular mass (14–19 kDa) perinuclear theca-derived proteins from acrosome-depleted bovine sperm heads by salt (1 m KCl) extraction and have identified them as core somatic histones. N-terminal sequencing and immunoblotting with anti-histone antibodies confirmed the presence of both intact and proteolytically cleaved somatic histones H3, H2B, H2A, and H4. Identical proteins were isolated using 2% SDS or 1 n HCl extractions. Subsequent acid and SDS extractions of intact bovine sperm revealed the presence of all four intact histone subtypes, with minimal proteolysis. Two-dimensional acid/urea/Triton-SDS-PAGE, coupled with immunoblotting analysis, confirmed the somatic nature of these perinuclear theca-derived histones. Estimates of the abundance of perinuclear theca-derived histones showed that up to 0.2 pg per sperm of each histone subtype was present. Immunogold labeling at the ultrastructural level localized all four core somatic histones to the post-acrosomal sheath region of bovine epididymal sperm, when probed with affinity-purified anti-histone antibodies.

Based on morphological and protein composition assessments, the PT is divided into two structurally continuous regions, termed the subacrosomal layer, and the post-acrosomal sheath (reviewed in Refs. 1Eddy E.M.

Rather, the PT contains a range of proteins of varying function, including Calicin, a basic structural protein that binds actin (4von Bulow M. Heid H. Hess H. Franke W.W. Exp.

The PT structure has been implicated in a number of essential cellular processes, such as nuclear shaping during spermiogenesis (2Oko R.J. Reprod. Fertil.

Tech. 2003; 61: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), although the PT proteins involved in these processes remain elusive. Their identification and characterization is therefore critical for understanding the mechanisms involved in these, and potentially other, important cellular processes. To date, all characterized PT proteins share a resistance to non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, and to extraction by high salt (16Longo F.J. Krohne G. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1105-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). High pH buffers (NaOH), or the combination of a reducing agent with a denaturing detergent, are required for their complete removal and/or migration through SDS-PAGE (3Oko R. Aul R.B. Wu A. Sutovsky P. Robaire B. Chemes H.E. Morales C.R. Andrology in the 21st Century: Proceedings of the VIIth International Congress of Andrology. Medimond Publishing Co., Inc., Englewood, NJ2001: 37-51Google Scholar). As such, covalent disulfide bonds maintain the protein framework of the PT, consistent with observations in other sperm structures (17Bedford J.M. Calvin H.I. J. Exp. Zool. 1974; 188: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the potential for non-covalent, ionic-associated proteins in the PT cannot be excluded (5Lecuyer C. Dacheux J.L.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as suggested by a recent proposal for classifying PT proteins based on their extractability by ionic detergents, such as SDS (3Oko R. Aul R.B. Wu A. Sutovsky P. Robaire B. Chemes H.E. Morales C.R. Andrology in the 21st Century: Proceedings of the VIIth International Congress of Andrology. Medimond Publishing Co., Inc., Englewood, NJ2001: 37-51Google Scholar). Thus far, all known PT proteins are not extractable by SDS alone, whereas salt- and SDS-extractable PT proteins remain largely uncharacterized. During spermiogenesis, changes in sperm nuclear morphology are concomitant with both the development of the PT (8Oko R. Morales C.R. Dev.

B. 1986; 83: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Species-specific differences occur both in the subtypes of replacement nucleoproteins and the sequence of their removal, in addition to variation in the persistence of core histones in the mature sperm. Human sperm nuclei retain up to 15% of somatic core histone content (23Tanphaichitr N. Sobhon P. Taluppeth N. Chalermisarachai P. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 117: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Gatewood J.M. Cook G.R. Balhorn R. Schmid C.W. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1986; 884: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, somatic histones from bovine sperm nuclei represent less than 1% of calf thymus nuclei content (26Palmer D.K. O'Day K. Trong H.L. Charbonneau H. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Somatic histones have also been isolated in the mature sperm of mouse (27O'Brien D.A. Bellve A.R. Dev. Biol. 1980; 75: 386-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Goldberg R.B. Geremia R. Bruce W.R. Differentiation. 1977; 7: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and rat (29Kistler W.S. Geroch M.E. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4532-4543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it remained questionable whether their source was exclusively nuclear (27O'Brien D.A. Bellve A.R. Dev. Biol. 1980; 75: 386-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In mature bovine sperm, histone-like variants CENP-A and SubH2Bv have been characterized and localized to the nucleus (30Palmer D.K. O'Day K. Margolis R.L. Chromosoma. 1990; 100: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the subacrosomal layer of the PT (31Aul R.B. Oko R.J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), respectively. Taken together, these observations demonstrate the potential for both nuclear and non-nuclear localization of histone proteins in mature mammalian sperm. Here we demonstrate that the four core somatic histones H3, H2B, H2A, and H4 are present in the PT of the mature bovine sperm head. Unlike other PT proteins characterized to date, PT-derived somatic core histones are extractable by SDS, high salt, or acid. Quantitative analysis of these PT-bound somatic core histones suggests that up to 0.2 pg per sperm of each histone subtype is present, potentially representing 10–30% of a haploid genomic equivalence of somatic histone content. Isolation of Epididymal Bovine Sperm and Preparation of Sonicated Sperm Heads—Intact whole bovine sperm and sonicated bovine sperm heads from cauda epididymides were obtained and isolated according to methods previously described by Oko and Maravei (18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The isolation buffer, containing protease inhibitors (18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was adjusted to pH 6.4 to minimize histone proteolysis (32Chen H.Y. Sun J.M. Zhang Y. Davie J.R. Meistrich M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13165-13169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Hoffmann P. Chalkley R. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sperm were counted in a hemacytometer. Extraction of Salt-, SDS-, and Acid-soluble PT Proteins—Salt-extracted PT proteins were obtained according to previous methods (18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Omitting the initial Triton X-100 incubation, ∼1 × 1010 sonicated sperm heads were gently shaken in 1 m KCl in isolation buffer, for1hat4 °C. Following processing of the supernatant (18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the pellet was subjected to a second 1 m KCl extraction over 16 h to completely remove all salt-soluble PT proteins. SDS-extracted PT proteins were obtained from both whole sperm and sonicated heads by incubating pellets in SDS-PAGE non-reducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.0125% bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 3 min at 100 °C. The supernatant obtained following centrifugation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Acid-soluble PT proteins were obtained using methods for basic nuclear protein extractions described elsewhere (34Platz R.D. Meistrich M.L. Grimes Jr., S.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 297-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in place of isolated nuclei fractions, whole sperm or sonicated head fractions were incubated directly with 0.25 m HCl and processed accordingly (34Platz R.D. Meistrich M.L. Grimes Jr., S.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 297-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The total protein profile of both whole sperm and sonicated heads prior to, and following all extractions, was obtained by incubating pellets in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, for 3 min at 100 °C. To facilitate gel loading, decondensed chromatin was sheared by passing the samples through a 23-gauge needle several times. Total protein concentration in the extracts was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis, Transfer, and Peptide Sequencing—Three systems of gel electrophoresis were used in this study for analysis of SDS-, salt-, and acid-soluble proteins. SDS-PAGE was conducted under reducing condition, according to previously described procedures (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Migration was compared with low molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and calf thymus core histones (Roche Applied Science, Laval, Quebec, Canada). 15% acetic acid-urea-Triton X-100 (AUT)-PAGE and two-dimensional (2D) AUT/SDS-PAGE were performed according to the methods of Davie (37Davie J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). AUT-PAGE contained 5.4% acetic acid, 6 m urea, and 0.375% Triton X-100. All gel systems were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for protein band detection. Proteins separated by either SDS- or 2D AUT/SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a 0.45-μm PVDF membrane (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44922) Google Scholar). N-terminal peptide sequencing of the 14.5-, 17-, and 18-kDa bands from sonicated head salt extracts was conducted by the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre (Montreal, Quebec, Canada), as previously described (8Oko R. Morales C.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences were analyzed by protein BLAST for short sequences using the NCBI GenBank™ data base (39Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59917) Google Scholar). Antiserum Preparation and Affinity Purification—Antiserum against the 1 m KCl extract was generated using previously described methods (18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except that Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) was used in the emulsion. Specificity and strength of the antiserum were tested on immunoblots containing calf thymus core somatic histones and the PT extractions described above. The antiserum was affinity-purified against the individual core somatic histones (18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Affinity purification columns were generated using recombinant core histones H3, H2B, H2A, and H4 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) immobilized on PVDF. Specificity and strength of each affinity-purified anti-serum were assessed by immunodetection on blots containing calf thymus core somatic histones. Affinity-purified anti-histone antisera were further concentrated for immunogold transmission electron microscopy analysis (18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—1D- and 2D-resolved salt-, acid-, and/or SDS-extractable PT proteins, from both whole sperm and sonicated heads, were immobilized on PVDF and probed with affinity-purified anti-H3, anti-H2B, anti-H2A, and anti-H4 antisera (1:20–1:500 of unconcentrated stock), and the following commercially acquired antibodies: C-terminal-specific anti-H2B (against human H2B residues 118–126, 1:2000, Upstate Biotechnology), N-terminal-specific anti-H3 (human H3 residues 1–20, 1:500, Upstate Biotechnology), C-terminal-specific anti-H3 (human H3 residues 120–135, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-H4 (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-H2A (against acidic patch, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Nonspecific sites were blocked with 10% skim milk made in 25 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.8, and 0.1% Tween (TBS-TW) for 1 h at room temperature. Diluted primary antibodies in 2% skim milk/TBS-TW were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or anti-goat IgG (1:20,000, Sigma) peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used for 2-h secondary incubations at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was detected using a Super-signal West Pico Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Transmission Electron Microscopy and Immunogold Labeling— Fresh razor slices of cauda epididymis and sample pellets obtained from whole sperm and sonicated heads before and after the extractions were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 0.8% glutaraldehyde and embedded in LR white (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Immunogold labeling of post-embedded thin sections was probed with the concentrated affinity-purified anti-histone antisera, according to previously described methods (40Oko R. Clermont Y. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 41Clermont Y. Oko R. Hermo L. Anat. Rec. 1990; 227: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (Sigma) were used at a dilution of 1:20. Sections were viewed on a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi 7000). Quantification of PT-derived Histone Sperm Equivalence—Blots containing known amounts (ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 μg) of recombinant core histones H3, H2B, H2A, or H4 and sperm-equivalent volumetric loads of whole sperm SDS extracts were probed with affinity-purified anti-histone anti-sera. Densitometry of reactive bands, resolved by ECL, was assessed using the Scion Image Beta 4.02 Acquisition and Analysis software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MA). Regression analysis of recombinant histone standards and final estimation of sperm equivalence was conducted using Microsoft Excel Data Analysis software. Three separate whole sperm SDS extractions were analyzed for quantification of each histone protein from the same bull. Histones Are Present in Perinuclear Theca Extracts from Bovine Sperm—Protein extractions from sonicated heads using 1 m KCl were analyzed by one-dimensional 15% SDS-PAGE, revealing three prominent polypeptide bands of 14.5, 17, and 18 kDa (Fig. 1A). A comparison of the protein profile of reduced sonicated heads before (lane 1) and after (lane 3) extraction showed both the presence and absence of these bands, respectively (Fig. 1A), indicating their complete extraction. The N-terminal sequence of the 18-kDa band (PEPAKSAPAPKKGS) exactly matched the N-terminal sequence of bovine somatic histone H2B (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the major N-terminal sequences of the 17-kDa (SAPAPKKGSKKAVT) and 14.5-kDa (KSAPATGGVKKP) bands matched downstream regions of bovine somatic histones H2B (Ser-7 to Thr-20) and H3 (Lys-28 to Pro-39), respectively (Fig. 2). A second minor sequence was also obtained from the 17-kDa band, which matched the sequence found in the 18-kDa band, corresponding to the N terminus of H2B (data not shown). No N-terminal sequence data matching somatic histones H2A or H4 sequences were obtained from the three bands examined.Fig. 2N-terminal sequence of the major protein bands from sonicated sperm head salt extracts aligned with histone sequences. A, alignment of the N-terminal sequences from the 18- and 17-kDa bands with protein sequences from bovine somatic H2B (bH2B), testis-specific H2B variants from rat (rTH2B) and human (hTH2B), and bovine H2B-like SubH2Bv (bSH2Bv). Gaps (-) are indicated for proper alignment of sequences. Note: A second minor sequence (PEPAKSAPA) was detected in the 17-kDa band, representing contaminating sequence from the 18-kDa band. B, alignment of the N-terminal sequences from the 14.5-kDa band with protein sequences from bovine somatic H3 (bH3) and human H3-like centromere-specific histone variant CENP-A (hCENP-A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The advantage in using sonicated sperm heads for high salt extraction was that the post-acrosomal sheath of the PT was fully exposed, yet the nuclear envelope remained intact, presumably providing a barrier against extraction of any salt-soluble proteins from the condensed nucleus (for review of morphological assessment, see Ref. 18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, an enrichment of the 17- and 18-kDa bands was also observed in acid-extractions from sonicated heads (Fig. 1B), consistent with the acid extractability of histones from somatic nuclei (42Klyszejko-Stefanowicz L. Krajewska W.M. Lipinska A. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press Inc, Boca Raton, FL1989: 17-71Google Scholar). Likewise, the 17- and 18-kDa bands were present in 2% SDS extracts from sonicated heads (Fig. 1B). Appearing somewhat inconsistently were two bands migrating at 14- and 14.5-kDa in all sonicated head extracts. Similar to KCl-extracted sonicated head pellets (Fig. 1A, lane 3), a depletion of the 14- to 18-kDa bands was observed in sonicated head pellets following both SDS and acid extractions, with a retention of SDS/salt-insoluble PT proteins (data not shown). Migration of the 18-, 17-, and 14-kDa bands extracted from sonicated head by salt, acid, and SDS treatment matched identically to control calf thymus histones H2B, H2A, and H4 (Fig. 1B). No matching band corresponding to H3 was detected in any of the Coomassie Blue-stained sonicated head extracts, nor did the 14.5-kDa band match with any of the core histone bands. In contrast, crude acid and SDS extracts from whole sperm revealed the presence of the same 14- to 18-kDa bands, together with a 19-kDa band, corresponding to the migration of calf thymus H3 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the presence of the 14.5-kDa band was also inconsistent in both whole sperm extracts. Although additional proteins were present in these extracts above 20 kDa, the 14- to 19-kDa bands were fully depleted from whole sperm pellets following acid or SDS extraction (data not shown). Histone subtype identities of the 14- to 19-kDa bands from whole sperm extracts were further elucidated by immunoblots probed with anti-histone antibodies (Fig. 3). N- and C-terminal-specific anti-H3 antibodies labeled the 19-kDa band from whole sperm SDS (Fig. 3, A and B) and acid extracts (data not shown). Similarly, the 14-, 17-, and 18-kDa bands were specifically immunoreactive to respective anti-H4, anti-H2A, and C-terminal-specific anti-H2B antibodies, respectively (Fig. 3A). Whole sperm pellets after extractions were non-immunoreactive to these antibodies (data not shown). Quantification of PT-derived somatic histones indicated that 0.2, 0.1, 0.03, and 0.02 pg per sperm of H3, H2B, H2A, and H4, respectively, were present in the whole sperm SDS extracts. H3, H2B, and H4, but not H2A, were sensitive to proteolytic cleavage as a result of the sperm head isolation process, because no such cleavage products were detected in immunoblots of whole sperm extracts (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, anti-histone antibodies confirmed the presence of histone proteolytic cleavage products in sonicated head extracts. For example, in sonicated head extracts, but not whole sperm extracts, C-terminal-specific anti-H3 antibodies were strongly immunoreactive with the 14.5-kDa band (Fig. 3B). Labeling was abolished when these extracts were probed with N-terminal-specific anti-H3 antibodies. This corroborates the N-terminal sequencing data, suggesting the 14.5-kDa band contains an H3 cleavage product lacking the N-terminal region, which was otherwise detectable by the latter probe. The 18-, 17-, and 14.5-kDa bands from sonicated head extracts were all immunoreactive to C-terminal-specific anti-H2B antibodies (Fig. 1A). This confirmed the presence of both intact and proteolytically cleaved H2B that were initially detected in the 18- and 17-kDa bands, respectively, by N-terminal sequencing. Anti-H2A and anti-H4 antibodies labeled the 17- and 14-kDa bands, respectively, from sonicated head extracts, demonstrating the presence of these histones despite the lack of N-terminal sequence data. An additional band migrating below 14 kDa was detected by anti-H4 antibodies and is indicative of a potential H4 cleavage product. The somatic nature of the histones isolated from whole sperm acid extracts was further established by AUT- and 2D AUT/SDS-PAGE analysis. Numerous proteins in crude whole sperm acid extracts were resolved in Coomassie-stained gels by AUT-PAGE (Fig. 4A) and 2D AUT-SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). Nonetheless, bands and spots corresponding to calf thymus core somatic histones were detected. Subsequent probing of 2D-resolved whole sperm acid extracts by anti-histone-specific antibodies revealed strong monospecific reactivity of spots corresponding to respective histones subtypes. These labeled spots matched 2D-resolved and immunoprobed calf thymus somatic histones (Fig. 4C). Somatic Histone Are Localized to the Post-acrosomal Sheath Region in Bovine Sperm Perinuclear Theca—Ultrastructural assessment of sonicated sperm heads prior to, and following, salt, SDS, or acid extractions by transmission electron microscopy indicated that neither the isolation, nor the extraction procedures produced any observable perturbation of the condensed nucleus (Fig. 5A). These findings were consistent with previous assessments of sonicated sperm head morphology following Triton X-100 and NaCl extractions (2Oko R.J. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1995; 7: 777-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 43Korley R. Pouresmaeili F. Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1426-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Attempts at labeling sperm samples with commercially available anti-histone antibodies were marred by high background and nonspecific labeling (data not shown). Therefore, antiserum raised against sonicated head KCl extracts was affinity-purified against each histone subtype and used to probe the sperm samples. The characterization of the antisera and subsequent affinity-purified anti-H3, -H2B, -H2A, and -H4 antibodies are presented in Fig. 3C. Prior to the extractions, immunogold labeling with each affi"

Previous substrate profiling studies have demonstrated some of the intriguing properties of the enzyme, including its unique and highly selective inositol phosphatase activity. The enzyme is also potentially involved in pathogenic inositol phosphate signal transduction pathways via type III secretion into the host cell. We have determined the crystal structure of E. coli glucose-1-phosphatase in an effort to unveil the structural mechanism underlying such unique substrate specificity. The structure was determined by the method of multiwavelength anomalous dispersion using a tungstate derivative together with the H18A inactive mutant complex structure with glucose 1-phosphate at 2.4-Å resolution. In the active site of glucose-1-phosphatase, there are two unique gating residues, Glu-196 and Leu-24, in addition to the conserved features of histidine acid phosphatases. Together they create steric and electrostatic constraints responsible for the unique selectivity of the enzyme toward phytate and glucose-1-phosphate as well as its unusually high pH optimum for the latter. Based on the structural characterization, we were able to derive simple structural principles that not only precisely explains the substrate specificity of glucose-1-phosphatase and the hydrolysis products of various inositol phosphate substrates but also rationalizes similar general characteristics across the histidine acid phosphatase family.

Encoded by the agp (acid glucose phosphatase) gene, Escherichia coli glucose-1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.10, d-glucose-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase, hereafter abbreviated as G1Pase 1The abbreviations used are: G1Pase, d-glucose-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid; Ins, inositol; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion; P-, phosphate.) belongs to the high molecular weight (histidine) acid phosphatases family, which is considered to be functionally conserved from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes (1Chi H.

Prostate. 2000; 42: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) cells have been determined. All identified histidine acid phosphatases contain a conserved N-terminal RH(G/N)XRXP sequence as well as an R and a HD motif located at almost identical positions in the active site (2Lim D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22830-22836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The common two-step catalysis mechanism consists of a nucleophilic attack on the P atom by the active site histidine imidazole nitrogen and the subsequent hydrolysis of the covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate (8Van Etten R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 390: 27-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Vincent J.B. Crowder M.W. Averill B.A. Trends Biochem.

Mutation of the active site histidine to alanine in E. coli G1Pase (H18) and E. coli phytase completely abolished the activity of both enzymes (7Ostanin K. Harms E.H. Stevis P.E. Kuciel R. Zhou M.

Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mature E. coli G1Pase contains 391 amino acids with a molecular mass of 44 kDa (10Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Pradel E. Marck C. Boquet P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 802-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the native enzyme is likely a homodimer in solution (12Pradel E. Boquet P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4916-4923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G1Pase has broad substrate specificity for phosphorylated compounds but demonstrates its highest activity toward glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) (12Pradel E. Boquet P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4916-4923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the function of the enzyme in the periplasm is to scavenge glucose from G1P, an important intermediate in glycogen catabolism, glycogen biosynthesis, and galactose metabolism (13Pradel E. Boquet P.L. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This conclusion was drawn from both the lack of regulation of G1Pase activity by free phosphate concentration as well as the unique growth of agp+ strains in a high phosphate media with G1P as the sole carbon source (13Pradel E. Boquet P.L. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Pradel E. Boquet P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3511-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli G1Pase has also been shown to hydrolyze phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) (15Golovan S. Wang G. Zhang J. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2000; 46: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Despite the possession of the same active site residues (the RH(G/N)XRXP and down-stream R and HD) found in other histidine acid phosphatases, a recent analysis of G1Pase by Cottrill et al. (10Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) indicates the enzyme specificity toward inositol phosphates. This specific inositol phosphate activity is intriguing because several inositol phosphatases of the related Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae family members, Salmonella and Shigella spp., were reported to be translocated directly into the eukaryotic host cell via type III secretion systems to interfere with a variety of host cell signaling pathways (16De Vinney I. Steele-Mortimer I. Finlay B.B. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For example, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the receptor complex structure of which has been recently reported (17Bosanac I. Alattia J. Mal T. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), plays a critical role in Ca2+ signaling in the control of a variety of cellular and physiological processes. Because the hydrolysis products of G1Pase can include several inositol phosphates identified as signal transducing agents (10Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), G1Pase has become a potential virulence determinant and may prove to be a useful target for new anti-microbial agents, the development of which could be accelerated with structural data (19Jia Z. Cottrill M. Pal G.P. Lee D. Sung M. Forsberg C.W. Phillips J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A second highlight of E. coli G1Pase is the structural comparison to E. coli phytase. The two histidine acid phosphatases share a significant amino acid sequence identity of 31% (20Dassa J. Marck C. Boquet P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5497-5500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but possess quite different specific activities toward their common substrates (10Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Pradel E. Boquet P.L. J.

Although the overall fold should be similar between G1Pase and other acid phosphatases including E. coli phytase, a detailed structural study of G1Pase is necessary to explain the unique hydrolysis profile of the enzyme. For instance, E. coli G1Pase has a strong preference for G1P over other small monosaccharide phosphates and hydrolyzes G1P at an unusually high pH (10Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Pradel E. Boquet P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4916-4923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compared with other histidine acid phosphatases. Structural analysis of G1Pase as well as the comparison of its active site to those of other histidine acid phosphatases could reveal key structural features influencing the substrate recognition and kinetics of G1Pase (2Lim D. Golovan S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Jia Z. Cottrill M. Pal G.P. Lee D. Sung M. Forsberg C.W. Phillips J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and eventually lead to the derivation of general principles applicable to the histidine acid phosphatase family. In this paper we report structural studies of E. coli glucose-1-phosphatase along with its H18A inactive mutant structure in a complex with the natural substrate glucose 1-phosphate. Crystallization—The E. coli glucose-1-phosphatase was purified and crystallized as described in Jia et al. (19Jia Z. Cottrill M. Pal G.P. Lee D. Sung M. Forsberg C.W. Phillips J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). All crystals were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, with each slide containing one to three drops. Drops consisted of 1 or 2 μl of an 11 mg/ml protein solution with an equal volume of crystallization solution (1.75–1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000, and 0.05 m MES buffer at pH 6.25). Co-crystallizations were performed by including 10 mm Na2WO4 or 0.66 mm α-d-glucose 1-phosphate (dipotassium salt). Data Collection and Processing—All crystal forms were of space group R3, with cell axes a = b = 156.3–157.3, c = 84.1–85.2Å and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. All data sets were collected under 100 K preceded by a 10-s cryo soaking in 45% polyethylene glycol 400 (in 0.05 m MES, pH 6.25). The tungstate derivative diffraction data were collected with a CCD detector at the X8-C beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory). Data for the mutant and mutant-G1P complex were collected with a CCD detector at the A1 and F1 stations, respectively, at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). Our initial attempt to solve the structure by molecular replacement from the E. coli phytase model was unsuccessful, consistent with a previous example of phytase structure determination (2Lim D. Golovan S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The HKL (21Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Issacs N. Bailey S.

D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) were used for data reduction and processing. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of E. coli glucose-1-phosphatase was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using data collected from the tungstate derivative. The wavelengths chosen from the energy scan for tungsten Liii absorption edge were 1.2146 Å (f ″ peak), 1.2149 Å (f ′ peak), and 1.3190 Å (remote). The CNS software package (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) was used for heavy atom searches, yielding two distinct peaks corresponding to two bound tungstates. Because of strong white line effects near the tungsten Liii edge (25Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), experimental f ′ and f ″ values for tungsten were interpolated from x-ray fluorescence data and refined in SHARP (26de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The initial phases were improved by solvent flipping. The MAD phasing statistics are listed in Table I. The model was completed by iterative cycles of model building with Xtalview (27McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refinement with CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

The asymmetric unit of all crystal forms contained two molecules. The final models showed good stereochemistry when validated with Procheck (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—The crystal structure of the E. coli G1Pase was determined by the MAD method using a tungstate derivative (Table I). An inactive H18A mutant (10Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was co-crystallized with α-d-glucose 1-phosphate for structure determination of the enzyme-substrate complex. Because the crystals were isomorphous, the tungstate-derivative structure, devoid of tungstate, was directly used for determining the structures of the H18A mutant and mutant-G1P complex, both at 2.4 Å resolution (1NT4 in the Protein Data Bank). The overall folding architecture of G1Pase (Fig. 1) can be divided into two major domains, the α domain (green) and the α/β domain (blue), surrounding a central catalytic shaft. The α domain consists of several α helices, with the two major helices (I, L) shaping part of the catalytic pocket. The α/β domain contains a twisted β structure of mixed parallel and anti-parallel topology surrounded by two α helices on each side. These major structural features are well conserved throughout histidine acid phosphatases, whereas primary sequence alignment (29Person W.R. Wood T. Zhang Z. Miller W. Genomics. 1997; 46: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) between G1Pase and other histidine acid phosphatase members generally show a low sequence identity of only ∼20% (31% for the E. coli phytase). Interestingly, the β hairpin motif (strands 7 and 8; pink), which was found exclusively in the E. coli phytase (2Lim D. Golovan S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), is also present in G1Pase. In the case of G1Pase, however, strand 8 extends further upstream to form a second anti-parallel topology with strand 6 of the α/β domain. The central catalytic region consists of the signature motif N-terminal RH(G/N)XRXP, Arg-94 on helix C, and a His-289–Asp-290 motif preceding helix N, which has its N terminus pointing directly into the active pocket. There are in total six cysteine residues forming 3 disulfide bonds between residues 79–110, 174–180, and 369–377. The 369–377 disulfide is a C-terminal loop linker and is conserved in all other histidine acid phosphatase structures. The overall structure of the E. coli G1Pase is very similar to that of the E. coli phytase, with a root mean square deviation (calculated by ALIGN (30Cohen G.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar)) of 1.46 Å between corresponding Cα atoms. The root mean square deviation between Cα atoms for G1Pase with A. ficuum phytase, A. niger pH 2.5 acid phosphatase, rat prostatic acid phosphatase, and human prostatic acid phosphatases are 2.46, 2.45, 2.31, and 2.14 Å, respectively. The orientations and positions of the catalytic site residues, Arg-17, His-18, Arg-21, Arg-94, His-289, and Asp-290, are especially well conserved. The common features for all histidine acid phosphatase active sites include a catalytic center filled by positive-charged residues and both an aspartic acid amide hydrogen and a α helix N terminus pointing into the pocket. The combined effects of the positive charges and the dipole moment not only facilitate substrate phosphate binding but also reduce the pK a of the catalytic histidine imidazole group by charge-charge repulsion (2Lim D. Golovan S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As a result the nucleophilic nitrogen would stay unprotonated at a pH as low as 2.5 (31Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Vihko P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All of the above structural features are observed in the E. coli G1Pase active site. Upon substrate binding, the phosphate group of G1P forms extensive hydrogen bonding with Arg and His residues in the active site (Fig. 2, A and B). An exactly identical pattern of hydrogen bonding was observed for the 3-phosphate group of phytate complexed with the E. coli phytase (2Lim D. Golovan S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The Asp-Ser-Ala-Ala sequence, which is present in the active site of alkaline phosphatase and those of other typical serine hydrolases, was also found in G1Pase (residue 157–160) but not phytase (15Golovan S. Wang G. Zhang J. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2000; 46: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This sequence is located on the coil between strand 6 of the α/β domain and helix D of the α domain, a surface region with relatively poor electron density and a high temperature factor. This region does not seem to be involved in any catalytic function. In G1Pase, the well conserved catalytic region also differs slightly from other histidine acid phosphatases; an Asn replaces the Gly in RHG XRXP. However, the replacement is of minimal influence because the side chain of Asn-19 points to the opposite direction of the active site. The position of the Asn-19 peptide oxygen is still conserved; it forms a hydrogen bond with one of the His-18 imidazole nitrogen atoms, fixing the His-18 side chain. Rigidity of the Glucose-1-phosphatase Catalytic Pocket—The H18A mutant structure, lacking any bound substrate, is almost identical to the native-tungstate structure as well as the structure of H18A mutant complexed with glucose 1-phosphate. The root mean square deviation of Cα atoms between the mutant and the mutant-complex structure and between the mutant and the native-tungstate complex is 0.39 and 0.44 Å, respectively. Without significant main chain shift all of the less-overlapped residues are located on the loosely packed regions away from the active site. In the E. coli phytase, substrate-induced conformational change of the active pocket was reported to facilitate substrate binding and, hence, catalysis (2Lim D. Golovan S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), whereas in G1Pase no change is observed because the corresponding residues are already in the closed conformation. When comparing the temperature factor of the binding pocket residues (which shape the pocket surface), the average temperature factor is significantly lower (25.47) than the molecular average (30.75). However, in E. coli phytase the average temperature factor for the same set of conserved binding pocket residues (29.33) is almost identical to the molecular average (29.32). The binding pocket of G1Pase is therefore more rigid than that of phytase, which is not surprising given that the competent active-site conformation of G1Pase already exists before substrate binding. Previously determined structures of histidine acid phosphatases indicated that their broad substrate range can be attributed to differences in the α domain (3Kostrewa D. Grüninger-Leitch F. D'Arcy A. Broger C. Mitchell D. van Loon A.P.G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Kostrewa D. Wyss M. D'arcy A van Loon A.P.G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In G1Pase there are two structural features in the α domain that are most likely responsible for the observed rigidity of the catalytic pocket. First, the three-stranded β substructure (strands 6–8), which is only observed in G1Pase, provides stability to the upper binding pocket (Figs. 1 and 2A). Because this β substructure actually covers both the α domain (strands 7 and 8) and the α/β domain (strand 6), it also contributes to interdomain stability. Glu-196, located on strand 8 and pointing into the binding pocket, is a unique feature of G1Pase in both its position and negative charge compared with other histidine phosphatase active sites (Fig. 3). The second rigidity-related feature is the other gating residue, Leu-24. Also pointing into the pocket, Leu-24 is located on the bottom of the pocket, between two conserved β strands (strands 2 and 3). Strand 2 contains an important Arg-21 residue required in substrate binding, and it further connects to the catalytic residues Arg-17 and His-18. Compared with other histidine acid phosphatases, strands 2 and 3 are more closely associated to the downstream helix A. Strand 3 and helix A are both located behind the peptide chain of Leu-24. As a result, the two strands and helix A fix Leu-24 in the middle, narrowing the active site entrance (Fig. 3). Unique Phytate Specificity—The histidine acid phosphatase family is known to be the only multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase to hydrolyze the abundant metabolites inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate) and inositol pentakisphosphate (1Chi H. Tiller G.E. Dasouki M.J. Romano P.R. Wang J. O'Keefe R.J. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. Reynolds P.R. Genomics. 1999; 56: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although both E. coli G1Pase and phytase possess phytase activity, E. coli phytase subsequently hydrolyzes myo-inositol hexakisphosphate to inositol phosphate (32Greiner R. Carlsson N. Alminger M.L. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 84: 53-62Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas G1Pase cleaves only 3-phosphate from myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, and no further hydrolysis takes place (10Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). G1Pase is the only phosphatase known to possess this unique specificity. Based on the structures of E. coli G1Pase, phytase, and their enzyme-substrate complexes, computational G1Pase-phytate docking was attempted to rationalize the unique 3- and only 3-phytase specificity. During modeling, the distance for all possible contact atoms between the substrate and the enzyme was simultaneously monitored to provide a dynamic evaluation of the model. Because of the small pocket size, it was very difficult to dock phytate without steric hindrance. The first strategy was to overlap the hexagonal carbon ring of phytate with the glucopyranose ring of glucose 1-phosphate followed by a second attempt to overlap the 3-carbon of phytate with the 1-carbon of G1P. Both attempts were unsuccessful due to steric clashes. Finally, when the 3-phosphate of phytate was aligned with the phosphate of G1P, a fitting was achieved with all possible contact distance greater than 2.45 Å (Fig. 4). The"

NADPH reduction of the FAD and FMN redox centers by the CaM-bound flavin domains was studied by stopped-flow and rapid scan spectrometry. Reduction of the air-stable semiquinone (FAD-FMNH•) of both domains with NADPH showed that the extent of conversion of FADH2/FMNH• to FADH•/FMNH2 in the iNOS flavin domain was greater than that of the nNOS flavin domain. The reduction of both oxidized domains (FAD-FMN) with NADPH resulted in the initial formation of a small amount of disemiquinone, which then decayed. The rate of intramolecular electron transfer between the two flavins in the iNOS flavin domain was faster than that of the nNOS flavin domain. In addition, the formation of a mixture of the two- and four-electron-reduced states in the presence of excess NADPH was different for the two NOS flavin domains.

The latter structure is superimposable on those of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). The x-ray crystal structure of CPR, which contains one molecule each of FAD and FMN (16Iyanagi T. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), indicates that direct electron transfer between the two flavins is most likely, given their close proximity (17Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The genes encoding nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed, and their enzymatic activities are regulated by the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration through binding of Ca2+/CaM (4Roman L.J. Martàsek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp.

In contrast, iNOS activity is regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level and binds CaM with such high affinity that it is already fully activated at the free Ca2+ level of a resting cell (20Nathan C. Xie Q-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). Thus, nNOS and eNOS have typically been used to investigate the mechanism of CaM activation of NOS. The CaM-dependent activation mechanism is modulated by several unusual structural features within the NOS flavin domain, such as an autoinhibitory loop in the FMN binding subdomain that is absent in iNOS, kinase-dependent phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal extension (tail) (4Roman L.J.

All three NOS isoforms share 50–60% overall sequence similarity, and they have an analogous electron transfer pathway (NADPH → FAD → FMN → heme) but have different NO production rates. Turnover numbers for NO synthesis of ∼200 min–1, 100 min–1, and 20 min–1 for iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS, respectively, have been reported (4Roman L.J. Martàsek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A chimeric enzyme in which the heme domain of one isoform was connected to the flavin domain of another (23Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) indicated that an increased flavin domain activity could lead to a corresponding increase in NO synthase activity. This raises the possibility that there are differences in the flavin-mediated electron transfer between the NOS isoforms. The electron transfer from the flavin domain to the heme domain is thought to be stimulated by the binding of CaM. CaM can influence two possible electron transfer steps: from NADPH to FAD or/and from FAD to FMN (24Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Guan Z-W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The NOS flavin domain is related structurally and functionally to CPR (16Iyanagi T. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Both enzymes have cytochrome c and ferricyanide reductase activities, and each flavin has different redox properties (27Iyanagi T. Makino N. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Noble M.A. Munro A.W. Rivers S.L. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Yellowlees L.J. Shimizu T. Sagami I. Guillemette J.G. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16413-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the nNOS flavin domain is controlled by Ca2+-dependent CaM binding, which can stimulate the reduction of cytochrome c (4Roman L.J. Martàsek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Guan Z-W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This suggests that CaM may enhance NOS cytochrome c reduction by directly activating the reductase domain itself. Craig et al. (30Craig D.H. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33987-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have shown that the reductase domain will be conformationally locked and unable to transfer electrons efficiently to cytochrome c. CaM causes a shift in the orientation of the FMN subdomain, thereby unlocking the reductase activity, enabling efficient transfer of electrons to cytochrome c. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the FAD/NADPH subdomain suggests that a C-terminal tail bisects the FMN and FAD redox centers (15Zhang J. Martàsek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S.

In the presence of CaM, this lock is removed, facilitating electron transfer between FAD and FMN. Intramolecular electron transfer between the two flavins in CPR has been studied using laser flash photolysis (31Bhattacharyya A.K. Lipka J.J. Waskell L. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and temperature-jump relaxation spectroscopy (32Gutierrez A. Paine M. Wolf C.R. Scrutton N.S. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4626-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis was used to study the electron transfer in nNOS (33Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39864-39871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data suggest that domain movement within the protein may play a major role in the mechanism of intramolecular electron transfer. Adak et al. (34Adak S. Sharma M. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. Proc.

Although this work has established the importance of the flavin domain in regulating CaM-dependent electron transfer, it is still unclear as to how the FAD and FMN centers communicate in the transfer of electrons within the nNOS and iNOS flavin domains. In this study, we have measured the rapid kinetic behavior of each FAD and FMN semiquinone bound to the flavin domains of human nNOS and iNOS and provide direct evidence that CaM binding stimulates the one-electron transfer between the two flavins.

The DNA fragments of 2145 nucleotides (2598–4742) for the human nNOS flavin domain and 1953 nucleotides (1510–3462) for the human iNOS flavin domain were amplified by PCR with restriction sites NdeI/XbaI and NdeI/HindIII, respectively. The oligonucleotides used as primers were as follows: nNOS, sense (5′-AAGAATTCTCATATGTCCACCAACGGGACC-3′) and antisense (5′-ACAGAATTCGGTCTAGAGGGTCCAG-3′); iNOS, sense (5′-AGAATTCATATGGAGAAGCGGAGACC-3′) and antisense (5′-GACTCCCGGATGTAGATCTCTTAAGA-3′). The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and gel-extracted, and the nNOS and iNOS fragments were digested with NdeI/XbaI and NdeI/HindIII, respectively. The digestion products were ligated into expression vector pCWori+ using the appropriate restriction sites within the polylinker region. For expression studies, the plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 harboring the compatible plasmid pACY-CaM III. Transformed clones were selected and maintained on LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml tetracycline. Recombinant clones were verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—The human CaM III, human nNOS FAD/NADPH binding domain, and CaM-free human nNOS flavin (FAD/FMN) domain were expressed and purified as described previously (26Guan Z-W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The human nNOS and iNOS flavin domains, which were co-expressed with the recombinant plasmid pACY-CaM III in E. coli cells were purified by DE52 and 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose 4B chromatography. Recombinant E. coli BL21 harboring the compatible plasmids was cultured in LB medium, containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml tetracycline, at 30 °C for 24 h. Expression was induced at A 600 = 0.1–0.2 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β–d–thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and frozen at –80 °C until required. The E. coli cells were disrupted by sonication (10 pulses of 30 s) in buffer A on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a DE52 column (35 × 20 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme adsorbed on the column as a blue band and was eluted with 0.1 m NaCl in buffer A. The active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B (2 × 4 cm) affinity column and then oxidized using ferricyanide. After washing with 200 ml of 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm 2′,3′-AMP in buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with 100 ml of 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm 2′,3′-AMP in buffer A. The active fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, and 2′,3′-AMP was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C using an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis, the purified enzymes bound CaM (17–18 kDa) in a ratio of 1:1 and had an estimated molecular mass of about 80 and 74 kDa for the human nNOS and iNOS flavin domains, respectively. In addition, both the purified flavin domains contained FAD and FMN with a ratio of 1:1 determined by capillary electrophoresis (36Britz-McKibbin P. Markuszewski M.J. Iyanagi T. Matsuda K. Nishioka T. Terabe S. Anal. Chem. 2003; 57: 87-95Google Scholar). The enzymes were further purified by a DE-52 column prior to experiments. Quantitative Analysis of CaM Bound to NOS Flavin Domain—The quantities of CaM bound to NOS flavin domain were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using purified human CaM III as a standard. The intensity of the protein bands was quantified using Gel Plotting Macros software. The co-expressed nNOS and iNOS flavin domain bound CaM with a ratio ([E]/[CaM]) of 1.0:1.2 and 1.0:1.1, respectively. The values represent the means ± S.D. of three independent measurements each. Spectrophotometric Methods—Enzyme concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 457 nm of the NOS flavin domains, using an extinction coefficient of 22.9 mm–1 cm–1 for the human nNOS flavin domain (26Guan Z-W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and 23.1 mm–1 cm–1 for the human iNOS flavin domain. The extinction coefficient of the CaM-bound oxidized human iNOS flavin domain was determined by comparing the absorbance at the flavin peak at 457 nm in the holoenzyme with the absorbance of the free flavins (ϵ450 = 11.3 mm–1 cm–1 for FAD and ϵ450 = 12.5 mm–1 cm–1 for FMN) released by the addition of 5% sodium lauroylsarcosine. The concentration of NADPH was determined using an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm–1 cm–1 at 340 nm. The concentration of cytochrome c was measured by monitoring the absorbance change at 550 nm, using a difference extinction coefficient of 21 mm–1 cm–1 between the reduced and oxidized forms. The percentage conversion of FADH2/FMNH• to FADH•/FMNH2 (see Fig. 7) was calculated using a difference extinction coefficient of 2.3 mm–1 cm–1 at 520 nm between the FAD and FMN semiquinone forms (26Guan Z-W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The percentage conversion of the oxidized enzyme to the fully reduced form (see Fig. 8) was calculated from the extinction coefficient of 8.6 mm–1 cm–1 at 596 nm for nNOS disemiquinone (FADH•/FMNH•). The extinction coefficient of disemiquinone at 596 nm was determined by comparing the absorbance of disemiquinone at 596 nm with the absorbance at 457 nm of the oxidized enzymes (see Fig. 2B).Fig. 8Reduction of the CaM-bound oxidized human nNOS (A1 and A2) and iNOS (B1 and B2) flavin domains. The spectra were recorded by using rapid scan (A1 and B1) and stopped-flow methods (A2 and B2) after 5 μm enzyme with 50 μm NADPH in 10 mm Hepes buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0, 25 °C. A1, spectra were recorded at 16, 40, 88, 136, and 184 ms (spectra 1–5). B1, spectra were recorded at 16, 40, 64, 88, 136, and 184 ms (spectra 1–6) after the initial mixing event and at a long wavelength period (520–700 nm). A2 and B2, the spectra were recorded at two wavelengths (457 and 596 nm) and over a time period of 500 ms.

A, the spectrum for FAD semiquinone (FADH•) was recorded at 5 min after mixing the human nNOS FAD/NADPH domain with a 10-fold molar excess of NADPH in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 25 °C. B, the spectrum for air-stable semiquinone (FAD-FMNH•) was recorded at 10 min after mixing CaM-bound human nNOS flavin domain with a 5-fold molar excess of NADPH in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 25 °C, and the spectrum for disemiquinone (FADH•-FMNH•) was plotted based on the absorbance of FAD and FMN semiquinone species at several wavelengths.

The K m and k cat values for NADPH were measured between 0.5 and 4.0 μm NADPH at a constant concentration of 100 μm ferricyanide as an electron acceptor. The K m and k cat values for ferricyanide and cytochrome c were determined in the concentration ranges of 0.2–2.0 mm ferricyanide and 0.25–200 μm cytochrome c and at a constant concentration of 300 μm NADPH as electron donor, respectively. Spectra analysis was performed using a Shimazu model MSP UV-2000 spectrophotometer in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 25 °C.Table IApparent kinetic parameters for the CaM-bound human nNOS and iNOS flavin domainsElectron acceptorsKmnNOS flavin domainiNOS flavin domainμ mK3Fe(CN)6293.6 ± 84.1364.4 ± 80.4Cytochrome c0.2 ± 0.0414.9 ± 2.4NADPHaNADPH was used as an electron donor.0.2 ± 0.050.84 ± 0.18k catmin-1K3Fe(CN)68861.8 ± 654.413,294.9 ± 838.7Cytochrome c836.5 ± 34.14170.5 ± 576a NADPH was used as an electron donor. Open table in a new tab Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Stopped-flow reactions were performed using a Union Giken model RA401 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a photodiode array detector, which has a dead time of 5 ms. For rapid scan experiments, the spectra were collected between 440 and 700 nm (see Fig. 5) and between 500 and 700 nm (see Figs. 7 and 8). The one-electron-reduced air-stable semiquinone form of the two flavin domains were generated by incubating the oxidized flavin domains with a 5-fold molar excess of NADPH for 10 min at 25 °C. All stopped-flow experiments were performed in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, and at a constant temperature of 25 °C. The apparent rate constants for the reduction of the human nNOS and iNOS flavin domains and their air-stable semiquinone forms with NADPH were determined by plotting the absorbance changes at 457 and 520 nm against time (t) as previously described (26Guan Z-W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

The solutions were made anaerobic by successive flushing with oxygen-free argon gas with gentle agitation for more than 60 min. The absorption spectra were measured before and after illumination at 25 °C with a 300-watt halogen lamp at room temperature. Preparation of CaM-bound Enzymes—Both the neuronal and inducible NOS have a functional peptide of 20–25 amino acids located between the N-terminal oxygenase domain and C-terminal reductase domain, which binds calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds NOS in a 1:1 stoichiometry with very high affinity (K D values typically 1–2, 0.1, and 4 nm for nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS, respectively) (4Roman L.J. Martàsek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this work, the expression construct for either the human nNOS and iNOS flavin domain was co-expressed with human calmodulin III (CaM III) in an E. coli host and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both of the flavin domains absorbed to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B affinity column to form a greenish band, indicating the formation of an air-stable semiquinone form (25Matsuda H.

The enzymes were oxidized with ferricyanide solution before elution from the affinity column. The final products were at least 95% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE. The apparent molecular masses of the human nNOS and iNOS flavin domains were ∼80 and 74 kDa, respectively, which are in good agreement with the predicted size of the polypeptides based on the gene sequence (78.7 and 71.7 kDa, respectively). In addition, both the co-expressed human nNOS and iNOS flavin domains bound CaM with a ratio of 1:1 based on SDS-PAGE analysis (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). Reductase Activities of the CaM-bound Enzymes—Both NOS flavin domains can transfer electrons to several artificial electron acceptors. The apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for ferricyanide and cytochrome c were determined under turnover conditions and are listed in Table I. These values were not significantly changed by the further addition of Ca2+/CaM (data not shown). The iNOS flavin domain showed about 5-fold greater activity for cytochrome c and 1.5-fold greater ferricyanide reductase activity than the nNOS flavin domain. We have confirmed that ferricyanide mainly accepted electrons from FAD and cytochrome c mainly accepted electrons from FMN (26Guan Z-W. Iyanagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The data strongly suggest that intramolecular (i.e. FAD to FMN) electron transfer is faster in the iNOS flavin domain than it"
https://openalex.org/W1966642608,"Adenine nucleotide translocase-2 (ANT2) catalyzes the exchange of ATP for ADP across the mitochondrial membrane, thus playing an important role in maintaining the cytosolic phosphorylation potential required for cell growth. Expression of ANT2 is activated by growth stimulation of quiescent cells and is down-regulated when cells become growth-arrested. In this study, we address the mechanism of growth arrest repression. Using a combination of transfection, in vivo dimethyl sulfate mapping, and in vitro DNase I mapping experiments, we identified two protein-binding elements (Go-1 and Go-2) that are responsible for growth arrest of ANT2 expression in human diploid fibroblasts. Proteins that bound the Go elements were purified and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as members of the NF1 family of transcription factors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that NF1 was bound to both Go-1 and Go-2 in quiescent human diploid cells in vivo, but not in the same cells stimulated to growth by serum. NF1 binding correlated with the disappearance of ANT2 transcripts in quiescent cells. Furthermore, overexpression of NF1-A, -C, and -X in NIH3T3 cells repressed expression of an ANT2-driven reporter gene construct. Two additional putative repressor elements in the ANT2 promoter, an Sp1 element juxtaposed to the transcription start site and a silencer centered at nucleotide -332, did not appear to contribute to growth arrest repression. Thus, enhanced binding of NF1 is a key step in the growth arrest repression of ANT2 transcription. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a role for NF1 in growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1984674965,"The [URE3] phenotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae propagates by a prion mechanism, involving the aggregation of the normally soluble and highly helical protein Ure2. Previous data have shown that the protein spontaneously forms in vitro long, straight, insoluble fibrils at neutral pH that are similar to amyloids in that they bind Congo red and show green-yellow birefringence and have an increased resistance to proteolysis. These fibrils are not amyloids as they are devoid of a cross-β core. Here we further document the mechanism of assembly of Ure2p into fibrils. The critical concentration for Ure2p assembly is measured, and the minimal size of the nuclei that are the precursors of Ure2p fibrils is determined. Our data indicate that the assembly process is irreversible. As a consequence, the critical concentration is very low. By analyzing the elongation rates of preformed fibrils and combining the results with single-fiber imaging experiments of a variant Ure2p labeled by fluorescent dyes, we reveal the polarity of the fibrils and differences in the elongation rates at their ends. These results bring novel insight in the process of Ure2p assembly into fibrils and the mechanism of propagation of yeast prions.

These results bring novel insight in the process of Ure2p assembly into fibrils and the mechanism of propagation of yeast prions. Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and sheep scrapie are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. They are believed to be caused by a constitutive protein called prion protein (PrP) in an altered conformation (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This rare form of the protein is thought to convert the normal form to the infectious conformation in a catalytic manner (for review, see Ref. 2Caughey B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The molecular events at the origin of propagation are not yet elucidated. In the lower eukaryotes Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Podospora anserina prion proteins have been identified taking advantage of traits they confer (3Cox B.S.

Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are harmless for humans and constitute valuable model systems to characterize prion propagation. The [URE3] phenotype in S. cerevisiae is caused by a disorder in a signal transduction cascade that regulates nitrogen catabolism (8Magasanik B. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 283-317Google Scholar). Yeast cells exhibiting the [URE3] phenotype have the ability to take up ureidosuccinate, the structural analogue of allantoate, a poor nitrogen source in the presence of a good nitrogen source such as ammonium ions. This is believed to be because of the loss of the function of the protein determinant of [URE3], Ure2p, whose function is unknown although reported to be involved in yeast heavy metal and strong oxidant detoxification (9Rai R. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12826-12833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Importantly, Ure2p[URE3] promotes the conversion of the newly synthesized active Ure2p into an inactive form. Thus, the Ure2p[URE3] state is heritable, independent of any nucleic acid (10Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Native soluble Ure2p assembles in vitro into fibrils that exhibit the characteristics of amyloids in that they are about 20 nm wide and more than 1 μm long, bind thioflavin T and Congo Red, show yellow-green birefringence in polarized light upon Congo Red binding, and exhibit an increased resistance to proteolysis (11Thual C.

Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The assembly reaction follows a nucleation-growth mechanism with a lag phase that can be eliminated by the addition of minute amounts of preformed fibrils to a solution of native soluble Ure2p (11Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The assembly reaction of native full-length Ure2p into fibrils under physiologically relevant conditions is believed to be at the origin of the [URE3] phenotype in the yeast. Finally, the seeding property of preformed fibrils is believed to be at the origin of prion propagation in vivo (14Bousset L. Melki R. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We showed recently that hydrated fibrils formed from Ure2p at neutral pH are made of native-like, functional units (15Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, Ure2p assembly into protein fibrils appears reminiscent of the assembly of biological polymers such as actin filaments and microtubules. Native-like Ure2p fibrils, although not built on the cross β framework of amyloids (15Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), differ significantly from cytoskeletal polymers in that they persist in the presence of high denaturant (guanidine HCl) concentrations. This strongly suggests that the fibrillar scaffold is stabilized by a large number of hydrogen bonds and/or hydrophobic interactions. The structure of a protein is at the origin of its ability to assemble. It determines the nature of the polymers formed in the absence of any additional genetic information. It is the selection of a state of minimum free energy among many other states of higher free energy that is believed to allow a protein to assemble into macromolecular structures such as fibrils (17Oosawa F. Asakura S. Horecker B. Kaplan N.O. Marmur J. Scheraga H.A. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., London1975Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular events at the origin of the [URE3] phenotype and the role of Ure2p fibrils in this process we set up experiments to document in vitro the mechanism of Ure2p assembly into fibrils. We measured the critical concentration for Ure2p assembly into fibrils and determined the minimal size of the nuclei that are the precursors of Ure2p fibrils. Finally, we examined the polarity of Ure2p fibrils using both kinetic and single fiber imaging methods. Our data indicate that the assembly of Ure2p into fibrils is an irreversible reaction. As a consequence, the critical concentration is very low. Single fiber growth imaging of Ure2p labeled by fluorescent dyes revealed the polarity of the fibrils. Our results bring novel insight in the process of Ure2p assembly into protein fibrils. Construction of Ure2pC353 Variant Expression Vector in Escherichia coli—The Ure2pC353 variant expression vector was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis by replacing the GGT codon, encoding the glycine residue at position 353, by a TGT codon, encoding a cysteine.

Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer, Hewlett-Packard) using an extinction coefficient of 0.67 mg·cm2 at 280 nm and a molecular weight of 40,200. The proteins were stored at –80 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Assembly of Ure2p into Fibrils—The assembly of Ure2p into fibrils and the elongation reaction of preformed fibrils were carried out in buffer A and monitored using thioflavin T binding as described (18McParland V.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) using a Quantamaster QM 2000–4 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, NJ). Ure2p fibrils were negatively stained on carbon-coated grids (200 mesh) with 1% uranyl acetate and examined in a Philips EM 410 electron microscope. Sedimentation Assay—Soluble Ure2p at various concentrations (2–100 μm) in buffer A was assembled into fibrils at 10 °C, and the assembly reaction was followed using the thioflavin T binding assay. At steady state, aliquots (75 μl) were removed from each solution and subjected to ultracentrifugation (300,000 × g at 10 °C for 30 min) in a TL100 tabletop Beckman Ultracentrifuge. The amount of soluble Ure2p in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). Labeling of Ure2pC353—Ure2pC353 was desalted using a NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl. The eluted protein was incubated with a 10-fold excess of either Cy3-maleinide (Amersham Biosciences) or Oregon Green™ 488-maleimide (OG 1The abbreviation used is: OG, Oregon Green.; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or biotin-PEAK5-maleimide (Dojindo) for 30 min at 20 °C. Unreacted dyes were removed by another NAP-5 column equilibrated in the same buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Each protein solution was filtered by NANOSEP 300K OMEGA (PALL). The protein concentration was adjusted to 20 μm and stored at –80 °C in 20-μl aliquots. Observation of the Growth of Fluorescently Labeled Ure2pC353 Fibrils—OG-Ure2pC353 was mixed with biotin-Ure2pC353 (4:1) and incubated for 10 h at room temperature. After this incubation short entangled fibrils were present in solution. The fibril solution was slightly sonicated or sheared by four passages through a 26-gauge needle and mixed with an equal amount of soluble Cy3-Ure2pC353 solution. Aliquots of the mixture flowed into an observation chamber that assembled with coverslips in which the internal surfaces were coated with biotinylated bovine serum albumin and streptavidin at various times after the onset of the reaction. The chamber was washed twice with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl. To minimize photobleaching, the same buffer containing 2500 units/ml catalase (Fluka), 0.2 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), 6 mg/ml glucose, and 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (20Harada Y. Sakurada K. Aoki T. Thomas D.D. Yanagida T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) flowed into the chamber. Fibrils were observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with fluorescence cubes WIB and WIG (Olympus) for OG and Cy3, respectively. Green and red fluorescent images were recorded individually with a SIT camera (G2741–08, Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) on a DV tape and processed with Adobe Photoshop. To speed up the assembly process, which is temperature-dependent (11Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and avoid optical problems due to water condensation during image acquisition, the assembly of fluorescently labeled Ure2p was performed at room temperature. Additional Methods—Standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in 10% gels following the method described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out as described (11Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at 40,000 rpm and 18 °C. Data were analyzed to provide the apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients using the software SVEDBERG (22Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laues T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhaeuser Boston, Cambridge, MA1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar) and DC/DT (23Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Critical Concentration of Ure2p Assembly—Ure2p assembles under physiologically relevant conditions in a concentration-dependent manner into protein fibrils with a specific structure (11Thual C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), where the native-like conformation of the protein is retained (15Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The fibrils appear flexible and have a diameter of about 20 nm and a variable length often exceeding 1 μm (11Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The assembly reaction is cooperative and follows a lag phase. Polymerization of Ure2p is greatly accelerated by the addition of a small amount of preformed Ure2p fibrils (11Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), thus indicating that the formation of nuclei that requires the interaction of many Ure2p molecules is the limiting step in the assembly reaction. To further characterize the assembly process and its dynamic aspect we determined the critical concentration of Ure2p assembly into fibrils, i.e. the amount of soluble Ure2p that coexists with the fibrillar form of the molecule, by ultracentrifugation and by measurement of the elongation rates of preformed Ure2p fibrils. The critical concentration for Ure2p assembly into fibrils measured by the sedimentation assay is 0.12 μm. This concentration is overestimated, as short fibrils do not sediment as efficiently as longer fibrils. The kinetic parameters for elongation of Ure2p fibrils can be determined using Oosawa's plot (17Oosawa F. Asakura S. Horecker B. Kaplan N.O. Marmur J. Scheraga H.A. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., London1975Google Scholar) of the monomer concentration dependence of the rate of growth, J(c). The equation describes polymer growth in the case of a reversible polymerization: J(c) = dc/dt = k+[P]c–k–[P], where c and P represent the concentrations of monomer and polymer elongating sites, respectively, and k + and k – are the rate constants for monomer association to and dissociation from polymer ends, respectively. According to this equation, k +, is easily derived from the slope of the plot, whereas, k –, is given by the extrapolation of J(c) at c = 0. The critical concentration is given by solving J = 0 (intercept on the c axis). In the case of an irreversible polymerization, the above equation becomes J(c) = k +[P]c. Fig. 1A shows the initial growth rates of preformed Ure2p fibrils (2 μm) followed by thioflavin T binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble Ure2p (2.5–20 μm). A control reaction in which Ure2p (20 μm) was incubated under the same experimental conditions in the absence of added nuclei demonstrates the absence of de novo nucleation and assembly throughout the measurements. The J(c) plot derived from the data in Fig. 1A is presented in Fig. 1B. The rate of Ure2p fibril elongation varies strictly linearly with the concentration of soluble Ure2p. The critical concentration of Ure2p assembly derived from Fig. 1B is 40 nm. Size of Ure2p Nuclei—The lag time that precedes Ure2p assembly into fibrils is highly dependent on the concentrations of Ure2p. Typically, the lag phase decreased from 40 to 11 h upon increasing Ure2p concentration from 25 to 125 μm (Fig. 2A). Short oligomers of Ure2p are formed in the nucleation phase that precedes the assembly of Ure2p into fibrils (15Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The nucleus is a stable oligomer that has equal probabilities of lateral or longitudinal interaction with an additional Ure2p molecule (17Oosawa F. Asakura S. Horecker B. Kaplan N.O. Marmur J. Scheraga H.A. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., London1975Google Scholar, 24Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1908-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The size of the nucleus is equal to 2m–1, where m is the value of the slope of the log/log plot of the lag time versus the concentration of Ure2p. The value of m is 3.5; thus, the nucleation unit is made of 6 Ure2p molecules. This number is in very good agreement with the estimated number of Ure2p monomers (4Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 519-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Coustou V. Deleu C. Saupe S. Begueret J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 6Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) needed to form the smallest globular particles observed in the early stages of assembly using atomic force microscopy, which are 12–14 nm in diameter (15Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Polarity of Ure2p Fibrils—The measurement of the rate of elongation of freshly prepared preformed Ure2p fibrils in the presence of different concentrations of soluble Ure2p allows the determination of the association rate constant of Ure2p to fibril ends. This rate is derived from the slope of the J(c) plot (Fig. 1) and reflects the contribution of both ends to Ure2p fibril growth. A value of 0.38 μm–1 h–1 was found for the sum of the association rate constants. If the two ends of the fibrils are structurally and functionally identical they will grow at the same rate. In contrast, if they differ, they will grow at different rates. The measurement of the elongation rates of increasing concentrations of freshly prepared Ure2p fibrils (0–8 μm)inthe presence of constant concentrations of soluble Ure2p (20–40 μm) allows a better determination of the growth rates at each end of Ure2p fibrils. The data are presented in Fig. 3. A linear regression fits well the data, indicating either that Ure2p fibrils grow at the same rate from both ends or that the growth rate of one of the ends is negligible compared with that of the other end, thus resembling a case where only one of the ends can grow. Ure2p Fibrils Grow from Both Ends and Show a Polarity— The kinetic approach developed above does not allow us to distinguish between a polar or a non-polar elongation of Ure2p fibrils. To further document this issue, we decided to label the protein with fluorescent dyes and examine its assembly by fluorescence microscopy. Ure2p contains no cysteine residues. Its C-terminal amino acid is exposed to the solvent (25Bousset L. Belrhali H. Janin J. Melki R. Morera S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 39-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We therefore introduced a reactive cysteine residue into the protein by site-directed mutagenesis by replacing glycine 353 by a cysteine residue in order to label it with either Cy3 or Oregon Green 488 (OG). Fig. 4A shows the Cys-353 engineered into the protein to label it by an extrinsic fluorophore. To determine whether this modification influences the oligomeric state of the protein, we carried out sedimentation velocity experiments using soluble Ure2pC353 (1 mg/ml) and analyzed them to yield the apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients, g*(s). Two species were observed, with sedimentation coefficients of 4.3 s and 6.5 s with proportions of 85 and 15%, respectively. Identical results were found for wild type Ure2p in agreement with previous measurements (11Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Thual C. Bousset L. Komar A.A. Walter S. Buchner J. Cullin C. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1764-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We conclude from these findings that Ure2pC353 behaves in solution in a manner indistinguishable from wild type Ure2p. Both proteins exist in a dimeric and tetrameric form under the experimental conditions used in the measurements. The C-terminal domain of Ure2p extending from amino acid residue 95 to 354 does not interfere with the assembly process of full-length Ure2p (12Thual C. Bousset L. Komar A.A. Walter S. Buchner J. Cullin C. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1764-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, to make sure that the modification we introduced does not affect the assembly properties of the full-length protein, Ure2pC353 assembly reactions were compared with that of wild type Ure2p. The data are summarized in Fig. 4. The assembly kinetics of Ure2pC353 and wild type Ure2p are very similar (Fig. 4B). In addition, the two kinds of fibrils appear identical in shape and length when examined in the electron microscope (Fig. 4, C and D). The critical concentration of Ure2pC353 assembly into fibrils determined by the sedimentation assay is 0.1 μm and 25 nm by measurement of the initial growth rate of freshly prepared Ure2pC353 fibrils. Finally, Ure2pC353 nuclei are identical in size to that of wild type Ure2p (Fig. 4, E and F). We conclude from these findings that Ure2pC353 oligomerization and assembly into fibrils is indistinguishable from that of the wild type form of the protein. To visualize the growth polarity of Ure2p fibrils, soluble Ure2pC353 was labeled with the fluorescent dyes Cy3 (red) or OG (green). Aliquots of OG-labeled Ure2pC353 (20 μm) were incubated for 10 h at 20 °C to assemble into fibrils. Preformed OG-labeled Ure2pC353 fibrils were diluted 10-fold in a solution of soluble Cy3-labeled Ure2p (20 μm), and the mixture was incubated for 10 h. Newly formed fibrils are entangled (Fig. 5A), as they appear often when observed in the electron microscope (Fig. 5B). The analysis of the elongation of individual fibrils is hard to achieve on such fibrils. We therefore repeated this experiment after the separation of OG-labeled Ure2pC353 fibrils by a variety of treatments such as sonication or shearing by four passages though a 26-gauge needle. After dissociation, a large proportion of the fibrils attached to the glass surface, thus enabling us to visualize individual fibrils by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5C). At various times after mixing separated OG-labeled fibrils with Cy3-labeled soluble Ure2pC353, an aliquot was taken and observed using a fluorescence microscope. If the fibrils grow only from one of their ends i.e. unidirectionally, only one end of the green fibrils is expected to incorporate the red protein and, therefore, to exhibit a red stretch. In contrast, if both ends grow, whether at the same rate or at different rates, both ends of the green fibrils will incorporate the red protein and show red stretches. The data presented in Fig. 5D show that Ure2p fibrils grow preferentially from one of their ends. Cy3-labeled Ure2pC353 fibrils were found also to grow from their two ends when diluted in the presence of soluble OG-labeled Ure2pC353. A statistical analysis of 93 individual fibrils showed that 14 (15%) grow from both ends (inset in Fig. 5D), 51 (55%) grow only from one of their ends, whereas 28 (30%) did not grow from either end. The observation that the majority of the fibrils grow from only one end reflects the structural polarity of the fibrils. The existence of a non-negligible proportion of fibrils that grow from none of their ends may be due to the degradation of the lattice of the fibrils at their ends after the incorporation of Ure2p molecules in an irregular manner. Ure2p fibrils do not anneal in solution. 2L. Bousset and R. Melki, unpublished observations. This observation is further supported by the absence of any fibrils where the stretch made of newly assembled labeled protein is enclosed between two stretches of preformed labeled fibrils. We conclude from these observations that Ure2p fibrils are made by the polar arrangement of Ure2p molecules into a lattice that elongate preferentially from one end. We further conclude that the overall growth rate of the fibrils determined kinetically is the average of two different elongation rates at the two ends of the fibrils. The finding of β-sheet structure in mixtures containing Ure2p and a synthetic peptide reproducing the N-terminal 65 amino acids of Ure2p (13Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and upon assembly of refolded Sup35p NM fragment (26Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) has led to the widely believed view that β-sheet formation is the general mechanism that leads to Ure2p assembly. We demonstrated recently that the assembly of full-length Ure2p into protein fibrils under physiologically relevant conditions is not due to the loss of the tertiary structure of its functional domain (15Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct.

As a consequence, the fibrils are devoid of a cross β-core, and the protein retains its glutathione binding capacity in the fibrils. Thus, the assembly process of Ure2p differs significantly from that of β2-microglobulin and transthyretin, where the amyloid forms differ significantly from the normally soluble native monomeric (18McParland V.J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of DOK proteins establishes high affinity binding sites for other signaling molecules leading to activation of a signaling cascade. Here we show that Dok-R associates with c-Abl directly via a constitutive SH3-mediated interaction and that this binding requires a PMMP motif in the proline-rich tail of Dok-R. The Dok-R-Abl interaction is further enhanced by an active c-Abl kinase, which requires the presence of its SH2 domain. Interaction of Dok-R with c-Abl also results in an increase in c-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this increase in kinase activity correlates with a concomitant increase in c-Abl-mediated biological activity as measured by the formation of actin microspikes. Our data are the first to demonstrate that Dok-R and c-Abl interact in both a constitutive and inducible fashion and that Dok-R influences the intracellular kinase and biological activity of c-Abl.

Cell. 2001; 106: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One of the many targets of TK-mediated signaling pathways is the actin cytoskeleton (2Jamora C. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E101-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Actin cytoskeletal rearrangements are important fundamental events that occur during a variety of cellular processes such as adhesion, spreading, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (2Jamora C. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E101-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton involves cross-talk between a multitude of different signaling pathways involving kinases, integrins, and other adhesion molecules that target the actin cytoskeletal machinery. Many of these signaling proteins, including the integrin receptors and the cytosolic c-Abl tyrosine kinase, associate directly with the cytoskeleton. Tyrosine phosphorylation of docking and adapter proteins by receptor and cytosolic TKs promotes signal amplification by providing high affinity binding sites for numerous intracellular signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. Protein-protein interactions can also occur in a non-inducible manner as seen with the constitutive interaction between Src homology 3 (SH3) domains binding proline-rich motifs. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains on signaling proteins recognize phospholipids and assist in recruitment of the protein to the plasma membrane. In addition to their role in mediating protein interactions, many of these modular domains found in cytoplasmic TKs also serve to regulate the host kinase. Similar to Src family kinases, c-Abl kinase activity is tightly regulated through intramolecular interactions involving its amino-terminal SH3 domain-containing region (3Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J.

Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M.

Modulation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity has been shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton in both mammalian cells and during Drosophila axon guidance (7Woodring P.J. Litwack E.D. O'Leary D.D.

Moreover, the Bcr-Abl fusion protein resulting from a reciprocal translocation between the Bcr and c-Abl genes in chronic myelogenous leukemia contains increased intracellular kinase activity and leads to a polarized distribution of the oncoprotein in migrating cells (12Skourides P.A. Perera S.A. Ren R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion through integrins also regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin by c-Abl (13Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this manner, Abl kinases provide a direct link between TK-mediated signaling and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to a role for c-Abl in actin reorganization, several adapter and docking proteins have also been shown to be instrumental in regulating actin dynamics.

In this article, we show that Dok-R directly associate with c-Abl via both a constitutive and phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. Dok-R constitutively associates with c-Abl via its SH3 domain, which requires a PMMP motif on Dok-R. In addition, we demonstrate that this binding is enhanced upon activation of the Abl kinase and is also mediated through the c-Abl SH2 domain. Upon engagement with Dok-R, c-Abl can utilize Dok-R as a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro and within cells, which can be abrogated upon the addition of the pharmacological inhibitor of the c-Abl kinase, STI571. The association of Dok-R with c-Abl leads to an increase in c-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. Importantly, expression of Dok-R also enhances c-Abl-dependent biological activity as measured by cytoskeletal rearrangements of condensed actin cell protrusions. These results are the first to demonstrate that Dok-R and c-Abl associate both constitutively and in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner and suggest that a mechanism of processive binding between Dok-R and c-Abl may physiologically regulate the kinase activity of c-Abl.

Immunofluorescence and Confocal Analysis of Cell Protrusion Assay—For actin staining of membrane protrusions, HEK293-Vector, HEK293-Dok-R, and HEK293-Dok-RΔPRR cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with PECE-c-Abl or empty vector by LipofectAMINE and then serum-starved for 18 h at 37 °C before harvesting. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P40 (Sigma) for 10 min. Samples were blocked in 5% goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) and then incubated with antibodies to actin (1:500), c-Abl (1:500), or Dok-R (1:2000) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (1:100) or rhodamine (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature (28Master Z. Jones N. Tran J. Kerbel S. Dumont D.J. EMBO J. 2001; PubMed Google Scholar). Slides were mounted using Aquapolymount (Polysciences Inc.) and visualized using Zeiss Axiovert 100 m laser scanning microscope (LSM) confocal microscopy. Analyses were performed using LSM510 (version 2.3) scanning software (Zeiss), and images were captured at ×630 magnification. Actin cell protrusion counts were performed at this magnification on the Zeiss Axiovert laser scanning microscope. For cell protrusion analysis, we scored cells either as having or not having protrusions per field with an average of 10 fields. We also scored cells by counting the average number of protrusions per cell per sample with sample sizes equaling 60 or more. A Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance with a 95% confidence interval between all STI571 versus Me2SO treatments and between certain cell lines. All experiments were repeated at least twice with at least two replicates per experiment. In Vitro c-Abl Kinase Assays—Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Abl antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C.

Kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. c-Abl immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed and half the gel was used to resolve c-Abl expression by Western analysis using anti-c-Abl antibodies while the other half was dried and exposed to phosphorimager analysis and quantification (ImageQuant). The representative values of c-Abl kinase activity were reflected as the value of GST-Dok-RΔPH phosphorylation over the amount of immunoprecipitated c-Abl in each of the samples. All experiments were performed twice or more times with similar results.

Res. 2000; 86: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Originally, Dok-R, and its related member Dok, were identified as phosphoproteins migrating at relative molecular masses of 56 and 62 kDa, respectively, from cells expressing Bcr-Abl (22Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 23Di Cristofano A. Carpino N. Dunant N. Friedland G. Kobayashi R. Strife A. Wisniewski D.

Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since the nature of the interaction between Abl and Dok-R has yet to be resolved, we set out to determine whether Dok-R could associate with c-Abl and if so, to define the mechanism behind this interaction. COS-1 cells transfected with HA-tagged Dok-R (HA-Dok-R) were either left untreated or stimulated with EGF, which is known to activate c-Abl (6Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As previously demonstrated, Dok-R becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation and can coimmunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR (Fig. 1A, below) (32Jones N. Dumont D.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1057-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Dok-R immunoprecipitates contained c-Abl in both untreated and EGF-stimulated COS-1 cells and similarly, c-Abl immunoprecipitates contained Dok-R (Fig. 1A, top). These results suggest that Dok-R and c-Abl may associate in a constitutive manner. To determine if Abl kinase activity enhances its constitutive association with Dok-R, we chose a system that was independent of EGF stimulation to activate c-Abl. We treated murine parental 32D cells and 32D-p210Bcr-Abl stable cells, where Bcr-Abl is activated (39Avanzi G.C. Lista P. Giovinazzo B. Miniero R. Saglio G. Benetton G. Coda R. Cattoretti G. Pegoraro L. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 69: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 40Daley G.Q. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9312-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), with either the small molecule Abl inhibitor STI571 or Me2SO as a control. Dok-R, endogenous to these cells, was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in the 32D-p210Bcr-Abl stable cell line and could bind p210Bcr-Abl in the presence or absence of STI571 treatment (Fig. 1B, top). Interestingly, the addition of STI571 to 32D-p210Bcr-Abl cells resulted in diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-R and dramatically reduced coimmunoprecipitation of phosphorylated Bcr-Abl (Fig. 1B, top). Similar treatments of STI571 to 32D and 32D-p210 cells, were immunoprecipitated using anti-Bcr antibodies and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. Although more p210Bcr-Abl was immunoprecipitated in the 32D-p210 STI571-treated lane, there was a 2-fold decrease in p210Bcr-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation and co-precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Dok-R (Fig. 1B, bottom). These results demonstrate that the Dok-R and Abl association does not require Abl kinase activity, but is enhanced upon activation of Abl. The SH3 Domain of c-Abl Mediates Binding to a PmmP266 Motif on Dok-R—The constitutive interaction between Dok-R and c-Abl led us to investigate the possibility that binding between these proteins may be mediated through the SH3 domain of c-Abl and one of the eight PXXP motifs found within the carboxyl tail of Dok-R. In order to bypass the requirement of stimulating cells with EGF, we utilized the property that overexpression of c-Abl in COS-1 cells leads to its kinase activation (41Wang J.Y. Oncogene Res. 1988; 3: 293-298PubMed Google Scholar). To further define the site of interaction between Dok-R and c-Abl, we introduced mutant forms of Dok-R with c-Abl in 293T or COS-1 cells (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, we observed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Abl upon coexpression with wild-type Dok-R (Fig. 2B). This enhanced phosphorylation was retained with a Dok-R mutant carrying a termination codon (at amino acid 321) midway through the proline-rich tail (Dok-RΔC-PRR), but was completely abolished with a Dok-R mutant completely lacking the proline- and tyrosine-rich tail (PRR) by placing a stop codon at amino acid 257 (Dok-RΔPRR) (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the immunoprecipitation of c-Abl lead to the coimmunoprecipitation of Dok-R and Dok-RΔC-PRR, but not with Dok-RΔPRR, indicating that the amino-terminal half of the PRR is responsible for Dok-R binding c-Abl. Additionally, inverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments resulted in similar findings in that Dok-R or Dok-RΔC-PRR could coimmunoprecipitate c-Abl whereas Dok-RΔPRR could not (data not shown). These results indicate that the c-Abl/Dok-R interaction requires the proline- and tyrosine-rich region (PRR) of Dok-R between amino acids 257 and 321. In order to further delineate the c-Abl binding site within the amino-terminal PRR of Dok-R, several different proline Dok-R mutants were engineered and co-transfected along with c-Abl (Fig. 2A). The different Dok-R mutants tested were able to coimmunoprecipitate c-Abl, however, the Dok-RAMMA mutant, where prolines 263 and 266 are engineered to alanine, displayed a decrease in c-Abl and Dok-R tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the constitutive interaction between c-Abl and Dok-R is at least partially mediated via a PmmP266 motif on Dok-R. To confirm that the c-Abl SH3 domain can associate with Dok-R through its PMMP motif, we performed several in vitro binding experiments using bacterially purified recombinant GST fusion proteins. Cell extracts prepared from c-Abl transfected cells were incubated with either GST-beads or with GST-Dok-RΔPH-beads. Bound proteins were subsequently resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for c-Abl. c-Abl did not co-precipitate with GST alone, however, a distinct band representing c-Abl was seen in mixing experiments with GST-Dok-RΔPH (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the specificity of the SH3 domain of c-Abl for Dok-R was illustrated by in vitro binding experiments where cell extracts from HA-Dok-R-transfected cells were mixed with purified GST-SH3 domains of c-Abl, Vav, Spectrin, and Lck. Specifically, the c-Abl GST-SH3 protein, but not the others, could precipitate Dok-R (Fig. 2E). Participation of the Dok-R PMMP motif in associating c-Abl was further illustrated by in vitro binding experiments where all the Dok-R proteins tested could be precipitated by the SH3 domain of c-Abl, except for Dok-RΔPRR and Dok-RAMMA"
https://openalex.org/W2040426765,"L35 and FAO cells were derived as single cell isolates from H35 cells. Whereas L35 cells do not express microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which regulates lipoprotein secretion, they express CYP7A1, which regulates bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. FAO cells display the opposite phenotype (<i>i.e.</i> expression of MTP but not CYP7A1). We examined the molecular basis of the transcriptional inactivation of the MTP gene in L35 cells. Nested deletion and mutagenesis studies show that a conserved DR1 element within the 135-bp proximal MTP promoter is responsible for differential expression by L35 and FAO cells. Yeast one-hybrid screening identified apolipoprotein A1 regulatory protein-1/chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (ARP-1/COUP-TFII) and retinoid X receptor (RXRα) as the protein factors that can bind to the conserved DR1 element. Nuclear extracts from L35 cells contained 2-fold more ARP-1/COUP-TFII and 50% less RXRα than those from FAO cells. Immunologic studies show that in L35 cells, ARP-1/COUP-TFII is bound to the DR1 element, whereas in FAO cells, a complex containing RXRα is bound to the DR1 element. Co-transfection studies show that ARP-1/COUP-TFII repressed MTP promoter activity by ∼70% in FAO hepatoma cells, whereas RXRα and its ligand 9-<i>cis</i>-retinoic acid increased MTP promoter activity by 6-fold in L35 cells. The combined data suggest that in the context of the MTP promoter, ARP-1/COUP-TFII (repressor) and a complex containing RXRα (inducer) compete for the DR1 element. Analysis of the CYP7A1 promoter revealed that it is ∼5-fold more active in L35 cells than in FAO cells. Co-transfection of an ARP-1/COUP-TFII expression vector showed that it enhances CYP7A1 promoter activity by 6-fold in FAO cells. These combined findings indicate that ARP-1/COUP-TFII acts as both a transcriptional repressor (of MTP) and as a transcription activator (of CYP7A1). This dual function of ARP-1/COUP-TFII may play an important role in determining the metabolic phenotype of individual liver cells."

Bacteria contain an NADPH-dependent GltS (NADPHGltS) whose catalytically active αβ protomer (α subunit, 162 kDa; and β subunit, 52.3 kDa) contains one FAD, one FMN, and three different iron-sulfur clusters. Eukaryotic GltS is reported to be NADH-dependent and is formed by a single polypeptide chain derived from the fusion of bacterial α and β subunits. On the basis of sequence similarities, NADH-dependent GltS should have a cofactor content and overall architecture similar to those of the well characterized Azospirillum brasilense NADPH-GltS. Finally, cyanobacteria and plants contain an Fd-dependent GltS (Fd-GltS) similar in size, primary and tertiary structure, cofactor content, and function to the α subunit of NADPH-GltS. In these organisms, Fd-GltS is reported to be mainly involved in re-assimilation of ammonia released during photorespiration or from storage compounds, whereas NADH-dependent GltS appears to be mainly responsible for primary ammonia assimilation in roots (2Temple S.J. Vance C.P. Gantt J.S. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 51-56Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A. brasilense NADPH-GltS is, indeed, the best studied GltS form. By combining a number of kinetic and spectroscopic studies on the αβ holoenzyme and on its isolated α and β subunits, a model of NADPH-GltS has been proposed (1Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which was fully confirmed and refined after the determination of the three-dimensional structures of the NADPH-GltS α subunit (3Binda C.

According to such a model (Fig. 1), the GltS overall reaction takes place at three distinct catalytic subsites: NADPH binds and is oxidized at the pyridine nucleotide site within the β subunit with FAD reduction to the hydroquinone form. Reducing equivalents are transferred from FAD (on the β subunit) to FMN (on the α subunit) through at least two of the three iron-sulfur clusters of GltS (viz. the [3Fe-4S]0,1+ cluster in the α subunit and at least one of the two low potential [4Fe-4S]1+,2+ clusters present in the holoenzyme) (5Vanoni M.A. Edmondson D.E. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4613-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Ravasio S. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5533-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 2-OG binds in the FMN domain of the α subunit (the enzyme synthase site); is converted to the 2-iminoglutarate intermediate upon addition of ammonia; and is reduced to l-Glu by the reduced FMN cofactor, which shuttles between the quinone and hydroquinone forms (6Ravasio S. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5533-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ammonia originates from hydrolysis of glutamine at the N-terminal PurF (type II) glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) domain of the GltS α subunit and is transferred to the FMN/2-OG-binding site through an intramolecular ammonia tunnel (3Binda C.

Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, crystallization experiments with the NADPH-GltS αβ protomer have not been successful yet, and it has not been possible to crystallize the Fd·Fd-GltS complex. Therefore, several aspects of GltS mechanism of action rely only on solution information. For example, conformational changes within the α subunit have been proposed to take place upon association with the β subunit to yield the holoenzyme, with the resulting tight coupling of glutamine hydrolysis and glutamate synthesis at the GAT and synthase sites of the α subunit, respectively (8Vanoni M.A. Fischer F. Ravasio S. Verzotti E. Edmondson D.E. Hagen W.R. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intramolecular electron transfer pathway from FAD to FMN through the enzyme iron-sulfur clusters remains to be established. To gain insight into the quaternary structure of the GltS αβ protomer, we carried out small-angle x-ray scattering measurements on solutions of the NADPH-GltS αβ holoenzyme and its isolated α and β subunits. Masses and shapes of the protein species were determined by ab initio analyses of the scattering data. Rigid body modeling of the solution scattering patterns of the α subunit was performed using the known atomic coordinates of the GltS α subunit (3Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A.

A model of the GltS β subunit based on the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal region of porcine recombinant dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) (9Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was employed to build a functional model of the GltS αβ protomer, and the resulting protein heterodimer was used to further construct the molecular model of the GltS (αβ)4 tetrameric species. The models account for the available solution scattering patterns of the holoenzyme and of the individual subunits and agree with the biochemical evidence available on GltS. Sample Preparation—The GltS holoenzyme and its α and β subunits were prepared as described (8Vanoni M.A. Fischer F. Ravasio S. Verzotti E. Edmondson D.E. Hagen W.R. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Stabile H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Eur. J.

Prior to experiments, enzymes were transferred to Buffer A (25 mm Hepes/KOH buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-25 columns, concentrated to 20–40 mg/ml with centrifugal concentrators (Centricon 30, Amicon, Inc.), and stored frozen at –80 °C after rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. For small-angle x-ray scattering measurements, solutions were diluted in Buffer A and brought to 5 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration of the samples prior to measurements and of those recovered from the measurement cell was determined spectrophotometrically using known extinction coefficients (8Vanoni M.A. Fischer F.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217399) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The activities and electrophoretic patterns of proteins recovered from the measurements were also determined to check for enzyme degradation upon x-ray irradiation. Scattering Experiments and Data Processing—The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected on the X33 camera (13Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Boulin C.J. Kempf R. Gabriel A. Koch M.H.J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1988; 269: 312-320Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory on the storage ring DORIS III of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron using multiwire proportional chambers with delay line readout (15Gabriel A. Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The scattering patterns were recorded at a sample-detector distance of 2.2 m, covering the range of momentum transfer 0.15 < s < 3.5 nm–1 (s = 4πsin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 0.15 nm is the x-ray wavelength). The solution of the β subunit was measured at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml; solutions of the α subunit were measured at several concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 mg/ml; and those of the GltS holoenzyme were measured at concentrations ranging from 1 to 23 mg/ml. To check for radiation damage during the scattering experiments, the data were collected in 15 successive 1-min frames. The individual frames were averaged after normalization to the intensity of the incident beam and corrected for the detector response, and the scattering of the buffer was subtracted using the programs PRIMUS and SAPOKO. 2Konarev, P. V., Volkov, V. V., Sokolova, A. V., Koch, M. H. J., and Svergun, D. I. (2003) J. Appl. Crystallogr., in press. The difference curves were scaled for the solute concentration and extrapolated to infinite dilution following standard procedures (16Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). The maximum particle dimensions (D max) were estimated using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (17Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The forward scattering (I(0)) and the radius of gyration (R g) were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (18Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar) assuming that, at very small angles (s < 1.3/R g), the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0)exp(–(sR g)2/3). These parameters were also computed from the entire scattering patterns using the indirect transform package GNOM (19Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2984) Google Scholar), which also provides the distance distribution function (p(r)) of the particle. The molecular masses of the solutes were evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). Ab Initio Shape Determination—Low resolution models of the proteins were generated ab initio by the program DAMMIN (20Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The program represents the particle as a collection of M ≫ 1 densely packed beads inside a sphere with the diameter D max. Each bead belongs either to the particle or to the solvent, and the shape is described by a binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, simulated annealing is employed to search for a compact model that fits the experimental data I exp(s) to minimize discrepancy (Equation 1), χ2=1N-1∑jIexp(sj)-cIcalc(sj)σ(sj)2(Eq. 1) where N is the number of experimental points, c is a scaling factor, and I calc(s j) and σ(s j) are the calculated intensity and the experimental error at the momentum transfer s j, respectively. Prior to shape analysis by DAMMIN, a constant is subtracted from each data point to force the s –4 decay of the intensity at higher angles following Porod's law (21Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press Limited, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) for homogeneous particles. The resulting “shape scattering” curve (i.e. scattering due to the excluded volume of the particle with unit density) in the range up to s = 2.0 nm–1 was used for ab initio shape restoration. The excluded volume of the hydrated particle (Porod volume) was computed from the shape scattering curve using Equation 2 (21Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press Limited, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). V=2π2I(0)/∫0∞s2I(s)ds(Eq. 2) The outer parts of the scattering patterns (s > 2.0 nm–1) dominated by the scattering from the internal structure were discarded in the shape analysis. The shapes were reconstructed ab initio using symmetry restrictions when appropriate (P222 symmetry for the tetrameric α subunit and GltS) and also without symmetry restrictions. High Resolution Models—The crystallographic model of the dimeric A. brasilense GltS α subunit was taken from Protein Data Bank (22Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27870) Google Scholar) code 1ea0 (3Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To represent the structure of the GltS β subunit, the crystallographic coordinates of residues 50–520 of pig liver DPD (Protein Data Bank code 1h7w) (9Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were used. This region of DPD has 39% sequence similarity (25% identical residues and 14% conservative substitutions) to the GltS β subunit and contains the FAD- and NADP-binding sites and the two N-terminal [4Fe-4S] clusters of the enzyme. To build the αβ protomer, the GltS β subunit model was docked onto the GltS α subunit as described under “Results and Discussion,” and the heterodimer model coordinates were generated using the program MASSHA (23Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 527-532Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Rigid body modeling of the quaternary structure of α4 and GltS in solution was performed in the same angular range (s < 2 nm–1) as for the ab initio modeling; no attempt was made to model the scattering at higher angles, which is defined by tertiary rather than quaternary structure. The scattering amplitudes of the individual subunits were calculated using the program CRYSOL (24Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar), which takes the scattering from the excluded volume and from the hydration shell into account. Given the atomic coordinates, the program can either fit the experimental scattering curve or, in the absence of the experimental data, predict the theoretical scattering pattern (I(s)) expressed in terms of spherical harmonics (Equation 3), I(s)=2π2∑l=0∞∑m=-ll|Alm(s)|2(Eq. 3) where complex function A lm(s) is the partial scattering amplitudes of the particle (24Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). To exploit symmetry restrictions for model building, the program GLOBSYMM was written. This program performs a global search of the quaternary structure of a symmetric oligomer built from monomers (point symmetries Pnk, where n = 2... 6, and k = 1,2 are currently supported). First, the partial scattering amplitudes of the monomer (A lm(s)) centered at the origin in a reference orientation are computed from the high resolution model using CRYSOL. Rotation of the monomer by the Euler angles α, β, and γ, followed by its displacement by the vector r = (r,ψ,φ) and generation of all symmetry mates, permits one to construct a symmetric oligomer. The partial scattering amplitudes of the rotated and shifted monomer (B lm(s) = B lm(s,α,β,γ,r )) can be analytically expressed via the amplitudes (A lm(s)) and the elements of the finite rotation matrix (25Edmonds A.R. Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics: Investigations in Physics. 4. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1957: 53-60Crossref Google Scholar) as described (26Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 798-802Crossref Google Scholar). Assuming without loss of generality that the n-fold axis coincides with the z axis and that the 2-fold axis in the case of Pn2 symmetry coincides with the y axis, symmetry mate generation leads to selection rules for the spherical harmonics so that the scattering from the entire oligomer is as in Equation 4, Icalc(s,r,α,β,γ)=2π2(nk)2∑l=0∞∑m=-ll|Blm(s)|2(Eq. 4) where the summation runs only over m equal to zero or multiples of n; and moreover, terms of order l0 with odd l as well as all imaginary parts vanish in the case of k = 2. Equation 4 permits one to rapidly compute the scattering intensity from the symmetric oligomer, making it possible to employ an exhaustive search of the positional and rotational parameters to minimize discrepancy (Equation 1). The magnitude of the vector r can be constrained by the experimental value of the radius of gyration of the oligomer; and for k = 1, it is sufficient to consider only displacements along the x axis. The global search of four (for k = 1) or six (for k = 2) positional parameters is performed over the allowed range of the magnitude of the shift, whereby the angular parameters are taken from a quasi-uniform Fibonacci grid (27Svergun D.I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 391-402Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The model of tetrameric α4 was constructed by GLOBSYMM from α subunits assuming P222 symmetry. After addition of the β subunit to each of the α subunits in the α4 model, the scattering amplitude from the αβ protomer was computed using CRYSOL, and the GltS structure was modeled interactively in terms of entire αβ protomers using the program MASSHA (23Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 527-532Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For this, the latter program was modified to perform local rigid body refinement against the scattering data for symmetric oligomers using Equation 4. The volume fractions of monomers and dimers in the solution of β subunits were computed by the program OLIGOMER2 using the scattering patterns from the homology model of the monomeric subunit (see above) and from that of the dimeric model constructed as described under “Results and Discussion.” Overall Parameters—The experimental scattering patterns from the solutions of the GltS α subunit, the GltS holoenzyme, and its β subunit are presented in Fig. 2 (curves 1–3, respectively), and Table I summarizes the structural parameters obtained from these data sets. The estimated molecular masses of the solutes are compared with the values predicted from the sequences of monomeric proteins in Table I. The comparison indicates tetrameric assemblies for the GltS α subunit and holoenzyme, whereas for the β subunit, the effective molecular mass is between that of the monomeric and dimeric protein forms. The accuracy of molecular mass determination by solution scattering is limited, in particular, by the uncertainty in the measured protein concentrations required for the data normalization. As an additional check, the excluded (Porod) particle volumes were also analyzed, taking advantage of the fact that the Porod volume is computed without model assumptions and does not depend on data normalization (21Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press Limited, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). For globular proteins, Porod (i.e. hydrated) volumes in nm3 are about twice the molecular masses in kDa. As shown in Table I, the Porod volumes of all the solutes are in good agreement with the estimated molecular masses. Thus, it can be concluded that both the GltS α subunit and holoenzyme are tetrameric in solution, whereas dissolved β subunits form an approximately equimolar mixture of monomers and dimers. The finding that the GltS holoenzyme forms tetramers at the protein concentrations used in these experiments is in perfect agreement with previous mass determination experiments by analytical gel filtration (10Stabile H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2720-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the same experiments, the GltS α subunit eluted in a broad peak centered around the elution position of apoferritin (443 kDa) (10Stabile H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2720-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As the α subunit is unlikely to form trimers, it was suggested that the GltS α subunit in solution could be an asymmetric dimer (324 kDa), similar to that found in the crystallographic model (3Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The present experiments correct such an interpretation and conclusively demonstrate that the GltS α subunit forms tetramers in solution at concentrations above 1 mg/ml. The finding that the β subunit may form dimers in solution also corrects previous gel filtration results pointing to monomeric β subunits (10Stabile H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2720-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the β subunit was shifted toward monomers during the gel filtration experiments (10Stabile H. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2720-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); moreover, quantitative analysis of these experiments is shape-dependent and thus less accurate than the present small-angle x-ray scattering results.Table ISummary of structural parameters computed from the scattering dataSampleRgDmaxMMMMmonV pχsχoχnmnmkDakDanm 3α7.3 ± 0.219 ± 1670 ± 501621250 ± 600.66.02.3GltS7.7 ± 0.221 ± 1940 ± 1002141440 ± 650.88.32.2β3.3 ± 0.211 ± 188 ± 1552140 ± 150.92.5/3.30.9 Open table in a new tab The distance distribution functions (p(r)) of α4 and the GltS holoenzyme computed from the experimental data (Fig. 3) are typical for globular hollow particles, with a pronounced maximum shifted toward larger distances (16Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the two functions are nearly identical up to intraparticle distances of ∼6 nm and display similar profiles also at larger distances. GltS has a larger maximum size, and its p(r) goes systematically above that of α4 for distances >6 nm. Given that GltS additionally contains β subunits compared with α4, this observation suggests that the arrangement of α subunits in the GltS tetramer is similar to that in α4 (leading to similar distributions at smaller distances), whereas the β subunits are located at the periphery of GltS, increasing the maximum particle size. Shape Determination—Typical ab initio low resolution models of α4 and GltS restored assuming P222 symmetry are displayed in Fig. 4, and the curves computed from these models neatly fit the experimental data (Fig. 2; the corresponding χS values are given in Table I). Superposition of the shapes of α4 and GltS in Fig. 4 (lower row) indicates that the two proteins have a similar overall structure, but there is an extra volume on the periphery of GltS providing space for the β subunits. This result is in agreement with the above analysis of the overall parameters and of the p(r) functions. The reconstructions without symmetry restrictions yielded low resolution models similar to those in Fig. 4, also suggesting that the β subunits are located on the periphery of the GltS tetramer. The ab initio model of β subunit species presented in Fig. 4 (third row) suggests that the protein has an elongated shape in solution. This model should, however, be treated with caution given the fact that the solution of the β subunit appears to be a mixture, and shape determination in this case provides a tentative model, intermediate between monomeric and dimeric subunits. Rigid Body Modeling Strategy—The above results clearly indicate that the arrangement of α subunits in GltS holoenzyme tetramers should be similar to that in tetrameric α4. Based on this, the following strategy for rigid body modeling was chosen. (i) A model of α4 was constructed against its scattering pattern using the high resolution crystal structure of the monomeric α subunit (3Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). (ii) A putative model of the αβ protomer was built, and β subunits were added to the model of α4, yielding a tentative model of the quaternary structure of GltS. (iii) This tentative model was further refined by rigid body movements of the αβ protomers to fit the experimental scattering data of GltS. Rigid Body Modeling of the α4 Tetramer—As α subunits form a tightly coupled dimer in the crystal (3Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we first attempted to construct the model of α4 as a dimer of crystallographic α dimers. This attempt failed, as the experimental data from α4 could only be poorly fitted by a model of two rather separated α2 dimers displaying no contacts between each other, and even the best model yielded a very high χ0 value of 6.0 (Fig. 2, curve 1). It was concluded that the contacts between monomers in α4 should be different from those in the crystal, and a global search was performed using GLOBSYMM based on the monomeric α subunit assuming P222 symmetry. The best model (Figs. 5 and 6, upper rows) yields a good fit to the experimental data with χ = 2.3 (Fig. 2, curve 1) and agrees well with the ab initio shape of α4. In this mo"

NAD+ synthetase converts nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide to NAD+ via an adenylylated intermediate. All of the known eukaryotic NAD+ synthetases are glutamine-dependent, hydrolyzing glutamine to glutamic acid to provide the attacking ammonia. In the prokaryotic world, some NAD+ synthetases are glutamine-dependent, whereas others can only use ammonia. Earlier, we noted a perfect correlation between presence of a domain related to nitrilase and glutamine dependence and then proved in the accompanying paper (Bieganowski, P., Pace, H. C., and Brenner, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33049–33055) that the nitrilase-related domain is an essential, obligate intramolecular, thiol-dependent glutamine amidotransferase in the yeast NAD+ synthetase, Qns1. Independently, human NAD+ synthetase was cloned and shown to depend on Cys-175 for glutamine-dependent but not ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity. Additionally, it was claimed that a 275 amino acid open reading frame putatively amplified from human glioma cell line LN229 encodes a human ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase and this was speculated largely to mediate NAD+ synthesis in human muscle tissues. Here we establish that the so-called NADsyn2 is simply ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase from Pseudomonas, which is encoded on an operon with nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase and, in some Pseudomonads, with nicotinamidase. Nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthetases catalyze the last step in NAD+ metabolism in the de novo, import, and salvage pathways that originate from tryptophan (or aspartic acid), nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide, respectively, and converge on nicotinic acid mononucleotide. NAD+ synthetase converts nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide to NAD+ via an adenylylated intermediate. All of the known eukaryotic NAD+ synthetases are glutamine-dependent, hydrolyzing glutamine to glutamic acid to provide the attacking ammonia. In the prokaryotic world, some NAD+ synthetases are glutamine-dependent, whereas others can only use ammonia. Earlier, we noted a perfect correlation between presence of a domain related to nitrilase and glutamine dependence and then proved in the accompanying paper (Bieganowski, P., Pace, H. C., and Brenner, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33049–33055) that the nitrilase-related domain is an essential, obligate intramolecular, thiol-dependent glutamine amidotransferase in the yeast NAD+ synthetase, Qns1. Independently, human NAD+ synthetase was cloned and shown to depend on Cys-175 for glutamine-dependent but not ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity. Additionally, it was claimed that a 275 amino acid open reading frame putatively amplified from human glioma cell line LN229 encodes a human ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase and this was speculated largely to mediate NAD+ synthesis in human muscle tissues. Here we establish that the so-called NADsyn2 is simply ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase from Pseudomonas, which is encoded on an operon with nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase and, in some Pseudomonads, with nicotinamidase. NAD+ is essential as a co-enzyme for oxidation and reduction reactions and as a substrate for NAD+-consuming enzymes such as the Sir2-related lysine deacetylases, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, and the cyclic ADP-ribose synthetases (1Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Because the reaction catalyzed (amidation of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide) is the final common step in NAD+ biosynthesis from the de novo, import, and salvage pathways, NAD+ synthetase is an essential enzyme in yeast (3Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic NAD+ synthetase was first characterized 45 years ago in extracts from yeast and human cells and shown to use glutamine as the ammonia source and to work in an ATP-Mg2+-dependent manner through an adenylylated nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide intermediate (4Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 488-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Escherichia coli NAD+ synthetase (6Spencer R.L. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 385-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bacillis subtilis NAD+ synthetase (7Rizzi M. Nessi C. Mattevi A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Galizzi A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5125-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) cannot use glutamine while Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAD+ synthetase can use glutamine (8Cantoni R. Branzoni M. Labo M. Rizzi M. Riccardi G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3218-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the N terminus of M. tuberculosis NAD+ synthetase was observed to be extended with respect to the ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetases by ∼300 amino acids, no similarity was observed to any known glutamine amidotransferase domain (8Cantoni R. Branzoni M. Labo M. Rizzi M. Riccardi G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3218-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). Two years ago, we classified the nitrilase superfamily into 13 branches, most of which consist of amidases of various specificities, and observed that presence of a nitrilase-related domain correlates with glutamine dependence in prokaryotic NAD+ synthetases and is found in all of the eukaryotic NAD+ synthetases (10Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, we made the explicit prediction that the nitrilase-related domain accounts for glutamine dependence by serving as the glutamine amidotransferase domain for the associated NAD+ synthetase (10Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar, 11Brenner C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cloning of the yeast Gln-dependent NAD+ synthetase, Qns1, allowed us to show that Cys-175 is required for glutaminase activity and glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase activity in vitro (3Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In vivo experiments established that neither the active-site mutants in the NAD+ synthetase domain nor in the glutaminase domain allow physiological function despite the residual ammonia-dependent activity of the latter mutants (3Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic experiments showed that the ammonia released from the glutaminase active site follows an obligate intramolecular path to the pyridine-nucleotide substrate bound at the other active site (3Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Without reference to structures (12Pace H.C. Hodawadekar S.C.

Surprisingly, Tsuchiya and co-workers (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) claim that a second glutamine-independent NAD+ synthetase they term human NADsyn2 is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart and that this enzyme may largely mediate NAD+ synthesis in these tissues. Here we show that NADsyn2 is an ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase of Pseudomonal origin, which is encoded on an operon with nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase and, in some Pseudomonads, with nicotinamidase. Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequence Analyses—DNA sequence searches were performed with MEGA-BLAST (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59441) Google Scholar) against all of the non-redundant data available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the Sanger Center. Protein sequence homologs were identified using BLASTP without position specific iteration (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). DNA Sequences from a Human Chromosome 22 CpG Library Do Not Consist Entirely of Chromosome 22 cDNAs—In their attempt to clone human NAD synthetase(s), Tsuchiya and co-workers (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) interrogated the public nucleic acid repositories with the sequence of B. subtilis NAD+ synthetase (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One of two sequences they identified as encoding an NAD+ synthetase homolog (GenBank™ accession number HSA236685) had been deposited as a 1007-nucleotide sequence from a CpG island library prepared from flow-sorted human chromosome 22 (18Cross S.H. Clark V.H. Simmen M.W. Bickmore W.A. Maroon H. Langford C.F. Carter N.P. Bird A.P. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ninety-nine clones from the chromosome 22 library had been sequenced. The authors reported that the majority represented known genes or sequences found among human expressed sequences (18Cross S.H. Clark V.H. Simmen M.W. Bickmore W.A. Maroon H. Langford C.F. Carter N.P. Bird A.P. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additional clones represented chromosome 22 genomic DNA, human repetitive DNA, or Epstein-Barr viral DNA. These investigators were careful to point out that three clones from a similarly prepared chromosome 18 library matched E. coli sequences (18Cross S.H. Clark V.H. Simmen M.W. Bickmore W.A. Maroon H. Langford C.F. Carter N.P. Bird A.P. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Four clones including HSA236685 provided no match to any sequence, and no warrantee was expressed about the “humanity” or expression of this deposition (18Cross S.H. Clark V.H. Simmen M.W. Bickmore W.A. Maroon H. Langford C.F. Carter N.P. Bird A.P. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Conceptual translation of a 275 amino acid open reading frame from HSA236685 produces a polypeptide that is homologous to B. subtilis NAD+ synthetase. Tsuchiya and co-workers (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) designed primers to amplify this sequence by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human glioma cell line LN229 and report cloning of a “human cDNA” that encodes a polypeptide with 271 of 275 identities to that encoded by HSA236685. The sequence was deposited in GenBank™ with accession number AB091317. Despite noting that there is no evidence for expression of this molecule from the extensive expressed sequence tag databases and with no Southern data or location of the gene in a human or other animal genomic assembly, the clone was termed “human NADsyn2 cDNA” and claimed to encode the first strictly ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase in eukaryotes (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In fact, what was deposited has no feature diagnostic of a cDNA, such as an untranslated leader or sequences 3′ of the stop codon terminating in poly(A). Surprised by the claim of a human ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase without a genomic clone for such a sequence from any eukaryote, we performed numerous searches through the publicly accessible databases. Because Tsuchiya and co-workers (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) did not identify a genomic DNA fragment encoding their “human NADsyn2,” we examined the 1007-nucleotide sequence read of HSA236685 and found an 88% identical match (Fig. 1) over a common length of 975 nucleotides (864 of 975 nucleotides; p value = 6.2 × 10–170) with the partially assembled genome of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/P_fluorescens/). Thus, independent of coding potential, AB091317 appears to be of Pseudomonal origin. HSA236685 Represents a Fragment of an Operon Containing pncB and nadE and Possibly pncA Orthologs—Tsuchiya and co-workers never published genomic or transcript sequences 5′ to the initiator of “human NADsyn2.” However, they did state that the NADsyn2 sequence contains an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initiator methionine in the same location as HSA236685 and encodes a polypeptide with 98.5% identity to that encoded by HSA236685 (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As Tsuchiya and co-workers referred to the HSA236685 clone as a fragment of human genomic DNA, we examined the coding potential of the 136 nucleotides of HSA236685 preceding the NAD+ synthetase initiator codon. Immediately 5′ of the NAD+ synthetase initiator codon, we discovered an uninterrupted run of 43 amino acids followed by a TGA stop codon and one ATC codon. A BLASTP search (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59441) Google Scholar) of nonredundant peptide data revealed that the 43 amino acid segment is the C terminus of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.11), the first enzyme in the Preiss-Handler pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis from nicotinic acid (NAD+ synthetase (EC 6.3.5.1) is the last) (4Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 488-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then searched the ERGO database of completely and partially assembled genomes (16Overbeek R. Larsen N. Walunas T. D'Souza M. Pusch G. Selkov Jr., E. Liolios K. Joukov V. Kaznadzey D. Anderson I. Bhattacharyya A. Burd H. Gardner W. Hanke P. Kapatral V. Mikhailova N. Vasieva O. Osterman A. Vonstein V. Fonstein M. Ivanova N. Kyrpides N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to examine whether nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase genes (bacterial orthologs usually termed pncB) have been found clustered with NAD+ synthetase genes (bacterial orthologs usually termed nadE). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2, we found that pncB orthologs are the immediate upstream cistron with respect to nadE orthologs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus gasseri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphlococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Moreover, we found that a pncA ortholog encoding nicotinamidase (EC 3.5.1.19), which salvages nicotinamide to nicotinic acid for its subsequent use in the Preiss-Handler pathway, is located first in a three cistron operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19Stover C.K.

Folger K.R. Kas A. Larbig K. Lim R. Smith K. Spencer D. Wong G.K. Wu Z. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Hancock R.E. Lory S. Olson M.V. Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). At the time of consulting the ERGO database, 513 complete and partial genomes were included, including 93 eukaryotic genomes (16Overbeek R. Larsen N. Walunas T. D'Souza M. Pusch G. Selkov Jr., E. Liolios K. Joukov V. Kaznadzey D. Anderson I. Bhattacharyya A. Burd H. Gardner W. Hanke P. Kapatral V. Mikhailova N. Vasieva O. Osterman A. Vonstein V. Fonstein M. Ivanova N. Kyrpides N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). No eukaryotic NAD+ synthetase homolog was found without an N-terminal nitrilase-related domain, and no NAD+ synthetase gene was found in a eukaryote in an operon with genes for nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase or nicotinamidase. Thus, the genomic organization of Tsuchiya's NADsyn2 is bacterial and highly typical of a Pseudomomad. NADsyn2 and Its Associated pncB Ortholog Are Pseudomonal Enzymes—Whereas the ERGO search confirmed that single domain NAD+ synthetases have not been found in eukaryotes, we thought it important to confirm the Pseudomonal origin of the HSA236685 genes on the basis of amino acid sequence conservation, independent of the genomic data presented above. BLASTing the 43 amino acid C terminus of the HSA236685 pncB, we obtained hits against predicted polypeptides annotated either as “hypothetical protein” or as “nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase.” In descending order of significance, the genomes from which these sequences were derived were P. fluorescens, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas putida, and P. aeruginosa followed by three related γ-proteobacteria and three enterobacteria. Taking the BLASTP results to diminished E-values, a few β-proteobacteria were identified but nothing resembling a eukaryotic sequence was identified. It should be noted that the power of this BLASTP search was limited by the 43 amino acid probe, such that eukaryotic pncB homologs were not identified. The shortness of the query sequence served as a high stringency test for the origin of the pncB ortholog from HSA236685. Tsuchiya and co-workers (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) provided the predicted amino acid sequence of “human NADsyn2.” We submitted the sequence to a BLASTP search and discovered that its top four hits were from precisely the same Pseudomonads that matched the pncB cistron upstream of the nadE cistron on HSA236685. Although the NADsyn2 sequence is not a perfect match with P. fluorescens, it is demonstrably more similar to nadE of P. fluorescens than to P. syringae, other Pseudomonads, or other organisms within the huge eubacterial domain. The PHYLIP program (17Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) was used to display the phylogenetic inferences that emerge from multiple sequence alignment of NADsyn2, the nadE homolog obtained by conceptual translation of HSA236685, and eight nadE homologs from our BLASTP search. As shown in Fig. 3, an unrooted phylogenetic tree clearly locates HSA236685 and NADsyn2 as deriving from two strains of the same unidentified species of Pseudomonas. In this analysis, genus Pseudomonas was clearly separated from the other γ-proteobacteria. As other more distantly related nadE homologs were added to these alignments, it was possible to construct phylogenies that included more of the bacterial domain and, eventually, archaea and eukaryotes. Not surprisingly, vertebrate sequences were tightly grouped extremely far apart from the γ-proteobacteria (data not shown). Tsuchiya and co-workers (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) amplified “human NADsyn2” from human cell lines using primers designed to amplify an ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase gene they spotted in GenBank™ deposited sequence HSA236685 (14Hara N.

No data were presented, suggesting that the NADsyn2 clone required reverse transcriptase for amplification (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The NADsyn2 clone is absent from all of the human expression databases (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and genomic assemblies, whereas DNA sequence homologs with p values as low as 6.2 × 10–170 are found in Pseudomonal and other bacterial genomic assemblies (this work). Pseudomonas species are well known laboratory contaminants capable of growing on disinfectants such as benzalkonium chloride as their sole carbon source (20Nagai K. Ohta S. Zenda H. Matsumoto H. Makino M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 873-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Northern blotting of murine tissues with a NADsyn2 probe showed extremely weak hybridization that was interpreted as specific signals in heart, skeletal muscle, and other tissues, whereas robust “expression” was seen in four human cell lines (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our interpretations are cross-hybridization and Pseudomonal contamination, respectively. Clone HSA236685, which had been isolated by enrichment of human chromosome 22 CpG islands, was reported to be a rare clone with no match to human nucleic acids. Three clones from a similarly constructed chromosome 18 library were reported to match E. coli sequences (18Cross S.H. Clark V.H. Simmen M.W. Bickmore W.A. Maroon H. Langford C.F. Carter N.P. Bird A.P. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we reported that HSA236685 is full-length homologous to a fragment of the unassembled genome of P. fluorescens. Moreover, HSA236685 is a fragment of an operon that is found in E. faecalis, E. faecium, L. gasseri, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. equi, S. mutans, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes consisting of pncB followed by nadE cistrons. In P. aeruginosa, the operon consists of pncA, pncB, and nadE, such that nicotinamidase, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, and NAD synthetase are coordinately expressed. In contrast, no such chromosomal organization has been found in any animal. Both the pncB fragment from HSA236685 and the reported sequence of NADsyn2 are more similar to homologous enzymes in four species of Pseudomonas than they are to enzymes from other γ-proteobacteria or any other form of life. Finally, the biochemical properties and the domain structure of NADsyn2 (14Hara N. Yamada K. Terashima M. Osago H. Shimoyama M. Tsuchiya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10914-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) are consistent with those of bacterial ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase (6Spencer R.L. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 385-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inconsistent with those of any eukaryotic NAD synthetase (3Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33049-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol.

Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0001.1-0001.9Crossref Google Scholar). The simplest conclusion is that NADsyn2 is a typical Pseudomonal ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W2002548601,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is expressed in many tissues, including vasculature and renal proximal tubules, and its genetic ablation in mice causes abnormal renal structure and functions, hypotension, and male sterility. To test the hypothesis that specific physiological functions of ACE are mediated by its expression in specific tissues, we generated different mouse strains, each expressing ACE in only one tissue. Here, we report the properties of two such strains of mice that express ACE either in vascular endothelial cells or in renal proximal tubules. Because of the natural cleavage secretion process, both groups also have ACE in the serum. Both groups were as healthy as wild-type mice, having normal kidney structure and fluid homeostasis, though males remained sterile, because they lack ACE expression in sperm. Despite equivalent serum ACE and angiotensin II levels and renal functions, only the group that expressed ACE in vascular endothelial cells had normal blood pressure. Expression of ACE, either in renal proximal tubules or in vasculature, is sufficient for maintaining normal kidney functions. However, for maintaining blood pressure, ACE must be expressed in vascular endothelial cells. These results also demonstrate that ACE-mediated blood pressure maintenance can be dissociated from its role in maintaining renal structure and functions."

Thus, DNA binding activity of cytoplasmic phosphorylated Stat6 is masked by a factor dissociable by detergent treatment. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 1The abbreviations used are: Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; JAK, janus kinase; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated Stat; DOC, deoxycholic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IL, interleukin; SH, Src homology. proteins are mediators of transcription of several cytokine-inducible genes. These proteins exist as latent cytoplasmic monomers until cytokine stimulation, whereupon they are phosphorylated by the Janus family of kinases (JAKs), dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, activated Stats bind specific canonical DNA elements and initiate cytokine-specific gene transcription (1Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). To date, six Stat proteins have been described (2Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and of these, only Stat6 has been shown to be specifically activated by IL-4 and IL-13 (3Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C.

Stat6–/– mice are deficient in their ability to mount a Th2 response following nematode infection, fail to produce IgE, and do not develop airway hypersensitivity following antigen challenge (3Hou J.

The importance of Stat6 in human allergic disease is supported by the fact that Stat6 expression is increased in the bronchial epithelium of humans with severe asthma (10Mullings R.E. Wilson S.J. Puddicombe S.M. Lordan J.L. Bucchieri F. Djukanovic R. Howarth P.H. Harper S. Holgate S.T. Davies D.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 108: 832-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and that polymorphic variants of Stat6 have been reported to associate with atopic asthma (11Tamura K. Arakawa H. Suzuki M. Kobayashi Y. Mochizuki H. Kato M. Tokuyama K. Morikawa A. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Activation of Stat6 following receptor engagement involves multiple steps and is dependent on critical structural elements within Stat6. First, association of Stat6 with tyrosine-phosphorylated regions of cytokine receptors occurs via its SH2 domain. Subsequently, Stat6 is phosphorylated on Tyr641, a residue critical for Stat6 function (12Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and phosphorylated Stat6 monomers dimerize via their respective amino-terminal domains with Tyr641 of one monomer associating with the SH2 domain of the other (13Mikita T. Kurama M. Schindler U. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1822-1828PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Stat6 dimers then translocate to the nucleus, bind specific consensus sequences, and promote transcription of downstream genes. The crystal structure of Stat1-DNA complexes revealed that dimeric interactions between the two respective SH2 domains was critical for the formation of the DNA binding region (14Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of Stat6 depends on its phosphorylation and dimerization (12Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Mowen K. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, the elements responsible for nuclear localization of Stat6 have not been identified. Although Stat6 activation in response to IL-4 and IL-13 has been well documented, the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation of Stat signaling remain poorly understood. A number of negative regulators of the JAK-Stat signaling pathway have been described, including suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and protein inhibitors of activated stat (PIAS). SOCS proteins form a negative feedback loop whereby SOCS genes are induced following cytokine stimulation and, once produced, inhibit cytokine signaling (16Venktaraman C. Leung S. Slavekar A. Mano H. Schindler U. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4053-4061PubMed Google Scholar, 17Losman J.A. Chen X.P. Hilton D. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3770-3774PubMed Google Scholar). SOCS-1 has been shown to bind and inhibit JAK kinases, but this may not be true of all SOCS family members. A number of PIAS proteins have been described recently (18Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 19Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), which bind specifically to phosphorylated Stat dimers and prevent them from binding DNA (20Liao J. Fu Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, arginine methylation was shown to be another mechanism by which Stats can be regulated (21Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Methylation of Stat1 prevented its association with PIAS1, thereby increasing the amount of Stat1 available for DNA binding and gene induction. No PIAS protein has yet been described for Stat6. Another important point of regulation of the Stat pathway that remains ill-defined is the control of Stat migration between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Herein, we tracked the migration of phosphorylated Stat6 and Stat6 DNA binding activity between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to determine the kinetics of nuclear translocation and identify possible targets for regulation. Cells and Reagents—A201.1 murine B cells, a gift from Dr. Gregg Milligan (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH), are derived from the parent line A20. The cells are B220+, IgG+, Ia+, IgA–, IgM–, and IgD– and were originally derived from a BALB/c mouse. Cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640, consisting of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Murine splenocytes were obtained from BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and were purified by filtration over nylon mesh followed by erythrocyte lysis. Recombinant mouse IL-4 was purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Polyclonal anti-Stat6 antibody, S-20, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-phospho-STAT6 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Confocal Microscopy—A201.1 cells in culture were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1% fetal bovine serum, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and then stained with anti-phospho-Stat6 (Tyr641) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or rabbit IgG followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat F(ab)2 anti-rabbit (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) in a solution containing PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% saponin, and 3% cold fish gelatin (Sigma). After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in a minimal volume of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), placed on a slide, covered with a coverslip, and the edges sealed with nail polish. Cells were observed on a Leica DM IRBC confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cells (2.5 × 106) were stimulated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min, pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and reconstituted in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and supernatants containing the cytoplasmic extracts were removed. Pelleted nuclei were reconstituted in nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). EMSAs were performed as described previously (22Andrews R.P. Ericksen M.B. Cunningham C.M. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36563-36569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Andrews R.P. Rosa L.R. Daines M.O. Khurana Hershey G.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the detergent-treated samples, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared for EMSA as described above. Ten percent deoxycholic acid (DOC) (Sigma) was added to achieve the noted final concentration, and the samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. Radiolabeled Stat6 probe and nonionic detergent Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) were then added, to a final concentration of 1.2% Igepal. Samples prepared without DOC were incubated with the radiolabeled Stat6 probe only. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and then resolved by polyacryamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (22Andrews R.P. Ericksen M.B. Cunningham C.M. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36563-36569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Andrews R.P. Rosa L.R. Daines M.O. Khurana Hershey G.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—A201.1 cells (2 × 107) were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C and Stat6 was immunoprecipitated as described previously (23Andrews R.P. Rosa L.R. Daines M.O. Khurana Hershey G.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked overnight in block solution (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 20,000). Membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or anti-Stat6 polyclonal antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylated Stat6 Is Present in the Cytoplasm A201.1 Cells following IL-4 Treatment but Is Incapable of Binding DNA—We first investigated the cellular distribution of phosphorylated Stat6 in A201.1 cells following stimulation with IL-4 (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylated Stat6 was present in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts as early as 5 min after IL-4 treatment, and the levels were maximal by 15 min. As expected, total Stat6 remained constant in the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 1A). The same extracts were then analyzed for the presence of Stat6 DNA binding activity (Fig. 1B). Stat6 DNA binding activity was detected in the nuclear extracts after 1 min of IL-4 stimulation and reached maximal levels by 15 min. Stat6 DNA binding activity was not detected in cytoplasmic extracts at any time point. To further examine the subcellular localization of phosphorylated Stat6 in A201.1 cells and confirm the presence of phosphorylated Stat6 in the cytoplasm, confocal microscopy was performed on fixed, permeabilized cells following IL-4 stimulation (Fig. 2). As depicted in Fig. 2, phosphorylated Stat6 was not detectable in unstimulated cells, but was evident after 5 min of IL-4 stimulation. The majority of the phosphorylated Stat6 was in the cytoplasm, although in some cells, some nuclear staining was also detected. After 15 min of IL-4 stimulation, the phosphorylated Stat6 had migrated to the nucleus, in agreement with the observation that maximal Stat6 binding activity was detected in the nucleus after 15 min of IL-4 stimulation. When cells were stimulated for 15 min with IL-4, washed, and then incubated in medium lacking IL-4 for 1 h, the level of phosphorylated Stat6 staining was similar to that seen in unstimulated cells consistent a half-life of activated Stat6 of less than 1 h. These data confirm the presence of active phosphorylated Stat6 in the cytoplasm of cells. Cytoplasmic Extracts Do Not Inhibit Stat6 DNA Binding Activity—Our data established that although phosphorylated Stat6 was present in the cytoplasm, it was unable to bind cognate DNA sequences. One possibility for this was that cytoplasmic extracts contained an inhibitor capable of interfering with the DNA binding activity of phosphorylated Stat6. To address this, we examined the ability of cytoplasmic extracts to inhibit the Stat6 DNA binding present in nuclear extracts (Fig. 3). Increasing amounts of cytoplasmic extracts were added to nuclear extracts of activated A201.1 cells, and then the mixtures were assayed for DNA binding activity. As expected, DNA binding activity was present in the nuclear extracts, but not the cytoplasmic extracts. Addition of cytoplasmic extracts to the nuclear extracts had no effect on the DNA binding activity of the nuclear extracts even at a 10-fold excess of cytoplasmic extracts. Thus, cytoplasmic extracts do not contain a transferable inhibitor of Stat6 DNA binding activity. Detergent Treatment Unmasks Cytoplasmic Stat6 DNA Binding Activity—Our data demonstrates that phosphorylated Stat6 is present in the cytoplasm of IL-4-treated A201.1 cells, that this “activated” Stat6 is incapable of binding DNA and that there is not a transferable inhibitor of Stat6 DNA binding in the cytoplasm. We next sought to determine whether there is a tightly bound inhibitor of activated Stat6. To investigate this possibility, we treated cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from A201.1 cells with the ionic detergent DOC to separate any dissociable inhibitor from the phosphorylated Stat6. The extracts were then treated with a nonionic detergent, Nonidet P-40, to inactivate the DOC, and EMSA analysis was performed (Fig. 4A). Cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts derived from cells that were not treated with IL-4 did not display Stat6 DNA binding activity in the presence or absence of detergent. As expected, nuclear extracts derived from IL-4 treated cells demonstrated Stat6 DNA binding in the absence and presence of detergent treatment. There was a slight change in mobility of Stat6 in the presence of detergent. Cytoplasmic extracts showed no significant Stat6 DNA binding in the absence of detergent. However, following detergent treatment, robust Stat6 DNA binding was observed in the cytoplasmic extracts. This demonstrates that in the cytoplasm there is a tightly bound inhibitor of activated Stat6 that can be removed or is denatured or degraded by detergent treatment. To verify that these findings were not peculiar to the murine A201.1 line, we repeated the detergent treatment experiments with freshly isolated murine splenocytes. The results obtained mirrored those observed with A201.1 cells. IL-4-stimulated cytoplasmic extracts derived from splenocytes lacked Stat6 DNA binding activity, while detergent treatment unmasked DNA binding activity in these extracts (Fig. 4B). Since DNA binding activity was restored in detergent-treated cytoplasmic extracts, we reasoned that the inhibitor might be unbound in these extracts. Thus, we investigated whether detergent-treated cytoplasmic extracts could inhibit nuclear DNA binding activity. We utilized varying ratios of the cytoplasmic:nuclear extracts prepared from A201.1 cells, and even with a 10-fold excess of the detergent-treated cytoplasmic extracts, no inhibition was observed (data not shown). Thus, the inhibitor is no longer able to inhibit Stat6 activity after detergent treatment, supporting that it is either degraded or denatured. Alternatively, residual detergent in the extracts may inhibit the interaction, although this is less likely since it is diluted in the EMSA buffer. Cytokine signaling involves many steps: the production of cytokine, the expression of its receptor, the recruitment of kinases, the activation of transcription factors followed by their translocation to the nucleus, and binding to cognate DNA sequences. Each one of these layers of activation provides the potential for regulation. Herein, we describe the first report of a detergent-sensitive factor that blocks the DNA binding activity of activated Stat6 in the cytoplasm of IL-4 stimulated A201.1 cells. Our data establish the presence of phosphorylated Stat6 in the cytoplasm of activated cells by Western blot and confocal microscopy. However, the cytoplasmic extracts failed to demonstrate DNA binding despite the presence of phosphorylated Stat6. There was no evidence of a transferable inhibitor of Stat6 in the cytoplasm of activated A201.1 cells, as the addition of cytoplasmic proteins did not inhibit DNA binding of nuclear extracts. Strikingly, Stat6 DNA binding activity was restored to cytoplasmic extracts of IL-4-stimulated A201.1 cells by detergent treatment. This observation was confirmed in primary and cultured cells, confirming that it is not restricted to one cell type. These data support the presence of a factor that is tightly bound to activated Stat6 in the cytoplasm of cells and prevents its association with its cognate DNA sequence. The biologic function of this factor is not yet clear. It may act as an inhibitor or regulator of Stat6 function. Alternatively, the factor may act as a chaperone protein, which may be required for the nuclear localization of Stat6. The nuclear import requirements for Stat6 remain to be identified. Importin proteins have been shown to be involved in the nuclear localization of Stat1. Interestingly, in addition its role in nuclear localization, importin α5 has been reported to competitively block the Stat1 DNA binding site (24McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization occurs both at the level of nuclear import and nuclear export (25Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although a leucine-rich nuclear export signal has recently been implicated in the nuclear localization of Stat1 (26Mowen K. David M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7273-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), no nuclear localization signals have been identified in the Stats. We have previously shown that the maintenance of Stat6 activity requires cycling of Stat6 with nuclear export (22Andrews R.P. Ericksen M.B. Cunningham C.M. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36563-36569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on our observations, we propose the following model of the life cycle of activated Stat6 (Fig. 5). Upon IL-4 binding, Stat6 is rapidly activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr641 in the cytoplasm. Site-specific phosphorylation of Stat6 activates reciprocal interactions between 2 Stat6 molecules, whereby the SH2 domain of one monomer couples with the phosphotyrosine of the other, and vice versa, leading to dimerization of Stat6 (2Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Stat6 dimers should then be capable of binding DNA. However, we found that phosphorylated Stat6 detected in the cytoplasm was incapable of DNA binding. It is unlikely that the phosphorylated monomers were unable to dimerize, since the phosphotyrosines and SH2 domains, which have been shown to be critical for dimerization by mutational analyses (12Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Mikita T. Kurama M. Schindler U. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1822-1828PubMed Google Scholar), were intact. Thus, we propose that a chaperone-like molecule binds the phosphorylated Stat6 dimers in the cytoplasm and either directly or indirectly masks their DNA binding domain. Once the activated dimers have translocated to the nucleus, this chaperone molecule likely dissociates from the activated Stat6. We have performed experiments attempting to co-precipitate the associated factor with Stat6, but these experiments have not yet been successful. Additional experiments aimed at identifying this factor are underway. One potential candidate molecule for this chaperone may be a PIAS-like protein. PIAS proteins exist in the cytoplasm and nucleus (18Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and have been reported to bind exclusively to phosphorylated Stat dimers and block their DNA binding domain (20Liao J. Fu Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which would be consistent with our model. Overexpression of PIAS3 and PIAS1 proteins has been reported to inhibit Stat3 (18Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and Stat1 activation (19Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), respectively, as assayed by DNA binding and gene activation. However, an alternative explanation is that the natural function of PIAS or a PIAS-like protein is to transport Stat dimers to the nucleus. In this case, overexpression of this protein might lead to inhibition of Stat function because an excess of PIAS relative to the Stat dimers would favor PIAS proteins remaining bound to the activated dimers. The generation of PIAS knock-out mice will distinguish between these possibilities. In summary, our data establish that the DNA binding ability of phosphorylated Stat6 in the cytoplasm is inhibited by a detergent-sensitive factor. This is the first report of such a factor, and this represents a novel mechanism by which the JAK/Stat signaling pathway can be regulated. We are grateful to Drs. Christopher Karp, Jeffrey Whitsett, and Marc Rothenberg for critical review of this manuscript and to Dr. Timothy Weaver and Ledung Ray for help with the confocal microscopy.
