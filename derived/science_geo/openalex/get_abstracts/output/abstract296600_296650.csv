https://openalex.org/W2070889312,"Recognition of nestmates and discrimination against aliens is the rule in the social insects. The principal mechanism of nestmate recognition in carpenter ants (Camponotus) appears to be odor labels or ""discriminators"" that originate from the queen and are distributed among, and learned by, all adult colony members. The acquired odor labels are sufficiently powerful to produce indiscriminate acceptance among workers of different species raised together in artificially mixed colonies and rejection of genetic sisters reared by different heterospecific queens."
https://openalex.org/W2075928103,"A carbon-chromite fraction from the Allende C3V chondrite shows strikingly large isotopic enrichments of neodymium-142 (0.47 percent) and neodymium- 143 (36 percent). Both apparently formed by alpha decay of samarium-146 and samarium-147 (half-lives 1.03 x 10(8) and 1.06 x 10(11) years), but the isotopic enrichment was greatly magnified by recoil of residual nuclei into a carbon film surrounding the samarium-bearing grains. These data provide an improved estimate of the original abundance of extinct samarium-146 in the early solar system [(146)Sm/(144)Sm = (4.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(-3)], higher than predicted by some models of pprocess nucleosynthesis. It may be possible to use this isotopic pair as a chronometer of the early solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2063802363,"Pinosylvin methyl ether (PME), a toxic phenol, is a potent deterrent to showshoe hare feeding on green alder. Concentrations of PME found in green alder parts can account for the low palatability of winter-dormant foliar buds and staminate catkins but cannot affect internode palatability. The lack of a PME-related defense system in internodes suggests that green alder has at least a two-level defense system: defense of growth stages and defense of parts within growth stages."
https://openalex.org/W2041080990,"Some of the information about photosynthesis and related biosynthesis that might be used to develop strategies for increasing crop yields are discussed. It seems possible that techniques of plant breeding can be used to exploit or improve some of the biochemical characteristics now understood for green plants. There may be specifically designed chemicals--for example, glycidate--that can alter production. Finally, we can use the new knowledge to improve physiological conditions. Each of these techniques can be used to try to improve rate-limiting steps. A particularly good use of plant breeding techniques (including tissue culture with genetic modification) may be in increasing the distribution of photosynthate to desirable chemical products. Greater knowledge of the regulation of biosynthetic pathways in plants may be helpful in carrying out such genetic modifications, although much can be done empirically. Chemicals may be found which can improve yields of desired products by inhibition or stimulation of specific biochemical pathways. Considering costs of application and environmental considerations, this approach may be less desirable than plant breeding. There is a need for plant chemists and physiologists to find ways of increasing photosynthetic efficiency by reducing photorespiration, whether through carbon dioxide enrichment, chemicals, or breeding. We need a better understandingmore » of regulation leading to increased conversion of photosynthate into useful products--conventional ones (seeds, roots, or fruit), whole dry matter, or useful chemicals such as hydrocarbons. Translation of increased photosynthesis into increased nitrogen fixation in legumes and possibly other plants needs to be further utilized. The intensified research activities now under way in these and other areas promise a greater impact of basic plant biochemical research on crop productivity in the future.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2008419179,"Geographic variation in behaviors that influence resource utilization is a key component in current ecological theory, but the phenomenon has been poorly documented. Propensity to attack slugs varies geographically in a western garter snake, Thamnophis elegans. Many naive, newborn snakes from inland localities in California refuse to eat slugs. In contrast, virtually all naive young from coastal localities eat slugs. There is, however, no demonstrable polymorphism or geographic variation for propensity to eat anurans. Both coastal and inland snakes consistently eat anurans."
https://openalex.org/W2026189303,"Aircraft measurements were made of trace gases, atmospheric particles, and condensed acid volatiles in the plume of El Chichón volcano, Chiapas, Mexico, in November 1982. Hydrogen sulfide was the primary gaseous sulfur species in the plume at the time of collection. Concentrations of 28 elements were determined by neutron activation analysis of particulate material from the plume. Rates of trace element emission to the atmosphere for each species were estimated by normlization to the simultaneously determined total sulfur emission rate. The volatile elements sulfur, chlorine, arsenic, selenium, bromine, antimony, iodine, tungsten, and mercury were enriched relative to bulk pyroclastic material by factors of 60 to 20,000. Arsenic, antimony, and selenium were associated predominantly with small (>/= 3 micrometer) particles. Calcium and sodium were present almost exclusively on larger particles and aluminum and manganese were bimodally distributed. Ashladen particulate material injected into the stratosphere during the early violent eruptions was enriched by factors of 10 to 30 relative to ash in some of the same elements observed in the quiescent plume."

https://openalex.org/W2026577195,The moon is visible during total lunar eclipses due to sunlight refracted into the earth's shadow by the atmosphere. Stratospheric aerosols can profoundly affect the brightness of the eclipsed moon. Observed brightnesses of 21 lunar eclipses during 1960-1982 are compared with theoretical calculations based on refraction by an aerosol-free atmosphere to yield globally averaged aerosol optical depths. Results indicate the global aerosol loading from the 1982 eruption of El Chichón is similar in magnitude to that from the 1963 Agung eruption.
https://openalex.org/W2007955972,Carbon and chromite fractions from the Allende meteorite that contain isotopically anomalous xenon-131 to xenon-136 (carbonaceous chondrite fission or CCF xenon) at up to 5 x 1011 atoms per gram show no detectable isotopic anomalies in barium-130 to barium-138. This rules out the possibility that the CCF xenon was formed by in situ fission of an extinct superheavy element. Apparently the CCF xenon and its carbonaceous carrier are relics from stellar nucleosynthesis.
https://openalex.org/W2089651471,Volcanoes are unusually quiet for periods of a few years to a few decades prior to great shallow-thrust earthquakes. This is the most obvious part of an apparent pattern of volcanic activity related to the occurrence of great earthquakes at some convergent plate margins.
https://openalex.org/W2064981414,"A recent survey of five watersheds in south-central Wisconsin, where corn is now the dominant annual crop, illustrates the soil erosion damage that is occurring on sloping land under modern agricultural technology and prevailing market forces. In 70 percent of the 93 quarter-sections sampled, estimated soil losses, on the average, were more than twice the amounts considered compatible with permanent agriculture. Scattered studies by others indicate that the findings are meaningful for a large area in the United States when row cropping is prevalent on sloping soils."

The technique can be used for economic precombustion desulfurization and may have many other applications in coal utilization."
