https://openalex.org/W2891109293,"Just as in clay moulding or glass blowing, physically sculpting biological structures requires the constituent material to locally flow like a fluid while maintaining overall mechanical integrity like a solid. Disordered soft materials, such as foams, emulsions and colloidal suspensions, switch from fluid-like to solid-like behaviours at a jamming transition1-4. Similarly, cell collectives have been shown to display glassy dynamics in 2D and 3D5,6 and jamming in cultured epithelial monolayers7,8, behaviours recently predicted theoretically9-11 and proposed to influence asthma pathobiology8 and tumour progression12. However, little is known about whether these seemingly universal behaviours occur in vivo13 and, specifically, whether they play any functional part during embryonic morphogenesis. Here, by combining direct in vivo measurements of tissue mechanics with analysis of cellular dynamics, we show that during vertebrate body axis elongation, posterior tissues undergo a jamming transition from a fluid-like behaviour at the extending end, the mesodermal progenitor zone, to a solid-like behaviour in the presomitic mesoderm. We uncover an anteroposterior, N-cadherin-dependent gradient in yield stress that provides increasing mechanical integrity to the presomitic mesoderm, consistent with the tissue transiting from a wetter to a dryer foam-like architecture. Our results show that cell-scale stresses fluctuate rapidly (within about 1 min), enabling cell rearrangements and effectively 'melting' the tissue at the growing end. Persistent (more than 0.5 h) stresses at supracellular scales, rather than cell-scale stresses, guide morphogenetic flows in fluid-like tissue regions. Unidirectional axis extension is sustained by the reported rigidification of the presomitic mesoderm, which mechanically supports posterior, fluid-like tissues during remodelling before their maturation. The spatiotemporal control of fluid-like and solid-like tissue states may represent a generic physical mechanism of embryonic morphogenesis."

Here we identified 129,582 spontaneous, genome-wide somatic mutations in 140 single-cell-derived haematopoietic stem and progenitor colonies from a healthy 59-year-old man and applied population-genetics approaches to reconstruct clonal dynamics. Cell divisions from early embryogenesis were evident in the phylogenetic tree; all blood cells were derived from a common ancestor that preceded gastrulation. The size of the stem cell population grew steadily in early life, reaching a stable plateau by adolescence. We estimate the numbers of haematopoietic stem cells that are actively making white blood cells at any one time to be in the range of 50,000-200,000. We observed adult haematopoietic stem cell clones that generate multilineage outputs, including granulocytes and B lymphocytes. Harnessing naturally occurring mutations to report the clonal architecture of an organ enables the high-resolution reconstruction of somatic cell dynamics in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2810137848,"The binary neutron-star merger GW1708171 was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum2 and localized2 to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance3 of about 41 megaparsecs from Earth. The radio and X-ray afterglows of GW170817 exhibited delayed onset4–7, a gradual increase8 in the emission with time (proportional to t0.8) to a peak about 150 days after the merger event9, followed by a relatively rapid decline9,10. So far, various models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a choked-jet cocoon4,8,11–13 and a successful-jet cocoon4,8,11–18 (also called a structured jet). However, the observational data have remained inconclusive10,15,19,20 as to whether GW170817 launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we report radio observations using very long-baseline interferometry. We find that the compact radio source associated with GW170817 exhibits superluminal apparent motion between 75 days and 230 days after the merger event. This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the choked- and successful-jet cocoon models and indicates that, although the early-time radio emission was powered by a wide-angle outflow8 (a cocoon), the late-time emission was most probably dominated by an energetic and narrowly collimated jet (with an opening angle of less than five degrees) and observed from a viewing angle of about 20 degrees. The imaging of a collimated relativistic outflow emerging from GW170817 adds substantial weight to the evidence linking binary neutron-star mergers and short γ-ray bursts. Emission from the radio counterpart of the gravitation-wave event GW170817 was powered by a wide-angle outflow at early times, but probably dominated by a narrowly collimated jet at later times."

https://openalex.org/W3098159263,"We demonstrate the realization of large, fully loaded, arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional arrays of single atoms. Using holographic methods and real-time, atom-by-atom, plane-by-plane assembly, we engineer atomic structures with up to 72 atoms separated by distances of a few micrometres. Our method allows for high average filling fractions and the unique possibility to obtain defect-free arrays with high repetition rates. These results find immediate application for the quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using Rydberg atoms in state-of-the-art platforms, and are very promising for quantum-information processing with neutral atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2783364275,"A quantum computer has the potential to effciently solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Constructing a large-scale quantum processor, however, is challenging due to errors and noise inherent in real-world quantum systems. One approach to this challenge is to utilize modularity--a pervasive strategy found throughout nature and engineering--to build complex systems robustly. Such an approach manages complexity and uncertainty by assembling small, specialized components into a larger architecture. These considerations motivate the development of a quantum modular architecture, where separate quantum systems are combined via communication channels into a quantum network. In this architecture, an essential tool for universal quantum computation is the teleportation of an entangling quantum gate, a technique originally proposed in 1999 which, until now, has not been realized deterministically. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a teleported controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation made deterministic by utilizing real-time adaptive control. Additionally, we take a crucial step towards implementing robust, error-correctable modules by enacting the gate between logical qubits, encoding quantum information redundantly in the states of superconducting cavities. Such teleported operations have significant implications for fault-tolerant quantum computation, and when realized within a network can have broad applications in quantum communication, metrology, and simulations. Our results illustrate a compelling approach for implementing multi-qubit operations on logical qubits within an error-protected quantum modular architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2888438017,"High energy particle accelerators have been crucial in providing a deeper understanding of fundamental particles and the forces that govern their interactions. In order to increase the energy or reduce the size of the accelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield acceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong electric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering experiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing a plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well beyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1 GV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored energy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies. The use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive wakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating stage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo self-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the bunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to create large wakefields. The AWAKE experiment at CERN uses intense bunches of protons, each of energy 400 GeV, with a total bunch energy of 19 kJ, to drive a wakefield in a 10 m long plasma. Bunches of electrons are injected into the wakefield formed by the proton microbunches. This paper presents measurements of electrons accelerated up to 2 GeV at AWAKE. This constitutes the first demonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The potential for this scheme to produce very high energy electron bunches in a single accelerating stage means that the results shown here are a significant step towards the development of future high energy particle accelerators."
https://openalex.org/W183072596,"In 1872, Maxwell proposed his famous ‘demon’ thought experiment1. By discerning which particles in a gas are hot and which are cold, and then performing a series of reversible actions, Maxwell’s demon could rearrange the particles into a manifestly lower-entropy state. This apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics was resolved by twentieth-century theoretical work2: the entropy of the Universe is often increased while gathering information3, and there is an unavoidable entropy increase associated with the demon’s memory4. The appeal of the thought experiment has led many real experiments to be framed as demon-like. However, past experiments had no intermediate information storage5, yielded only a small change in the system entropy6,7 or involved systems of four or fewer particles8–10. Here we present an experiment that captures the full essence of Maxwell’s thought experiment. We start with a randomly half-filled three-dimensional optical lattice with about 60 atoms. We make the atoms sufficiently vibrationally cold so that the initial disorder is the dominant entropy. After determining where the atoms are, we execute a series of reversible operations to create a fully filled sublattice, which is a manifestly low-entropy state. Our sorting process lowers the total entropy of the system by a factor of 2.44. This highly filled ultracold array could be used as the starting point for a neutral-atom quantum computer. An experiment inspired by Maxwell’s ‘demon’ thought experiment uses a series of reversible operations to fully fill a three-dimensional optical lattice with ultracold atoms and realize a low-entropy state."

Treatment currently requires the transplantation of pre-existing epithelial components, such as skin grafts, or therapy using cultured cells2. Here we develop alternative supplies of epidermal coverage for the treatment of these kinds of wounds. We generated expandable epithelial tissues using in vivo reprogramming of wound-resident mesenchymal cells. Transduction of four transcription factors that specify the skin-cell lineage enabled efficient and rapid de novo epithelialization from the surface of cutaneous ulcers in mice. Our findings may provide a new therapeutic avenue for treating skin wounds and could be extended to other disease situations in which tissue homeostasis and repair are impaired."

https://openalex.org/W2949187072,"Meiotic recombination differs between males and females; however, when and how these differences are established is unknown. Here we identify extensive sex differences at the initiation of recombination by mapping hotspots of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks in male and female mice. Contrary to past findings in humans, few hotspots are used uniquely in either sex. Instead, grossly different recombination landscapes result from up to fifteen-fold differences in hotspot usage between males and females. Indeed, most recombination occurs at sex-biased hotspots. Sex-biased hotspots seem to be partly determined by chromosome structure, and DNA methylation, which is absent in females at the onset of meiosis, has a substantial role. Sex differences are also evident later in meiosis as the rate at which meiotic breaks are repaired as crossovers differs between males and females in distal regions. The suppression of distal crossovers may help to minimize age-related aneuploidy that arises owing to cohesion loss during dictyate arrest in females. Differential DNA methylation and the long-range effects of chromatin organization lead to pronounced differences in recombination landscape between males and females."

https://openalex.org/W2890108523,"Huntington’s disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the gene encoding the Huntingtin protein (Htt). Phosphorylation of this protein region (Httex1) has been shown to play important roles in regulating the structure, toxicity, and cellular properties of N-terminal fragments and full-length Htt. However, increasing evidence suggests that phosphomimetic substitutions in Htt result in inconsistent findings and do not reproduce all aspects of true phosphorylation. Here, we investigated the effects of bona fide phosphorylation at Ser-13 or Ser-16 on the structure, aggregation, membrane binding, and subcellular properties of the Httex1-Q18A variant and compared these effects with those of phosphomimetic substitutions. We show that phosphorylation at either Ser-13 and/or Ser-16 or phosphomimetic substitutions at both these residues inhibit the aggregation of mutant Httex1, but that only phosphorylation strongly disrupts the amphipathic α-helix of the N terminus and prompts the internalization and nuclear targeting of preformed Httex1 aggregates. In synthetic peptides, phosphorylation at Ser-13, Ser-16, or both residues strongly disrupted the amphipathic α-helix of the N-terminal 17 residues (Nt17) of Httex1 and Nt17 membrane binding. Experiments with peptides bearing different combinations of phosphorylation sites within Nt17 revealed a phosphorylation-dependent switch that regulates the Httex1 structure, involving cross-talk between phosphorylation at Thr-3 and Ser-13 or Ser-16. Our results provide crucial insights into the role of phosphorylation in regulating Httex1 structure and function, and underscore the critical importance of identifying the enzymes responsible for regulating Htt phosphorylation, and their potential as therapeutic targets for managing Huntington’s disease.

It is mediated by an enzymatic cascade and the E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzymes (UBCs) lie at its heart.

In vitro activity assayed by autoubiquitination only partially recapitulated the in vivo selectivity.

Together, our work provides a framework to interrogate in vivo E2–E3 pairing and reveals a multi-tiered and dynamic E2–E3 network. To date no physiological E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzyme–E3 ubiquitin ligase pair has been reported for plants. Most research has focused on E3 ligases because they are the specificity determinants of the ubiquitination process. However, E2s mediate the attachment of ubiquitin mainly onto lysine residues of a substrate, in most cases guided by one of the more than 1400 E3s encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. The surfacing complexity of the different functions carried out by E2s contradicts their early image as simple carriers of activated ubiquitin. They are first loaded with ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 via transthiolation forming a thioester bond with their catalytic cysteine and subsequently are recognized by an E3 ligase. The E2 then discharges ubiquitin onto either the E3, a process commonly used to test E3 activity termed autoubiquitination, or onto a substrate, in which case the E3 acts as an adaptor. E2s have emerged as key mediators of ubiquitin chain assembly and have been demonstrated to be able to govern the switch from ubiquitin chain initiation to elongation, as well as regulate the processivity of chain formation (1.Stewart M.D. Ritterhoff T. Klevit R.E. Brzovic P.S. E2 enzymes: more than just middle men.Cell Res. 2016; 26 (27002219): 423-44010.1038/cr.2016.35Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Substrates can be modified by attachment of a ubiquitin polymer (polyubiquitination), in which single moieties are linked to one another through one of seven lysine residues present in ubiquitin, or its initial methionine (2.Kulathu Y. Komander D. Atypical ubiquitylation: the unexplored world of polyubiquitin beyond Lys48 and Lys63 linkages.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (22820888): 508-52310.1038/nrm3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Importantly, E2s to a large extent dictate the Lys residue within ubiquitin used to link the moieties in a chain (1.Stewart M.D. Ritterhoff T. Klevit R.E. Brzovic P.S. E2 enzymes: more than just middle men.Cell Res. 2016; 26 (27002219): 423-44010.1038/cr.2016.35Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The resulting different linkage types lead to alternative topologies of the polyubiquitin chains, which in turn are responsible for the different fates endowed onto the modified proteins (2.Kulathu Y. Komander D. Atypical ubiquitylation: the unexplored world of polyubiquitin beyond Lys48 and Lys63 linkages.Nat. Rev. Mol.

These can include the degradation of proteins tagged with Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains by the 26S proteasome, or regulate the transit of integral membrane proteins through the endomembrane system. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 37 ubiquitin E2 enzymes, all of which display a highly conserved cysteine residue at the predicted catalytic site and are classified into 16 groups based on the similarity to each other (3.Kraft E.

However, whether in vitro autoubiquitination activity faithfully recapitulates all aspects of E2–E3 pairing in vivo remains open. Therefore, data interpretation pertaining to its relevance in vivo must be made with caution for several reasons. (i) The E2s usually employed to perform in vitro ubiquitination assay display high processivity and promiscuity and are therefore active with a wide range of E3 ligases. These include the commonly used UBC8 and UBC11 from group VI, which are homologues of the human UBE2D group of E2s shown to prime ubiquitination (6.Jin L. Williamson A. Banerjee S. Philipp I. Rape M.

(iii) High concentrations of recombinant proteins employed in these assays can lead to unspecific E2–E3 interactions. (iv) Spatio-temporal resolution that restricts the encounter of E2–E3 pairs within the cell is absent. Therefore, to fully understand the potentially distinct cellular roles played by any E3, it is of central importance to identify its physiological E2 counterparts, as they define to a large extent its biochemical properties.

These include the bacterial protein flagellin, or its derived peptide flg22, which is recognized by the FLS2 receptor (18.Chinchilla D. Bauer Z. Regenass M. Boller T. Felix G. The Arabidopsis receptor kinase FLS2 binds flg22 and determines the specificity of flagellin perception.Plant Cell. 2006; 18 (16377758): 465-47610.1105/tpc.105.036574Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Similar to animals, plant PRRs activate innate immune responses to fend off pathogens (19.Couto D. Zipfel C. Regulation of pattern recognition receptor signalling in plants.Nat. Rev.

PUB22 mediates the degradation of components of the exocyst complex, which are required for full activation of PRR signaling, during the immune response (8.Furlan G. Nakagami H. Eschen-Lippold L.

PUB22 is composed of an N-terminal U-box that mediates E2 pairing and four armadillo (ARM) repeats that interact with its substrates (Fig. 1A). The U-box is a domain of ∼70 amino acids present in proteins from yeast to human. It consists of a typical fold stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds that is structurally similar to RING domains (20.Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Ren L. Hirsch J.P. Chazin W.J. Walz T. Gould K.L. Structural and functional analysis of essential pre-mRNA splicing factor Prp19p.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25 (15601865): 451-46010.1128/MCB.25.1.451-460.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Employing cell-based assays we determined in vivo E2–PUB22 pairing and uncover different layers of specificity. The U-box, which provides the docking surface, mediates interaction with a subset of 18 E2s. However, the ARM repeats impose higher specificity allowing interaction with 11 E2s. Of note, activation of the immune response-modulated interaction with E2s from different subgroups known to have distinct catalytic properties. This suggests that PUB22 mediates distinct catalytic activities. The observed pairing specificities in vivo were only partially recapitulated by in vitro autoubiquitination. Our work therefore reveals various factors that regulate E2–E3 pairing, whereas in addition providing a framework for their study. To reveal the cellular function of the E3 ligase PUB22 we screened for PUB22–E2 pairs using a cell-based assay employing bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) that allows the in vivo visualization of protein–protein interactions. We subcloned all 37 E2 genes encoded by the Arabidopsis genome (3.Kraft E. Stone S.L. Ma L. Su N. Gao Y. Lau O.S. Deng X.W. Callis J. Genome analysis and functional characterization of the E2 and RING-type E3 ligase ubiquitination enzymes of Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2005; 139 (16339806): 1597-161110.1104/pp.105.067983Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) to generate N-terminal HA-cYFP and Myc-nYFP E2 or E3 fusion proteins, respectively. We first assayed the interaction between the E2s and a truncated PUB22 carrying the U-box only to test the specificity conferred by this domain on its own. The UBC domain of E2s, which mediates pairing, is highly conserved. We therefore anticipated that the U-box of PUB22 would be able to interact with various E2s. Indeed, BiFC was detected for 18 out 37 tested E2s, including UBCs 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, and 36 (Fig. 1A, and Figs. S1 and S2). Therefore, the U-box domain on its own conferred only a low degree of specificity. U-box PUB22–E2 pairs displayed distinct subcellular localizations. Most pairs, including UBC5, UBC8, and UBC36, showed a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1B and Table S1). By contrast, the interaction with UBC26 was localized exclusively in the nucleus and was more pronounced in the nucleolus (Fig. 1B). UBC32 was shown to localize in the endoplasmic reticulum where it participates in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (21.Cui F. Liu L. Zhao Q. Zhang Z. Li Q. Lin B. Wu Y. Tang S. Xie Q. Arabidopsis ubiquitin conjugase UBC32 is an ERAD component that functions in brassinosteroid-mediated salt stress tolerance.Plant Cell. 2012; 24 (22214659): 233-24410.1105/tpc.111.093062Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the interaction with UBC32 displayed reticulate and perinuclear localization, reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1B). We next tested whether the ARM repeats, which mediate the interaction with substrates, influence the specificity of the PUB22–E2 pairing. The presence of the ARM domains had a dramatic impact on both the localization and the specificity of the PUB22–E2 pairing. Full-length PUB22 interaction was restricted to 10 E2s: UBCs 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, 28, 29, 30, 35, and 36 (Table S1, Fig. 1A, and Figs. S1 and S2). In most cases the ARM repeats shifted the subcellular localization of PUB22–E2 pairs from the nucleus and cytoplasm to punctae in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C and Table S1). This localization is reminiscent of that observed for PUB22 and its cognate substrate Exo70B2 in BiFC (9.Stegmann M. Anderson R.G. Ichimura K. Pecenkova T. Reuter P. Žársky V. McDowell J.M. Shirasu K. Trujillo M. The ubiquitin ligase PUB22 targets a subunit of the exocyst complex required for PAMP-triggered responses in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2012; 24 (23170036): 4703-471610.1105/tpc.112.104463Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). By contrast, interaction with UBC35 or UBC36 was also cytoplasmic (Fig. 1D), similar to the subcellular localization detected for the PUB22-MPK3 interaction in BiFC (8.Furlan G. Nakagami H. Eschen-Lippold L. Jiang X. Majovsky P. Kowarschik K. Hoehenwarter W. Lee J. Trujillo M. Changes in PUB22 ubiquitination modes triggered by mitogen-activated protein kinase3 dampen the immune response.Plant Cell. 2017; 29 (28280093): 726-74510.1105/tpc.16.00654Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, interactions between full-length PUB22 and UBCs 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 26, 32, 33, which interacted with the U-box only, were not detected (Fig. 1A and Table S1). PUB22 is regulated by the activation of PRRs, including FLS2 (8.Furlan G. Nakagami H. Eschen-Lippold L. Jiang X. Majovsky P. Kowarschik K. Hoehenwarter W. Lee J. Trujillo M. Changes in PUB22 ubiquitination modes triggered by mitogen-activated protein kinase3 dampen the immune response.Plant Cell. 2017; 29 (28280093): 726-74510.1105/tpc.16.00654Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9.Stegmann M.

We therefore tested whether treatment with flg22 influenced PUB22–E2 pairing. Elicitation with flg22 induced the interaction of the full-length PUB22 with UBC26, which was detected in the nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 1C). However, in all other cases no major effects could be observed. Finally, we tested the specificity of PUB22–E2 pairing by including the W40A PUB22 point mutant variant, which is impaired in its autoubiquitination activity (4.Kowarschik K. Hoehenwarter W. Marillonnet S. Trujillo M.

Without exception, interaction of all PUB22-interacting E2s with the W40A mutant variant was inhibited (Fig. 1D and Table S1). This additionally confirms that the PUB22–E2 pairing occurs via the canonical U-box and UBC surfaces (22.Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Chaperoned ubiquitylation: crystal structures of the CHIP U box E3 ubiquitin ligase and a CHIP-Ubc13-Uev1a complex.Mol.

Together, we identified 11 PUB22-interacting E2s and we show that both U-box, as well as the ARM repeats, contribute to the pairing specificity. Moreover, the data revealed that activation of the immune response can induce interaction between PUB22 and UBC26. PUB22 interacted with the majority of the eight E2s belonging to group VI (Fig. 1A). Group VI are prototypical E2s, which are almost exclusively composed of the UBC domain (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3). E2s dock onto U-box/RING domain of E3s via the L1 and L2 loops and the N-terminal α-helix (Fig. 2A, dark blue) with low affinity, which is thought to be a requirement for the rapid exchange between binding to the ubiquitin-E2 conjugate, the aminolysis reaction and the subsequent undocking of the unloaded E2 (1.Stewart M.D. Ritterhoff T. Klevit R.E. Brzovic P.S. E2 enzymes: more than just middle men.Cell Res. 2016; 26 (27002219): 423-44010.1038/cr.2016.35Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23.Eletr Z.M. Kuhlman B. Sequence determinants of E2-E6AP binding affinity and specificity.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369 (17433363): 419-42810.1016/j.jmb.2007.03.026Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a consequence, commonly used techniques such as co-immunoprecipitations are unsuitable to confirm the interaction. We therefore opted to use a split luciferase complementation assay (SLCA), which allows the detection of weak interactions, and in contrast to BiFC in which complementation is irreversible, maintains association-dissociation dynamics (24.Stefan E. Aquin S. Berger N. Landry C.R. Nyfeler B. Bouvier M. Michnick S.W. Quantification of dynamic protein complexes using Renilla luciferase fragment complementation applied to protein kinase A activities in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Moreover, normalization of the transformation efficiency was performed via Renilla luciferase (Luc) harbored in the vector containing the UBCs by dual-luciferase detection. We validated the specificity of the interaction detected via SLCA by using two different variants of PUB22 carrying point mutations to alanine in the U-box known to interfere with autoubiquitination (10.Trujillo M. Ichimura K. Casais C. Shirasu K. Negative regulation of PAMP-triggered immunity by an E3 ubiquitin ligase triplet in Arabidopsis.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18 (18771922): 1396-140110.1016/j.cub.2008.07.085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Trp40 is predicted to be located on an α-helix distant from the E2 docking surface and not to be required to maintain the core structure of the U-box (25.Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Chazin W.J. Gould K.L. Structural insights into the U-box, a domain associated with multi-ubiquitination.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10 (12627222): 250-25510.1038/nsb906Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Cys13 is located on one of the two loops that make contact with the E2 (22.Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Chaperoned ubiquitylation: crystal structures of the CHIP U box E3 ubiquitin ligase and a CHIP-Ubc13-Uev1a complex.Mol.

When compared with the WT PUB22, the W40A variant was still able to partially interact, whereas the C13A mutation abrogated the interactions with UBC30 as well as UBC10 and UBC11 (Fig. S4). These results show the high sensitivity and specificity of the SLCA to investigate E2–E3 interactions. Analysis of PUB22 and group VI E2 pairing by SLCA confirmed that PUB22 interacted with UBC8, UBC10, UBC11, UBC28, UBC29, and UBC30 (Fig. 2B and Fig. S5). Signal intensities for PUB22 interactions with UBC9 and UBC12, which were not detected by BiFC, were also significantly weaker in SLCA. Hence, we were able to confirm our initial results and show in vivo specificity in the interaction of PUB22 and group VI E2s. Previous reports show that the U-box domain binds with higher affinity to the loaded E2 (26.Soss S.E. Klevit R.E. Chazin W.J. Activation of UbcH5c∼Ub is the result of a shift in interdomain motions of the conjugate bound to U-box E3 ligase E4B.Biochemistry. 2013; 52 (23550736): 2991-299910.1021/bi3015949Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which can be mediated by binding of the E2 and the loaded ubiquitin to the RING domain (27.Plechanovova A. Jaffray E.G. McMahon S.A. Johnson K.A. Navratilova I. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. Mechanism of ubiquitylation by dimeric RING ligase RNF4.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 2012; 19 (22902369): 876-88310.1038/nsmb.2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To investigate a possible effect of ubiquitin in binding of the E2 with the U-box of PUB22 we replaced the catalytic cysteine residue at position 85 of UBC30 with alanine, which impairs ubiquitin loading, or a lysine, which is able to receive ubiquitin by forming an isopeptide bond (27.Plechanovova A. Jaffray E.G. McMahon S.A. Johnson K.A. Navratilova I. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. Mechanism of ubiquitylation by dimeric RING ligase RNF4.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 (21857666): 1052-105910.1038/nsmb.2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Compared with the WT UBC30, the inactive C85A variant displayed reduced, whereas the C85K variant displayed enhanced, Luc activity (Fig. S6). This suggests that ubiquitin loading may enhance UBC30 binding to PUB22 U-box. To test whether interaction specificity is maintained in vitro, we carried out autoubiquitination assays. In contrast to the differences observed between the interactions in vivo, ubiquitin chain formation activities of PUB22 in combination with group VI E2s did not show any major changes under the used conditions (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, in all instances ubiquitination was inhibited in the case of the W40A mutant, indicating that interaction with the E3 was required for activity (Fig. 2C). However, detailed time course analyses of PUB22 autoubiquitination revealed differences in the processivity between the in vivo noninteracting UBC9 and the in vivo interacting UBC30 (Fig. 2D). We next selected representative E2s that were identified in the BiFC screen and compared the interaction using SLCA. Selected E2s included UBC17 (group VII), UBC26 (group XI), UBC28 (group VI), UBC30 (group VI), and UBC35 (group XV). In addition, we included as negative controls UBC9 and UBC12 (group VI), which did not interact with PUB22 in BiFC, as well as UBC1 (group III) and UBC5 (group IV), which interacted in BiFC only wi"

Here, we present first evidence that INH and EMB act synergistically through a transcriptional repressor of the inhA gene, the target gene of INH encoding an enoyl–acyl carrier protein reductase of the fatty acid synthase type II system required for bacterial cell wall integrity. We report that EMB binds a hypothetical transcription factor encoded by the Rv0273c gene, designated here as EtbR. Using DNA footprinting, we found that EtbR specifically recognizes a motif sequence in the upstream region of the inhA gene. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we observed that EMB binds EtbR in a 1:1 ratio and thereby stimulates its DNA-binding activity. When a nonlethal dose of EMB was delivered in combination with INH, EMB increased the INH susceptibility of cultured M. tuberculosis cells. In summary, EMB induces EtbR-mediated repression of inhA and thereby enhances the mycobactericidal effect of INH.

Yet little is known about the physiological mechanisms governing this benefit in the context of social exclusion. This study investigated the impact of attachment (vs non-attachment) priming on affective and cardiovascular responses to social exclusion induced by the computerized ""Cyberball"" ball-tossing game, and the moderating influence of individual differences in attachment style, rejection sensitivity and self-construal. No significant change in high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV)-an index of parasympathetic activity and cardiovagal balance-was observed across the time course in the attachment priming condition, whereas the non-attachment condition showed significant fluctuation in HF-HRV-increasing during Cyberball and decreasing relative to baseline during recovery. Moreover, the benefit afforded by attachment priming on was enhanced amongst participants with lower rejection sensitivity and higher collectivistic self-construal, and those with higher anxious attachment style in the non-attachment prime group showed a trend towards increased HF-HRV during the Cyberball. Results are consistent with Social Baseline Theory, which argues that social proximity-particularly from attachment figures-protects against the metabolic costs associated with strong reactions to stress, including the preservation of cardiovagal homeostasis in this instance. Social attachments may provide an important mechanism to increase adaptive responding to the distressing experience of social exclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2890231424,"Honey bee populations have been declining precipitously over the past decade, and multiple causative factors have been identified. Recent research indicates that these frequently co-occurring stressors interact, often in unpredictable ways, therefore it has become important to develop robust methods to assess their effects both in isolation and in combination. Most such efforts focus on honey bee workers, but the state of a colony also depends on the health and productivity of its queen. However, it is much more difficult to quantify the performance of queens relative to workers in the field, and there are no laboratory assays for queen performance. Here, we present a new system to monitor honey bee queen egg laying under laboratory conditions and report the results of experiments showing the effects of pollen nutrition on egg laying. These findings suggest that queen egg laying and worker physiology can be manipulated in this system through pollen nutrition, which is consistent with findings from field colonies. The results generated using this controlled, laboratory-based system suggest that worker physiology controls queen egg laying behavior. Additionally, the quantitative data generated in these experiments highlight the utility of the system for further use as a risk assessment tool."

https://openalex.org/W2890549490,"Maize (Zea mays L.), an important agricultural crop, suffers from drought stress frequently during its growth period, thus leading to a decline in yield. 2-(3,4-Dichlorophenoxy) triethylamine (DCPTA) regulates many aspects of plant development; however, its effects on crop stress tolerance are poorly understood. We pre-treated maize seedlings by adding DCPTA to a hydroponic solution and then subjected the seedlings to a drought condition [15% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 treatment]. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) were enhanced under drought stress and further enhanced by the DCPTA application. The activities of monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and catalase (CAT) declined continuously under drought stress; however, the activities partially recovered with DCPTA application. Up-regulation of the activities and transcript levels of APX, GR, MDHAR and DHAR in the DCPTA treatments contributed to the increases in ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) levels and inhibited the increased generation rate of superoxide anion radicals (O2·−), the contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the electrolyte leakage (EL) induced by drought. These results suggest that the enhanced antioxidant capacity induced by DCPTA application may represent an efficient mechanism for increasing the drought stress tolerance of maize seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W2890311846,"Trypanosoma cruzi is a genetically heterogeneous group of organisms that cause Chagas disease. It has been long suspected that the clinical outcome of the disease and response to therapeutic agents are, at least in part, related to the genetic characteristics of the parasite. Herein, we sought to validate the significance of the genotype of T. cruzi isolates recovered from patients with different clinical forms of Chagas disease living in Argentina on their biological behaviour and susceptibility to drugs. Genotype identification of the newly established isolates confirmed the reported predominance of TcV, with a minor frequency of TcI. Epimastigote sensitivity assays demonstrated marked dissimilar responses to benznidazole, nifurtimox, pentamidine and dihydroartemisinin in vitro. Two TcV isolates exhibiting divergent response to benznidazole in epimastigote assays were further tested for the expression of anti-oxidant proteins. Benznidazole-resistant BOL-FC10A epimastigotes had decreased expression of Old Yellow Enzyme and cytosolic superoxide dismutase, and overexpression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and tryparedoxin- 1, compared to benznidazole-susceptible AR-SE23C parasites. Drug sensitivity assays on intracellular amastigotes and trypomastigotes reproduced the higher susceptibility of AR-SE23C over BOL-FC10A parasites to benznidazole observed in epimastigotes assays. However, the susceptibility/resistance profile of amastigotes and trypomastigotes to nifurtimox, pentamidine and dihydroartemisinin varied markedly with respect to that of epimastigotes. C3H/He mice infected with AR-SE23C trypomastigotes had higher levels of parasitemia and mortality rate during the acute phase of infection compared to mice infected with BOL-FC10A trypomastigotes. Treatment of infected mice with benznidazole or nifurtimox was efficient to reduce patent parasitemia induced by either isolate. Nevertheless, qPCR performed at 70 dpi revealed parasite DNA in the blood of mice infected with AR-SE23C but not in BOL-FC10A infected mice. These results demonstrate high level of intra-type diversity which may represent an important obstacle for the testing of chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2891653808,"The goal of this study was to test the nature of the memory advantage in synaesthesia. We compared four different types of synaesthetes (27 grapheme-colour, 21 sound-colour-, 25 grapheme-colour-and-sound-colour- and 24 sequence-space synaesthetes) to their matched controls. Recognition memory for three types of stimuli (music, words, colour) was tested. We anticipated a general advantage in memory for synaesthetes and potentially additional synaesthesia-specific benefits. The results showed a general advantage for synaesthesia. Further, a benefit for colour stimuli resulted for grapheme-colour synaesthetes and a benefit for music stimuli resulted for grapheme-colour-and-sound-colour synaesthetes, indicating synaesthesia-type specific effects. These results suggest different mechanisms for the explanation of the memory benefit for different types of synaesthesia such as synaesthesia-related colour expertise for grapheme-colour synaesthesia and additional encoding opportunities for grapheme-colour-and-sound-colour synaesthesia."

https://openalex.org/W2890529795,"In recent years, air pollution has been a subject of great scientific and public interests for the strong impact on human health. Air pollution is due to the presence in the atmosphere of polluting substances, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, particulates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), derived predominantly from various combustion processes. Benzene is a VOC belonging to group-I carcinogens with a toxicity widely demonstrated. The emission limit values and the daily exposure time to benzene (TLV-TWA) are 5μg/m3 (0.00157 ppm) and 1.6mg/m3 (0.5 ppm), respectively. Currently, expensive and time-consuming analytical methods are used for detection of benzene. These methods require to perform a few preliminary steps such as sampling, and matrices pre-treatments. In addition, it is also needed the support of specialized personnel. Recently, single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNTs) gas sensors with a limit detection (LOD) of 20 ppm were developed for benzene detection. Other innovative bioassay, called bio-report systems, were proposed. They use a whole cell (Pseudomona putida or Escherichia coli) as molecular recognition element and exhibit a LOD of about 10 μM. Here, we report on the design of a highly sensitive fluorescence assay for monitoring atmospheric level of benzene. For this purpose, we used as molecular recognition element the porcine odorant-binding protein (pOBP). 1-Aminoanthracene was selected as extrinsic fluorescence probe for designing a competitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for benzene detection. The detection limit of our assay was 3.9μg/m3, a value lower than the actual emission limit value of benzene as regulated by European law."
https://openalex.org/W2891623075,"Background Primary central nervous system (CNS) solitary fibrous tumour/hemangiopericytoma (SFT/HPC) is a rare neoplasm and its classification criteria have been redefined by the latest WHO Classification of CNS Tumours. Outcome can vary significantly among patients, thus reliable prognostic markers are warranted. Methods Primary CNS SFT/HPC diagnosed at the Pathology Unit of our Institution between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively collected. Tumour grade along with immunohistochemistry for Ki67, STAT6, PHH3, CD34 and Bcl-2 were assessed. TERT promoter status was evaluated by Sanger sequencing. Results Fifteen SFT/HPC were analysed: 9/15 (60%) female, median age at diagnosis 60 (range: 10–67). Six (40%) cases showed a SFT phenotype and mean H&E-mitotic count was 4.8/10 HPF. Tumour grade was I in 6, II in 4 and III in 5 cases. Mean PHH3-mitotic count was higher than H&E count (8.4 versus 4.8/10 HPF), but it would have determined a change in tumour grade in a sole case. Nuclear staining for STAT6 was present in 14/15 (93.3%). CD34 and Bcl-2 expression rates were lower in higher grade tumours. TERT promoter was mutated in two cases. Median follow up time was 2.4 years (6 months-7.4 years) and 5/15 (33%) patients developed local disease recurrence. Partial resection (p = 0.0185), higher WHO grade (p = 0.038), lower CD34 (p = 0.038) and Bcl-2 (p = 0.010) expressions were significantly associated with a poorer disease-free interval. Conclusions WHO grade is the main prognostic tool in CNS SFT/HPC, but it could be integrated by other markers, like CD34 and Bcl-2, in the clinical practice. The relevance of TERT promoter mutations in this subset of CNS tumours needs further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2892006782,"Background and aim This study assessed the association between depressive symptom severity and cognition in middle-to-older aged adults with mild-to-moderate depression and cardiovascular risk factors using an online test battery (CogState) and whether changes in depressive symptoms over 3 months were associated with changes in cognition. Methods Participants (mean age = 57.8) with cardiovascular risk and mild–to-moderate depressive symptoms completed measures of psychomotor speed, learning, and executive function prior to (n = 445)_and after (n = 334) online depression or attention control interventions. The symptom severity-cognition relationship was examined both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Results Participants exhibited significantly reduced psychomotor speed and variable impairments on measures of learning and executive functioning relative to normative data. However, there was no association of depression severity with cognition at baseline or of change in depressive symptoms with change in cognitive performance. Limitations Participants were well-educated, which may have protected against cognitive decline. Attrition may limit generalisability, though is unlikely to explain the lack of association between depression symptoms and cognition. Conclusions Adults with comorbid mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms and cardiovascular risks performed less well than age-matched normative data on three online cognitive tests; however, we were unable to show any symptom-cognition association cross-sectionally or longitudinally, despite significant improvements in depressive symptoms. This challenges the generalisability of such associations found in more severely unwell clinical samples to those with a broader depressive symptom profile, or suggests that underlying cardiovascular disease may account for the association seen in some clinical studies. This has implications for scaling up selective prevention of cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2889619022,"Evaluating genetic diversity of seagrasses provides insight into reproductive mode and adaptation potential, and is therefore integral to broader conservation strategies for coastal ecosystems. In this study, we assessed genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow in an opportunistic seagrass, Syringodium filiforme, in the Florida Keys and subtropical Atlantic region. We used microsatellite markers to analyze 20 populations throughout the Florida Keys, South Florida, Bermuda and the Bahamas primarily to understand how genetic diversity of S. filiforme partitions across the Florida Keys archipelago. We found low allelic diversity within populations, detecting 35-106 alleles across all populations, and in some instances moderately high clonal diversity (R = 0.04-0.62). There was significant genetic differentiation between Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) populations (FST = 0.109 ± 0.027, p-value = 0.001) and evidence of population structure based on cluster assignment, dividing the region into two major genetic demes. We observed asymmetric patterns in gene flow, with a few instances in which there was higher than expected gene flow from Atlantic to Gulf populations. In South Florida, clustering into Gulf and Atlantic groups indicate dispersal in S. filiforme may be limited by historical or contemporary geographic and hydrologic barriers, though genetic admixture between populations suggests exchange may occur between narrow channels in the Florida Keys, or has occurred through other mechanisms in recent evolutionary history, maintaining regional connectivity. The variable genotypic diversity, low genetic diversity and evidence of population structure observed in populations of S. filiforme resemble the population genetics expected for a colonizer species."
https://openalex.org/W2890887107,"The management of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection is quite complex because it requires an in-depth knowledge of the natural history of the disease. This study was aimed at characterizing HBV infected patients in order to determine the phase of the infection and identify the proportion eligible for treatment using 3 different guidelines.HBV chronically infected patients (negative for HIV and HCV) were enrolled and the following tests were done for them: ALT, AST, HBV viral load, HBV serologic panel and Full blood count. APRI score was calculated for all patients. These patients were classified into immunotolerant, immune clearance, immune control and immune escape phases of the infection. The WHO and the 2018 AASLD criteria was also used to identify those who need treatment. Patients were clinically examined for signs and symptoms. Questionnaire was administered to all participants to ascertain their treatment status. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 21.A total of 283 participants (101 females and 182 males) with a mean age of 31.3±8.5 were enrolled. Fifty-two (18.4%) were eligible for treatment (Immune clearance and immune escape phases) and they recorded a significantly higher mean APRI score (0.71±0.51) as compared to those in the immune control and immune tolerant phase (0.43±0.20). Based on WHO and AASLD criteria, 12(4.2%) and 15 (5.3%) were eligible for treatment respectively and these were all subsets of the 52 cases mentioned above. Six (2.1%) and 29 (10.2%) of those identified under the immune control phase were on tenofovir and traditional medication respectively.Considering treatment for patients in the immune clearance and immune escape phases of the infection can be a reliable strategy to implement in our setting as this may probably tie with considerations from other treatment guidelines. Fifty-two (18.4%) patients were eligible for treatment and none of them were among the 2.1% of patients put on Tenofovir based treatment. This calls for the need for more trained health experts to periodically assess patients, implement an adequate treatment guideline and place the right patients on treatment in Cameroon."
https://openalex.org/W2890898299,"Cultural evolutionary theory provides a framework for explaining change in population-level distributions. A consistent finding in the literature is that multiple transmission episodes shape a distribution of cultural traits to become more compressible, i.e., a set of derived traits are more compressed than their ancestral forms. Importantly, this amplification of compressible patterns can become manifest in two ways, either via the homogenisation of variation or through the organisation of variation into structured and specialised patterns. Using a novel, large-scale dataset from Reddit Place, an online collaborative art project, we investigate the emergence and evolution of compressible patterns on a 1000x1000 pixel canvas. Here, all Reddit users could select a coloured pixel, place it on the canvas, and then wait for a fixed period before placing another pixel. By analysing all 16.5 million pixel placements by over 1 million individuals, we found that compression follows a quadratic trajectory through time. From a non-structured state, where individual artworks exist relatively independently from one another, Place gradually transitions to a structured state where pixel placements form specialised, interdependent patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2890099438,"Rtg1p and Rtg3p are two basic helix–loop–helix, retrograde transcription factors in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both factors heterodimerize to activate the transcription of nuclear genes in response to mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate auxotrophy, but are not well characterized in other yeasts. Here, we demonstrate that the Rtg1p/Rtg3p-mediated retrograde signaling pathway is absent in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. We observed that P. pastoris Rtg1p (PpRtg1p) heterodimerizes with S. cerevisiae Rtg3p and functions as a nuclear, retrograde transcription factor in S. cerevisiae, but not in P. pastoris. We noted that P. pastoris Rtg3p lacks a functional leucine zipper and interacts with neither S. cerevisiae Rtg1p (ScRtg1p) nor PpRtg1p. In the absence of an interaction with Rtg3p, PpRtg1p has apparently acquired a novel function as a cytosolic regulator of multiple P. pastoris metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of glutamate dehydrogenase 2 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase required for the utilization of glutamate as the sole carbon source. PpRtg1p also had an essential role in methanol metabolism and regulated alcohol oxidase synthesis and was required for the metabolism of ethanol, acetate, and oleic acid, but not of glucose and glycerol. Although PpRtg1p could functionally complement ScRtg1p, ScRtg1p could not complement PpRtg1p, indicating that ScRtg1p is not a functional PpRtg1p homolog. Thus, PpRtg1p functions as a nuclear, retrograde transcription factor in S. cerevisiae and as a cytosolic, post-transcriptional regulator in P. pastoris.

https://openalex.org/W2892203922,"Aeromonas hydrophila is a globally occurring, potentially virulent, gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that is known to cause water and food-borne diseases around the world. In this study, we use whole genome sequencing and in silico analyses to identify 14 putative O antigen gene clusters (OGCs) located downstream of the housekeeping genes acrB and/or oprM. We have also identified 7 novel OGCs by analyzing 15 publicly available genomes of different A. hydrophila strains. From the 14 OGCs identified initially, we have deduced that O antigen processing genes involved in the wzx/wzy pathway and the ABC transporter (wzm/wzt) pathway exhibit high molecular diversity among different A. hydrophila strains. Using these genes, we have developed a multiplexed Luminex-based array system that can identify up to 14 A. hydrophila strains. By combining our other results and including the sequences of processing genes from 13 other OGCs (7 OGCs identified from publicly available genome sequences and 6 OGCs that were previously published), we also have the data to create an array system that can identify 25 different A. hydrophila serotypes. Although clinical detection, epidemiological surveillance, and tracing of pathogenic bacteria are typically done using serotyping methods that rely on identifying bacterial surface O antigens through agglutination reactions with antisera, molecular methods such as the one we have developed may be quicker and more cost effective. Our assay shows high specificity, reproducibility, and sensitivity, being able to classify A. hydrophila strains using just 0.1 ng of genomic DNA. In conclusion, our findings indicate that a molecular serotyping system for A. hydrophila could be developed based on specific genes, providing an important molecular tool for the identification of A. hydrophila serotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2888944854,"Listeners are known to use adjacent contextual speech rate in processing temporally ambiguous speech sounds. For instance, an ambiguous vowel between short /α/ and long /a:/ in Dutch sounds relatively long (i.e., as /a:/) embedded in a fast precursor sentence, but short in a slow sentence. Besides the local speech rate, listeners also track talker-specific global speech rates. However, it is yet unclear whether other talkers' global rates are encoded with reference to a listener's self-produced rate. Three experiments addressed this question. In Experiment 1, one group of participants was instructed to speak fast, whereas another group had to speak slowly. The groups were compared on their perception of ambiguous /α/-/a:/ vowels embedded in neutral rate speech from another talker. In Experiment 2, the same participants listened to playback of their own speech and again evaluated target vowels in neutral rate speech. Neither of these experiments provided support for the involvement of self-produced speech in perception of another talker's speech rate. Experiment 3 repeated Experiment 2 but with a new participant sample that was unfamiliar with the participants from Experiment 2. This experiment revealed fewer /a:/ responses in neutral speech in the group also listening to a fast rate, suggesting that neutral speech sounds slow in the presence of a fast talker and vice versa. Taken together, the findings show that self-produced speech is processed differently from speech produced by others. They carry implications for our understanding of rate-dependent speech perception in dialogue settings, suggesting that both perceptual and cognitive mechanisms are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2891472125,"Contractile force development of smooth muscle is controlled by balanced kinase and phosphatase activities toward the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC). Numerous biochemical and pharmacological studies have investigated the specificity and regulatory activity of smooth muscle myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP) bound to myosin filaments and comprised of the regulatory myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) and catalytic protein phosphatase 1cβ (PP1cβ) subunits. Recent physiological and biochemical evidence obtained with smooth muscle tissues from a conditional MYPT1 knockout suggests that a soluble, MYPT1-unbound form of PP1cβ may additionally contribute to myosin RLC dephosphorylation and relaxation of smooth muscle. Using a combination of isoelectric focusing and isoform-specific immunoblotting, we found here that more than 90% of the total PP1c in mouse smooth muscles is the β isoform. Moreover, conditional knockout of PP1cα or PP1cγ in adult smooth muscles did not result in an apparent phenotype in mice up to 6 months of age and did not affect smooth muscle contractions ex vivo. In contrast, smooth muscle–specific conditional PP1cβ knockout decreased contractile force development in bladder, ileal, and aortic tissues and reduced mouse survival. Bladder smooth muscle tissue from WT mice was selectively permeabilized to remove soluble PP1cβ to measure contributions of total (α-toxin treatment) and myosin-bound (Triton X-100 treatment) phosphatase activities toward phosphorylated RLC in myofilaments. Triton X-100 reduced PP1cβ content by 60% and the rate of RLC dephosphorylation by 2-fold. These results are consistent with the selective dephosphorylation of RLC by both MYPT1-bound and -unbound PP1cβ forms in smooth muscle."

HiLPMO9I produced very little soluble sugar on bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC). In contrast, HiLPMO9B was much more active against BMCC and even released more soluble sugar than the H. irregulare cellobiohydrolase I, HiCel7A. Furthermore, HiLPMO9B was shown to cooperate with and stimulate the activity of HiCel7A, both when the BMCC was first pretreated with HiLPMO9B, as well as when HiLPMO9B and HiCel7A were added together. No such stimulation was shown by HiLPMO9I. On the other hand, HiLPMO9I was shown to degrade glucomannan, using a C4-oxidizing mechanism, whereas no oxidative cleavage activity of glucomannan was detected for HiLPMO9B. Structural modeling and comparison with other glucomannan-active LPMOs suggest that conserved sugar-interacting residues on the L2, L3 and LC loops may be essential for glucomannan binding, where 4 out of 7 residues are shared by HiLPMO9I, but only one is found in HiLPMO9B. The difference shown between these two H. irregulare LPMOs may reflect distinct biological roles of these enzymes within deconstruction of different plant cell wall polysaccharides during fungal colonization of softwood."

The atomic structures of five different retrovirus IN–DNA complexes, termed intasomes, have revealed varying IN subunit compositions ranging from tetramers to octamers, dodecamers, and hexadecamers. Intasomes containing two IN-associated viral DNA ends capable of concerted integration are termed stable synaptic complexes (SSC), and those formed with a viral/target DNA substrate representing the product of strand-transfer reactions are strand-transfer complexes (STC). Here, we investigated the mechanisms associated with the assembly of the Rous sarcoma virus SSC and STC. C-terminal truncations of WT IN (286 residues) indicated a role of the last 18 residues (“tail” region) in assembly of the tetrameric and octameric SSC, physically stabilized by HIV-1 IN strand-transfer inhibitors. Fine mapping through C-terminal truncations and site-directed mutagenesis suggested that at least three residues (Asp-268–Thr-270) past the last β-strand in the C-terminal domain (CTD) are necessary for assembly of the octameric SSC. In contrast, the assembly of the octameric STC was independent of the last 18 residues of IN. Single-site substitutions in the CTD affected the assembly of the SSC, but not necessarily of the STC, suggesting that STC assembly may depend less on specific interactions of the CTD with viral DNA. Additionally, we demonstrate that trans-communication between IN dimer–DNA complexes facilitates the association of native long-terminal repeat (LTR) ends with partially defective LTR ends to produce a hybrid octameric SSC.

These insoluble complexes are dialyzed in higher salt buffers that produced soluble and stabilized STCs for purification by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and structural analyses.

Studies were initiated to determine what regions of the IN are responsible for the transition of a tetrameric SSC to the octameric form.

C-terminal truncations of wildtype (WT) RSV IN(1–286) demonstrated that the last 18 residues or “tail region” (Fig. 1) influences the ability of IN to produce SSC that contained either IN tetramers or octamers.

We have further investigated the role of the tail region and the CTD (Fig. 1) of RSV IN by site-directed mutagenesis as well as the long-terminal repeat (LTR) DNA sequences on the assembly of the SSC. The results suggest that the assembly of the octameric RSV SSC is multifactorial, including protein–protein and protein–viral DNA interactions. Selected mutations differentially affect the assembly of the tetrameric and octameric SSC. The results further suggest that two different proximal IN dimer–viral DNA complexes, one with a native LTR end and another with a partially defective end, can communicate in trans to produce the tetrameric SSC that is the precursor to the octameric form. The last well-ordered residue past the β-strand in the crystal structure of the RSV STC containing IN octamers is Ile-269 (Fig. 1) (2.Yin Z. Shi K. Banerjee S. Pandey K.K. Bera S. Grandgenett D.P.

We wanted to determine which residues immediately past Ile-269 had a major effect on the conversion of the tetrameric SSC to the octameric form (Fig. 2).

IN(1–270) was mixed with the 18R GU3 DNA substrate under standard assembly conditions in the presence of MK-2048 for varying times of incubation at 4 or 18 °C and subsequently analyzed by SEC (Fig. 2, A and B). At the higher temperature and shorter times of incubation (Fig. 2A), IN(1–270) was significantly better in producing the octameric SSC than it was at the lower temperature of 4 °C (Fig. 2B). The total incorporation of IN(1–270) and GU3 into either SSC appears to be nearly equivalent as observed by the quantities of both SSC in each experiment (compare Fig. 2, A to B). The results suggest the efficiency of converting the tetrameric SSC to the octameric form is highly dependent on temperature.Table 1Sequences of the LTR substrates used in this studySubstrate nameSubstrate sequence18R WT U35′-ATT GCA TAA GAC TAC A-3′3′-TAA CGT ATT CTG ATG TAA-518R GU35′-ATT GCA TAA GAC AAC A-3′3′-TAA CGT ATT CTG TTG TAA-5′18R U3-A75′-ATT GCA TAA GAA TAC A-3′3′-TAA CGT ATT CTT ATG TAA-5′18R U3-T75′-ATT GCA TAA GAT TAC A-3′3′-TAA CGT ATT CTA ATG TAA-5′20R WT U55′-ATG AAG CAG AAG GCT TCA-3′3′-TAC TTC GTC TTC CGA AGT AA-5′20R GU55′-ATG AAG CAG AAG GCA ACA-3′3′-TAC TTC GTC TTC CGT TGT AA-5′ Open table in a new tab The conversion of the tetrameric SSC to the octameric form was significantly increased by one additional residue with the C-terminal IN(1–271) truncation (Fig. 2, C and D). The efficiency of producing the octameric SSC with IN(1–271) was best at 18 °C and completed by 24 h (Fig. 2C) in contrast to the results observed at 4 °C for the same time periods (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the transition of the tetrameric SSC to the octameric form was rapid and efficient at 18 °C. Similar results compared with IN(1–271) at the higher temperature were obtained using IN(1–272) at 18 °C at 24 h (Fig. 3) or 4 °C (data not shown). IN(1–272) was always slightly better than RSV IN(1–274) at 18 °C for assembling the octameric SSC (Fig. 3). IN(1–274) truncation was previously analyzed (7.Pandey K.K. Bera S. Shi K. Aihara H.

The results suggest that the addition of only a few residues beyond the well-ordered Ile-269 modulates the ability of the C-terminal IN truncations to assemble the octameric SSC.

The various C-terminal IN truncations were assembled with the branched substrate at 4 °C for 24 h in the absence of MK-2048 (Fig. S2).

Here, we determined whether modifications of the charged residues (Fig. 1) or introduction of random amino acids in the tail region of IN(1–278) would affect the ability of IN to assemble the octameric SSC at 18 °C (Fig. 4). The three positively charged Lys residues in the tail region of IN(1–278) were altered to Ala in K272A/K277A/K278A (termed 3K/A) (Fig. 4). In addition, the charged residues Lys-272/Asp-273/Glu-274 group was changed to uncharged Ala or Gly in K272A/D273A/E274G (termed Alt), and a complete random sequence of eight residues (271GAAGGAAA278) (termed Rdm) was substituted in the IN(1–278) backbone. All three different alterations in this C-terminal IN backbone were very similar to the original C-terminal IN(1–278) truncation for assembly of the octameric SSC at 18 °C for 24 h (Fig. 4). IN (3K/A) had the lowest yield of the octameric SSC among the four IN constructs. As shown previously at 4 °C with all three new C-terminal IN truncation mutants (Fig. 2) (7.Pandey K.K. Bera S.

Hispanic cesarean rates were higher than non-Hispanic white rates in the US in 2016. In 2009, cesarean rates among Hispanics on the US-Mexico border exceeded rates among US Hispanics. Since 2009, rates have declined nationwide, but border Hispanic rates have not been studied. Objective To compare cesarean delivery rates and trends in Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border and nonborder counties of the four US border states before and after 2009. Study Design We used data from birth certificates to calculate percentages of cesarean deliveries among all births and births to low-risk nulliparous women during 2000–2015, and among births to low-risk women with and without a previous cesarean during 2009–2015. We calculated 95% confidence intervals around rates and used regular and piecewise linear regression to estimate trends for four ethnic-geographic subpopulations defined by combinations of Hispanic ethnicity and border-nonborder status. Results Of the four subpopulations, border Hispanic rates were highest every year for all cesarean outcomes. In 2015 they were 38.3% overall, 31.4% among low-risk nulliparous women, and 21.1% and 94.6% among low-risk women without and with a previous cesarean, respectively. Nonborder Hispanic rates in 2015 were lowest for all outcomes but repeat cesarean. Rates for all four subpopulations rose steadily during 2000–2009. Unlike rates for non-Hispanic whites, border and nonborder Hispanic rates did not decline post-2009. Most of the border Hispanic excess can be attributed to higher cesarean rates in Texas. Discussion Border Hispanic cesarean rates remain higher than those among other Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in border states and show no signs of declining. This continuing disparity warrants further analysis using individual as well as hospital, environmental and other contextual factors to help target prevention measures."

To our knowledge, no study has determined the effect of denoising on the ability to detect differences in binding at the voxel level using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).In the present study, groups of subject-images with a 10%- and 20%- difference in binding of [123I]iomazenil (IMZ) were simulated. They were denoised with Factor Analysis (FA). Parametric images of binding potential (BPND) were produced with the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the Logan non-invasive graphical analysis (LNIGA) and analyzed using SPM to detect group differences. FA was also applied to [123I]IMZ and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) clinical images (n = 4) and the variance of BPND was evaluated.Estimations from FA-denoised simulated images provided a more favorable bias-precision profile in SRTM and LNIGA quantification. Simulated differences were detected in a higher number of voxels when denoised simulated images were used for voxel-wise estimations, compared to quantification on raw simulated images. Variability of voxel-wise binding estimations on denoised clinical SPECT and PET images was also significantly diminished.In conclusion, noise removal from dynamic brain SPECT and PET images may optimize voxel-wise BPND estimations and detection of biological differences using SPM."
https://openalex.org/W2892168005,"Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is a glycogen storage disorder of known cause whereas the basis for type 2 PSSM (PSSM2) is unknown. The same diet and exercise regime prescribed for PSSM1 is recommended for PSSM2; however, the benefit of these recommendations for PSSM2 is undocumented. The objectives of this study were to determine traits of PSSM2 Warmblood horses (WB), determine the changes in exercise responses that occur with a recommended low-starch/fat-supplemented diet and exercise regime, and determine if glycogen concentrations correspond to the severity of signs. Owners of PSSM2 WB (2008–2016), completed a retrospective questionnaire regarding their horse. Glycogen concentrations were analyzed in skeletal muscle of PSSM2 WB (n = 36) obtained prior to recommendations and in control WB with no evident myopathy (n = 23). Chi-square, Fisher’s exact, McNemar’s tests with Bonferroni correction and Mann Whitney testing were utilized. Abnormal exercise responses reported by owners, began at approximately 6 years of age and included a decline in performance, a reluctance to collect and reluctance to go forward in over 50% of horses. With the recommended diet and exercise regime, 80% of PSSM2 WB owners reported an overall improvement with significant decreases in the proportion of horses showing a decline in performance and rhabdomyolysis. However, 53% of PSSM2 WB were still not advancing as expected with reluctance to go forward and collect persisting in approximately one third of horses. Median muscle glycogen concentrations did not differ between PSSM2 WB and WB with no evident myopathy. PSSM2 WB with the highest glycogen concentrations were significantly more likely to show a decline in performance than those with lower glycogen concentrations. In conclusion, diet and exercise recommendations ideal for PSSM1 improve but do not eliminate the decline in performance and reluctance to go forward under saddle characteristic of PSSM2."
https://openalex.org/W2890023033,"Medical carbon material has been extensively studied due to their excellent biological and mechanical properties. However, the dissociation of the surface carbon particles greatly limited the application of medical carbon material (MCM). To overcome this defect, we introduced the polydimethylsiloxane, a polymer-coating material (PCM) that possesses acceptable biocompatibility, into medical carbon material to prevent the shedding of carbon debris. Additionally, to reduce inflammatory reactions and increase surface hydrophilicity, ferulic acid, also called Chinese medicine coating material (CCM), was used to modify the surface of polymer-coating material. We investigated the proliferation and adhesion of NIH-3T3 cells onto MCM, PCM and CCM in vitro. We showed that CCM exhibited excellent biological activity to promote cell growth. Twelve weeks after CCM implantation, bone defects were repaired, and the material showed acceptable chemical stability. The results indicated that the CCM composite possesses excellent mechanical property and favorable biocompatibility, which can be used for clinical bone repair."

https://openalex.org/W2891517711,"Predicting ecological responses to climate change requires an understanding of the mechanisms that influence species’ tolerances to temperature. Based on the idea that air and water breathing animals are differentially suited to life in either medium due to differences in their respiratory morphology, we examined the possibility that the thermal tolerances of co-existing intertidal pulmonate and patellogastropod limpets may differ in different breathing media. We tested this by determining each species’ median lethal temperature (LT50) and cardiac Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) as measures of upper thermal tolerance limits, in air and water. Although all these species can survive in air and water, we hypothesised that the pulmonate limpets, Siphonaria capensis and S. serrata, would have higher thermal limits than the patellogastropod limpets, Cellana capensis and Scutellastra granularis, in air and vice versa in water. The results did not support our hypotheses, since C. capensis had similar thermal tolerance limits to the pulmonate limpets in air and the pulmonate limpets had thermal tolerance limits similar to or higher than S. granularis in water. Thus, considering pulmonate and patellid limpets as groups, we found no differences in their collective upper thermal tolerance limits in either medium. We conclude that differences between these two limpet groups in their respiratory morphology do not influence thermal tolerance, but that tolerances are species-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2892087960,"It is difficult to determine ages of eels via otoliths, because multiple alternating translucent and opaque zones in the otoliths are hard to identify. In this study, we developed an efficient age determination method for whitespotted conger (Conger myriaster), using random forest models with otolith weight and length, total body length, capture location and season as predictors. 409 specimens were collected from six locations in Yellow and East China Sea between October 2016 and December 2017. Overall OOB error rate was 17.36% compared with 16.26% for the external cross-validation dataset, and the error of age was within one year. Otolith weight and total length were the most important predictors, followed by otolith length, capture locations and seasons. There were no significant differences between the results derived from otolith/somatic morphometrics and otoliths annuli in the estimation of age composition and von Betalanffy Growth Functions growth curve. Our results demonstrated that random forest model with otolith and somatic morphometrics is an efficient and reliable approach for age determination of C. myriaster, which may also be applied to other eel species."
https://openalex.org/W2892147161,"Estimating the incidence of antiretroviral discontinuations due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is important to inform antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimen recommendations, and to guide prescribing and monitoring policies. Routinely collected clinical data is a useful source of pharmacovigilance data. We estimated the incidences of first-line antiretroviral discontinuations due to ADRs using routine clinical data, and compared them with incidences estimated using data enhanced by folder review, in two South African cohorts.We included patients 16 years and older on first-line ART. We selected a stratified random sample of 25% for checking of ART prescription data and reasons for antiretroviral discontinuations retrospectively, including folders reviews where required (enhanced-data sample). We estimated the incidence of antiretroviral discontinuations using Kaplan-Meier and competing risk analyses.In 15396 patients, 40% had a first-line antiretroviral discontinuation by three years on ART. We could determine the reason for 65% of discontinuations using routine data only, and 84% of discontinuations, in the enhanced-data sample of 3837 patients. ADR was the most common reason for discontinuations. In the enhanced-data sample, the cumulative incidence of discontinuations due to ADRs by three years was 30.4% (95% CI: 24.4-36.6) for stavudine; 2.0% (95% CI: 1.5-2.6) for tenofovir, and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.8-2.1) for efavirenz. Using routine data only, the cumulative incidences of discontinuations due to ADRs by three years for stavudine, tenofovir, and efavirenz respectively were 23.9% (95% CI: 20.3-27.7), 1.2% (95% CI: 0.9-1.4) and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3-0.7).Although the relative rankings were similar using routine or enhanced data, lack of checking for missing reasons for discontinuation resulted in underestimates of the incidence of antiretroviral discontinuations due to ADRs. Systems to improve data collection of reasons for regimen changes prospectively would increase the capacity of routine data to answer pharmacovigilance questions."
https://openalex.org/W2891256825,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that remodel the extracellular matrix environment and mitigate outside-in signaling. Loss of regulation of MMP activity plays a role in numerous pathological states. In particular, aberrant collagenolysis affects tumor invasion and metastasis, osteoarthritis, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. To evaluate the collagen sequence preferences of MMPs, a positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library was synthesized herein and was used to investigate the P10′ and P11′ substrate subsites. The scaffold for the library was a triple-helical peptide mimic of the MMP cleavage site in types I–III collagen. A FRET-based enzyme activity assay was used to evaluate the sequence preferences of eight MMPs. Deconvolution of the library data revealed distinct motifs for several MMPs and discrimination among closely related MMPs. On the basis of the screening results, several individual peptides were designed and evaluated. A triple-helical substrate incorporating Asp–Lys in the P10′–P11′ subsites offered selectivity between MMP-14 and MMP-15, whereas Asp–Lys or Trp–Lys in these subsites discriminated between MMP-2 and MMP-9. Future screening of additional subsite positions will enable the design of selective triple-helical MMP probes that could be used for monitoring in vivo enzyme activity and enzyme-facilitated drug delivery. Furthermore, selective substrates could serve as the basis for the design of specific triple-helical peptide inhibitors targeting only those MMPs that play a detrimental role in a disease of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2890104248,"We aimed to study the effects of schooling on aspects of attention using the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) among children in rural Burkina Faso.We re-enrolled children of a previously community-based cluster randomized exclusive breastfeeding trial in rural Burkina Faso. A total of 534 children (280 boys and 254 girls) aged 6 to 8 years were assessed using the TOVA. We examined the effect size difference using Cohen's d, ANOVA and conducted regression analyses.Forty nine percent of the children were in school. Children not in school performed poorly with a small effect size difference for 'Response Time', 'Errors of omission', and 'Errors of commission' compared to children in school. The effect size difference was moderate for 'Response Time Variability', and 'D prime score'.Schooling affects different aspects of attention in rural Burkina Faso. In settings where literacy and schooling rate is low, public sensitizations of the benefits of schooling need to be reinforced and advice on sending children to school need to be provided continuously."
https://openalex.org/W2890880973,"Aim To compare the potential of a gadoxetate disodium enhanced navigator-triggered 3D T1 magnetic-resonance cholangiography (MRC) sequence with a specific inversion recovery prepulse to T2-weighted MRCP for assessment of the hepatobiliary system. Materials and methods 30 patients (12 male, 18 female) prospectively underwent conventional navigator-triggered 3D turbo spin-echo T2-weighted MRCP and 3D T1 MRC with a specific inversion pulse to minimise signal from the liver 30 minutes after administration of gadoxetate disodium on a 1.5 T MRI system. For qualitative evaluation, biliary duct depiction was assessed segmentally following a 5-point Likert scale. Visualisation of hilar structures as well as image quality was recorded. Additionally, the extrahepatic bile ducts were assessed quantitatively by calculation of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Results The advantages of T1 3D MRC include reduced affection of image quality by bowel movement and robust depiction of the relative position of the extrahepatic bile ducts in relation to the portal vein and the duodenum compared to T2 MRCP. However, overall T1 3D MRC did not significantly (p > 0.05) improve the biliary duct depiction compared to T2 MRCP in all segments: Common bile duct 4.1 vs. 4.4, right hepatic duct 3.6 vs. 4.2, left hepatic duct 3.5 vs. 4.1. Image quality did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between both sequences (3.6 vs. 3.5). SNR measurements for the hepatobiliary system did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between navigator-triggered T1 3D MRC and T2 MRCP. Conclusions This preliminary study demonstrates that T1 3D MRC of a specific inversion recovery prepulse has potential to complement T2 MRCP, especially for the evaluation of liver structures close to the hilum in the diagnostic work-up of the biliary system in patients receiving gadoxetate disodium."
