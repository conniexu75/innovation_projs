https://openalex.org/W2771254581,"Aims The association between relative muscle mass (RMM) and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is largely unknown. We examined whether RMM predicted development of T2DM in an apparently young healthy population. Methods This cohort study was comprised of 113,913 men and 89,854 women, free of T2DM at baseline, who underwent a health checkup examination and were followed-up annually or biennially for an average of 2.9 years. We used skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) as an indicator of RMM. SMI (%) [total skeletal muscle mass (kg)/body weight (kg)×100] was estimated using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer. The study outcome was incident T2DM, defined as fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL, HbA1C ≥6.5%, or use of medication for T2DM. Results During 589,098.8 person-years of follow-up, 4,264 individuals developed T2DM (incidence rate, 7.2 per 1000 person-years). Median age (range) at baseline was 39.1 years (18.1–87.1). RMM was negatively associated with incidence of T2DM in a dose-response manner. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for incident T2DM comparing quartiles 3, 2 and 1 of RMM to the highest quartile were 1.32 (1.14–1.52), 1.63 (1.42–1.86), and 2.21 (1.94–2.51), respectively, for males and 1.18 (0.88–1.58), 1.46 (1.11–1.91), and 1.96 (01.51–2.53) for females (P for trend <0.001; 0.011). This association was stronger in younger or premenopausal subjects. Conclusions RMM was negatively associated with development of T2DM in a large sample of young and middle-aged Korean adults. Further research is required to determine whether preservation of muscle mass through intervention affects the risk of T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2773982115,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disease affecting over 6 million people worldwide. Loss of dopamine-producing neurons results in a range of both motor and non-motor symptoms, however there is currently no definitive test for PD by non-specialist clinicians, especially in the early disease stages where the symptoms may be subtle and poorly characterised. This results in a high misdiagnosis rate (up to 25% by non-specialists) and people can have the disease for many years before diagnosis. There is a need for a more accurate, objective means of early detection, ideally one which can be used by individuals in their home setting. In this investigation, keystroke timing information from 103 subjects (comprising 32 with mild PD severity and the remainder non-PD controls) was captured as they typed on a computer keyboard over an extended period and showed that PD affects various characteristics of hand and finger movement and that these can be detected. A novel methodology was used to classify the subjects' disease status, by utilising a combination of many keystroke features which were analysed by an ensemble of machine learning classification models. When applied to two separate participant groups, this approach was able to successfully discriminate between early-PD subjects and controls with 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity and an AUC of 0.98. The technique does not require any specialised equipment or medical supervision, and does not rely on the experience and skill of the practitioner. Regarding more general application, it currently does not incorporate a second cardinal disease symptom, so may not differentiate PD from similar movement-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2772792185,"Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a systemic vasculitis characterized by IgA deposits, which target the skin, joints, and kidneys, among other organs. In children, prognosis is often good but little is known about biomarkers of pediatric nephritis. We hypothesized that biological markers, including cytokines, immunoglobulins, IgA-immune complexes, IgA glycosylation and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), may discriminate IgA vasculitis (IgAV) pediatric patients with renal involvement from those without renal involvement. Fifty children at the time of IgAV rash between 2010 and 2015 were prospectively enrolled and compared to 21 controls. All patients were assessed for clinical and biological parameters at the time of diagnosis, including the levels of cytokines, immunoglobulins, immune complexes, IgA glycosylation and NGAL in serum and urine. Among IgAV patients, 33 patients exhibited nephritis (IgAV-N) and 17 children were without nephritis (IgAV-woN). The serum level of galactose-deficient (Gd)-IgA1 (p<0.01) and the urinary concentrations of IgA, IgG, IgM, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IgA-IgG complexes and IgA-sCD89 complexes (p<0.001 for all) were higher in the IgAV-N patients than in the IgAV-woN patients. Among those markers, urinary IgA and IgM had the highest AUC (0.86 and 0.87 respectively, p<0.0001). This prospective cohort study furthers our understanding of the pathophysiology of IgAV. We identified biomarkers that are able to distinguish patients initially with or without nephritis. To conclude, serum Gd-IgA1 and urinary IgA, IgG, IgM, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IgA-IgG and IgA-sCD89 complexes could identify IgAV pediatric patients with renal involvement at the time of diagnosis."

Outcomes were: patient characteristics, hospitalization, 90-day ED-return visits, and 30-day mortality.A retrospective cohort study was conducted amongst elderly patients present to the Internal Medicine Emergency Department (ED) between 01-09-2010 and 31-08-2011. NSC were defined as indefinable complaints that lack a pre-differential diagnosis needed to initiate of a standardized patient evaluation. Cox regression was performed to calculate Hazard Ratios (HR) and corrected for confounders such as comorbidity.In total, 1784 patients were enrolled; 244 (13.7%) presented with NSC. Compared to those with SC, comorbidity was higher in the NSC-group (Charlson comorbidity index 3.0 vs. 2.4, p<0.001). The triage level did not differ, but ED-length of stay was longer in the NSC-group (188 vs. 178 minutes, p = 0.004). Hospitalization was more frequent (84.0 vs. 71.1%, p<0.001) and the length of hospital stay (9 vs. 6 days, p<0.001 was longer in the NSC- than in the SC-group. The number of ED-return visits were comparable between both groups (HR 0.8, 95%CI 0.6-1.1). Mortality within 30-days was higher in the NSC- (20.1%) than in the SC-group (11.0%, HR 1.7 95%CI 1.2-2.4).Elderly patients present with NSC at the ED regularly. These patients are more often hospitalized and have a substantially higher 30-day mortality than patients with SC."
https://openalex.org/W2773752529,"Introduction Depression has been shown to be associated with elevated leptin levels, low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. These derangements are often measured in mixed gender cohorts despite the different body compositions and hormonal environments of men and women and gender-specific prevalence and responses to depression. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was carried out on a cohort of 639 participants from the ADDITION-Leicester dataset to assess differences in markers of diabetes risk, cardiovascular risk and inflammation in depressed and non-depressed individuals. Depressive symptoms were determined using the WHO (Five) well-being index. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, social deprivation and activity levels for continuous and binary variables respectively. Further analysis included stratifying the data by gender as well as assessing the interaction between depression and gender by including an interaction term in the model. Results Women with depressive symptoms had a 5.3% larger waist circumference (p = 0.003), 28.7% higher HOMA IR levels (p = 0.026), 6.6% higher log-leptin levels (p = 0.01) and 22.37% higher TNF-α levels (p = 0.015) compared with women without. Conversely, depressive symptoms in men were associated with 7.8% lower body fat % (p = 0.015) but 48.7% higher CRP levels (p = 0.031) compared to men without. However, interaction analysis failed to show a significant difference between men and women. Conclusions Depressive symptoms are associated with metabolic derangements. Whilst women tended to show elevations in biomarkers related to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (HOMA IR, leptin and TNF-α), men showed a marked increase in the cardiovascular disease risk biomarker CRP. However, perhaps due to the cohort size, interaction analysis did not show a significant gender difference."
https://openalex.org/W2771241409,"Epidemiological studies show an association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontal disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gingivalis) is a well-known pathogen in periodontitis. This study investigated the pathogenic effects of P.gingivalis on autoimmune arthritis in vivo. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were intraperitoneally injected with W83 and 2561 strains of P.gingivalis. Infection with P.gingivalis exacerbated arthritis score in CIA mice. Synovial inflammation and bone destruction in CIA mice infected with P.gingivalis were more severe than in uninfected CIA mice. Both W83 and 2561 strains were more pro-arthritic after arthritis symptom was fully activated. Interestingly, only W83 strain was arthritogenic before autoimmune reaction initiated. Citrullination was detected in synovial tissue of CIA mice and CIA mice inoculated with P.gingivalis, but not in normal control mice. The citrullinated area was greater in P.gingivalis-infected CIA mice than in non-infected CIA mice. This study showed that P.gingivalis exacerbated disease in a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis and increased the expression of citrullinated antigens in the synovium. The arthritogenic effects of P.gingivalis were at least in part, dependent upon the bacterial strain with or without fimbriae expression, route and time of infection. P.gingivalis-mediated citrullination may explain the possible link between periodontal disease and RA."
https://openalex.org/W2774494527,"This study investigated electrocortical dynamics of human walking across different unconstrained walking conditions (i.e., level ground (LW), ramp ascent (RA), and stair ascent (SA)). Non-invasive active-electrode scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded and a systematic EEG processing method was implemented to reduce artifacts. Source localization combined with independent component analysis and k-means clustering revealed the involvement of four clusters in the brain during the walking tasks: Left and Right Occipital Lobe (LOL, ROL), Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC), and Central Sensorimotor Cortex (SMC). Results showed that the changes of spectral power in the PPC and SMC clusters were associated with the level of motor task demands. Specifically, we observed α and β suppression at the beginning of the gait cycle in both SA and RA walking (relative to LW) in the SMC. Additionally, we observed significant β rebound (synchronization) at the initial swing phase of the gait cycle, which may be indicative of active cortical signaling involved in maintaining the current locomotor state. An increase of low γ band power in this cluster was also found in SA walking. In the PPC, the low γ band power increased with the level of task demands (from LW to RA and SA). Additionally, our results provide evidence that electrocortical amplitude modulations (relative to average gait cycle) are correlated with the level of difficulty in locomotion tasks. Specifically, the modulations in the PPC shifted to higher frequency bands when the subjects walked in RA and SA conditions. Moreover, low γ modulations in the central sensorimotor area were observed in the LW walking and shifted to lower frequency bands in RA and SA walking. These findings extend our understanding of cortical dynamics of human walking at different level of locomotion task demands and reinforces the growing body of literature supporting a shared-control paradigm between spinal and cortical networks during locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2772747208,"Global positioning system (GPS) technologies have improved the ability of researchers to monitor wildlife; however, use of these technologies is often limited by monetary costs. Some researchers have begun to use commercially available GPS loggers as a less expensive means of tracking wildlife, but data regarding performance of these devices are limited. We tested a commercially available GPS logger (i–gotU GT–120) by placing loggers at ground control points with locations known to < 30 cm. In a preliminary investigation, we collected locations every 15 minutes for several days to estimate location error (LE) and circular error probable (CEP). Using similar methods, we then investigated the influence of cover on LE, CEP, and fix success rate (FSR) by constructing cover over ground control points. We found mean LE was < 10 m and mean 50% CEP was < 7 m. FSR was not significantly influenced by cover and in all treatments remained near 100%. Cover had a minor but significant effect on LE. Denser cover was associated with higher mean LE, but the difference in LE between the no cover and highest cover treatments was only 2.2 m. Finally, the most commonly used commercially available devices provide a measure of estimated horizontal position error (EHPE) which potentially may be used to filter inaccurate locations. Using data combined from the preliminary and cover investigations, we modeled LE as a function of EHPE and number of satellites. We found support for use of both EHPE and number of satellites in predicting LE; however, use of EHPE to filter inaccurate locations resulted in the loss of many locations with low error in return for only modest improvements in LE. Even without filtering, the accuracy of the logger was likely sufficient for studies which can accept average location errors of approximately 10 m."
https://openalex.org/W2772954333,"Down syndrome (DS) is the most prevalent chromosomal abnormality. Early-onset dementia with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) frequently develops in DS. Reliable blood biomarkers are needed to support the diagnosis for dementia in DS, since positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid sampling is burdensome, particularly for patients with DS. Plasma t-tau is one of the established biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD, suggesting the potential value of t-tau as a biomarker for dementia in DS. The aim of this study was to assess and compare plasma levels of t-tau in adults with DS and in an age-matched control population. In this study, plasma levels of t-tau in 21 patients with DS and 22 control participants were measured by an ultrasensitive immunoassay technology, the single-molecule immunoarray (Simoa) method. We observed significantly increased plasma t-tau levels in the DS group (mean ± standard deviation (SD) = 0.643±0.493) compared to those in the control group (mean ± SD = 0.470±0.232): P = 0.0050. Moreover, age dependent correlation of plasma t-tau was only found in the DS group, and not in the control group. These findings suggest that elevated plasma t-tau levels reflect AD pathology and therefore have potential as an objective biomarker to detect dementia in adult DS."
https://openalex.org/W2772178670,"Breast cancer (BC) treatment includes mostly chemotherapy (CT), which can cause side effects like nausea, taste changes, early satiety, slow gastric emptying and xerostomia. In this way, the individual's relationship with food may change during the treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on perceptions related to food intake of women with BC. Fifty-five women with BC were followed, and data were collected at three periods during first-line CT: beginning (T0), intermediate (T1) and end (T2). A visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 10 cm) for hunger, appetite for various food categories and meal enjoyment was investigated. The frequency and intensity of side effects were evaluated using a 4 cm scale. The results showed a higher prevalence of taste changes in T1 (p = 0.044) and more nausea in T1 and T2 (p = 0.018). Furthermore, the intensity of nausea was higher in T2 (p = 0.01) than in the other periods. We observed moderate hunger in T0, T1 and T2 (p = 0.113), but the overall appetite increased between T0 and T2 (p = 0.003). Meal enjoyment was reduced from T0 to T1and returned back to the initial value in T2 (p = 0.021). The appetite for salty (p = 0.004) and spicy (p = 0.03) foods was increased in T1. There was an increase of body weight (p = 0.008), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.009) and waist circumference (WC) (p = 0.03) during CT. CT changes food hedonism, increasing the overall appetite and the appetite for salty and spicy foods. Moreover, we observed the negative impact of CT on meal enjoyment and an increase in side effects and anthropometric parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2771516164,"Periodontal disease (PD) is characterized by inflammatory tissue destruction in tooth supporting apparatus. Many studies indicate that the underlying pathogenesis is in concordance with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) sharing immune-inflammatory events affect both diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate serum cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, enzymes and costimulatory proteins in association with periodontal conditions in PD and RA subjects.Periodontal examination was performed in RA (n = 38), PD (n = 38) and healthy subjects (n = 14). Bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD) were measured. Marginal bone loss (MBL) for premolars and molars was measured on digital panoramic radiographs. PD was defined as present if the PPD was ≥5mm in ≥ 3 different sites. Serum samples were collected from all subjects. A multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) was used to analyze the samples for simultaneous measurement of 92 cytokines. Cytokines with ≥ 60% quantitative results were included.A significant positive correlation was seen for ST1A1, FGF-19 and NT-3 whereas EN-RAGE, DNER, CX3CL1 and TWEAK associated inversely with BOP, PPD≥ 5mm and MBL but positively with number of teeth. Several CD markers (CD244, CD40, CDCP1, LIF-R, IL-10RA, CD5 and CD6) were found to be associated with BOP, shallow and deep pockets, MBL and number of teeth, either directly or inversely. Most chemokines (CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL11, CCL4, CCL20, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CCL23) were positively associated with number of teeth and some inversely related to MBL (CCL8, CXCL10). Proteins with enzymatic activity (ST1A1, HGF and CASP-8) were directly related to the severity of periodontal conditions and inversely related to number of teeth. Aside from FGF-19, other growth factors were also directly associated with MBL (HGF), number of teeth (VEGF-A, LAP TGF-beta-1) and, inversely to, shallow pockets (LAP TGF-beta-1, TGFA and Beta-NGF). Out of 33 cytokines, 32 associated inversely with shallow pockets, whereas only CD40 associated positively. Associations between cytokines and periodontal parameters in the RA group were comparatively less. Statistical analyses were adjusted for multivariate effects using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method.Systemic inflammatory burden, via known and novel markers, is associated with periodontal conditions in PD and RA subjects. Shallow pockets are not associated with a higher inflammatory state."
https://openalex.org/W2775520402,"Climate change may affect the chemical composition of riparian leaf litter and, aquatic organisms and, consequently, leaf breakdown. We evaluated the effects of different scenarios combining increased temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) on leaf detritus of Hevea spruceana (Benth) Müll. and decomposers (insect shredders and microorganisms). We hypothesized that simulated climate change (warming and elevated CO2) would: i) decrease leaf-litter quality, ii) decrease survival and leaf breakdown by shredders, and iii) increase microbial leaf breakdown and fungal biomass. We performed the experiment in four microcosm chambers that simulated air temperature and CO2 changes in relation to a real-time control tracking current conditions in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. The experiment lasted seven days. During the experiment mean air temperature and CO2 concentration ranged from 26.96 ± 0.98ºC and 537.86 ± 18.36 ppmv in the control to 31.75 ± 0.50ºC and 1636.96 ± 17.99 ppmv in the extreme chamber, respectively. However, phosphorus concentration in the leaf litter decreased with warming and elevated CO2. Leaf quality (percentage of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, cellulose and lignin) was not influenced by soil flooding. Fungal biomass and microbial leaf breakdown were positively influenced by temperature and CO2 increase and reached their highest values in the intermediate condition. Both total and shredder leaf breakdown, and shredder survival rate were similar among all climatic conditions. Thus, low leaf-litter quality due to climate change and higher leaf breakdown under intermediate conditions may indicate an increase of riparian metabolism due to temperature and CO2 increase, highlighting the risk (e.g., decreased productivity) of global warming for tropical streams."
https://openalex.org/W2772014051,"Background An imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory systems in the pain networks may explain the persistent chronic pain after hallux valgus surgery. Thus, to contra-regulate this dysfunction, the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) becomes attractive. Objective We tested the hypothesis that two preoperative active(a)-tDCS sessions compared with sham(s)-tDCS could improve the postoperative pain [as indexed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at rest and during walking (primary outcomes)]. To assess their effect on the change in the Numerical Pain Scale (NPS0-10) during Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM-task), disability related to pain (DRP) and analgesic consumption (secondary outcomes). Also, we assessed if the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) after tDCS could predict the intervention’s effect on the DRP. Methods It is a prospective, double blind, sham-controlled, randomized single center, 40 women (18–70 years-old) who had undergone hallux valgus surgery were randomized to receive two sessions (20 minutes each) of anodal a-tDCS or s-tDCS on the primary motor cortex at night and in the morning before the surgery. To assess the DRP was used the Brazilian Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen (B-PCP:S). Results A-tDCS group showed lower scores on VAS at rest and during walking (P<0.001). At rest, the difference between groups was 2.13cm (95%CI = 1.59 to 2.68) while during walking was 1.67cm (95%CI = 1.05 to 2.28). A-tDCS, when compared to s-tDCS reduced analgesic doses in 73.25% (P<0.001), produced a greater reduction in B-PCP:S (mean difference of 9.41 points, 95%CI = 0.63 to 18.21) and higher function of descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) during CPM-task. Conclusion A-tDCS improves postoperative pain, the DRP and the function of DPMS. Also, the CSF BDNF after a-tDCS predicted the improvement in the DRP. In overall, these findings suggest that a-tDCS effects may be mediated by top-down regulatory mechanisms associated with the inhibitory cortical control.

https://openalex.org/W2772607919,"Xuezhikang (XZK), an extract of red yeast rice, is a traditional Chinese medicine widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China and other countries. However, whether XZK treatment can improve atherosclerotic plaque stability is not fully understood. Based on our previously developed mouse model of spontaneous vulnerable plaque formation and rupture in carotid arteries in ApoE-/- mice. We showed that low-dose (600 mg/kg/d) XZK improved plaque stability without decreasing plaque area, whereas high-dose (1200 mg/kg/d) XZK dramatically inhibited vulnerable plaque progression accompanied by decreased plaque area. Mechanistically, XZK significantly suppressed lesional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mouse carotid arteries. In vitro, XZK inhibited 7-KC-induced activation of ER stress in RAW264.7 macrophages, as assessed by the reduced levels of p-PERK, p-IRE1α, p-eIF2α, c-ATF6, s-XBP1, and CHOP. Compared to controls, the XZK-treated group displayed dramatically decreased apoptotic cell numbers (shown by decreased TUNEL- and cleaved caspase3-positive cells), lower necrotic core area and ratio, and reduced expression of NF-κB target gene. In RAW264.7 cells, XZK inhibited 7-KC-induced upregulation of apoptosis, protein expression of apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP), and NF-κB activation (shown by target gene transcription and IκBα reduction). Collectively, our results suggest that XZK effectively suppresses vulnerable plaque progression and rupture by mitigating macrophage ER stress and consequently inhibiting apoptosis and the NF-κB pro-inflammatory pathway, thereby providing an alternative therapeutic strategy for stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques."
https://openalex.org/W2775074827,"People are increasingly leaving digital traces of their daily activities through interacting with their digital environment. Among these traces, financial transactions are of paramount interest since they provide a panoramic view of human life through the lens of purchases, from food and clothes to sport and travel. Although many analyses have been done to study the individual preferences based on credit card transaction, characterizing human behavior at larger scales remains largely unexplored. This is mainly due to the lack of models that can relate individual transactions to macro-socioeconomic indicators. Building these models, not only can we obtain a nearly real-time information about socioeconomic characteristics of regions, usually available yearly or quarterly through official statistics, but also it can reveal hidden social and economic structures that cannot be captured by official indicators. In this paper, we aim to elucidate how macro-socioeconomic patterns could be understood based on individual financial decisions. To this end, we reveal the underlying interconnection of the network of spending leveraging anonymized individual credit/debit card transactions data, craft micro-socioeconomic indices that consists of various social and economic aspects of human life, and propose a machine learning framework to predict macro-socioeconomic indicators."

The diabetic children were divided: a) 20 children in good metabolic control (Hb1ac≤7.5) and b) 48 children in bad metabolic control (Hb1ac>7.5). Dietary and oral hygiene habits were investigated. Caries status was registered using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System. Oral microflora was analysed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation method. Plaque acidogenicity was recorded after a sucrose rinse.Sugared beverage and snack intake was higher in diabetic group compared to non-diabetic group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively) and in subjects in bad metabolic control (p = 0.03 and p<0.01, respectively). Oral hygiene habits were similar, except for the use of fluoridated adjuvants, higher in non-diabetic children (p = 0.04). No statistically significant differences were observed regarding caries figures, but a higher number of caries free subjects was found in diabetic subjects in good metabolic control (p<0.01). Significant difference for the main cariogenic bacteria was found between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects (p<0.05). The pH values showed statistically significant differences between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects and between diabetic subjects in good and bad metabolic control (p<0.01).Diabetic children in good metabolic control might even be considered at low caries risk, while those in bad metabolic control showed an oral environment prone to a high caries risk."

To enhance this infection and the potential agricultural application, we compared six different infection methods (Direct seed dip; Seed germination dip; Pruned-root dip; Foliar spray; Circum-soil dip; Seed dip and circum-soil dip) for achieving the high efficient infection of A. caulinodans into wheat plants by employing a green fluorescent protein (gfp)-labeled Azorhizobium caulinodans strain ORS571. With proper methods, copious rhizobia could enter the interior and promote the growth of wheat to the hilt. Circum-soil dip was proved to be the most efficient method, seed germination dip and pruned-root dip is the last recommended to infect wheat, seed germination dip and seed dip and circum-soil dip showed better effects on plant growth, pruned-root dip did not show too much effect on plant growth. This study laid the foundation for understanding the interaction between rhizobia and cereal crops and the growth-promoting function of rhizobia."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate S. aureus nasal colonization over time among Portuguese nursing students, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).In this longitudinal cohort study, we collected 280 nasal swabs from nursing students at 14 time points over four years of schooling (2012-2016). The isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and SCCmec typing for MRSA. Among 47 students, 20 (43%) carried methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) at admission, but none was colonized with MRSA. A total of 19 students (40%) became colonized after exposure during the nursing training, out of which five carried MRSA. Overall, 39 students (83%) had S. aureus detected at least once during the study period. Among the 97 MSSA isolates, most (65%) belonged to four clones: PFGE A-ST30 (21%), B-ST72 (20%), C-ST508 (13%), and D-ST398 (11%). Three of the five MRSA carriers were colonized with the predominant clone circulating in Portuguese hospitals (ST22-IVh) and two with ST3162-II. Colonization of nursing students was highly dynamic with continuous appearance of strains with distinct PFGE types in the same individual.A considerable proportion of students became colonized by S. aureus, including MRSA, during the nursing education, evidencing this population represents an important reservoir of S. aureus. Therefore, education on infection control measures in nursing schools is of major importance."

Methods This study was undertaken in four phases and used a mixed method approach (an audit, a semi-structured interview, a survey and simulation study). The three months audit was of 24 patients, the semi-structured interview was performed with 19 health professionals and informed the process of use of pH strips. A survey of 134 professionals and novices explored the likelihood of misinterpreting pH strips. Standardised questionnaires were used to assess professionals perceived usability, trust and acceptance of pH strip use in a simulated study. Results The audit found that in 45.7% of the cases aspiration could not be achieved, and that 54% of the NG-tube insertions required x-ray confirmation. None of those interviewed had received formal training on pH strips use. In the simulated study, participants made up to 11.15% errors in reading the strips with important implications for decision making regarding NG tube placement. No difference was identified between professionals and novices in their likelihood of misinterpreting the pH value of the strips. Whilst the overall experience of usage is poor (47.3%), health professionals gave a positive level of trust in both the interview (62.6%) and the survey (68.7%) and acceptance (interview group 65.1%, survey group 74.7%). They also reported anxiety in the use of strips (interview group 29.7%, survey group 49.7%). Conclusions Significant errors occur when using pH strips in a simulated study.

A multicenter national program was developed to assess toxicity and tumor response with hypofractionated stereotactic boost after conventional radiotherapy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.Between August 2010 and April 2013, 76 patients with intermediated-risk prostate carcinoma were included in the study. A first course delivered 46 Gy by IMRT (68.4% of patients) or 3D conformal radiotherapy (31.6% of patients). The second course delivered a boost of 18 Gy (3x6Gy) within 10 days. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were evaluated as defined by NCI-CTCAE (v4.0). Secondary outcome measures were local control, overall and metastasis-free survival, PSA kinetics, and patient functional status (urinary and sexual) according to the IIEF5 and IPSS questionnaires.The overall treatment time was 45 days (median, range 40-55). Median follow-up was 26.4 months (range, 13.6-29.9 months). Seventy-seven per cent (n = 58) of patients presented a Gleason score of 7. At 24 months, biological-free survival was 98.7% (95% CI, 92.8-99.9%) and median PSA 0.46 ng/mL (range, 0.06-6.20 ng/mL). Grade ≥2 acute GI and GU toxicities were 13.2% and 23.7%, respectively. Grade ≥2 late GI and GU toxicities were observed in 6.6% and 2.6% of patients, respectively. No grade 4 toxicity was observed.Hypofractionated stereotactic boost is effective and safely delivered for intermediate-risk prostate carcinoma after conventional radiation. Mild-term relapse-free survival and tolerance results are promising, and further follow-up is warranted to confirm the results at long term.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01596816."

Here we analyzed for the first time all the intermediate products of DNA demethylation pathway in the form of deoxynucleosides (5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine, 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2′-deoxycytidine, 5-formyl-2′-deoxycytidine and 5-carboxy-2′-deoxycytidine as well as 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2′-deoxyuridine) using automated isotope-dilution online two-dimensional ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. DNA was isolated from human malignant cell lines of colon adenocarcinoma (HCT 116), melanoma (Me45), myelogenous leukemia bone marrow blasts (K562), EBV-positive Burkitt’s lymphoma lymphoblasts (Raji), EBV-negative Burkitt’s lymphoma lymphoblasts (male-CA46 and female-ST486), as well as normal neonatal dermal fibroblasts (NHDF-Neo). The expression levels of TET1, TET2, TET3, SMUG1, and TDG genes were also assayed by RT-qPCR. Our results show a global erasure of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine and 5-carboxy-2′-deoxycytidine in DNA of cultured cells compared with DNA from primary malignant tissue. Moreover, malignant cells in culture have a quite different DNA epigenetic profile than cultured normal cells, and different types of malignant cells display different and characteristic profiles of DNA epigenetic marks. Similar analyses of a broader spectrum of epigenetic modifications, not restricted to 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine, could lead to better understanding of the mechanism(s) responsible for emergence of different types of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2771640620,"People in cities nowadays suffer from increasingly severe traffic jams due to less awareness of how collective human mobility is affected by urban planning. Besides, understanding how region functions shape human mobility is critical for business planning but remains unsolved so far. This study aims to discover the association between region functions and resulting human mobility. We establish a linear regression model to predict the traffic flows of Beijing based on the input referred to as bag of POIs. By solving the predictor in the sense of sparse representation, we find that the average prediction precision is over 74% and each type of POI contributes differently in the predictor, which accounts for what factors and how such region functions attract people visiting. Based on these findings, predictive human mobility could be taken into account when planning new regions and region functions."
https://openalex.org/W2772873006,"Objectives To elucidate new risk factors for MRSA carriers without known risk factors (MRSA of unknown origin; MUO). These MUO carriers are neither pre-emptively screened nor isolated as normally dictated by the Dutch Search & Destroy policy, thus resulting in policy failure. Methods We performed a prospective case control study to determine risk factors for MUO acquisition/carriage (Dutch Trial Register: NTR2041). Cases were MUO carriers reported by participating medical microbiological laboratories to the RIVM from September 1st 2011 until September 1st 2013. Controls were randomly selected from the community during this period. Results Significant risk factors for MUO in logistic multivariate analysis were antibiotic use in the last twelve months, aOR 8.1 (5.6–11.7), screened as contact in a contact tracing but not detected as a MRSA carrier at that time, aOR 4.3 (2.1–8.8), having at least one foreign parent, aOR 2.4 (1.4–3.9) and receiving ambulatory care, aOR 2.3 (1.4–3.7). Our found risk factors explained 83% of the MUO carriage. Conclusions Identifying new risk factors for MRSA carriers remains crucial for countries that apply a targeted screening approach as a Search and Destroy policy or as vertical infection prevention measure."
https://openalex.org/W2774529556,"Purpose X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) is the current gold standard for the assessment of lumen encroaching coronary stenosis but XCA does not allow for early detection of rupture-prone vulnerable plaques, which are thought to be the precursor lesions of most acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) and sudden death. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of delayed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance coronary vessel wall imaging (CE-MRCVI) for the detection of culprit lesions in the coronary arteries. Methods 16 patients (13 male, age 61.9±8.6 years) presenting with sub-acute MI underwent CE-MRCVI within 24-72h prior to invasive XCA. CE-MRCVI was performed using a T1-weighted 3D gradient echo inversion recovery sequence (3D IR TFE) 40±4 minutes following the administration of 0.2 mmol/kg gadolinium-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) on a 3T MRI scanner equipped with a 32-channel cardiac coil. Results 14 patients were found to have culprit lesions (7x LAD, 1xLCX, 6xRCA) as identified by XCA. Quantitative CE-MRCVI correctly identified the culprit lesion location with a sensitivity of 79% and excluded culprit lesion formation with a specificity of 99%. The contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of culprit lesions (9.7±4.1) significantly exceeded CNR values of segments without culprit lesions (2.9±1.9, p<0.001). Conclusion CE-MRCVI allows the selective visualization of culprit lesions in patients immediately after myocardial infarction (MI). The pronounced contrast uptake in ruptured plaques may represent a surrogate biomarker of plaque activity and/or vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2771320966,"The infection caused by Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common but overlooked non-viral sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Treatment relies on one class of drugs, the 5-nitroimidazoles, but resistance is widespread. New drugs are urgently needed. We reported the effect of crude and purified saponin fractions of Manilkara rufula against Trichomonas vaginalis. The compound responsible for antitrichomonal activity was isolated and identified as an uncommon bidesmosic saponin, Mi-saponin C. This saponin eliminated parasite viability without toxicity against the human vaginal epithelial line (HMVII). In addition, the isolated saponin fraction improved the metronidazole effect against a metronidazole-resistant isolate and dramatically reduced the cytoadherence of T. vaginalis to human cells. Investigation of the mechanism of death showed that the saponin fraction induced the parasite death due to profound membrane damage, inducing a disturbance of intracellular content without nuclear damage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of antitrichomonal activity in the bidesmosic saponins of Manilkara rufula."
https://openalex.org/W2774519184,"Objectives We assessed whether grip strength was related to various types of radiographic damage in Korean adults with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Data from 2,251 subjects enrolled in the Dong-gu study, who had no hand joint pain, were analyzed to investigate the relationship between grip strength and OA. Hand grip strength was measured using a hand-held dynamometer, and radiographs of the hand and knee were scored according to a semi-quantitative grading system. Multiple linear regressions were used to explore associations between grip strength and radiographic features of OA. Results Grip strength in men and women was negatively related to hand (both p < 0.001) and knee (men, p < 0.001; women, p = 0.010) OA after adjusting for confounders. Hand (men, p < 0.001; women, p = 0.001) and knee (both p < 0.001) joint space narrowing (JSN) showed the strongest associations with low grip strength, regardless of gender. Moreover, the severity of hand osteophytes in women (p = 0.001), and subchondral cysts (men, p < 0.001) was correlated with low grip strength in both genders. Conclusions Among subjects without hand joint pain, low grip strength was associated significantly with hand and knee radiographic OA, regardless of gender. Among all types of OA radiographic damage, low grip strength showed the strongest association with JSN."
https://openalex.org/W2771229559,"Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been reported to play major roles in tumorigenesis, tumor relapse, and metastasis after therapy against colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Therefore, identification of colorectal CSC regulators could provide promising targets for CRC. Ligand-of-Numb protein X1 (LNX1) is one E3 ubiquitin ligase which mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Numb. Although several studies indicate LNX1 could be a potential suppressor of cancer diseases, the functions of LNX1 in mediating cancer stemness remain poorly understood. In this study, LNX1 was identified as a negative regulator of cancer stemness in CRC, which was downregulated in colonospheres or side population (SP) cells. Furthermore, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) was found to be one critical downstream mediator of cancer stemness regulated by LNX1. Interestingly, the anti-breast cancer drug tamoxifen was found to be an agonist of LNX1 and suppress cancer stemness in CRC. In sum, this study provided the evidences that LNX1 signaling plays important roles in regulating the stemness of colon cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2772367294,"Introduction 
Although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (influenza) infections are one of the leading causes of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and death in young children worldwide, little is known about the burden of these pathogens in Mozambique.


Material and methods 
From January 2015 to January 2016, nasopharyngeal swabs from 450 children, aged ≤2 years, who had been admitted to the Pediatric Department of the Maputo Central Hospital (HCM) in Mozambique, suffering with SARI were enrolled and tested for influenza and RSV using a real-time PCR assay.


Results 
Influenza and RSV were detected in 2.4% (11/450) and 26.7% (113/424) of the participants. Children with influenza were slightly older than those infected with RSV (10 months in influenza-infected children compared to 3 months in RSV-infected children); male children were predominant in both groups (63.6% versus 54.9% in children with influenza and RSV, respectively). There was a trend towards a higher frequency of influenza (72.7%) and RSV (93.8%) cases in the dry season. Bronchopneumonia, bronchitis and respiratory distress were the most common diagnoses at admission. Antibiotics were administered to 27,3% and 15,9% of the children with influenza and RSV, respectively. Two children, of whom, one was positive for RSV (aged 6 months) and another was positive for Influenza (aged 3 months) died; both were children of HIV seropositive mothers and had bronchopneumonia.


Conclusions 
Our data demonstrated that RSV, and less frequently influenza, occurs in children with SARI in urban/sub-urban settings from southern Mozambique. The occurrence of deaths in small children suspected of being HIV-infected, suggests that particular attention should be given to this vulnerable population. Our data also provide evidence of antibiotics prescription in children with respiratory viral infection, which represents an important public health problem and calls for urgent interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2772665712,"Background Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) at the point of care have the potential to increase access and acceptability of EVD testing and the speed of patient isolation and secure burials for suspect cases. A pilot program for EVD RDTs in high risk areas of Guinea was introduced in October 2015. This paper presents concordance data between EVD RDTs and PCR testing in the field as well as an assessment of the acceptability, feasibility, and quality assurance of the RDT program. Methods and findings Concordance data were compiled from laboratory surveillance databases. The operational measures of the laboratory-based EVD RDT program were evaluated at all 34 sentinel sites in Guinea through: (1) a technical questionnaire filled by the lab technicians who performed the RDTs, (2) a checklist filled by the evaluator during the site visits, and (3) direct observation of the lab technicians performing the quality control test. Acceptability of the EVD RDT was good for technicians, patients, and families although many technicians (69.8%) expressed concern for their safety while performing the test. The feasibility of the program was good based on average technician knowledge scores (6.6 out of 8) but basic infrastructure, equipment, and supplies were lacking. There was much room for improvement in quality assurance of the program. Conclusions The implementation of new diagnostics in weak laboratory systems requires general training in quality assurance, biosafety and communication with patients in addition to specific training for the new test. Corresponding capacity building in terms of basic equipment and a long-term commitment to transfer supervision and quality improvement to national public health staff are necessary for successful implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2773911394,"An alcohol dehydrogenase from the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii (HvADH2) has been engineered by rational design to broaden its substrate scope towards the conversion of a range of aromatic substrates, including flurbiprofenol, that is an intermediate of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, flurbiprofen. Wild-type HvADH2 showed minimal activity with flurbiprofenol (11.1 mU/mg). A homology model of HvADH2 was built and docking experiments with this substrate revealed that the biphenyl rings of flurbiprofenol formed strong interactions with residues F85 and F108, preventing its optimal binding in the active site. Mutations at position 85 however did not increase activity. Site directed mutagenesis at position F108 allowed the identification of three variants showing a significant (up to 2.3-fold) enhancement of activity towards flurbiprofenol, when compared to wild-type HvADH2. Interestingly, F108G variant did not show the classic inhibition in the presence of (R)-enantiomer when tested with rac-1-phenylethanol, underling its potential in racemic resolution of secondary alcohols."
https://openalex.org/W2774554202,"Intramyocellular triacylglycerol (IMTG) is utilized as metabolic fuel during exercise and is linked to insulin resistance, but the long-term effect of weight loss strategies on IMTG among participants with abdominal fat, remain unclear.In an 18-month trial, sedentary participants with abdominal fat/dyslipidemia were randomized to either a low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet (including 28g·day-1 of walnuts). After 6-months, the participants were re-randomized to moderate intense physical activity (PA+) or non-physical activity (PA-). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to quantify changes of IMTG, abdominal sub-depots, hepatic and intermuscular fats.Across the 277 participants [86% men, age = 48 years, body-mass-index (BMI) = 31kg/m2, visceral fat = 33%] 86% completed the 18-m trial. At baseline, women had higher IMTG than men (3.4% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001) and increased IMTG was associated with aging and higher BMI, visceral and intermuscular fats, HbA1c%, HDL-c and leptin(p<0.05), but not with intra-hepatic fat. After 18 month of intervention and a -3 kg mean weight loss, participants significantly increased IMTG by 25%, with a distinct effect in the MED/LCPA+ group as compared to the other intervention groups (57% vs. 9.5-18.5%, p<0.05). Changes in IMTG were associated with visceral and intermuscular fat, metabolic syndrome, insulin and leptin (p<0.05 for all), however, these associations did not remain after adjustment for visceral fat changes.Lifestyle strategies differentially affect IMTG accumulation; combination of exercise with decreased carbohydrate/increased unsaturated fat proportion intake greatly increase IMTG. Our findings suggest that increased IMTG during diet-induced moderate weight loss may not be directly related to cardiometabolic risk.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01530724."
https://openalex.org/W2775058001,"Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is one of the most common tumors of the urinary tract. Despite the current multimodal therapy, recurrence and progression of disease have been challenging problems. We hereby introduced a new approach, ultrasound-assisted intravesical chemotherapy, intravesical instillation of chemotherapeutic agents and microbubbles followed by ultrasound exposure. We investigated the feasibility of the treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In order to evaluate intracellular delivery and cytotoxic effect as a function to the thickness, we performed all experiments using a bladder cancer mimicking 3D culture model. Ultrasound-triggered microbubble cavitation increased both the intracellular platinum concentration and the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin at the thickness of 70 and 122 μm of the culture model. The duration of enhanced cytotoxic effect of cisplatin by ultrasound-triggered microbubble cavitation was approximately 1 hr. Based on the distance and duration of delivery, we further tested the feasibility of repetition of the treatment. Triple treatment increased the effective distance by 1.6-fold. Our results clearly showed spatial and temporal profile of delivery by ultrasound-triggered microbubble cavitation in a tumor-mimicking structure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the increase in intracellular concentration results in the enhancement of the cytotoxic effect in a structure with the certain thickness. Repetition of ultrasound exposure would be treatment of choice in future clinical application. Our results suggest ultrasound-triggered microbubble cavitation can be repeatable and is promising for the local control of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2774728647,"Porphyromonas gingivalis, an asaccharolytic Gram-negative oral anaerobe, is a major pathogen associated with adult periodontitis, a chronic infective disease that a significant percentage of the human population suffers from. It preferentially utilizes dipeptides as its carbon source, suggesting the importance of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) types of enzyme for its growth. Until now DPP IV, DPP5, 7 and 11 have been extensively investigated. Here, we report the characterization of DPP III using molecular biology, biochemical, biophysical and computational chemistry methods. In addition to the expected evolutionarily conserved regions of all DPP III family members, PgDPP III possesses a C-terminal extension containing an Armadillo (ARM) type fold similar to the AlkD family of bacterial DNA glycosylases, implicating it in alkylation repair functions. However, complementation assays in a DNA repair-deficient Escherichia coli strain indicated the absence of alkylation repair function for PgDPP III. Biochemical analyses of recombinant PgDPP III revealed activity similar to that of DPP III from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and in the range between activities of human and yeast counterparts. However, the catalytic efficiency of the separately expressed DPP III domain is ~1000-fold weaker. The structure and dynamics of the ligand-free enzyme and its complex with two different diarginyl arylamide substrates was investigated using small angle X-ray scattering, homology modeling, MD simulations and hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX). The correlation between the experimental HDX and MD data improved with simulation time, suggesting that the DPP III domain adopts a semi-closed or closed form in solution, similar to that reported for human DPP III. The obtained results reveal an atypical DPP III with increased structural complexity: its superhelical C-terminal domain contributes to peptidase activity and influences DPP III interdomain dynamics. Overall, this research reveals multifunctionality of PgDPP III and opens direction for future research of DPP III family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2774432378,"Intermanual transfer, the transfer of motor skills from the trained hand to the untrained hand, can be used to train upper limb prosthesis skills. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between the magnitude of the intermanual transfer effect and the type of training task. The used tasks were based on different aspects of prosthetic handling: reaching, grasping, grip-force production and functional tasks. A single-blinded clinical trial, with a pre-posttest design was executed. Seventy-one able-bodied, right-handed participants were randomly assigned to four training and two control groups. The training groups performed a training program with an upper-limb prosthesis simulator. One control group performed a sham training (a dummy training without the prosthesis simulator) and another control group received no training at all. The training groups and sham group trained on five consecutive days. To determine the improvement in skills, a test was administered before, immediately after, and one week after the training. Training was performed with the 'unaffected' arm; tests were performed with the 'affected' arm, with the latter resembling the amputated limb. In this study half of the participants trained with the dominant hand, while the other half trained with the non-dominant hand. Participants executed four tests that corresponded to the different training tasks. The tests measured the reaching (movement time and symmetry ratio), grasping (opening time, duration of maximum hand opening, and closing time), grip-force production (deviation of asked grip-force) and functional (movement time) performance. Half of the participants were tested with their dominant arm and half of the participants with their non-dominant arm. Intermanual transfer effects were not found for reaching, grasping or functional tasks. However, we did find intermanual transfer effects for grip-force production tasks. Possibly, the study design contributed to the negative results due to the duration of the training sessions and test sessions. The positive results of the grip-force production might be an effect of the specificity of the training, that was totally focused on training grip-force production. When using intermanual transfer training in novice amputees, specific training should be devoted to grip-force."
https://openalex.org/W2774604023,"Although dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy shows little toxicity, improvements should be necessary to obtain satisfactory clinical outcome. Using interferon-gamma injection along with DCs, we previously obtained significant clinical responses against small or early stage malignant tumors in dogs. However, improvement was necessary to be effective to largely developed or metastatic tumors. To obtain effective methods applicable to those tumors, we herein used a DC-targeting Toll-like receptor ligand, h11c, and examined the therapeutic effects in murine subcutaneous and visceral tumor models and also in the clinical treatment of canine cancers. In murine experiments, most and significant inhibition of tumor growth and extended survival was observed in the group treated with the combination of h11c-activated DCs in combination with interferon-gamma and a cyclooxygenase2 inhibitor. Both monocytic and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells were significantly reduced by the combined treatment. Following the successful results in mice, the combined treatment was examined against canine cancers, which spontaneously generated like as those in human. The combined treatment elicited significant clinical responses against a nonepithelial malignant tumor and a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The treatment was also successful against a bone-metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. In the successful cases, the marked increase of tumor-responding T cells and decrease of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells was observed in their peripheral blood. Although the combined treatment permitted the growth of lung cancer of renal carcinoma-metastasis, the marked elevated and long-term maintaining of the tumor-responding T cells was observed in the patient dog. Overall, the combined treatment gave rise to emphatic amelioration in DC-based cancer therapy."

Following regional vaccination campaigns for serogroup A and subsequent increases in protection against this serogroup, non-A serogroups such as C and W now pose significant epidemic threats, particularly in young children.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of broadening coverage from conjugate serogroup A to quadrivalent ACWY vaccination.We developed a 40-year Markov state transition model with annual cycles to simulate costs and clinical outcomes in children aged 1 to 10 in the 26 countries of the African meningitis belt. The incidence of CWY meningitis cases among an unvaccinated population was held constant at inter-epidemic rates of 50 per 100,000/year and 150 per 100,000/year. The country-specific cost and probability of access to meningitis care, vaccine efficacy, the mortality risk among treated and untreated meningitis cases, the risk of clinical sequelae and their respective disability weights were based on published sources. Vaccination cost was based on international prices lists, presented in 2014 US$.At an incidence rate of 50 per 100,000/year, routine conjugate vaccination is highly cost-effective in 14 out of 26 countries with a cost/DALY averted ranging from US$555-US$787. At the higher incidence rate of 150 per 100,000/year, quadrivalent vaccination is cost-effective in all 26 countries with a cost/DALY averted ranging from US$105-US$250. The annual incidence rate at which routine conjugate quadrivalent vaccination is expected to be economically justifiable ranges from 13 per 100,000/year in Nigeria to 142 per 100,000/year in Burundi.Routine quadrivalent conjugate vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis is cost-effective at incidence rates well below the epidemic threshold among children living in the African meningitis belt."
https://openalex.org/W2775725481,"We study how the approach grounded on non-extensive statistical physics can be applied to describe and distinguish different stages of the stock and money market development. A particular attention is given to asymmetric behavior of fat tailed distributions of positive and negative returns. A new method to measure this asymmetry is proposed. It is based on the value of the non-extensive Tsallis parameter q. The new quantifier of the relative asymmetry level between tails in terms of the Tsallis parameters q± is provided to analyze the effect of memory in data caused by nonlinear autocorrelations. The presented analysis takes into account data of separate stocks from the main developing stock market in Europe, i.e., the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) in Poland and-for comparison-data from the most mature money market (Forex). It is argued that the proposed new quantifier is able to describe the stage of market development and its robustness to speculation. The main strength is put on a description and interpretation of the asymmetry between statistical properties of positive and negative returns for various stocks and for diversified time-lags Δt of data counting. The particular caution in this context is addressed to the difference between intraday and interday returns. Our search is extended to study memory effects and their dependence on the quotation frequency for similar large companies-owners of food-industrial retail supermarkets acting on both Polish and European markets (Eurocash, Jeronimo-Martins, Carrefour, Tesco)-but traded on various European stock markets of diversified economical maturity (respectively in Warsaw, Lisbon, Paris and London). The latter analysis seems to indicate quantitatively that stocks from the same economic sector traded on different markets within European Union (EU) may be a target of diversified level of speculations involved in trading independently on the true economic situation of the company. Our work thus gives indications that the statement:"" where you are is more important than who you are"" is true on trading markets."
https://openalex.org/W2772263643,"Chlamydia pecorum is a globally recognised livestock pathogen due to the significant clinical and economic impact it poses to livestock producers. Routine serological diagnosis is through a complement fixation test (CFT), which is often criticised for cross-reactivity, poor sensitivity and specificity. Although serology remains the preferred method in veterinary diagnostic laboratories, serological assays based on surface antigens of C. pecorum have not been established until now. In this study, we evaluated the use of two chlamydial recombinant protein antigens (PmpG and MOMP-G) by a direct IgG ELISA method for detection of ovine anti-chlamydial antibodies. Using the Pepscan method we then identified B cell epitopes across PmpG and MOMP-G proteins, in lambs with (a) naturally occurring asymptomatic C. pecorum infections (b) C. pecorum-associated polyarthritis and (c) recombinant PmpG and MOMP-G vaccine. Plasma IgG antibodies to PmpG in natural infection of lambs were detected earlier in infection than CFT and served as an acute phase marker. Antibodies to MOMP-G IgG were significantly heightened in lambs with C. pecorum-associated polyarthritis. PmpG and MOMP-G specific B-cell epitope mapping revealed epitope responses in immunised lambs cluster with some of the epitope responses in naturally infected lambs. B-cell epitope mapping further revealed that lambs with polyarthritis recognised several unique PmpG (50% frequency, peptide 8, 25, 40, 41 and 50) and MOMP (50% frequency, peptide 50) epitopes in comparison to asymptomatic infections. The findings of this study will have implications towards improved serodiagnosis of C. pecorum infections in livestock and inform the downstream development of alternative peptide-based antigens for future C. pecorum vaccine studies."
https://openalex.org/W2773009770,"To determine whether the delivery method is associated with the rate of anemia in later life, using the data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).This study used data from the KNHANES 2010-2012. Among 25,534 participants, 8,126 cases were included in this study after exclusion of males and other inappropriate data. The study population was divided into three groups according to the delivery modes: vaginal delivery (VD) only group, single cesarean delivery (SCD) group and repetitive cesarean delivery (RCD) group. The primary outcome was anemia and iron deficiency. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <12 g/dl in accordance with the World Health Organization criteria. Iron deficiency was defined as low transferrin saturation (TSAT) or ferritin levels. Multivariate analysis was used for determination of association between the delivery modes and anemia.The mean age was 53.4 years and the median time from the last delivery to the survey was 25 years. The VD only group was composed of 6,493 (79.9%) women, while 685 (8.4%) were classified as the SCD group and 948 (11.7%) were classified as a RCD group. The rates of anemia were 11.8%, 13.9%, and 19.7% in VD only group, SCD group, and RCD group, respectively. However, those groups were significantly different in many confounding factors. Therefore, to adjust those factors, multivariate analysis and subgroup analysis were followed. The odds of SCD for anemia and iron deficiency were not different from those of VD only. However, RCD was independently associated with anemia [Odds ratio(OR) 1.47, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.79, P <0.001] and iron deficiency (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.21-1.67, P <0.001) compared to VD only. In the subgroup analysis, RCD was significantly associated with anemia in perimenopausal women, women with iron deficiency, those without any comorbidity and those without anemia-prone treatment.Repetitive cesarean section may be a risk factor for future development of anemia in later life, especially in perimenopausal period. Therefore, evaluation and management of anemia in longer postpartum period should be considered for women who experience repetitive cesarean section."

The model compared three vaccination scenarios against screening only (no-vaccination) for three doses of HPV4 vaccine among individuals aged 11-15 years in Puerto Rico: 1) 34% for females and 13% for males (34%F/13%M), 2) 50% for females and 40% for males (50%F/40%M), and 3) 80% for female and 64% for male (80%F/64%M). Data specific to Puerto Rico was used. When not available, values from the United States were used. Input data consisted of demographic, behavioral, epidemiological, screening, and economic parameters.The model predicted decreases in: 1) HPV infection prevalence for females and males, 2) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer incidence for females, 3) genital warts incidence for females and males, and 4) cervical cancer deaths among females, when various vaccination program scenarios were considered. In addition, when the vaccination percentage was increased in every scenario, the reduction was greater and began earlier. The analysis also evidenced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1,964 per quality-adjusted life year gained for the 80%F/64%M uptake scenario.HPV vaccine can prove its cost effectiveness and substantially reduce the burden and costs associated to various HPV-related conditions when targeted to the adequate population together with an organized HPV vaccination program."
https://openalex.org/W2772128902,"Targeted therapy is currently the standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but an effective treatment after the discontinuation of sorafenib therapy remains uncertain. We aim to investigate the survival benefits of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after stopping sorafenib therapy. We retrospectively analyzed all patients with advanced HCC, who had received palliative TACE after terminating sorafenib therapy, from January 2008 to June 2016. Patients who were in the terminal stage (Child-Pugh class C or performance status 3-4), who received a liver transplantation, or who had received any HCC treatment other than TACE, were excluded. Finally, 28 patients were recruited as the TACE group, and were randomly matched 1:1 by age, gender, Child-Pugh class, extrahepatic metastasis, and portal vein thrombosis with 28 controls who only received supportive care. For avoiding any immortal time bias, the index date of outcome follow-up was also matched. Cumulative incidences of, and hazard ratios (HRs) for, patient mortality were analyzed. The baseline demographic data between the TACE group and the control group were similar, but the 1-year overall survival rate in the TACE group was significantly higher than that of the control group (41.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.4-63.0% vs. 24.5%, 95% CI: 6.3-42.7%; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for alpha-fetoprotein > 400ng/mL, Child-Pugh class B, and tumor extension > 50% of liver volume, TACE was independently associated with a decreased mortality risk(HR 0.19, 95% CI: 0.08-0.42). In addition, tumor extension > 50% of the liver was another independent prognostic factor associated with an increased mortality risk (HR 2.99, 95% CI: 1.31-6.82). Multivariate stratified analyses verified the association of TACE with a decreased mortality rate in each patient subgroup (all HR < 1.0). By controlling intrahepatic tumor growth, TACE may be a treatment option for use in improving patient survival in advanced HCC, after the termination of sorafenib therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2773739638,"The choice of an optimal feature detector-descriptor combination for image matching often depends on the application and the image type. In this paper, we propose the Log-Polar Magnitude feature descriptor-a rotation, scale, and illumination invariant descriptor that achieves comparable performance to SIFT on a large variety of image registration problems but with much shorter feature vectors. The descriptor is based on the Log-Polar Transform followed by a Fourier Transform and selection of the magnitude spectrum components. Selecting different frequency components allows optimizing for image patterns specific for a particular application. In addition, by relying only on coordinates of the found features and (optionally) feature sizes our descriptor is completely detector independent. We propose 48- or 56-long feature vectors that potentially can be shortened even further depending on the application. Shorter feature vectors result in better memory usage and faster matching. This combined with the fact that the descriptor does not require a time-consuming feature orientation estimation (the rotation invariance is achieved solely by using the magnitude spectrum of the Log-Polar Transform) makes it particularly attractive to applications with limited hardware capacity. Evaluation is performed on the standard Oxford dataset and two different microscopy datasets; one with fluorescence and one with transmission electron microscopy images. Our method performs better than SURF and comparable to SIFT on the Oxford dataset, and better than SIFT on both microscopy datasets indicating that it is particularly useful in applications with microscopy images."
https://openalex.org/W2773939690,"A region-specific method, NTR (non-threshold rare) variant detection method, was developed—it does not use the threshold for defining rare variants and accounts for directions of effects. NTR also considers linkage disequilibrium within the region and accommodates common and rare variants simultaneously. NTR weighs variants according to minor allele frequency and odds ratio to combine the effects of common and rare variants on disease occurrence into a single score and provides a test statistic to assess the significance of the score. In the simulations, under different effect sizes, the power of NTR increased as the effect size increased, and the type I error of our method was controlled well. Moreover, NTR was compared with several other existing methods, including the combined multivariate and collapsing method (CMC), weighted sum statistic method (WSS), sequence kernel association test (SKAT), and its modification, SKAT-O. NTR yields comparable or better power in simulations, especially when the effects of linkage disequilibrium between variants were at least moderate. In an analysis of diabetic nephropathy data, NTR detected more confirmed disease-related genes than the other aforementioned methods. NTR can thus be used as a complementary tool to help in dissecting the etiology of complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2773085116,"For urban rail transit network, the space-time flow distribution can play an important role in evaluating and optimizing the space-time resource allocation. For obtaining the space-time flow distribution without the restriction of schedules, a dynamic assignment problem is proposed based on the concept of continuous transmission. To solve the dynamic assignment problem, the cell transmission model is built for urban rail transit networks. The priority principle, queuing process, capacity constraints and congestion effects are considered in the cell transmission mechanism. Then an efficient method is designed to solve the shortest path for an urban rail network, which decreases the computing cost for solving the cell transmission model. The instantaneous dynamic user optimal state can be reached with the method of successive average. Many evaluation indexes of passenger flow can be generated, to provide effective support for the optimization of train schedules and the capacity evaluation for urban rail transit network. Finally, the model and its potential application are demonstrated via two numerical experiments using a small-scale network and the Beijing Metro network."
https://openalex.org/W2775615550,"Introduction A broad range of self-tests (testing for e.g. HIV, cancer, hepatitis B/C) have become available and can be conducted by lay consumers without the help of a health professional. The aims of this study were to (a) investigate the prevalence of self-testing, (b) identify the most frequently used self-tests, and (c) explore the associations between socio-demographic, health-related and individual factors with self-testing. Methods A face-to-face plus paper-pencil cross-sectional survey was conducted. The sample consisted of 2.527 respondents who were representative of the German population in terms of the age, sex, and residence. Basic descriptive statistics and univariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results 8.5% of the participants reported having used one or more self-tests in the past, totalling 363 self-tests, with a mean of 1.7 (min. = 1, max. = 6). The three self-tests most frequently indicated were for detecting diabetes, bowel cancer, and allergies. Self-testers were older (Nagelkerke R2 = .006, p < .01), had a higher BMI (Nagelkerke R2 = .013, p < .001) and displayed more physical and mental fatigue (Nagelkerke R2 = .031, p < .001) than non-testers. Self-testers also reported higher global life satisfaction values (Nagelkerke R2 = .008, p < .01) and a higher educational level (Nagelkerke R2 = .015, p < .01). Conclusions Self-testing is fairly prevalent in Germany Given the current shortage of physicians in Germany, especially in rural areas, and recent studies on the use of self-medication, the topic of self-testing has a great practical and socio-political relevance. Future studies should investigate further predictors of self-testing (e.g. contextual, situational and individual factors) as well as the emotional consequences of testing as a layperson without the attendance of a health professional."
https://openalex.org/W2773643179,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging disease caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV). Although fever and thrombocytopenia are the typical manifestations of SFTS, a specific SFTS case with no fever was observed in Zhejiang, China. In this report, we aimed to explore the probable reason for the absence of fever by analyzing the genetic characteristics and temperature sensitivity (ts) of the SFTSV strain ZJ2013-06, which was isolated from the specific case. Phylogenetically, different clusters of SFTSV strains circulated in Zhejiang. ZJ2013-06 was farthest from ZJ2014-02, an isolate belonging to a Chinese dominant cluster, and nearest to the coastal strain NB24/CHN/2013. Ts tests, performed on Vero cells at 37°C and 39°C, indicated that ZJ2013-06 had restricted replication at 39°C. Its viral loads were substantially reduced at 39°C compared with that at 37°C (approximately 100-fold reduction) and were significantly lower than that of ZJ2014-02 at 39°C (P < 0.01). By adaptive culture at 39°C, the induced strain ZJ2013-06-P7 was obtained. Owing to a reverse mutation (S1616), ZJ2013-06-P7 lost the ts of the original strain, displaying similar replication processes with NB24/CHN/2013. The results indicated that the amino acid residue 1616 was related to the ts characteristics of ZJ2013-06. Our study revealed that ZJ2013-06 was temperature-sensitive and may be related to the absence of fever in our case."
https://openalex.org/W2774666738,"Background Efavirenz (EFV), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), has been widely used in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Some of its toxic effects on hepatic cells have been reported to display features of mitochondrial dysfunction through bioenergetic stress and autophagy, etc. However, alteration of protein levels, especially mitochondrial protein levels, in hepatic cells during treatment of EFV has not been fully investigated. Methods We built a cell model of EFV-induced liver toxicity through treating Huh-7 cells with different concentrations of EFV for different time followed by the analysis of cell viability using cell counting kit -8 (CCK8) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and MitoSox dye. Proteomic profiles in the mitochondria of Huh-7 cells stimulated by EFV were analyzed. Four differentially expressed proteins were quantified by real time RT-PCR. We also detected the expression of mitochondrial precursor Cob(I)yrinic acid a,c-diamide adenosyltransferase (MMAB) by immunohistochemistry analysis in clinical samples. The expression levels of MMAB and ROS were detected in EFV-treated Huh-7 cells with and without shRNA used to knock down MMAB, and in primary hepatocytes (PHC). The effects of other anti-HIV drugs (nevirapine (NVP) and tenofovirdisoproxil (TDF)), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were also tested. Amino acid analysis and fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH3A2) expression after MMAB expression knock-down with shRNA was used to investigate the metabolic effect of MMAB in Huh-7 cells. Results EFV treatment inhibited cell viability and increased ROS production with time- and concentration-dependence. Proteomic study was performed at 2 hours after EFV treatment. After treated Huh-7 cells with EFV (2.5mg/L or 10 mg/L) for 2 h, fifteen differentially expressed protein spots from purified mitochondrion that included four mitochondria proteins were detected in EFV-treated Huh-7 cells compared to controls. Consistent with protein expression levels, mRNA expression levels of mitochondrial protein MMAB were also increased by EFV treatment. In addition, the liver of EFV-treated HIV infected patients showed substantially higher levels of MMAB expression compared to the livers of untreated or protease inhibitor (PI)-treated HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, ROS were found to be decreased in Huh-7 cells treated with shMMAB compared with empty plasmid treated with EFV at the concentration of 2.5 or 10 mg/L. MMAB was increased in EFV-treated Huh-7 cells and primary hepatocytes. However, no change in MMAB expression was detected after treatment of Huh-7 cells and primary hepatocytes with anti-HIV drugs nevirapine (NVP) and tenofovirdisoproxil (TDF), or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), although ROS was increased in these cells. Finally, knockdown of MMAB by shRNA induced increases in the β-Alanine (β-Ala) production levels and decrease in ALDH3A2 expression. Conclusions A mitochondrial proteomic study was performed to study the proteins related to EFV-inducted liver toxicity. MMAB might be a target and potential biomarker of hepatotoxicity in EFV-induced liver toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2775338662,"The effectiveness of Special Master's Programs (SMPs) in benefiting a potential medical student's career beyond admission into an MD-program is largely unknown. This study aims to evaluate the role of SMPs, if any, in affecting the performance and outcomes of students during their medical school career. This study analyzed anonymous surveys of students and residents from the University of Toledo. The data analysis is used to evaluate a student's academic performance before, during and after medical school. Measured metrics included: MCAT Scores, undergraduate GPA, USMLE STEP 1 scores, participation in research, number of research publications, and residency placement. Of 500 people surveyed 164 medical students or residents responded. Based on their responses, the respondents were divided into traditional (non-SMP) and SMP groups. As anticipated, MCAT scores (SMP: 29.82 vs. traditional 31.10) are significantly (p<0.05) different between the two groups. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in USMLE STEP 1 scores (SMP: 232.7 vs. traditional: 233.8) and when normalized relative to MCAT scores, USMLE STEP 1 scores for SMP-students are significantly (p<0.05) higher than their traditional counterparts (p<0.05). Additionally, SMP-students did not outperform the traditional students with regards to research publications. But, they did demonstrate a significant (p<0.05) proclivity towards surgical residencies when compared to the traditional students. Overall, our results highlight that SMPs potentiate USMLE STEP 1 performance and competitive residency-placements for its students."
