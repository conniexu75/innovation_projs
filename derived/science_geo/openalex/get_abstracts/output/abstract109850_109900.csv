https://openalex.org/W2021632088,"Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), a member of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) family of transcription factors, is synthesized as a 125 kd precursor that is attached to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. In sterol-depleted cells, the membrane-bound precursor is cleaved to generate a soluble NH2-terminal fragment (apparent molecular mass, 68 kd) that translocates to the nucleus. This fragment, which includes the bHLH-ZIP domain, activates transcription of the genes for the LDL receptor and HMG CoA synthase. Sterols inhibit the cleavage of SREBP-1, and the 68 kd nuclear form is rapidly catabolized, thereby reducing transcription. ALLN, an inhibitor of neutral cysteine proteases, blocks the breakdown of the 68 kd form and superinduces sterol-regulated genes. Sterol-regulated proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor provides a novel mechanism by which transcription can be regulated by membrane lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2085668133,"Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) is a key signaling enzyme implicated in receptor-stimulated mitogenesis, oxidative bursting in neutrophils, membrane ruffling, and glucose uptake. A PI3K has already been purified, cloned, and shown to be regulated by receptors that act via tyrosine kinase-dependent regulatory mechanisms. We report that an immunologically, pharmacologically, and chromatographically distinct form of PI3K activity present in neutrophils and U937 cells is specifically activated by G protein beta gamma subunits. This data suggests PI3Ks conform to the paradigm set by receptor regulation of phosphoinositidase Cs: different receptor transduction systems specifically regulate dedicated isoforms of effector protein."
https://openalex.org/W1605838085,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a multisubunit, single-stranded DNA-binding protein that is absolutely required for replication of SV40 DNA. The three cDNAs encoding the subunits of human replication protein A (70, 32, and 14 kDa) have been expressed individually and in combination in Escherichia coli. When subunits were expressed individually, appropriately sized polypeptides were synthesized, but were found to be either insoluble or aggregated with other proteins. We examined the interactions between individual RPA subunits by expressing pairs of subunits and determining if they formed stable complexes. Only the 32- and 14-kDa subunits formed a soluble complex when coexpressed. This complex was purified and characterized. The 32-14 kDa subcomplex did not have any effect on DNA replication and was not phosphorylated efficiently in vitro. We believe that the 32.14-kDa subcomplex may be a precursor in the assembly of the complete RPA complex. Coexpression of all three subunits of RPA resulted in a significant portion of each polypeptide forming a soluble complex. We have purified recombinant RPA complex from E. coli and demonstrated that it has properties similar to those of human RPA. Recombinant human RPA has the same subunit composition and the same activities as the authentic complex from human cells. Recombinant human RPA binds single-stranded DNA and is capable of supporting SV40 DNA replication in vitro. In addition, recombinant RPA became phosphorylated when incubated under replication conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2004689349,"The structure of an Oct-1 POU domain-octamer DNA complex has been solved at 3.0 A resolution. The POU-specific domain contacts the 5' half of this site (ATGCAAAT), and as predicted from nuclear magnetic resonance studies, the structure, docking, and contacts are remarkably similar to those of the lambda and 434 repressors. The POU homeodomain contacts the 3' half of this site (ATGCAAAT), and the docking is similar to that of the engrailed, MAT alpha 2, and Antennapedia homeodomains. The linker region is not visible and there are no protein-protein contacts between the domains, but overlapping phosphate contacts near the center of the octamer site may favor cooperative binding. This novel arrangement raises important questions about cooperativity in protein-DNA recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2024880451,"We have previously used single-cell assays in a phytochrome-deficient tomato mutant to demonstrate that phytochrome signaling involves heterotrimeric G proteins, calcium, and calmodulin. While G protein activation could stimulate full chloroplast development and anthocyanin pigment biosynthesis, calcium and calmodulin could not induce anthocyanins and were only able to stimulate the development of immature chloroplasts lacking cytochrome b6f and photosystem I core components. We now report that cyclic GMP is able to trigger the production of anthocyanins, and that a combination of cyclic GMP with calcium can induce the development of fully mature chloroplasts containing all the photosynthetic machinery. Furthermore, using reporter genes for these different pathways (cab-gus, chs-gus, and fnr-gus) we demonstrate that cGMP and calcium act primarily by modulating gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1999730046,"The KH domain is an evolutionarily conserved sequence motif present in many RNA-binding proteins, including the pre-mRNA-binding (hnRNP) K protein and the fragile X mental retardation gene product (FMR1). We assessed the role of KH domains in RNA binding by mutagenesis of KH domains in hnRNP K and FMR1. Conserved residues of all three hnRNP K KH domains are required for its wild-type RNA binding. Interestingly, while fragile X syndrome is usually caused by lack of FMR1 expression, a previously reported mutation in a highly conserved residue of one of its two KH domains (Ile-304-->Asn) also results in mental retardation. We found that the binding of this mutant protein to RNA is severely impaired. These results demonstrate an essential role for KH domains in RNA binding. Furthermore, they strengthen the connection between fragile X syndrome and loss of the RNA binding activity of FMR1."
https://openalex.org/W1486424890,"A phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) kinase was isolated and purified to near homogeneity from bovine erythrocyte membranes. The PIP kinase was extracted from bovine erythrocyte membranes with a high salt wash, followed by phosphocellulose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. The predominant protein after phenyl-Sepharose purification had a molecular size of 68 kDa. Renaturation of PIP kinase activity after SDS-PAGE showed that a 68-kDa protein was able to phosphorylate PIP. An antibody developed against the 68-kDa protein Western blots the 68-kDa protein and is able to immunoprecipitate the 68-kDa protein and PIP kinase activity from membrane extracts. Based on functional studies, the 68-kDa protein is indistinguishable from the type I PIP kinase previously characterized from human erythrocyte membranes (Bazenet, C. E., Ruano, A.R., Brockman, J.L., and Anderson, R.A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18012-18022). These studies also show that the type I PIP kinases, but not the type II PIP kinase, are stimulated by phosphatidic acid, suggesting alternative roles for these enzymes. Two immunoreactive isoforms of the type I PIP kinase, of 68 and 90 kDa, were identified in rat brain and partially purified. Both of these isoforms are also stimulated by phosphatidic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1581180757,"Abstract We have found that the small stress protein, hsp27, exists in extracts of U251 MG human glioma cells in two forms: a large or aggregated form (L-hsp27, 300-400 kDa) and a small or dissociated form (S-hsp27, < 70 kDa), as indicated by centrifugation on sucrose density gradients. Dissociation of L-hsp27 to S-hsp27 was enhanced by incubation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate, interleukin-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or okadaic acid, all of which are known to enhance or mimic the effects of phosphorylation of hsp27 without stimulation of its synthesis. Exposure of cells to chemical stressors, namely, NaAsO2 and CdCl2, also enhanced the dissociation of L-hsp27. hsp27 that had been labeled with [32P]H3PO4 in U251 MG cells was detected mostly in fractions that contained S-hsp27, and the incorporation of radioactivity to S-hsp27 was enhanced under conditions that stimulated the dissociation of L-hsp27. L-hsp27 present in the (NH4)2SO4 fraction (0-50% saturation) of cell extracts were dissociated to 32P-labeled hsp27 when incubated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and Mg2+. These results indicate that the molecular configuration of hsp27 in cells is determined in part by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of this protein by protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) and, moreover, that the rapid dissociation of the aggregated form of hsp27 by phosphorylation might be involved in a cellular defense mechanism for protection against stress."
https://openalex.org/W1978324852,"The mouse Xist gene is expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome and may control the initiation of X inactivation. We show that in somatic tissues the 5â€² end of the silent Xist allele on the active X chromosome is fully methylated, while the expressed allele on the inactive X is completely unmethylated. In tissues that undergo imprinted paternal Xist expression and imprinted X inactivation, the paternal Xist allele is unmethylated, and the silent maternal allele is fully methylated. In the male germline, a developmentally regulated demethylation of Xist occurs at the onset of meiosis and is retained in mature spermatozoa. This may be the cause of imprinted expression of the paternal Xist allele. A role for methylation in the control of Xist expression is further supported by the finding that in differentiating embryonic stem cells during the initiation of X inactivation, differential methylation of Xist alleles precedes the onset of Xist expression."
https://openalex.org/W1531666134,"A peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of A beta 17-42 (LVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA) was isolated from Alzheimer Disease patient brains containing large deposits of diffuse-type amyloid. Brain homogenates were lysed in SDS and submitted to high speed centrifugations. A beta peptides were purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 12 and TSK 3000 SW columns. An A beta peptide with M(r) of 3,000 was recovered that on automatic gas-phase Edman degradation yielded the amino acid sequence of A beta starting at residue 17 (Leu). The 3-kDa peptide was subsequently hydrolyzed with trypsin and reacted with CNBr, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by amino acid analyses, peptide microsequencing, and mass spectrometry. Hydrolysis of beta-amyloid precursor protein 695 at Lys612-Leu613 or at Lys16-Leu17 of its A beta 1-42 derivative prevents the generation of neurotoxic A beta filaments, thus leading to the formation of A beta 17-42 localized in the diffuse amyloid deposits. An outstanding feature in the pathology of Alzheimer Disease is that the predominant A beta peptides have their C termini at position 42, whether in the cores of the neuritic plaques, in the vascular walls, or in the diffuse deposits. Based on these observations, we postulate that the accumulation of insoluble A beta N-42 in Alzheimer Disease is due to the anomalous processing of the C-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1589342505,"A soluble polyphosphatase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, purified to apparent homogeneity, is monomeric with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. It acts as an exoenzyme in a processive mode releasing orthophosphate residues from long polyphosphate chains until pyrophosphate is reached. Polyphosphates of all the lengths examined are used as substrates with a preference for those of about 250 residues. These are degraded with a kcat/Km near the limit for diffusion-controlled reactions. At 37 degrees C, the enzyme releases about 500 phosphate residues/s. It does not act on pyrophosphate, ATP, or the cyclic form of tripolyphosphate. For optimal activity the enzyme requires magnesium, manganese, or cobalt."
https://openalex.org/W1737157464,"An increase in cytosolic ATP following glucose metabolism by pancreatic beta-cells is the key signal initiating insulin secretion by causing blockade of ATP-dependent K+ channels (KATP). This induces membrane depolarization, leading to an elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and insulin secretion. In this report we identify the critical metabolic step by which glucose initiates changes in beta-cell KATP channel activity, membrane potential, and [Ca2+]i. The signal stems from the glycolytic production of NADH during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is subsequently processed into ATP by mitochondria via the operation of discrete shuttle systems."
https://openalex.org/W1505415396,"Rab3 proteins are small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily. Four highly homologous Rab3 proteins termed Rab3A, Rab3B, Rab3C, and Rab3D have been described. Rab3A has previously been shown to be a constituent of synaptic vesicles in neurons that undergoes membrane dissociation-association cycles during synaptic vesicle recycling. Here we report that Rab3C copurifies with Rab3A during the isolation of synaptic vesicles. Organelles immunoisolated with monoclonal antibodies directed against Rab3A led to a coenrichment of Rab3A and Rab3C, demonstrating that both Rab3 proteins are colocalized on the same organelle. In isolated nerve terminals, stimulation of neurotransmitter release resulted in a dissociation of Rab3C from synaptic vesicle and/or recycling membranes. This dissociation parallels that of Rab3A observed under the same conditions. In contrast, no change was observed in the membrane-association of Rab5, a Rab protein localized on early endosomes. We conclude that in the nervous system Rab3C is localized on synaptic vesicles and, like Rab3A, cycles on and off the synaptic vesicle membrane in parallel with exocytotic release of neurotransmitter."
https://openalex.org/W1536459857,"Fasciculin, a 6750-Da peptide from the venom of Dendroaspis, is known to inhibit reversibly mammalian and fish acetylcholinesterases at picomolar concentrations, but is a relatively weak inhibitor of avian, reptile, and insect acetylcholinesterases and mammalian butyryl-cholinesterases. An examination of fasciculin association with several mutant forms of recombinant DNA-derived acetylcholinesterase from mouse shows that it interacts with a cluster of residues near the rim of the gorge on the enzyme. The aromatic residues, Trp286, Tyr72, and Tyr124, have the most marked influence on fasciculin binding, whereas Asp74, a charged residue in the vicinity of the binding site that affects the binding of low molecular weight inhibitors, has little influence on fasciculin binding. The 3 aromatic residues are unique to the susceptible acetylcholinesterases and, along with Asp74, constitute part of the peripheral anionic site. Fasciculin falls in the family of three-loop toxins that include the receptor blocking alpha-toxins and cardiotoxins. From this basic structural motif, a binding site has evolved on fasciculin to be highly specific for the peripheral site on acetylcholinesterase. Acetylthiocholine affects rates of fasciculin binding at concentrations causing substrate inhibition. In the case of the mutant cholinesterases where rates of fasciculin dissociation are more rapid, steady state kinetic parameters also show acetylthiocholine-fasciculin competition to be consistent with occupation at a peripheral or substrate inhibition site rather than the active center."
https://openalex.org/W1583055778,"Abstract Ran/TC4, referred to here as Ran1, is a 25-kilodalton nuclear GTP-binding protein with an acidic C terminus that lacks any consensus prenylation sites. Here, we use a nitrocellulose overlay assay to identify potential effector proteins that bind specifically and with high affinity to the GTP-bound form of Ran1. GTP-Ran1 is shown to bind a variety of proteins, present in many eukaryotic tissues and cell extracts. A 28-kDa protein is cytosolic, whereas others, consisting of proteins of 86-300 kDa, are primarily localized in the nucleus. Binding is highly specific and is not detected by other small GTPases, such as c-Ha-Ras or Rab3A. Both deletion of the C-terminal-DEDDDL acidic sequence or alteration of the N terminus of Ran1 inhibits binding. However, these altered forms of Ran1 maintain the capacity to bind guanyl nucleotides and interact with the nucleotide exchange factor. The Ran1-binding proteins potently inhibit release of GTP from Ran1. These proteins can therefore maintain Ran1 in the on state and are potential down-stream effectors for Ran1-dependent cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1564828662,"Matrix vesicles (MV), microstructures which rapidly accumulate Ca2+ and induce mineral formation in vitro, are linked to type II and X collagens and proteoglycans in the hypertrophic cartilage. However, the roles of these matrix proteins on MV function are not known. This led us to investigate the influence of type II and X collagen binding on Ca2+ uptake by MV. MV isolated from chicken growth plate cartilage were treated with pure bacterial collagenase and 1 M NaCl in synthetic cartilage lymph to selectively and completely remove associated type II and X collagens. Uptake of 45Ca2+ by these collagen-depleted vesicles was markedly reduced. Further treatment with detergent, which disrupted the membrane, restored Ca2+ uptake, indicating that the vesicle membrane structure and the nucleational core inside the vesicle lumen were still intact after the collagenase and 1 M NaCl treatments. Readdition of either native type II or X collagen to the collagenase, 1 M NaCl-treated MV stimulated their Ca2+ uptake to levels similar to those of untreated vesicles. Pepsin-treated type II and X collagens were less effective in stimulating Ca2+ uptake, indicating that non-triple helical domains of these collagens were involved. The pepsin treatment of these collagens also decreased their binding to annexin V (anchorin CII), one of three annexins found in MV, suggesting that annexin V is involved in mediating the binding of type II and X collagens to the MV surface. Furthermore, treatment of collagenase, 1 M NaCl-treated MV with chymotrypsin, which damaged annexin V as well as many other MV proteins, prevented the stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by these collagens. Thus, the interaction between type II and X collagens with MV activates the influx of Ca2+ into MV and may play an important role in calcification of the vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2144660293,Lactococcus lactis takes up di- and tripeptides via a proton motive force-dependent carrier protein. The gene (dtpT) encoding the di-tripeptide transport protein of L. lactis was cloned by complementation of a dipeptide transport-deficient and proline auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain. Functional expression of the dipeptide transport gene was demonstrated by uptake studies of alanyl-[14C]glutamate and other peptides in E. coli cells. The di-tripeptide transport protein catalyzes proton motive force-driven peptide uptake and dipeptide exchange activity. The nucleotide sequence of dtpT was determined and the translated sequence corresponds with a protein of 463 amino acid residues. Hydropathy profiling indicates that the protein could form 12 membrane-spanning segments with the amino and carboxyl termini at the outer surface of the membrane. A secondary structure model is presented which is substantiated by analysis of DtpT-PhoA fusion constructs. Amino acid sequence comparisons showed no significant homology with other bacterial peptide transport systems nor with any other known protein. Flanking regions of the di-tripeptide transport gene were used to delete dtpT from the chromosome of L. lactis. Genetic and biochemical characterization of this mutant indicates that DtpT is the only transport protein in L. lactis for hydrophilic di- and tripeptides.
https://openalex.org/W1604517711,"We have previously reported the DNA and amino acid sequences for the three genes (ntpA, ntpB, and ntpK) encoding the A, B, and K (proteolipid) subunits, respectively, of Na(+)-translocating ATPase of a eubacterium Enterococcus hirae (Kakinuma, Y., Kakinuma, S., Takase, K., Konishi, K., Igarashi, K., and Yamato, I. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 195, 1063-1069). In this paper we report the entire nucleotide sequence of the ntp gene cluster coding for this multisubunit enzyme. The cluster contained eight other genes; the order of these 11 genes was ntpF, -I, -K, -E, -C, -G, -A, -B, -D, -H, and -J, encoding proteins with predicted molecular weights of 14,255, 75,619, 16,036, 22,699, 38,162, 11,409, 65,766, 51,139, 27,093, 7,164, and 48,869, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of these products suggested that NtpI and NtpJ are hydrophobic proteins and others are hydrophilic. The ntpI gene product, which possesses six membrane-spanning segments in its carboxyl-terminal half, resembled the 116-kDa subunit of vacuolar (V)-ATPase in clathrin-coated vesicles. In addition, the NtpE, NtpC, NtpG, and NtpD proteins resembled bovine kidney ATPase E subunit, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vma6p, Manduca sexta V-ATPase 14-kDa subunit, and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius gamma subunit, respectively, although the similarities between their amino acid sequences were moderate. Other gene products (NtpF and NtpH) did not show significant sequence similarity to other V-ATPase subunits. Since NtpA, NtpB, and NtpK are homologous counterparts of V-ATPase, these findings suggest that the molecular architecture of E. hirae Na(+)-ATPase complex corresponds to the V-type H(+)-ATPase complex distributed in various eukaryotic endomembrane systems. The sequence of the NtpJ product was similar to those of K+ transport systems of S. cerevisiae (Trk1 and Trk2); its meaning will be discussed. This is the first demonstration of a eukaryotic V-ATPase-like Na+ pump in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1569533476,"Atheroma macrophages accumulate large amounts of free cholesterol (FC) as well as cholesteryl ester (CE). An important adaptive response to FC loading might be increased cellular phospholipid to accommodate the excess FC. To explore this idea, J774 macrophages were incubated for 48 h without lipid, with acetyl-low density lipoprotein to induce mostly CE loading, or with acetyl-low density lipoprotein plus an acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor (58035) to induce marked FC loading. The total phospholipid content approximately doubled in FC-loaded versus control or CE-loaded macrophages, with phosphatidylcholine showing the largest increase (approximately 2.5-fold versus control). Electron micrographs revealed the presence of multiple intracellular membrane whorls in the FC-loaded macrophages but not in the control or CE-loaded macrophages. [3H]Choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was also greater in FC-loaded macrophages versus control or CE-loaded macrophages, whereas [3H]phosphatidylcholine degradation was similar in all of the macrophages. In these experiments and in others that used non-lipoprotein cholesterol, there was a very close correlation between cellular FC content and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. To determine the mechanism of increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis, FC-loaded and CE-loaded macrophages were pulsed with [3H]choline, then chased and assayed for labeled phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic precursors. The only major differences were a 2-fold greater disappearance of label from [3H]choline phosphate and a 5-fold greater appearance of label in CDP-[3H]choline in the FC-loaded macrophages. These data suggest a stimulation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT), which was confirmed by microsomal CT assays. Further studies revealed that the increase in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in FC-loaded macrophages was: (a) reversible under conditions of high density lipoprotein3-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux; (b) not blocked by cycloheximide-induced protein synthesis inhibition; and (c) not associated with increased CT mRNA levels. Thus, FC loading of macrophages leads to an increase in phosphatidylcholine mass which is caused by increased phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The mechanism appears to be FC-mediated post-translational activation of CT. This adaptive response may be important for atheroma macrophage survival, and disruption of the response may lead to macrophage necrosis and lesion progression."
https://openalex.org/W1622568915,"The rat insulinoma cell line RIN 1046-38 loses glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as a function of time in culture. We found that the loss of glucose sensing in these cells was correlated with the loss of expression of GLUT-2 and glucokinase. Stable transfection of RIN cells with a plasmid containing the GLUT-2 cDNA conferred glucose-stimulated insulin release in intermediate but not high passage cells, with the near-maximal 3-fold increase occurring at 50 microM glucose. GLUT-2 expressing cells also exhibited a larger response to the combination of 5 mM glucose + 1 microM forskolin than untransfected cells (7.9 versus 1.6-2.7-fold, respectively). GLUT-2 expressing intermediate passage, but not high passage, RIN cells exhibited a 4-fold increase in glucokinase enzymatic activity relative to nonexpressing controls. Glucokinase activity was also increased by transfer of the GLUT-2 gene into intermediate passage RIN cells via recombinant adenovirus. Preincubation of GLUT-2 expressing intermediate passage RIN cells with 2-deoxyglucose to inhibit low Km hexokinases resulted in a glucose-stimulated insulin secretion response that was shifted toward the physiologic range. These studies indicate that GLUT-2 expression confers both a high and low affinity glucose-stimulated insulin secretion response to intermediate passage RIN cells."
https://openalex.org/W1537523901,"In an optimized reconstituted system, the basic kinetic properties of the phosphate carrier from bovine heart mitochondria, e.g. the influence of membrane potential, pH, and proton gradient, were investigated for the two physiological modes of transport (Pi-/Pi- antiport and electroneutral, unidirectional phosphate transport). On the basis of these data, which closely resemble the function known from mitochondria, the reaction mechanism of the phosphate carrier was determined using bireactant initial velocity studies in both transport modes. Translocation occurred according to a simultaneous (sequential) mechanism, involving a ternary complex in transport catalysis. This mechanism indicates that the phosphate carrier falls into the same functional family as most other mitochondrial carriers. A detailed analysis of the different effects of pH on transport substrates and carrier protein in both possible transport modes, in combination with the identity of the kinetic mechanism in both modes, provides evidence that the unidirectional phosphate transport is catalyzed by Pi-/OH- antiport rather than by Pi-/H+ symport. We furthermore observed noncompetitive inhibition of phosphate transport by other anions. The consequences of this result with respect to a functional model of the carrier protein are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1607470476,"The sigma N (sigma 54) RNA polymerase holoenzyme has the distinctive property of binding to promoters to form a closed promoter complex, which only isomerizes to the open complex when acted upon by an enhancer binding activator protein. We probed promoter complexes that form between sigma N and its holoenzyme with the conformationally sensitive footprinting reagents ortho-copper phenanthroline, potassium permanganate, and diethylpyrocarbonate. Results from these experiments indicate that the contacts sigma N makes at the -12 promoter element are necessary to promote a local DNA distortion immediately adjacent to this promoter element when the holoenzyme but not sigma N alone binds promoter DNA. Complexes in which this local distortion is not detected are not activatable, and the altered DNA conformation is diminished in the activated complex. We propose that a barrier to open complex formation in the sigma N holoenzyme closed complex is at some step or steps after the initial nucleation of DNA strand separation, which is detected as an altered DNA conformation stably maintained within the closed complex. Thus the activator protein may promote a conformational change in the sigma N holoenzyme to allow propagation of the altered DNA conformation, probably local unwinding, which we propose is necessary for formation of the melted DNA state, characteristic of the open promoter complex."
https://openalex.org/W1522128121,"Adenovirus type 5 was modified by coupling an asialoglycoprotein-polylysine conjugate to the virus by reactions that activate carbohydrate residues. Wild-type virus modified in this manner had greatly decreased infectivity toward normally susceptible HeLa S3 (asialoglycoprotein receptor (-)) and SK Hep1 (asialoglycoprotein receptor (-)) cells leaving 91 and 86% viable, respectively, after 48 h. However, with Huh 7 (asialoglycoprotein receptor (+)) cells, modified virus retained its infectivity leaving only 19% of cells viable under identical conditions. Modified virus was complexed to DNA in the form of a plasmid, pSVHBV surf, containing the gene for hepatitis B surface antigen as a marker of gene expression. Huh 7, receptor (+), cells treated with modified wild type, and modified replication-defective d1312 virus complexed to DNA raised antigen levels by approximately 13- and 30-fold, respectively, compared with asialoglycoprotein-polylysine DNA complex alone. Competition with a large excess of an asialoglycoprotein blocked the enhancement by more than 95%. Using a beta-galactosidase marker gene, the number of cells transfected by modified virus was found to be 200-fold higher than complex alone. Yet, specificity was retained exclusively for asialoglycoprotein receptor-bearing cells. These data indicate that adenovirus can be chemically modified by coupling ligands resulting in targeted gene expression dictated specifically by receptor recognition of the attached ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1607201181,"We have reported previously that the three heat shock proteins hsp56, hsp70, and hsp90 exist together in a heterocomplex in human lymphocyte cytosol (Sanchez, E. R., Faber, L. E., Henzel, W. J., and Pratt, W. B. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 5145-5152). All three of these proteins also exist in the native glucocorticoid receptor heterocomplex isolated from WCL2 cell cytosol and we have recently shown that the three heat shock proteins are present when immunopurified mouse glucocorticoid receptor is reconstituted into a heterocomplex by rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Hutchison, K. A., Scherrer, L. C., Czar, M. J., Ning, Y., Sanchez, E. R., Leach, K. L., Deibel, M. R., Jr., and Pratt, W. B. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 3953-3957). In this work, we show that highly purified mouse hsp90 binds in a reversible equilibrium to immunopurified rabbit hsp56, but hsp56 does not bind to purified mouse hsp70. In contrast to the equilibrium binding of hsp90 to hsp56, purified hsp90 binds poorly or not at all to purified hsp70 unless a third factor from reticulocyte lysate is present to permit complex formation. This hsp70.hsp90 complex-forming factor is heat-labile, and in the presence of this factor and ATP, a heat shock protein heterocomplex can be reconstituted from purified mouse hsp90 and hsp70 and rabbit hsp56 that is present in the factor preparation. Our data are consistent with a model in which hsp56 and hsp70 bind to different sites on hsp90 but do not interact with each other. The presence of hsp56 in the heat shock protein heterocomplex is not stabilized by molybdate but hsp56 is stabilized if the glucocorticoid receptor is present in addition to hsp90 and hsp70."
https://openalex.org/W1568142005,"Stimulation of collagenase expression in cultures of normal diploid fibroblasts by the tumor promotor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) occurs secondarily to synthesis of unknown intermediary proteins. We have investigated the hypothesis that a form of the cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) is one intermediate controlling PMA-stimulated collagenase expression. Treatment with an IL-1 receptor antagonist inhibits the constitutive synthesis of collagenase in early passage fibroblast cultures from rabbit. Radioimmunoassay demonstrates that, of the two known IL-1 forms, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, only IL-1 alpha is synthesized and released into the medium of corneal fibroblast cultures. PMA treatment of cells increases the level of IL-1 alpha mRNA; this occurs prior to the increase in collagenase mRNA and corresponds with increased synthesis and release of IL-1 alpha protein. Neutralizing antiserum to IL-1 alpha inhibits constitutive collagenase synthesis. Reagents that inhibit the activity of IL-1 alpha (IL-1 receptor antagonist or neutralizing antibody) also inhibit the PMA-mediated stimulation of collagenase synthesis. These results indicate that constitutive and PMA-stimulated expression of collagenase is regulated through an IL-1 alpha intermediate. In vivo, regulation of the lytic phase of tissue remodeling through the IL-1 alpha intermediate may ensure the recruitment of cells adjacent to the one that received the initial stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1519327359,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the importance of nucleotides in the catBC promoter region for the binding of CatR, a member of the LysR family of DNA-binding proteins and for the in vivo activation of the catBC operon. The binding affinity of CatR for its binding site in the catBC promoter region was shown to increase about 2.2-fold in the presence of the inducer, cis,cis-muconate. Nucleotides were targeted for mutagenesis on the basis of previous footprinting data and sequence analysis of CatR binding sites. Critical nucleotides for CatR binding were found within an imperfect inverted repeat. Previous studies have indicated that the LysR family of DNA-binding proteins shares a consensus T-N11-A binding motif (Goethals, K., Van Montagu, M., and Holsters, M. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 1646-1650), but the CatR binding site sequence has located within the imperfect inverted repeat a G-N11-A instead of the predicted T. Mutagenesis of the G to a T resulted in an increase in both the binding of CatR to the catBC promoter and in the in vivo activation. Nucleotides within the -35 and -10 regions of the catBC promoter were found to be important for promoter activity but not for CatR binding."
https://openalex.org/W1565454730,"Oncostatin M (OM) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are functionally related cytokines, which trigger similar biological responses because they share gp130 as a common signal transducing transmembrane receptor. While IL-6 recruits gp130 only upon binding to its specific receptor subunit (IL-6R alpha), reconstitution and cross-linking experiments on cell membranes suggest that OM can directly interact with gp130 and that this interaction is necessary but not sufficient to stimulate cells. However, the issue of the direct binding between gp130 and OM, in the absence of any additional membrane component, remained essentially unclarified. In this paper we show that, uniquely among the family of cytokines that transduce through gp130, OM directly binds in vitro with a 10(-8) M affinity sgp130, a soluble form of gp130. Moreover, titration of sgp130 with OM inhibits the formation of a ternary complex comprising IL-6, sIL-6R alpha, and sgp130. These in vitro properties of OM are consistent with the additional finding that on human hepatoma Hep3B cells, which express gp130 but not functional OM receptors, OM does not mimic IL-6 activity, but rather behaves, at high doses, as an IL-6 antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1624849122,"Meizothrombin is a transient intermediate produced during the activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex. Because meizothrombin is very sensitive to further activation and autolysis, its isolation is possible only in the presence of active site thrombin inhibitors. This complicates studies of the activities and functions of meizothrombin. As a model, we have expressed a mutant human prothrombin cDNA (R155A, R271A, R284A) with three of the cleavage sites modified so that they are no longer cleaved by factor Xa or thrombin. Several stable baby hamster kidney cell lines were isolated that secreted up to 20 micrograms/ml of carboxylated mutant prothrombin. After purification, the mutant prothrombin was activated by the prothrombinase complex or by ecarin, resulting in the formation of a meizothrombin-like molecule. Electrophoretic analysis and NH2-terminal sequence analysis were consistent with cleavage of a single bond between Arg320-Ile321 and proper processing of the prepropeptide. The meizothrombin was stable for weeks at 4 degrees C. Activation in the presence of dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl) amide confirmed the conversion of prothrombin via meizothrombin. Compared with human plasma-derived thrombin, recombinant meizothrombin demonstrated approximately 7% clotting activity, 100% p-toluene-sulfonylarginine methyl ester esterase activity, and approximately 35% S2238 amidolytic activity, and could attenuate fibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2103737986,"Abstract The large cytoplasmic loop of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (LCL), situated between Lys329 and Phe740, is believed to contain both its phosphorylation and ATP binding domains. A cDNA fragment coding for this amino acid sequence was generated in vitro and cloned in vector pQE8 which allowed the overexpression in Escherichia coli of this Ca(2+)-ATPase domain fused with a cluster of 6 histidines at its NH2 terminus. The fusion protein produced in an insoluble form within bacteria was solubilized in 4 M urea, purified on immobilized Ni2+, and then renatured by elimination of urea. More than 4 mg of purified renatured fusion protein was obtained from 500 ml of culture. ATP binding on the refolded protein was demonstrated by two methods: 1) detection of ATP-induced intrinsic fluorescence change and 2) binding of the fluorescent ATP analogue 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-adenosine-5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) and its chase by ATP. It is shown that the LCL protein has one single TNP-ATP binding site having a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.6-1.9 microM. Both methods yielded a Kd for ATP around 200 microM. Binding of other nucleotides was detected with a sequence of Kd identical to that found for native Ca(2+)-ATPase: ATP < ADP < GTP < AMP < ITP. A Mg2+ binding site was also found on the LCL protein (Kd = 100 microM at pH 7.2). The fluorescence of bound TNP-ATP was found to be highly dependent on Mg2+ binding on this site."
https://openalex.org/W1610648155,"Wild-type rat androgen receptor and four of its deletion mutants were produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Inclusion of androgen, but not estrogen, progesterone, or glucocorticoid, in culture medium increased the yield of soluble androgen receptors, although the majority of receptors still remained in the insoluble form (Xie, Y.-B., Sui, Y.-P., Shan, L.-X., Palvimo, J. J., Phillips, D. M., and Janne, O. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4939-4948). The wild-type receptor interacted with an androgen response element (ARE) with a 2-6-fold higher affinity (KD = 0.5 nM) than mutants with deletions outside the DNA-binding domain (delta 40-147, delta 38-296, delta 46-408, and delta 788-902 mutants), suggesting that sequences flanking the DNA-binding region influence the stability of receptor-DNA complexes. Changes in spacing (n = 3) between the two ARE half-sites by a single nucleotide (n - 1, n + 1) or by 10 bases (n + 10) abolished the full-length receptor's ability to form stable complexes with DNA. Binding to AREs with altered spacing could not be restored by antisera against the N-terminal domain of the receptor that stabilize androgen receptor-DNA interactions with many naturally occurring strong and weak AREs. Methylation interference and 1,10-phenanthroline copper footprinting analyses revealed that the receptor binds to DNA as a dimer. Dimer formation was demonstrated directly by mixing full-length and delta 46-408 mutant receptors, which resulted in the formation of heterodimeric receptor-DNA complexes. The half-time of dissociation of the wild-type receptor from a consensus ARE sequence was about 3 min at 22 degrees C. Collectively, androgen receptor binds to DNA with properties similar to, but not identical with, those of glucocorticoid receptor, indicating that regions outside the DNA-binding domain are important to ensure androgen specificity of transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1515020013,"The N-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop (i3) of muscarinic acetylcholine and other G protein-coupled receptors has been shown to largely determine the G protein coupling profile of a given receptor subtype. Using the rat m3 muscarinic receptor as a model system, we have recently demonstrated that a tyrosine residue (Tyr-254), located at the beginning of the i3 domain, is critically involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis (Bluml, K., Mutschler, E., and Wess, J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 402-405). This study was designed to investigate the functional role of this amino acid in further molecular detail. Replacement of Tyr-254 (rat m3 receptor) with alanine or exchange of its position with Ile-253 virtually abolished receptor-mediated stimulation of PI hydrolysis studied in transfected COS-7 cells. In contrast, substitution of Tyr-254 by other aromatic residues such as phenylalanine or tryptophan resulted in mutant receptors that behaved functionally similar to the wild type m3 receptor. Introduction of Tyr-254 into the corresponding position (Ser-210) of the m2 muscarinic receptor (which is only poorly coupled to PI turnover) did not result in an enhanced PI response. However, reinsertion of Tyr-254 into a functionally inactive chimeric m3/m2 muscarinic receptor (containing m2 receptor sequence at the N terminus of the i3 loop) yielded a mutant receptor that was able to stimulate PI hydrolysis to a similar maximum extent as the wild type m3 receptor. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of PI metabolism is critically dependent on the presence and proper positioning of an aromatic residue at the beginning of the i3 loop."
https://openalex.org/W1532237107,"Two intracellular Ca2+ release pathways are modulated by Ca2+ itself, namely Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (classical CICR), and Ca(2+)-sensitized inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced Ca2+ release (CSIICR). Both of these pathways are thought to be important in generating cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations. Caffeine and the sulfhydryl reagent thimerosal (TMS) are frequently used as selective modulators of CICR and CSIICR, respectively. We have studied the modes of action of caffeine and TMS in sea urchin egg homogenates using the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), the only known endogenous compound to cause Ca2+ release via the ryanodine receptor, was used as an agonist for the classical CICR pathway. cADPR and InsP3 each alone caused release of sequestered Ca2+. Coaddition of caffeine dose-dependently and dramatically enhanced Ca2+ release induced by cADPR. InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was not affected by caffeine, but it was amplified by TMS, indicating the existence of the CSIICR pathway in this preparation. Surprisingly, cADPR-induced Ca2+ release was also markedly potentiated by TMS. TMS alone caused a slow increase in Ca2+ release which was not inhibited by heparin and/or procaine, indicating that TMS-induced Ca2+ release was not due to the actions of endogenous agonists (InsP3 or cADPR) on their receptors. All observed actions of TMS were abolished by dithiothreitol. We conclude: 1) both the InsP3- and cADPR-controlled Ca2+ release pathways are potentiated by TMS, while caffeine is specific for the cADPR pathway, indicating that TMS cannot be used as a selective reagent for probing the CSIICR mechanism; and 2) the action of TMS on intracellular Ca2+ release is independent of endogenous Ca2+ channel agonists, suggesting a novel action of TMS possibly on intravesicular Ca2+ handling."
https://openalex.org/W1558269436,"Conglutinin and mannan-binding protein are serum proteins that have similar carbohydrate binding specificities toward high mannose-type oligosaccharides, and yet only conglutinin binds the complement glycoprotein iC3b, which contains oligosaccharides of this type. In the present study, the interactions of conglutinin and mannan-binding protein were evaluated with the complement glycoprotein C3, including various physiologically derived fragments of this glycoprotein, and neoglycolipids prepared from oligosaccharides released from C3 and its isolated alpha and beta chains. Several conclusions can be drawn. First, the interaction of conglutinin is profoundly influenced by the state of the protein moiety of the alpha chain in the vicinity of the glycosylation site Asn-917. Second, the binding to the C3-derived glycoprotein iC3b appears to be exclusively mediated through the Man8 or Man9 oligosaccharide on the alpha chain; there is no evidence for other N-linked oligosaccharides on C3 that are uniquely bound by conglutinin. Third, although conglutinin shows a more restricted binding relative to mannan-binding protein toward the oligosaccharides free of protein, it has a broader binding pattern toward the oligosaccharides as presented on C3-derived glycoproteins. From these and additional observations with RNase B, which contains high mannose-type oligosaccharides at Asn-34, it is clear that the protein moieties of these glycoproteins markedly influence the presentation of the oligosaccharides such that biological specificity is mediated by the commonly occurring high mannose-type oligosaccharides in the context of specific carrier proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1562079260,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors (IGF-1R) and insulin receptors (IR) are closely related tyrosine kinases. However, the IR plays a major role in metabolism control, whereas the IGF-1R is mainly involved in growth and differentiation. With these observations in mind, we wished to define the regions of IR and IGF-1R responsible for generation of biological specificity. We constructed a chimeric IGF-1R in which the carboxyl-terminal domain was replaced by that of IR. This receptor (IGF/CTIR) was expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and we compared its biological activity with that of wild-type receptors. The IGF/CTIR was fully functional regarding kinase activity and biological properties. Comparison of insulin and IGF-1 effects on IR and IGF-1R cells, respectively, indicated that the IR is more efficient in stimulating glycogen synthesis and p44mapk activity than is the IGF-1R. Interestingly, in IGF/CTIR16 cells expressing only 250,000 receptors glycogen synthesis was better stimulated than in IGF-1R cells with 600,000 receptors. Similarly, p44mapk activation was slightly higher in IGF/CTIR16 cells than in IGF-1R cells. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain of IR is more tightly coupled to the stimulation of glycogen synthesis and to the p44mapk pathway than is that of IGF-1R. We propose that this domain plays a crucial role in the transmission of biological effects and could account, at least in part, for receptor specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1513956252,"Isoquinoline 1-oxidoreductase, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of isoquinoline to 1-oxo-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline with concomitant reduction of a suitable electron acceptor, was purified from the isoquinoline degrading bacterium Pseudomonas diminuta 7 to apparent homogeneity. The native enzyme was a heterodimer with a molecular mass of 95 kDa consisting of a 16- and a 80-kDa subunit. It contained 0.85 g atom molybdenum, 3.95 g atom iron, 3.9 g atom acid-labile sulfur, 2.1 mol of phosphate, and 1 mol of CMP/mol of enzyme. CMP and phosphate are suggested to originate from molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide of the pterin molybdenum cofactor. It is assumed that the iron and the acid-labile sulfur are arranged in two (2Fe-2S) clusters. The isoelectric point of the isoquinoline 1-oxidoreductase was within the range of pH 6.2 to 6.8. Cytochrome c, ferricyanide, and several non-physiological electron acceptors served as oxidizing substrates, whereas O2 and NAD were not used. Isoquinoline 1-oxidoreductase revealed a high specificity toward the reducing substrates isoquinoline, 5-hydroxyisoquinoline, quinazoline, and phthalazine. Isoquinoline 1-oxidoreductase was inactivated by methanol, arsenite, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, 1,10-phenanthroline, and cyanide. Additionally, the enzyme was inactivated upon incubation with its substrates isoquinoline, which slowly inhibited the enzyme in the absence of an electron acceptor, and 5-hydroxy-isoquinoline, which rapidly and very effectively inactivated the enzyme in the presence as well as in the absence of the electron acceptors iodonitrotetrazolium chloride, phenazine methosulfate, or ferricyanide."
https://openalex.org/W1604413181,"Abstract The self-polymerization of alpha beta-spectrin heterodimers to form tetramers and higher oligomers is central to its role as a membrane stabilizer and organizer. Mutations near the amino terminus of alpha I sigma 1-spectrin or the COOH terminus of I sigma 1-spectrin often lead to profound impairment heterodimer polymerization and to hemolytic disease of varying severity. Previous studies using an 80-kDa univalent fragment of alpha I sigma 1-spectrin have established that the amino-terminal segment of alpha I sigma 1-spectrin mediates the association of the alpha subunit with either intact heterodimers or with isolated beta-spectrin (beta I sigma 1). However, the nature of the self-association site in beta-spectrin has remained unclear. In the present study, native beta-spectrin and recombinant beta-spectrin peptides representing COOH-terminal portions of two alternative transcripts of the gene on chromosome 2 (beta I sigma 1 or erythrocyte spectrin and I sigma 2 or muscle spectrin), and one transcript of the gene on chromosome 14 (beta II sigma 1 or beta G-fodrin) have been examined for their ability to bind either intact alpha beta-spectrin or the alpha I-spectrin 80-kDa univalent fragment. Deletion of the nonhomologous beta-spectrin sequence downstream of repeat 17 (spectrin domain III) had no discernible effect on binding. Truncations proximal to codon 2085 of I sigma 1-spectrin demonstrated a precipitous loss of activity, accounted for by a loss of both binding affinity and capacity. Further truncations to repeat 16 (codon 1979) restored binding activity to levels approximating that of the intact molecule. Repeat 16/17 and 17/16 chimeras displayed reduced binding activity. Collectively, these data indicate that the beta-subunit self-association site is highly sensitive to conformation, involves widespread interactions within the 17th repeat unit, is largely independent of sequences in domain III, and can be recreated by the deletion of all residues distal to the COOH end (codon 1979) of the 16th and presumably other spectrin sequence repeat units. All beta-spectrins appear to use this binding motif, regardless of the nature of the nonhomologous sequence in domain III."
https://openalex.org/W1510515534,"Evidence suggests that the c-Jun protooncogene delta (delta) domain (amino acids 31-60) helps regulate the transcriptional activating capacity of c-Jun by modulating the amino-terminal phosphorylation of this protein. By using a peptide encoding the delta domain and purified amino-terminal c-Jun protein kinase, we demonstrate that the delta domain peptide inhibits phosphorylation of the amino terminus of both c-Jun and the related protein JunD. The delta domain peptide inhibited the activation of the c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase by phorbol esters in permeabilized U937 leukemic cells. Mutation of c-Jun followed by transfection into U937 leukemic cells demonstrated that partial deletions of the delta domain are sufficient to block phosphorylation of the amino terminus of c-Jun. In vitro deletion of the amino-terminal (amino acids 31-44) half of the delta domain inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun. However, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 45-60) half only partially inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation. Therefore, these results indicate that the delta domain sequence is an important regulator of c-Jun amino-terminal phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1546864960,"Reverse gyrase, an ATP-dependent topoisomerase that positively supercoils DNA, has been purified to near-homogeneity from the hyperthermophile Methanopyrus kandleri. It migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as two principal bands with apparent molecular masses of 150 and 50 kDa. Both proteins remain associated throughout all chromatographic steps. Transfer of a radioactive phosphate from DNA to the 50-kDa protein and gel retardation experiments indicate that this protein forms the covalent complex with DNA. A blot overlay assay identifies the 150-kDa protein as the potential ATPase. This is the first evidence that a reverse gyrase can be a topoisomerase consisting of two protomers. In analogy with the DNA gyrase A subunit (DNA breakage and reunion activity) and the B subunit (ATPase), the 50- and 150-kDa components of Mka reverse gyrase have been designated the A and B subunits, respectively. Methanopyrus reverse gyrase changes DNA linking number in steps of one and its A subunit covalently binds to the 5'-DNA phosphoryl group. It nicks DNA at sites that predominantly have a cytosine at the -4-position. The same rule was derived previously for monomeric reverse gyrase from sulfur-metabolizing hyperthermophiles and for topoisomerase I from mesophilic bacteria. Based on these results, Mka reverse gyrase is classified as belonging to group A of type I topoisomerases. The structural diversity of type I group A topoisomerases parallels the diversity of type II enzymes and suggests the evolution of an essential function by gene fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1529849819,"Abstract Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were treated with 6 mM dithiothreitol in the presence of 2 mM ATP and 0.1 mM Ca2+ at 25 degrees C and pH 7.0 for various periods. The Ca(2+)-ATPase was inhibited almost completely in 100 min. The content of the sulfhydryl group, which was measured in 2.5% SDS with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), increased during the treatment. Extrapolation of the plot of the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity versus the increment of the sulfhydryl group showed that reduction of two disulfide bonds per phosphorylation site leads to a complete inhibition of the enzyme. This reduction required binding of both Ca2+ (with a high affinity) and a purine nucleotide to the enzyme. Adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene) triphosphate (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) was also effective for the reduction, while phosphorylation of the enzyme with acetyl phosphate or P(i) did not trigger the reduction. These results indicate that formation of a substrate-enzyme-calcium complex is responsible for the dithiothreitol-induced disulfide bond reduction. The partial reactions of the Ca(2+)-ATPase were examined with the vesicles that had been treated with dithiothreitol in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ for 100-200 min. Neither isomerization of the unphosphorylated enzyme from the low Ca2+ affinity form to the high Ca2+ affinity form nor phosphorylation of the enzyme with ATP or P(i) was inhibited. In contrast, isomerization of the phosphoenzyme intermediate from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form was strongly inhibited. These results show that the observed inhibition of the Ca(2+)-ATPase is due to a selective blockage of the phosphoenzyme isomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1643671994,"In Rhizobium leguminosarum the nodABC and nod-FEL operons are involved in the production of lipooligosaccharide signals, which mediate host specificity. A nodE-determined highly unsaturated C18:4 fatty acid (trans-2,trans-4,trans-6,cis-11-octadecatetraenoic acid) is essential for the ability of the signals to induce nodule primordia (Spaink, H. P., Sheeley, D. M., van Brussel, A. A. N., Glushka, J., York, W.S., Tak, T., Geiger, O., Kennedy, E. P., Reinhold, V. N., and Lugtenberg, B. J. J.

(1992) Science 257, 70-72) on the host plant Vicia sativa. We presently focus on the question of how these lipo-oligosaccharide signals are synthesized in Rhizobium. Here we show that after the induction of the nodFE genes, even in the absence of the nodABC genes, the trans-2,trans-4,trans-6,cis-11-octadecatetraenoic acid, which has a characteristic absorbance maximum of 303 nm, is synthesized; this shows that the biosynthesis of the unusual fatty acid is not dependent on the synthesis of the lipooligosaccharides. This finding also suggests that the biosynthesis of the unusual fatty acid is completed before it is linked to the sugar backbone of the lipooligosaccharide. In an attempt to identify the lipid fraction with which the unusual C18:4 fatty acid is associated, we found that it is linked to the sn-2 position of the phospholipids. Even when lipooligosaccharide signals are produced in a wild type Rhizobium cell, a fraction of the unusual fatty acid is still bound to all major phospholipids. These findings offer interesting possibilities. 1) The phospholipids might be biosynthetic intermediates for the synthesis of lipooligosaccharide signals, and 2) phospholipids, containing nodFE-derived fatty acids, might have a signal function of their own."
https://openalex.org/W1509009736,"Five residues (Thr-53, Asn-54, Gly-370, Gly-393, and Gly-394) of Rhodospirillum rubrum ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase are positioned to serve as hydrogen-bond donors for the C1 phosphate of ribulose bisphosphate and thereby constrain conformational flexibility of the initial enediol(ate) intermediate (Knight, S., Andersson, I., and Branden, C.-I. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215, 113-160). To study the functional contributions of the residues implicated in ribulose bisphosphate binding and intermediate stabilization, we have replaced them individually with alanine, either to remove the H-bonding group (T53A, N54A) or to introduce bulk (G370A, G393A, G394A). Consequences of substitutions include diminution of carboxylase activity (with a lesser impact on enolization activity), increase of Km (ribulose bisphosphate), and decrease of carboxylation: oxygenation specificity. During catalytic turnover of ribulose bisphosphate by several mutants, substantial amounts of the substrate are diverted to 1-deoxy-D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 5-phosphate, reflecting beta-elimination of phosphate from the enediol(ate) intermediate. This side product is not observed with wild-type enzyme, nor has it been reported with mutant enzymes characterized previously. Another consequence of disruption of the phosphate binding site is enhanced production of pyruvate, relative to wild-type enzyme, by some of the mutants due to decomposition of the acicarbanion of 3-phosphoglycerate (the terminal intermediate). These data provide direct evidence that phosphate ligands stabilize conformations of intermediates that favor productive turnover and mitigate beta-elimination at two stages of overall catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1513222151,"Squalene synthase catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to give presqualene diphosphate (PSPP) and the subsequent reductive rearrangement of PSPP to squalene. Previous studies of the mechanism of addition of FPP to the enzyme have led to conflicting interpretations of initial velocity measurements (Beytia, E., Qureshi, A. A., and Porter, J.W. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1856-1867; Agnew, W.S., and Popjak, G. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4566-4573). Initial velocities for synthesis of PSPP and squalene were measured over a wider range of FPP and NADPH concentrations than previously reported, using a soluble form of recombinant enzyme. In the absence of NADPH, PSPP formation was activated by FPP at concentrations above approximately 0.5 microM. At fixed levels of NADPH, the dependence of initial rates of PSPP and squalene synthesis on FPP concentrations indicated that the C15 substrate added by a sequential mechanism. In addition, NADPH stimulated synthesis of PSPP by 40-fold at saturating levels of the cofactor. This stimulation is, at least in part, by reduction of PSPP to squalene."

The 13C enrichment of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA was probed by the enrichment of R-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The latter was not enriched from [1,2,3,4-(13)C4]docosanoate, thus excluding mitochondrial beta-oxidation of docosanoate. The 13C enrichment of extra-mitochondrial acetyl-CoA was probed by the enrichments of acetylated drugs and of free acetate. In most cases, the four probes yielded different enrichments. Thus, extra-mitochondrial acetyl-CoA appears nonhomogeneous. Competition between drugs alters the labeling of individual acetyl-CoA sub-pools. The labeling pattern of acetylated drugs suggests the existence of more than the two N-acetyltransferases identified so far by others. Our data question the possibility of probing the pool of lipogenic acetyl-CoA via drug acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W1557283306,"Ribozymes are potentially powerful tools for the suppression of intracellular gene expression. However, the few reports that exist of their activities in bacteria have described mixed success. Chuat and Galibert (Chuat, J.-C., and Galibert, F. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 162, 1025-1029) failed to detect any trans-activities of hammerhead ribozymes in Escherichia coli, while Sioud and Drlica (Sioud, M., and Drlica, K. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 7303-7307) reported complete inhibition of expression of the gene for a nonbacterial protein, HIV-1 integrase, by trans-acting hammerhead ribozymes in E. coli. It is of interest to determine whether ribozymes can really be used in natural bacterial systems (Altman, S. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 10898-10900). We now report that a ribozyme designed to cleave the A2 gene of RNA coliphage SP, when transcribed from a plasmid in E. coli caused failure of the proliferation of progeny phage. Inactive ribozymes with altered catalytic sequences did not affect phage growth. These results indicate that it is mainly the catalytic activity of the ribozyme and not its function as an antisense molecule that is responsible for suppressing the proliferation of the RNA phage. Moreover, an analysis based on numbers of plaque-forming units and the function of the A2 protein indicated that antisense RNA may successfully compete with ribosomes in targeting mRNA while ribozymes in this study may not compete with ribosomes in naturally occurring bacterial transcription/translation-coupled systems."

Two forms of N-proteinase with apparent molecular sizes of 300 and 500 kDa were found in partially purified preparations from fetal bovine tendon extracts. The 500-kDa form of enzyme was purified 16,000-fold with a recovery of 8% from the extracts of the tendons by six purification steps. The purified enzyme was a neutral, Ca(2+)-dependent proteinase (5-10 mM) that was inhibited by metal chelators. The 500-kDa enzyme contained unreduced polypeptides of 58, 125, 170, and 190 kDa which were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Electron microscopic study indicated that the enzyme molecules were generally globular and had diameters of 33 +/- 4 nm. Other properties of the 500-kDa enzyme were: 1) the Km for type I procollagen is 35 nM at pH 7.5 and 35 degrees C, and the kcat is 290 h-1; 2) the activation energy for reaction with type I procollagen is 10,050 cal mol-1; 3) the isoelectric point is 3.8; 4) the enzyme cleaves the NH2-terminal propeptides of type II procollagen as well as type I procollagen but not of type III procollagen; and 5) the enzyme specifically cleaves a -Pro-Gln- bond in the pro-alpha 1(I) chain and an -Ala-Gln- bond in the pro-alpha 2(I) chain. The bovine N-proteinase with a mass of 300 kDa was found to be similar to the 500-kDa enzyme and appeared to be a degraded form of the 500-kDa enzyme generated during purification.

The recombinant alpha-bungarotoxin is expressed as a fusion protein with alpha-bungarotoxin linked to the COOH-terminal end of the T7 Gene 9-encoded coat protein. After treatment of the fusion protein with Factor Xa protease, a recombinant alpha-bungarotoxin is released that co-migrates with authentic alpha-bungarotoxin upon reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Final yields of active recombinant alpha-bungarotoxin were about 0.4 mg/liter of starting bacterial culture. The recombinant alpha-bungarotoxin contains 10 additional residues linked to the NH2-terminal Ile of the alpha-bungarotoxin sequence due apparently to the inaccessibility of the engineered cleavage site to Factor Xa. Nevertheless, the recombinant alpha-bungarotoxin is capable of binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with an apparent affinity that is only decreased approximately 1.7-fold from that of authentic alpha-bungarotoxin. Alanine substitution of a residue, Asp30, highly conserved among alpha-neurotoxins and previously suggested to play a key role in receptor recognition, resulted in a recombinant alpha-bungarotoxin whose receptor binding activity is indistinguishable from authentic alpha-bungarotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1522884769,"Regulation of the 45- and 55-kDa forms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase (ATP:phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphotransferase) by phospholipids was examined using Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles. CDP-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol inhibited 45-kDa PI 4-kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analyses of the 45-kDa PI 4-kinase showed that phosphatidylglycerol was a competitive inhibitor with respect to PI (Ki = 2 mol %), and CDP-diacylglycerol was a mixed type of inhibitor with respect to PI (Ki = 4 mol %) and MgATP (Ki = 5 mol %). 55-kDa PI 4-kinase activity was not significantly affected by phospholipids. The physiological relevance of CDP-diacylglycerol inhibition of 45-kDa PI 4-kinase activity was examined using plasma membranes from inositol auxotrophic (ino1) cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that 45-kDa PI 4-kinase expression in plasma membranes was not affected by inositol starvation of ino1 cells. However, both 45-kDa PI 4-kinase activity and its product PI 4-phosphate were reduced in plasma membranes from inositol-starved ino1 cells. The CDP-diacylglycerol concentration (9.6 mol %) in plasma membranes of inositol-starved ino1 cells was 12-fold higher than its concentration (0.8 mol %) in plasma membranes of inositol-supplemented cells. Plasma membranes of inositol-starved ino1 cells also had increased levels of phosphatidate, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin. However, these phospholipids did not affect pure 45-kDa PI 4-kinase activity. The concentration of CDP-diacylglycerol in plasma membranes of inositol-starved ino1 cells was in the range of the inhibitor constants determined for CDP-diacylglycerol by kinetic analyses using pure 45-kDa PI 4-kinase. These results raised the suggestion that 45-kDa PI 4-kinase activity may be regulated in vivo by CDP-diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1542469826,"Abstract A xylosyltransferase in rat kidney, tentatively identified as glycogenin (Meezan, E., Ananth, S., Manzella, S., Campbell, P., Siegal, S., Pillion, D. J., and Roden, L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 11503-11508), was purified by a procedure in which affinity chromatography on UDP-glucuronic acid-agarose was a particularly useful step. The purified material was nearly homogeneous, as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining, and had an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to a M(r) of 32,000. The purified enzyme possessed both glucosyl- and xylosyltransferase activity, and incubation with UDP-[3H]xylose or UDP-[3H]glucose yielded a single macromolecular product, which had the same electrophoretic mobility as the major silver-stained component. These results indicate that the kidney transferase was indeed glycogenin and that it was functionally analogous to the larger glycogenin species previously isolated from rabbit muscle. Further examination of the properties of the rat kidney enzyme showed, i.a., that it was inhibited strongly by cytidine 5'-diphosphate. This effect was used to advantage in an alternative purification procedure, which was applied to beef kidney and involved adsorption of the enzyme to UDP-glucuronic acid-agarose and subsequent elution with cytidine 5'-diphosphate. In contrast to glycogenin, glycogen synthase did not catalyze transfer from UDP-xylose, and it is suggested that the incorporation of xylose into glycogen observed by other investigators was due to glycogenin-catalyzed xylosyl transfer and subsequent chain elongation by glycogen synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1511423784,"Abstract The binding domain of the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75NGFR) is built from four repeats, with almost identical patterns of half-cystine residues. To study the pattern of disulfide bridging within each cysteine repeat, we have mutated pairs of cysteine residues, primarily in the fourth repeat, and have tested the relative ability of each mutant to be cross-linked to the nerve growth factor after transient expression in COS 7 cells. The results give an indication of the relative importance of different disulfide bonds for the stability of the active conformation. Immunofluorescent staining shows that all of these proteins, even those that may be partially misfolded, are expressed to varying degrees on the surface of COS cells. They can also be detected by the monoclonal antibody MC192 on a Western blot following electrophoresis on a nondenaturing gel. Some cannot, however, be detected by MC192 on a Western blot after heat denaturation in SDS. The ability to refold under these conditions correlates in general with the ability of the mutant protein to bind nerve growth factor on the surface of COS cells."
