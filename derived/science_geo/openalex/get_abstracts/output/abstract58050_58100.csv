https://openalex.org/W1600281368,"Abstract The membrane-bound d-lactate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli ML 308–225 has been solubilized and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 75,000 ± 7% and contains approximately 1 mole of flavin adenine dinucleotide per mole of enzyme. Its pH optimum before exposure to Triton X-100 is 7.5 to 8.0; after exposure it is 8.0 to 9.5. The purified enzyme has a Km value of 1.4 x 10-3 m for d-lactate and 3.0 x 10-2 m for l-lactate before exposure to Triton X-100; after exposure its Km values are 0.5 x 10-2 m and 2.1 x 10-2 m for the same substrates, respectively. The enzyme is not active with d-glycerate, l-glycerate, succinate, malate, d-tartrate, l-tartrate, meso-tartrate, 1-propanol, or isopropanol as substrates and oxidized diphosphopyridine nucleotide has no effect on the catalytic conversion of d-lactate to pyruvate. The enzyme is not inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, n-ethylmaleimide, or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) but is inactivated by treatment with 2-hydroxy-3-butynoic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1600771742,"Abstract Studies on the specificity of a lytic enzyme induced by bacteriophage T7 infection of Escherichia coli were carried out by analyzing the products of the enzyme's action on purified E. coli peptidoglycan. The E. coli peptidoglycan is known to contain a lipoprotein (molecular weight = 7,200) covalently attached to diaminopimelic acid. When radioactively labeled E. coli peptidoglycan was digested with purified bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, the lipoprotein was cleaved from the peptidoglycan and migrated to a position of molecular weight 10,600 in a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretogram. The lipoprotein was found to contain both radioactive N-acetylglucosamine and diaminopimelic acid, as expected from the known enzymatic specificity of T4 lysozyme (an N-acetylmuramidase). On the other hand, when the labeled peptidoglycan was digested with a bacteriophage T7 lysate, the lipoprotein migrated to a position of significantly lower molecular weight than that of the lipoprotein cleaved by T4 lysozyme. Furthermore, the lipoprotein contained diaminopimelic acid, but not N-acetylglucosamine. This suggested that the release of the lipoprotein from the peptidoglycan by the T7 lysate was not due to the hydrolysis of one of the bonds in the glycan backbone, but due to the hydrolysis of one of the bonds in the peptide portion of the peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan radioactively labeled with l-alanine was prepared, digested with the lytic enzyme in a T7 lysate, and the digestion products analyzed. From these experiments, it was concluded that the T7 enzyme cleaves the bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and l-alanine. This conclusion was confirmed by observing that the release of NH2-terminal l-[14C]alanine was chemically detected by dinitrophenylation after digestion of labeled peptidoglycan with the T7 lysate. Hence the T7 lytic enzyme is an N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase. It is most likely the product of the T7 lysozyme gene (gene 3.5), since no lytic activity was detected in a lysate prepared by infection of E. coli with a T7 lysozyme mutant."

https://openalex.org/W1509187616,Abstract 50 S ribosomal proteins L7 and L12 have been shown to be equally effective in restoring elongation factors Tu- and G-dependent GTP hydrolysis and polyphenylalanine synthesis to 50 S ribosomal subunits depleted of these proteins. An additional protein fraction removed from the L7L12-depleted ribosomes is also required for polyphenylalanine synthesis and has been shown to be involved in the subsequent rebinding of L7L12 to the ribosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2067234881,"IN October 1968, the Department of Entomology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine received from the Chief Medical Officer of the British Petroleum Company Ltd, two nymphs of an argasid tick. They were collected from the island of Zirqa (Zarrakkuh) (24°53′N, 53°04′E) off the coast of Abu Dhabi in the Persian Gulf and were associated with ground-nesting ospreys (Pandion h. haliaetus) and Socotra cormorants (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis) which appear on the island towards the end of August and remain till early February. The island is barren and uninhabited by humans. Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Limited (ADMA) have a radiomast and generator on the island and ADMA personnel make regular visits for routine maintenance of the plant. Local fishermen also visit the island from time to time. Attention was drawn to the presence of ticks when personnel were bitten by them and reacted with allergic symptoms, septic sores and high temperature. Case history notes are given by Hoogstraal, Oliver and Guirgis1. Blood smears from a patient who was ill following tick bites were negative for spiro-chaetes, protozoa and microfilariae. The ticks were identified by one of us (M. G. R. V.) as Ornithodoros sp. and sent to Dr H. Hoogstraal of NAMRU-3, Cairo, who assigned them to Ornithodoros (Alectorobius) muesebecki described from specimens collected from a booby colony on Hasikiya Island, South Yemen Republic, in the Arabian Sea2."
