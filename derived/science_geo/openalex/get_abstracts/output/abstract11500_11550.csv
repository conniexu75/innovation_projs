https://openalex.org/W2018561367,"THERE are several sex determining mechanisms which produce two sexes in a population (dioecy or gonochorism)1–5. In many of these, the offspring's sex is determined at or before conception, as in male or female heterogamety. In several organisms, however, the offspring's sex is determined later than conception, by some environmental influence upon the offspring. We consider here why these environmental mechanisms have been maintained; that is, why have they not been replaced with an alternative system that determines sex at conception? We propose that labile sex determination (not fixed at conception) is favoured by natural selection when an individual's fitness (as a male or female) is strongly influenced by environmental conditions and where the individual has little control over which environment it will experience. Our argument also applies to sex expression in hermaphrodites6,7."

https://openalex.org/W2023593626,"CHOLESTEROL, the most abundant steroid in the animal kingdom, is found mainly as a component in cell membranes and lipoproteins. The presence of the hydrophilic C(3) hydroxyl group in this otherwise hydrophobic molecule allows cholesterol to occupy a position at polar–nonpolar interfaces. Crystals of 3-hydroxy steroids and their hydrates show a tendency towards double layer structures with an end-for-end arrangement of approximately parallel molecules1. As this molecular organisation is generally similar to that in membranes, it can be expected that some of the principles of intermolecular association in membranes might be revealed in the molecular packing in the crystal structures. Another common feature in these structures is the presence of more than one molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. While this is a complicating factor in structure analysis, it clearly increases the amount of information regarding preferred conformation and intermolecular association to be gained from a structure determination. Craven2 has recently reported the remarkable crystal structure of one form of cholesterol monohydrate. The arrangement of the eight crystallographically independent molecules in the triclinic cell shows unusual local pseudo-symmetry. One pair of molecules is related to another by a non-crystallographic b/2 translation, while a third pair, oriented end-for-end relative to the first, is related to the fourth by a similar a/2 translation. Non-crystallographic twofold rotation symmetry relates members of the first and the third pairs. The overall structure is a stacking of bilayers of 33.9 Å total thickness. We report here that anhydrous cholesterol crystals are also triclinic, with eight independent molecules per cell. This structure offers additional insight into the packing of cholesterol molecules, and a comparison with the monohydrate structure."
https://openalex.org/W1580015947,"Pancreatic lipase and phospholipase A2 have been shown by the monomolecular film technique to be progressively inactivated when adsorbed at the interface of their respective substrates. This inactivation is faster for lipase than for phospholipase. It is also enhanced by low film pressures and film transfer. The use of radioactive phospholipase and lipase samples offered the possibility to measure the amount of enzyme adsorbed at a monomolecular film with a reasonable accuracy. This adsorption was found to be relatively slow under the conditions of the assays. The main conclusion drawn from these data is that the enzyme kinetics in presence of a substrate film, and probably also under bulk conditions, is controlled by an adsorption flux responsible for an initial lag period and an inactivation flux tending to decrease the reaction rate. The kinetics are linear only when both fluxes equilibrate."

https://openalex.org/W1507330374,"The induction of fatty acid synthetase activity in rat liver is markedly reduced by feeding a diet containing a source of linoleate. Within 48 h after changing from a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet to one containing 15% by weight of safflower oil, the specific activity of rat liver fatty acid synthetase is approximately 2-fold lower than that from rats fed a fat-free diet througout. In contrast, feeding a diet containing 15% hydrogenated coconut oil, a source of saturated fatty acids, or 5% methyl oleate for the same length of time has little effect on the activity of the enzyme. The rate of synthesis of the enzyme is reduced by safflower oil feeding from the fat-free (control) level and after 48 h is approximately one-half that of the control. The rate of degradation of fatty acid synthetase is markedly increased in the safflower oil-fed animals over the control; the half-lives are 1.8 days and 3.8 days, respectively. It is suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids, or a product derived from them, may directly or indirectly regulate the transcription or translation (or both) of fatty acid synthetase messenger RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1582357284,"Lipoprotein lipase was isolated to electrophoretic and chromatographic purity from rat heart acetone/ether powder by a combination of n-butyl alcohol precipitation and heparin/sepharose affinity column chromatography. By sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the enzyme was found to have a minimum molecular weight of about 34,000. It had a relative abundance of glutamic acid and contains 3.3 percent carbohydrate by weight. The composition was as follows, in moles per 34,000 g: mannose (neutral sugars), 5.1; sialic acid, 0.8; and glucosamine, 2.3. When tested against a triolein emulsion, the enzyme was active only in the presence of apolipoprotein glutamic acid (apo C-II); it was inactivated by 1 M NaCl and by apolipoproteins serine and alanine isolated from human serum very low density lipoprotein. In order to define the kinetics of hydrolysis of triglyceride by lipoprotein lipase, we carried out studies on monomolecular films of glyceryl tri(1-/sup 14/C)octanoate. In the presence of excess apo C-II, the hydrolysis followed first order time course and yielded a second order rate constant of 1.85 x 10/sup 5/ M/sup -1/ S/sup -1/. The apparent first order rate constants, k/sub exp/, were proportional to enzyme concentrations over atmore » least a 5-fold range. When enzyme concentrations of 0.22, 0.35, and 0.66 ..mu..g/ml were used, the rate of hydrolysis increased as a function of apo C-II concentration and reached a maximum at a concentration of apo C-II corresponding to a molar ratio of enzyme to apo C-II of about 1 : 1, respectively, which suggests the formation of a stoichiometric complex. The availability of a pure enzyme and the knowledge of its kinetics should stimulate further studies on the molecular basis of enzyme action.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1512307754,"In a system free of bile salts we measured lipase hydrolysis of 1,3-didecanoylglycerol films in the presence or absence of colipase at different surface pressures. The strong, but not absolutely specific protective effect of colipase, most visible at low surface pressure, can account for the higher enzyme activity in the presence of colipase. This can be understood by taking into account simultaneous penetration and surface inactivation fluxes. Using radioactively labeled lipase, we have shown for the first time in a bile salt-free system that the critical surface pressure above which lipase can no longer penetrate a 1,2-didodecanoylphosphatidylglycerol monlayer is around 23 dynes/cm. Colipase increased this critical surface pressure to 30 dynes/cm indicating that it enables lipase penetration between 23 and 30 dynes/cm. The transfer experiment showed that colipase acts by first penetrating the lipid film and then serving as an anchor for lipase into the film."

Interferon synthesized in the presence of partially inhibitory concentrations of 2-deoxy-D-glucose or D-glucosamine were found to differ from interferons made in control cultures in some physical properties. Interferons synthesized in the presence of either inhibitor had a diminished charge heterogeneity demonstrable by iso-electric focusing. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, control interferon activity formed a single peak with the apparent molecular weight of 20,000, whereas interferons from cultures treated with either inhibitor could be resolved into two distinct molecular weight components, one of which was smaller than the interferon synthesized in control cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1493439918,"The rate constants for reduction by dithionite of a number of metmyoglobin species Mb+X(X=H2O, imidazole, OH-, F-, N3-, CNO-, SCN-, HCO2-, NO2-, and CN-) were measured at 25 degrees by stopped flow spectrophotometry. The dependence of the rate was [S2O42-]1/2, and the SO2- radical was considered to be the active reductant. Except for X=imidazole and CN-, reduction occurred through dissociation of Mb+X. Values for the dissociative rate constant obtained from dithionite reduction were in good agreement with those obtained directly. Reduction of the dissociated fragment (assumed Mb+H2O) by SO2- is 3+/-1 X 10(6) M-1S-1 at pH 8.2 for all Mb+X species examined. Reduction of Mb+ imidazole and Mb+CN- occurs directly with SO2-, and Mb0CN- (Mb0, deoxymyoglobin) is characterized as an intermediate in reduction of the latter."

https://openalex.org/W3906723,"The nonmediated permeation of L-glucose, cytosine, and prednisolone into Novikoff rat hepatoma cells followed first order kinetics with rate constants of 0.00404, 0.173, and 2.4 min-1, respectively. The constants were estimated from a nonlinear least squares fit of the integrated first order rate equation. The rate constants were independent of substrate concentration and correlated with the partition coefficients of the substances in octanol-balanced salt solution (0.00158, 0.0352, and 17.8, respectively) and olive oil-balanced salt solution mixtures which were between 10- and 100-fold lower. Arrhenius plots for the permeation of L-glucose, cytosine, and prednisolone were linear and indicated activation energies of 24.2, 28.0, and 19.6 kcal/mol, respectively. The permeation of L-glucose and cytosine, but not of prednisolone, was impeded in a concentration-dependent manner by the presence of cytochalasin B and Persantin, heretofore thought of as specific inhibitors of facilitated diffusion processes. The relative degree of decrease of the permeation rates of L-glucose and cytosine, however, differed for cytochalasin B and Persantin."

Chem. 250, 8179-8183) that the extraction of regenerating rat liver in solutions of isotonic sucrose containing 4 mM CaCl2 leads to almost quantitative recovery of DNA polymerase alpha (Weissbach, A., Baltimore, D., Bollum, F., Gallo, R., and Korn, D. (1975) Science 190, 401--402) activity in the purified nuclear compartment. Our application of this method to the isolation of the DNA polymerase activities activities from cultured human epithelial and lymphoblastoid cells has led to substantially different results. We have observed that the inclusion of Ca2+ in either isotonic sucrose or hypotonic aqueous extraction media leads to the irreversible inactivation of the majority, cytoplasmic fraction of DNA polymerase alpha activity and is without quantitative effect on the recovery of the nuclear fraction of this activity."

The major molecular species is 120 nucleotides long; some molecules are one or two nucleotides shorter with one less nucleotide at either or both termini. When compared to other 5 S rRNAs, the sequence homology was greater with a thermophile bacterium (Bacillus stearothermophilus) than with mesophilic species. The comparisons further indicate that among prokaryotes, eleven of the nucleotide residues in T. aquaticus 5 S RNA may be largely restricted to thermophiles. Possible models for the secondary structure of T. aquaticus 5 S rRNA are discussed with respect to products of limited digestion and the unique nucleotides."

The metabolic pools between protoporphyrin and protochlorophyllide were monitored spectrofluorometrically. The incorporation of the 14C label into protochlorophyllide was also determined. It was shown that magnesium-protoporphyrin monoester, a postulated intermediate of the chlorphyll biosynthetic pathway, was convertible into protochlorophyllide with relatively high yields. Since protochlorophyllide is the immediate precursor of chlorophyll a it was concluded that magnesium-protoporphyrin monoester was indeed an intermediate of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1658883211,"Tryptophan oxygenase activity follows a characteristic developmental pattern in the young rat, being absent until about 2 weeks of life, then attaining adult levels by the 3rd week. We have investigated the factors which control this process and determined that the increase in enzymatic activity results from increased glucocorticoid release between the 14th and 21st days. This conclusion was based on our observation that adrenalectomy completely arrests the development of the enzymatic activity. Twenty-one-day-old animals which were adrenalectomized on the 10th day, and thus possess no demonstrable enzymatic activity, could respond to cortisol treatment with an elevation of tryptophan oxygenase activity. Administration of either cycloheximide or actinomycin D completely inhibited this response, suggesting that both protein synthesis and RNA synthesis were requisite for the development of the enzyme. Immunochemical studies revealed that the enzyme found in the young animal was identical with that extracted from the adult rat; furthermore, the increase in activity observed in the developing rat is the result of increased enzyme protein levels. Direct measurement of the synthetic and degradative rates showed the accumulation of enzyme protein to depend upon increased synthetic activity, and not upon decreased enzyme degradation."

https://openalex.org/W1570291740,"A mixed disulfide reagent for photolabeling is described which reacts stoichiometrically with a cysteine sulfhydryl group of rabbit muscle creatine kinase to form a new mixed disulfide between enzyme and 2-thiobenzyl[14C]diazoacetate. When irradiated at 254 nm for 5 s in a photoreactor, the enzyme-bound diazo group is destroyed, presumably via a carbene intermediate. After photolysis, the enzyme can only be 69+/-2% reactivated by dithiothreitol, and only 67+/-1% of the radiolabel can then be removed from the protein by dialysis in the presence of dithiothreitol. Less than 3% of this permanent labeling occurs if photolysis is carried out in 6 N guanidine hydrochloride, which shows that the native enzyme structure is required for photolabeling. Identification of the tagged products after acid hydrolysis indicates that 30% of the carbene produced on photolysis reacts with the hydroxyl groups of threonine andserine with O-[14C]carboxymethylthreonine as the major product. Photochemical Wolff rearrangement is estimated to occur to less than 30%, and no S-carboxymethylcysteine was detected. The reagent employed and its isomers are proposed as bifunctional photolabeling probes to scan the amino acid residues near the active sites of thiol enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W137246821,"The methyltransferase responsible for the conversion of 5-demethylubiquinone-9 to ubiquinone-9 in rat liver mitochondria has been shown to be localized in the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria. NADH was required to generate the hydroquinone, which was the immediate substrate for methylation. The Km for 5-demethylubiquinone-9 was estimated to be in the range of 60 to 80 nM and the Km for S-adenosylmethionine was found to be 22 micronM. The methyl-transferase was solubilized by Triton X-100, a procedure which inactivated the 5-demethylubiquinone-9 reductase. Dithionite was found to partially substitute for NADH in both membranous and soluble systems. Inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase were not effective inhibitors of 5-demethylubiquinone-9-methyltransferase. In addition, catechol-O-methyltransferase and 5-demethylubiquinone-9-methyltransferase were found to have reciprocal subcellular localizations. It is likely that the hydrophobic side chain of ubiquinone, added to p-hydroxybenzoate in the first biosynthetic step, is required for attachment to the lipid bilayer. This permits subsequent metabolism of the ring system by membrane-bound enzymes, including the final methylation to form ubiquinone-9."
https://openalex.org/W2058056586,"WE have embarked on a programme of toxicity tests on a range of industrial chemicals that are manufactured using boron trifluoride (BF3) as a catalyst. Although this study is still in its early stages, we feel it opportune to draw attention to the fact that in some of the samples we have detected low concentrations of fluorinated compounds, some of which merit serious toxicological concern. The most notable example we have uncovered concerns some industrial chemicals that are manufactured from ethylene oxide using BF3 as catalyst. On the basis of the results of toxicological studies of these products, we suspected fluoroacetate precursors as contaminants, and subsequent chemical analysis has confirmed the presence of low concentrations of 2-fluoroethanol and/or 2–(2–fluoroethoxy) ethanol. These two compounds are known to be very toxic to mice (LD50 10 and 15 mg kg−1 respectively) and are regarded as fluoroacetate precursors1,2. The latter is the addition product of 2-fluoroethanol and ethylene oxide (equation 1), and 2-fluoroethanol is the formal addition product of fluoride ion to ethylene oxide (equation 2)."

One of these is a disaccharide, composed of glucose and galactose, linked to hydroxylysine. It was shown to be identical to the unit (2-O-D-glucopyranosyl-O-D-galactopyranosylhydroxylyasine) present in vertebrate basement membranes, as determined from stability to alkaline hydrolysis, retention time on amino acid analyzer, chemical composition, graded acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, and periodate oxidation. Direct quantitation after alkaline hydrolysis showed the presence of 9.71 disaccharide units/1000 amino acid residues, indicating that 89% of the hydroxylysine residues of the intestinal membrane are glycosylated. The other unit, consisting of the remaining monosaccharides of the membrane, was separated from the disaccharide unit by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography of collagenase/pronase digests. Chemical analyses and molecular weight determination by thin layer gel filtration chromatography of purified glycopeptides indicated that this unit is an oligosaccharide which is composed of fucose, galactose, mannose, galactosamine, and glucosamine in a mole ratio of 1:1:1:1:2, respectively. The amount of this unit was calculated to be 2.6 units/1000 amino acid residues."
