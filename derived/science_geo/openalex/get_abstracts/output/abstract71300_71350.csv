https://openalex.org/W1991283209,Receptors responsive to the removal of carbon dioxide from ventilatory gas were demonstrated in the lungs of the chicken. Apnea was induced in 0.64 second after rapid lowering of respired carbon dioxide in the absence of blood flow through the lungs. Afferent impulses from the receptors are conducted centrally in the vagi.

The sleep produced is characterized by enhancement of synchronized electroencephalographic activity with suppression of the desynchronized phase. The result is consistent with the theory that a function of synchronized sleep is to facilitate recovery from fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W1984298549,"A specific inactivator of chymotrypsin, p-azophenyldiphenylcarbamyl chloride, exists as two geometric isomers, cis and trans, which are interconvertible by means of light. The cis-isomer is five times more reactive than the more stable trans-isomer, and is obtained by exposure of the latter to light of 320 nanometer wavelength. The trans-isomer can be regained by exposure of the cis-isomer to light of 420 nanometer wavelength. This interconversion can be made to occur in aqueous solution in the presence of the enzyme under conditions in which the trans-isomer reacts relatively slowly with chymotrypsin. Thus, it is possible to regulate the rate of inactivation of chymotrypsin by using light of the appropriate wavelength. This system is presented as a model for some of the light-sensitive metabolic systems present in living organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1967004632,Application of 2-chloroethanephosphonic acid (120 to 240 parts per million) to monoecious cucumber plants when the first true leaf was 2 centimeters in diameter has resulted in as many as 19 continuous pistillate nodes. Control of the flowering habit simplifies the production of hybrid seed and offers the possibility of enhancing cucumber yields.

This color aftereffect might imply that contour-detecting cells participate in human vision, or might simply be due to afterimages. A procedure that precludes afterimages still yields aftereffects, but sensory units less complex than edge detectors could be responsible."

https://openalex.org/W2090636648,"Lidocaine and dibucaine are more effective in neutral than in alkaline solution when tested on the nonmyelinated fibers of the desheathed vagus nerve of the rabbit. Procaine, however, is more effective in alkaline solution. The activity of benzocaine is unaffected by pH. Both the charged and uncharged forms of local anesthetics thus seem capable of blocking conduction."

https://openalex.org/W1968452583,"IT is often taken for granted that education in general, and especially scientific training1,2, can eliminate the traditional supernatural beliefs widely held in African cultures. The outcome of extensive anthropological studies in this sphere, as discussed, for example, by Horton3, lends little support to this; on the contrary, it shows that such beliefs are deeply rooted in systems of social relations. If, as has been suggested4, a magico-mythical world view is an obstacle to the emergence of creative scientists (as distinct from competent practitioners of scientific techniques), then the issue is an important one. There is some evidence regarding primary and secondary schooling5,6 which indicates that education is far less effective in this respect than is usually assumed. Little seems to be known about higher education in this context, so a study was carried out at the University of Ghana."

https://openalex.org/W1991277346,Long-term oral administration of sodium warfarin significantly reduced the incidence of spontaneous metastases in the lungs from 83 percent in controls to 8 percent in treated C57/BL/6N mice. The size and weight of primary tumors in mice treated with warfarin were less than in control mice. Length of survival was unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W2064299507,"Neutral hydrogen atoms are simple, one-electron-equivalent reagents and their reactions are of fundamental interest for chemical kinetics. Functional correlation between aromatic and divalent-sulfur amino acids in ribonuclease is shown in the reaction of ribonuclease with hydrogen atoms in aqueous solution. Products of the reaction are partially characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1963516539,"A mouse myeloma protein of the immunoglobulin A class, which specifically binds dinitrophenyl ligands, has been successfully affinity labeled (site-directed labeling) with several diazonium reagents, leading to inactivation of the combining sites. The labeling reagents reacted only with tyrosine residues of light chain origin. The 7S subunit of the myeloma protein appears to contain only one reactive site."

https://openalex.org/W1994119736,"Rats that had undergone removal of the frontal portion of the brain, including the olfactory bulbs, did not drink, or drank less than controls, when subjected to cellular dehydration. These same animals drank normally in response to extracellular volume reduction. Rats from which only the olfactory bulbs had been removed drank normally in both tests. An essential part of the neurological system mediating drinking produced by cellular dehydration, but not by volume reduction, therefore lies within the frontal cortex or immediate subcortical tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2045376711,"X-ray diffraction patterns show that the statoliths of marine mysid crustaceans are composed of fluorite, and that this mineral is also a principal phase of the gizzard plates of some tectibranch gastropods. A phosphatic phase is also indicated by chemical analyses in the gizzard plates, but its crystallochemical characterization has not been feasible by x-ray diffraction. The occurrence of fluorite in mysid statoliths confirms the earlier interpretations based on insufficient documentation. Fixation of fluorine in hard tissues of marine invertebrates is extensive in the shelf seawaters and minor in the bathyal zone of the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2059585704,Double-walled spherical particles 100 millimicrons in diameter were accidentally discovered in the cytoplasm of spiral ganglion neurons of apparently healthy guinea pigs with normal startle responses. These particles in some ways resemble viruses of the herpes group and may represent a latent form of neuronal infection.

https://openalex.org/W2043019484,"Adult human brain contains cholestanol and two series of cholesterol precursors having 30, 29, 28, and 27 carbon atoms; one has an unsaturated steroid nucleus, and the other is unsaturated in both nucleus and side chain. The ability of preparations of brain to incorporate a specific precursor into cholesterol, as well as into these sterol metabolites in vitro, indicates that cholesterol synthesis continues long after brain maturation ceases."

A dose of olive oil smaller than that used to dissolve a single injection of juvenile hormone will cause nuclear enlargement in the cells of the prothoracic gland of the desert locus and advance the succeeding molt."
