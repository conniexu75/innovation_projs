https://openalex.org/W2055677723,"The interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a cellular restriction factor that inhibits infection by influenza virus and many other pathogenic viruses. IFITM3 prevents endocytosed virus particles from accessing the host cytoplasm although little is known regarding its regulatory mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that IFITM3 localization to and antiviral remodeling of endolysosomes is differentially regulated by S-palmitoylation and lysine ubiquitination. Although S-palmitoylation enhances IFITM3 membrane affinity and antiviral activity, ubiquitination decreases localization with endolysosomes and decreases antiviral activity. Interestingly, autophagy reportedly induced by IFITM3 expression is also negatively regulated by ubiquitination. However, the canonical ATG5-dependent autophagy pathway is not required for IFITM3 activity, indicating that virus trafficking from endolysosomes to autophagosomes is not a prerequisite for influenza virus restriction. Our characterization of IFITM3 ubiquitination sites also challenges the dual-pass membrane topology predicted for this protein family. We thus evaluated topology by N-linked glycosylation site insertion and protein lipidation mapping in conjunction with cellular fractionation and fluorescence imaging. Based on these studies, we propose that IFITM3 is predominantly an intramembrane protein where both the N and C termini face the cytoplasm. In sum, by characterizing S-palmitoylation and ubiquitination of IFITM3, we have gained a better understanding of the trafficking, activity, and intramembrane topology of this important IFN-induced effector protein.

Type I interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that activate host pathways to inhibit the replication of viruses (1Müller U. Steinhoff U. Reis L.F. Hemmi S. Pavlovic J. Zinkernagel R.M. Aguet M.

Highlighting the importance of this innate system of defense, humans deficient in components of type I IFN signaling are particularly vulnerable to viral disease (2Zhang S.Y. Boisson-Dupuis S.

IFNs limit viral infections through the induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes, but the antiviral mechanism(s) for many of these genes remains to be determined (3Bogdan C.

Likewise, IFITM3 knock-out mice and humans possessing specific IFITM3 gene mutations are more susceptible to disease caused by influenza virus (9Everitt A.R. Clare S. Pertel T. John S.P. Wash R.S.

Likewise, the multitude of viruses that are inhibited and the variability in their individual proteins suggests that a general mechanism rather than a direct IFITM3/virus protein interaction mediates antiviral activity.

The molecular mechanism by which IFITMs restricts virus infection is still unclear, but additional experiments have suggested that the most active isoform, IFITM3, does not block the binding or entry of vesicular stomatitis virus (12Weidner J.M.

IFITM3 inhibits influenza A virus infection by preventing cytosolic entry.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002337Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Interestingly, incoming influenza virus colocalizes with this acidic compartment and IFITM3 and is eliminated by 6 h post-infection. These observations suggest that IFITM3 induces a degradative compartment unique from the acidified endosomes where viruses typically fuse with host membranes to deliver their contents into the cytosol for replication (14Feeley E.M. Sims J.S. John S.P. Chin C.R. Pertel T. Chen L.M. Gaiha G.D. Ryan B.J. Donis R.O. Elledge S.J. Brass A.L. IFITM3 inhibits influenza A virus infection by preventing cytosolic entry.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002337Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our previous palmitoylome profiling studies revealed that IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on three membrane proximal cysteine resides (10Yount J.S. Moltedo B. Yang Y.Y. Charron G. Moran T.M. López C.B. Hang H.C. Palmitoylome profiling reveals S-palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of IFITM3.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). An IFITM3 mutant lacking all three S-palmitoylation sites exhibited a more diffuse cellular staining pattern and significantly diminished antiviral activity, suggesting that correct membrane positioning of IFITM3 is critical for its function (10Yount J.S. Moltedo B. Yang Y.Y. Charron G. Moran T.M. López C.B. Hang H.C. Palmitoylome profiling reveals S-palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of IFITM3.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that IFITM3 is also ubiquitinated on conserved lysine residues that are important for regulating its stability, endolysosomal localization/alteration, and antiviral activity. The mapping of IFITM3 ubiquitination sites also challenged its predicted membrane topology and revealed that the N and C termini of IFITM3 are predominantly oriented toward the cytosol. Our results collectively suggest that IFITM3 is an intramembrane protein that is targeted to endocytic vesicles by S-palmitoylation in the absence of ubiquitination. Both of these posttranslational modifications strongly regulate the antiviral activity of IFITM3 and have provided new insight into its mechanism of action.

For retroviral transduction of MEFs, IFITM3-HA coding sequence was cloned into pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1 (Clontech) using BglII and BamHI restriction sites. IFNα2 was purchased from eBioscience and used at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Ambion Silencer Select predesigned and validated control and IFITM3 siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen and were transfected into MEFs using RNAiMax transfection reagent also from Invitrogen. For Western blotting, cells were lysed with Brij 97 buffer (1% Brij 97, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm TEA, pH 7.4). Western blotting was performed with anti-HA antibody (Clontech, 631207) at 1:1000. For Western analysis of GFP-LC3, anti-GFP (Clontech, JL-8) at 1:1000 was used. Anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab70699), anti-calnexin (Abcam, ab22595), anti-IFITM3 (Abcam, ab15592), and anti-ubiquitin (Covance) were also used at 1:1000 dilutions. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-HA-conjugated agarose (Sigma). Influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was propagated in 10-day embryonated chicken eggs for 40 h at 37 °C and titrated using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 for 6 h before fixation and staining. For Salmonella typhimurium infections, strain IR715 was used, and infections were performed as previously described (18Yount J.S. Tsou L.K. Dossa P.D. Kullas A.L. van der Velden A.W. Hang H.C. Visible fluorescence detection of type III protein secretion from bacterial pathogens.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 8244-8245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For both flow cytometry and microscopy, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min followed by a 10-min permeabilization with 0.2% saponin in PBS and a 10-min blocking step with 2% FBS in PBS. Cells were stained using anti-HA anti-antibody (Covance, clone 16B12) directly conjugated to Alexa-488, -555, or -647 using kits for 100 μg of antibody available from Invitrogen. Anti-NP (Abcam, ab20343) was directly conjugated to Alexa-647 using a similar kit. Likewise, anti-myc (Clontech, 631206) was conjugated to Alexa-488. All conjugated antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution in 0.2% saponin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature for both microscopy and flow cytometry. Anti-calreticulin (Abcam, ab2907) was used at a 1:1000 dilution followed by a goat anti-rabbit secondary conjugated to Alexa-488 (Invitrogen). TOPRO-3 (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS for 10 min to stain nuclei as a final step in some experiments before glass slide mounting in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were metabolically labeled for 2 h with 50 μm alk-16 or for 4 h with alk-12 or alk-FOH in DMEM supplemented with 2% charcoal filtered fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific). Cells were lysed with 1% Brij buffer (0.1 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij97, pH 7.4) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to click chemistry reactions containing 100 μm azido-rhodamine (az-Rho), 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 100 μm tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA), and 1 mm CuSO4·5H2O. In-gel fluorescence scanning was performed using a Typhoon 9400 imager (Amersham Biosciences) (excitation 532 nm, 580-nm detection filter). LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on immunoprecipitated HA-IFITM3 peptides recovered from trypsin-treated gel slices with a Dionex 3000 nano-HPLC coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher). Peptides were identified using SEQUEST Version 28 searched against the mouse (v3.45) and human (v3.56) International Protein Index (IPI) protein sequence databases with an allowance for 114 Da modifications on lysines indicative of ubiquitination. Scaffold software (Proteome Software) was used to compile data. Although IFITM3 has a predicted molecular mass of 15 kDa, Western blot analysis showed additional higher molecular mass IFITM3-specific bands (Fig. 1A). Large scale immunoprecipitation of murine HA-tagged IFITM3 (HA-IFITM3) and mass spectrometry sequencing of the recovered peptides from trypsin-digested gel slices revealed that these upper bands were indeed IFITM3. Ubiquitin was also selectively identified in the upper bands (supplemental Fig. 1A), and one site of HA-IFITM3 ubiquitination was revealed on lysine 24 (supplemental Fig. 1B). Anti-ubiquitin Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated HA-IFITM3 further confirmed that IFITM3 is modified with one, two, and three ubiquitin molecules and is also polyubiquitinated (Fig. 1A). Higher molecular weight IFITM3 species and positive anti-ubiquitin blots were also seen for endogenous IFITM3 immunoprecipitated from MEFs and DC2.4 cells (supplemental Fig. 1C). Confirming these observations, two recent global proteomic studies of ubiquitinated proteins also identified ubiquitinated peptides from endogenous IFITM3 (19Kim W. Bennett E.J. Huttlin E.L. Guo A. Li J. Possemato A. Sowa M.E. Rad R. Rush J. Comb M.J. Harper J.W. Gygi S.P. Systematic and quantitative assessment of the ubiquitin-modified proteome.Mol.

Proteome-wide quantitative survey of in vivo ubiquitylation sites reveals widespread regulatory roles.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M111 013284)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of IFITM isoforms revealed that Lys-24 and three other lysine residues are highly conserved (Fig. 1B). As our mass spectrometry analysis did not preclude ubiquitination at lysines other than Lys-24, we generated individual lysine mutants as well as IFITM3 mutants in which three of the four lysines or all four lysines (UbΔ) were mutated to alanine. The analysis of these IFITM3 lysine mutants after immunoprecipitation revealed that ubiquitination is most prevalent on Lys-24 but can also occur on Lys-83, Lys-88, and Lys-104 (Fig. 1C). The complete loss of ubiquitinated bands visualized by Western blotting could only be achieved when all four lysines were mutated to alanine (Fig. 1C). The analysis of lysine mutants using polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibodies showed that IFITM3 is ubiquitinated with Lys-48 linkages on all four lysine residues and most robustly on Lys-24 (Fig. 1D). IFITM3 is also polyubiquitinated with Lys-63 linkages on Lys-24 and possibly other lysines in the wild type protein (Fig. 1D). Extending our previous observation that HA-tagged IFITM3 constructs are S-palmitoylated, we utilized metabolic incorporation of an alkynyl-palmitic acid reporter (alk-16) followed by click chemistry labeling with az-rho and in-gel fluorescence detection to show that endogenous IFITM3 produced in IFNα-treated MEFs is palmitoylated (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined potential interplay between palmitoylation and ubiquitination. Alk-16 labeling and fluorescence gel scanning along with Western blotting showed that S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 can occur independently of ubiquitination (Fig. 2B). Similarly, IFITM3 deficient in S-palmitoylation (PalmΔ) (10Yount J.S. Moltedo B. Yang Y.Y. Charron G. Moran T.M. López C.B. Hang H.C. Palmitoylome profiling reveals S-palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of IFITM3.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) was effectively ubiquitinated (Fig. 2B), and IFITM3 that is both ubiquitinated and S-palmitoylated can be visualized by fluorescence gel scanning (Fig. 2B). Thus, these modifications occur independently and are not mutually exclusive. Membrane fractionation of IFNα-treated MEFs revealed that endogenous IFITM3 partitions to both cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, unlike calnexin, a known transmembrane protein, but like caveolin-1, which is well characterized to be an intramembrane protein partially localized to the cytosol (21Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. Characterization of a cytosolic heat-shock protein-caveolin chaperone complex. Involvement in cholesterol trafficking.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 22Parton R.G. Hanzal-Bayer M. Hancock J.F. Biogenesis of caveolae. A structural model for caveolin-induced domain formation.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Similarly, in HEK293T cells, we observed that HA-IFITM3 is primarily membrane-associated but is also present in cytoplasmic fractions at lower levels (Fig. 2D). HA-IFITM3-UbΔ behaved similarly to HA-IFITM3, whereas the PalmΔ mutant showed less partitioning into the membrane fraction compared with WT protein (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate that IFITM3 has an inherent affinity for cellular membranes that is ubiquitin-independent, but the addition of hydrophobic S-palmitoylation enhances its membrane partitioning. Given our detection of IFITM3 modification by Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin and that this is often associated with proteasomal degradation, we analyzed turnover of wild type and ubiquitination-deficient IFITM3. We took advantage of a nonradioactive pulse-chase method utilizing an alkynyl methionine surrogate, homopropargylglycine, and detection of labeled protein through click chemistry reaction with az-rho followed by in-gel fluorescence scanning. We found that although wild type HA-IFITM3 signal decayed during the 4-h chase period, HA-IFITM3-UbΔ signal was relatively stable (Fig. 2, E and F). Interestingly, significantly less homopropargylglycine was incorporated into the UbΔ mutant compared with wild type, indicating that its relative synthesis is slowed (Fig. 2E). This is in agreement with similar overall levels of WT IFITM3 and UbΔ mutant being present in cells as measured by Western blotting and flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B) and may suggest that a feedback mechanism exists regulating IFITM3 translation. Thus, although ubiquitination regulates IFITM3 stability, the UbΔ mutant is not observed at higher levels than wild type protein. Concurrent with these protein stability assays, we also performed a pulse-chase experiment using alk-16 to determine whether S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 is dynamic or irreversible. Interestingly, decay of alk-16-dependent signal was nearly identical to the turnover of wild type protein, suggesting that S-palmitoylation on IFITM3 is likely stable (Fig. 2F). Because ubiquitination, particularly Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, can control protein trafficking, we also evaluated the cellular localization of the IFITM3 ubiquitination mutant.

Lysine mutants of HA-IFITM3 colocalized with calreticulin similarly to wild type HA-IFITM3, as represented by HA-IFITM3 K24A (Fig. 3). In contrast, HA-IFITM3-UbΔ showed a distinct distribution to a perinuclear site away from calreticulin positive regions (Fig. 3). As human IFITM3 has also been reported to induce enlarged acidified compartments that stain positive for endolysosomal markers (14Feeley E.M. Sims J.S. John S.P. Chin C.R. Pertel T. Chen L.M.

Indeed, GFP-tagged LAMP1, Rab7, and Rab5 showed partial colocalization with HA-IFITM3 that was dramatically enhanced with HA-IFITM3-UbΔ (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 3). This colocalization is specific to a subset of endocytic markers as GFP-CD9 showed some colocalization with IFITM3 but did not significantly redistribute upon HA-IFITM3-UbΔ expression (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 3). Interestingly, the distribution and clustering of GFP-LC3, a marker of autophagosomes/autolysosomes, was significantly altered by HA-IFITM3 and more so by the UbΔ mutant (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting engagement of the autophagy pathway by IFITM3.

https://openalex.org/W1980239164,"The outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) is known to regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shape in addition to its mitochondrial fusion effects. However, its role in ER stress is unknown. We report here that induction of ER stress with either thapsigargin or tunicamycin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to up-regulation of Mfn2 mRNA and protein levels with no change in the expression of the mitochondrial shaping factors Mfn1, Opa1, Drp1, and Fis1. Genetic deletion of Mfn2 but not Mfn1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or cardiac myocytes in mice led to an increase in the expression of the ER chaperone proteins. Genetic ablation of Mfn2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts amplified ER stress and exacerbated ER stress-induced apoptosis. Deletion of Mfn2 delayed translational recovery through prolonged eIF2α phosphorylation associated with decreased GADD34 and p58(IPK) expression and elevated C/EBP homologous protein induction at late time points. These changes in the unfolded protein response were coupled to increased cell death reflected by augmented caspase 3/7 activity, lactate dehydrogenase release from cells, and an increase in propidium iodide-positive nuclei in response to thapsigargin or tunicamycin treatment. In contrast, genetic deletion of Mfn1 did not affect ER stress-mediated increase in ER chaperone synthesis or eIF2α phosphorylation. Additionally, ER stress-induced C/EBP homologous protein, GADD34, and p58(IPK) induction and cell death were not affected by loss of Mfn1. We conclude that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is an ER stress-inducible protein that is required for the proper temporal sequence of the ER stress response."
https://openalex.org/W1964801445,"Induction of lipogenesis in response to insulin is critically dependent on the transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). FoxO1, a forkhead box class-O transcription factor, is an important mediator of insulin action, but its role in the regulation of lipid metabolism has not been clearly defined. We examined the effects of FoxO1 on srebp1 gene expression in vivo and in vitro. In vivo studies showed that constitutively active (CA) FoxO1 (CA-FoxO1) reduced basal expression of SREBP-1c mRNA in liver by ∼60% and blunted induction of SREBP-1c in response to feeding. In liver-specific FoxO knock-out mice, SREBP-1c expression was increased ∼2-fold. Similarly, in primary hepatocytes, CA-FoxO1 suppressed SREBP1-c expression and inhibited basal and insulin-induced SREBP-1c promoter activity. SREBP-1c gene expression is induced by the liver X receptor (LXR), but CA-FoxO1 did not block the activation of SREBP-1c by the LXR agonist TO9. Insulin stimulates SREBP-1c transcription through Sp1 and via ""feed forward"" regulation by newly synthesized SREBP-1c. CA-FoxO1 inhibited SREBP-1c by reducing the transactivational capacity of both Sp1 and SREBP-1c. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that FoxO1 can associate with the proximal promoter region of the srebp1 gene and disrupt the assembly of key components of the transcriptional complex of the SREBP-1c promoter. We conclude that FoxO1 inhibits SREBP-1c transcription via combined actions on multiple transcription factors and that this effect is exerted at least in part through reduced transcriptional activity of Sp1 and SREBP-1c and disrupted assembly of the transcriptional initiation complex on the SREBP-1c promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2079955858,"Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are synthesized in specialized cell types where they largely coexist with conventional lysosomes. Most of the known cellular transport machinery involved in biogenesis are ubiquitously expressed and shared between lysosomes and LROs. Examples of common components are the adaptor protein complex-3 (AP-3) and biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex (BLOC)-2. These protein complexes control sorting and transport of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins from early endosomes to both lysosomes and LROs such as the melanosome. However, it is unknown what factors cooperate with the ubiquitous transport machinery to mediate transport to LROs in specialized cells. Focusing on the melanosome, we show that the ubiquitous machinery interacts with cell type-specific Rab proteins, Rab38 and Rab32, to facilitate transport to the maturing organelle. BLOC-2, AP-3, and AP-1 coimmunoprecipitated with Rab38 and Rab32 from MNT-1 melanocytic cell extracts. BLOC-2, AP-3, AP-1, and clathrin partially colocalized with Rab38 and Rab32 by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in MNT-1 cells. Rab38- and Rab32-deficient MNT-1 cells displayed abnormal trafficking and steady state levels of known cargoes of the BLOC-2, AP-3, and AP-1 pathways, the melanin-synthesizing enzymes tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1. These observations support the idea that Rab38 and Rab32 are the specific factors that direct the ubiquitous machinery to mediate transport from early endosomes to maturing LROs. Additionally, analysis of tyrosinase-related protein-2 and total melanin production indicates that Rab32 has unique functions that cannot be carried out by Rab38 in melanosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2031446629,"The importance of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) as effectors of metformin (Met) action on glucose uptake (GU) in skeletal muscle cells was investigated. GU in L6 myotubes was stimulated 2-fold following 16 h of Met treatment and acutely enhanced by insulin in an additive fashion. Insulin-stimulated GU was sensitive to PI3K inhibition, whereas that induced by Met was not. Met and its related biguanide, phenformin, stimulated AMPK activation/phosphorylation to a level comparable with that induced by the AMPK activator, 5-amino-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR). However, the increase in GU elicited by AICAR was significantly lower than that induced by either biguanide. Expression of a constitutively active AMPK mimicked the effects of AICAR on GU, whereas a dominant interfering AMPK or shRNA silencing of AMPK prevented AICAR-stimulated GU and Met-induced AMPK signaling but only repressed biguanide-stimulated GU by ∼20%. Consistent with this, analysis of GU in muscle cells from α1(-/-)/α2(-/-) AMPK-deficient mice revealed a significant retention of Met-stimulated GU, being reduced by ∼35% compared with that of wild type cells. Atypical PKCs (aPKCs) have been implicated in Met-stimulated GU, and in line with this, Met and phenformin induced activation/phosphorylation of aPKC in L6 myotubes. However, although cellular depletion of aPKC (>90%) led to loss in biguanide-induced aPKC phosphorylation, it had no effect on Met-stimulated GU, whereas inhibitors targeting novel/conventional PKCs caused a significant reduction in biguanide-induced GU. Our findings indicate that although Met activates AMPK, a significant component of Met-stimulated GU in muscle cells is mediated via an AMPK-independent mechanism that involves novel/conventional PKCs."
https://openalex.org/W2154193623,"The general anatomy of the cardiac conduction system (CCS) has been known for 100 years, but its complex and irregular three-dimensional (3D) geometry is not so well understood. This is largely because the conducting tissue is not distinct from the surrounding tissue by dissection. The best descriptions of its anatomy come from studies based on serial sectioning of samples taken from the appropriate areas of the heart. Low X-ray attenuation has formerly ruled out micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) as a modality to resolve internal structures of soft tissue, but incorporation of iodine, which has a high molecular weight, into those tissues enhances the differential attenuation of X-rays and allows visualisation of fine detail in embryos and skeletal muscle. Here, with the use of a iodine based contrast agent (I2KI), we present contrast enhanced micro-CT images of cardiac tissue from rat and rabbit in which the three major subdivisions of the CCS can be differentiated from the surrounding contractile myocardium and visualised in 3D. Structures identified include the sinoatrial node (SAN) and the atrioventricular conduction axis: the penetrating bundle, His bundle, the bundle branches and the Purkinje network. Although the current findings are consistent with existing anatomical representations, the representations shown here offer superior resolution and are the first 3D representations of the CCS within a single intact mammalian heart."
https://openalex.org/W2158294246,"The prognosis of breast cancer patients is related to the degree of metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which epithelial tumor cells escape from the primary tumor and colonize at a distant site are not entirely understood. Here, we analyzed expression levels of pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 (PTTG1), a relatively uncharacterized oncoprotein, in patient-derived breast cancer tissues with corresponding normal breast tissues. We found that PTTG1 is highly expressed in breast cancer patients, compared with normal tissues. Also, PTTG1 expression levels were correlated with the degree of malignancy in breast cancer cell lines; the more migratory and invasive cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT549 displayed the higher expression levels of PTTG1 than the less migratory and invasive MCF7 and SK-BR3 and normal MCF10A cell lines. By modulating PTTG1 expression levels, we found that PTTG1 enhances the migratory and invasive properties of breast cancer cells by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as evidenced by altered morphology and epithelial/mesenchymal cell marker expression patterns and up-regulation of the transcription factor Snail. Notably, down-regulation of PTTG1 also suppressed cancer stem cell population in BT549 cells by decreasing self-renewing ability and tumorigenic capacity, accompanying decreasing CD44(high) CD24(low) cells and Sox2 expression. Up-regulation of PTTG1 had the opposite effects, increasing sphere-forming ability and Sox2 expression. Importantly, PTTG1-mediated malignant tumor properties were due, at least in part, to activation of AKT, known to be a key regulator of both EMT and stemness in cancer cells. Collectively, these results suggest that PTTG1 may represent a new therapeutic target for malignant breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2070418993,"The lectin pathway is an antibody-independent activation route of the complement system. It provides immediate defense against pathogens and altered self-cells, but it also causes severe tissue damage after stroke, heart attack, and other ischemia reperfusion injuries. The pathway is triggered by target binding of pattern recognition molecules leading to the activation of zymogen mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs). MASP-2 is considered as the autonomous pathway-activator, while MASP-1 is considered as an auxiliary component. We evolved a pair of monospecific MASP inhibitors. In accordance with the key role of MASP-2, the MASP-2 inhibitor completely blocks the lectin pathway activation. Importantly, the MASP-1 inhibitor does the same, demonstrating that MASP-1 is not an auxiliary but an essential pathway component. We report the first Michaelis-like complex structures of MASP-1 and MASP-2 formed with substrate-like inhibitors. The 1.28 Å resolution MASP-2 structure reveals significant plasticity of the protease, suggesting that either an induced fit or a conformational selection mechanism should contribute to the extreme specificity of the enzyme."

Comparison with gene expression profiles of human tumor-associated macrophages showed that ATM, but not MDM resemble tumor-associated macrophages. Indirect co-culture experiments demonstrated that factors secreted by preadipocytes, but not mature adipocytes, confer an ATM-like phenotype to MDM.

https://openalex.org/W2045220267,"DiGeorge Critical Region 8 (DGCR8) is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that interacts with Drosha and facilitates microRNA (miRNA) maturation. However, the role of DGCR8 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is not well understood. To investigate whether DGCR8 contributes to miRNA maturation in VSMCs, we generated DGCR8 conditional knockout (cKO) mice by crossing VSMC-specific Cre mice (SM22-Cre) with DGCR8(loxp/loxp) mice. We found that loss of DGCR8 in VSMCs resulted in extensive liver hemorrhage and embryonic mortality between embryonic days (E) 12.5 and E13.5. DGCR8 cKO embryos displayed dilated blood vessels and disarrayed vascular architecture. Blood vessels were absent in the yolk sac of DGCR8 KOs after E12.5. Disruption of DGCR8 in VSMCs reduced VSMC proliferation and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In DGCR8 cKO embryos and knockout VSMCs, differentiation marker genes, including αSMA, SM22, and CNN1, were significantly down-regulated, and the survival pathways of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT were attenuated. Knockout of DGCR8 in VSMCs has led to down-regulation of the miR-17/92 and miR-143/145 clusters. We further demonstrated that the miR-17/92 cluster promotes VSMC proliferation and enhances VSMC marker gene expression, which may contribute to the defects of DGCR8 cKO mutants. Our results indicate that the DGCR8 gene is required for vascular development through the regulation of VSMC proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2143143063,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons. ALS is considered to be a complex trait and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated a few susceptibility loci. However, many more causal loci remain to be discovered. Since it has been shown that genetic variants associated with complex traits are more likely to be eQTLs than frequency-matched variants from GWAS platforms, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide screening for eQTLs associated with ALS. In addition, we applied an eQTL analysis to finemap association loci. Expression profiles using peripheral blood of 323 sporadic ALS patients and 413 controls were mapped to genome-wide genotyping data. Subsequently, data from a two-stage GWAS (3,568 patients and 10,163 controls) were used to prioritize eQTLs identified in the first stage (162 ALS, 207 controls). These prioritized eQTLs were carried forward to the second sample with both gene-expression and genotyping data (161 ALS, 206 controls). Replicated eQTL SNPs were then tested for association in the second-stage GWAS data to find SNPs associated with disease, that survived correction for multiple testing. We thus identified twelve cis eQTLs with nominally significant associations in the second-stage GWAS data. Eight SNP-transcript pairs of highest significance (lowest p = 1.27×10−51) withstood multiple-testing correction in the second stage and modulated CYP27A1 gene expression. Additionally, we show that C9orf72 appears to be the only gene in the 9p21.2 locus that is regulated in cis, showing the potential of this approach in identifying causative genes in association loci in ALS. This study has identified candidate genes for sporadic ALS, most notably CYP27A1. Mutations in CYP27A1 are causal to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis which can present as a clinical mimic of ALS with progressive upper motor neuron loss, making it a plausible susceptibility gene for ALS."

Prominently, the crystal structures identified a deep pocket (∼16-Å long, ∼7-Å wide, and 5–6 Å deep) in the C-terminal region of N-helices, which is formed by a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1). Three hydrophobic residues (Trp628, Trp631, and Ile635) from the pocket-binding domain (PBD) (628WMEWEREI635) of the C-helix penetrate into the NHR pocket causing an extensive interaction. It is believed that the pocket can be an ideal target site for developing novel anti-HIV therapeutics (5Chan D.C. Kim P.S.

Molecular strategies to design an escape-proof antiviral therapy.Antiviral Res. 2011; 92: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notably, these peptides have been derived primarily from residues 628 to 673 of the gp41 CHR, based on the peptide C34 sequence as a template in particular (17Steffen I. Pöhlmann S.

Peptides in the treatment of AIDS.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but little attention was drawn to the upstream sequence of the CHR. We previously found that the 621QIWNNMT627 motif located at the upstream region of the CHR, immediately adjacent to the PBD, plays critical roles for 6-HB formation and inhibition (20He Y. Cheng J. Li J. Qi Z. Lu H. Dong M. Jiang S. Dai Q. Identification of a critical motif for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 core structure. Implications for designing novel anti-HIV fusion inhibitors.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 6349-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peptide CP621–652 containing this motif could dramatically improve its thermal stability and anti-HIV activity (Fig. 1), however, the molecular determinants were poorly understood and the 621QIWNNMT627 motif lacks structural information. In our previous publication (20He Y. Cheng J. Li J. Qi Z. Lu H. Dong M. Jiang S. Dai Q. Identification of a critical motif for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 core structure. Implications for designing novel anti-HIV fusion inhibitors.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 6349-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we discussed that “a crystallographic study on the 6-HB structure formed by CP621–652 and T21 is under the way, and hopefully, this study will provide more detailed information about their interaction. In addition, mutational analyses may also reveal the residues responsible for high affinity interactions between these NHR and CHR peptides.” Here, we report the results from our proposed studies. The crystal structure of the CP621–652·T21 complex discovered that the residues Met626 and Thr627 of the 621QIWNNMT627 motif form an unusual hook-like structure (denoted as M-T hook), a structural feature that has never been observed in the large collection of 6-HB structures of the HIV gp41 core. The structural data suggests that the M-T hook is crucial for stabilizing the interaction between the pocket binding residues from the CHR and the pocket region on the NHR trimer. Our mutagenesis studies validated the importance of both M-T hook residues for the stability of the NHR-CHR interaction, for HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and virus entry, and for the anti-HIV activity of the CP621–652 peptide. A panel of peptides, including CP621–652 and its mutants M626A and T627A, T21, N36, and T20 were synthesized by a standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method in Scilight Biotechnology LLC as described previously (14He Y. Cheng J. Lu H. Li J. Hu J. Qi Z. Liu Z. Jiang S. Dai Q. Potent HIV fusion inhibitors against Enfuvirtide-resistant HIV-1 strains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16332-16337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All peptides were acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus. They were purified by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and verified for purity >95% and correct amino acid composition by mass spectrometry. Concentrations of the peptides were determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar extinction coefficients (280 nm) of 5500 and 1490 m−1 cm−1 based on the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues (all the peptides tested contain Trp and/or Tyr), respectively. The 6-HB containing the CP621–652 and T21 peptides was prepared by dissolving an equal amount (1:1 molar ratio) of peptides in the denaturing buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea). The peptides were refolded by dialysis to yield the 6-HB structure. The resulting 6-HB was purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare). The 6-HB containing CP621–652·T21 peptides were crystallized by mixing equal volumes (1 μl) of purified sample (∼10 mg/ml) and reservoir solution containing 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 30% (w/v) PEG4000. The cryocooling was achieved by soaking the crystal 30–60 s in reservoir solution containing 15% glycerol. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before x-ray diffraction experiments. Complete data were collected at the laboratory x-ray source (HighFlux HomeLabTM, Rigaku, wavelength = 1.54 Å). The crystal belonged to the space group of H32, contained one-third of a complete 6-helical bundle (one CP621–652 peptide and one T21 peptide) per asymmetry unit, and diffracted the x-ray to a resolution limit of 1.74 Å. The structures of the 6-HB were solved by molecule replacement (Phaser, CCP4 suite) using the HIV-1 gp41 core structure (Protein Data Bank code 3F4Y) as the search model. The initial electron density map was improved by manual model building (COOT) and refinement using PHENIX (21Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W.

Open table in a new tab Two of the HIV-1NL4-3 mutants carrying M626A or T627A substitutions were generated as described previously (22Chong H. Xu S. Zhang C. Nie J. Wang Y. Mutation L33M in the HR1 region of HIV-1 gp41 may play a role in T20 resistance.J. Clin. Virol. 2009; 45: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutations were created using double-stranded DNA templates and selection of mutants with DpnI. For each mutation, the two primers contained the desired mutation and occupied the same starting and ending positions on opposite strands of the plasmid DNA. DNA synthesis was carried out by PCR in a 50-μl reaction volume using 1 ng of denatured plasmid template, 50 pm upper and lower primers, and 5 units of high-fidelity thermostable polymerase PrimeStar (Takara, Dalian, China). PCR amplification was carried out for one cycle of denaturation at 98 °C for 5 min, then 18 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s and 68 °C for 15 min, followed a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplicons were treated with the restriction enzyme DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C. DpnI-resistant molecules, which were rich in the desired mutants, were recovered by transforming Escherichia coli strain DH5α to antibiotic resistance. The successful mutations were confirmed by sequencing. To evaluate the effect of mutations on HIV-1 Env-driven cell-cell fusion, a sensitive assay was adapted from our previous studies (23Bertram S.

Briefly, 293T effector cells seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells per well were transfected with the plasmid encoding HIV-1NL4-3 Env or its mutants (M626A or T627A) in combination with plasmid pGAL4-VP16, which encodes the herpes simplex virus VP16 transactivator fused to the DNA-binding domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor GAL4. In parallel, U87-CD4-CXCR4 target cells seeded in 48-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells per well were transfected with pGal5-luc plasmid, which encodes the luciferase reporter gene under control of a promoter containing five GAL4-binding sites. The day after transfection, the effector cells were added to the target cells. After co-culturing for an additional 30 h, the cells were lysed by cell culture lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured by luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). To detect the inhibitory activity of CP621–652 and its mutants, cell fusion was monitored using a reporter gene assay based on activation of the HIV LTR-driven luciferase cassette in TZM-bl (Target) cells by HIV-1 tat from HL2/3 (Effector) cells (25Wexler-Cohen Y. Johnson B.T. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. Structurally altered peptides reveal an important role for N-terminal heptad repeat binding and stability in the inhibitory action of HIV-1 peptide DP178.J.

Briefly, the TZM-bl cells were plated in 96-well clusters (1 × 104 per well) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The target cells were co-cultured with HL2/3 cells (3 × 104/well) for 6 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of a tested peptide at graded concentrations. Luciferase activity was measured using luciferase assay regents and a Luminescence Counter (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Background luminescence in TZM-bl cells was determined without addition of HL2/3 cells. The percent inhibition of fusion by the peptides and 50% inhibitory of fusion concentration (IC50) values were calculated as previously described (14He Y. Cheng J. Lu H. Li J. Hu J. Qi Z. Liu Z.

Briefly, 293T cells (5 × 106 cells in 15 ml of growth medium in a T-75 culture flask) were cotransfected with 10 μg of an Env-expressing plasmid and 20 μg of a backbone plasmid pSG3δEnv that encodes a Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Pseudovirus-containing culture supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection and filtered at 0.45-μm pore size, and stored at −80 °C in 1-ml aliquots until use. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of a single thawed aliquot of each pseudovirus batch was determined in TZM-bl cells. The antiviral activity of the peptide CP621–652 or its mutants (M626A and T627A) was determined using TZM-b1 cells. Briefly, the peptides were prepared with 10 series of dilutions in a 3-fold stepwise manner and mixed with 100 TCID50 viruses and incubated 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was added to TZM-bl cells (104/well) and incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, and luciferase activity was measured as described above. A mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the gp41 6-HB (NC-1) was obtained from Dr. Shibo Jiang through the ARRRP, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. The inhibitory activity of CP621–652 or its mutants (M626A and T627A) on 6-HB formation was measured by a modified ELISA-based method as previously described (20He Y. Cheng J. Li J. Qi Z. Lu H. Dong M. Jiang S. Dai Q. Identification of a critical motif for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 core structure. Implications for designing novel anti-HIV fusion inhibitors.J.

A tested peptide at graded concentrations was mixed with C34-biotin (0.1 μm) and incubated with N36 (0.1 μm) at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then added to the NC-1-coated plate, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min and washing with a washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) three times. Then streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen) and the substrate 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) were added sequentially. Absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed as previously described (20He Y. Cheng J. Li J. Qi Z. Lu H. Dong M. Jiang S. Dai Q. Identification of a critical motif for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 core structure. Implications for designing novel anti-HIV fusion inhibitors.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 6349-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, CP621–652 or its mutant peptides (M626A, T627A) were incubated with an equal molar concentration of the NHR-derived peptide N36 at 37 °C for 30 min. The final concentration of each peptide was 10 μm in PBS buffer, pH 7.2. The CD spectra were acquired on Jasco spectropolarimeter (model J-815) using a 1-nm bandwidth with a 1-nm step resolution from 195 to 260 nm at room temperature. The spectra were corrected by subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent. Data were averaged over three accumulations. The α-helical content was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity (θ) at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation (−33,000 degrees·cm2 dmol−1). The thermal denaturation experiment was performed by monitoring the change in ellipticity (θ) at 222 nm at the increasing temperature (20–98 °C) using a temperature controller. The temperature was increased at a rate of 1.2 °C per min; data were acquired at a 1-nm bandwidth at 222 nm at a frequency of 0.25 Hz. The melting curve was smoothened, and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values were taken as the maximum of the derivative d[θ]222/dT. The Tm value was detected at a peptide concentration of 10 μm in PBS buffer. To crystallize the CP621–652·T21 complex, we assembled the complex by mixing equal amounts of synthetic peptides pre-dissolved in denaturing buffer. The mixture was dialyzed to allow refolding. The 6-HB formed by CP621–652 and T21 was purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The crystal of CP621–652·T21 complex belonged to the space group of H32 and contained a pair of CP621–652·T21 peptides per asymmetric unit, and diffracted x-ray to a resolution limit of 1.74 Å. The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement. The finally refined atomic model has excellent refinement statistics and stereochemistry qualities (Table 1). The structure was validated by MolProbity analysis. The MolProbity score is 1.67, with a in rating 82nd percentile among structures of comparable resolution. The Ramachandran plot finds all residues in the favored area. CP621–652 and T21 peptides assemble into a typical 6-HB structure as anticipated. Three T21 helices form the central trimeric coiled-coil, whereas three CP621–652 helices wrap around the outside of T21 trimer in an antiparallel orientation (Fig. 2). In the major part of CP621–652, the peptide adopts an α-helical conformation. Interestingly, the helical conformation does not extend all the way to the N-terminal portion of the peptide. The 621QIWNNMT627 motif located upstream of the pocket-binding domain is directed away from the central NHR coiled-coil. There was insufficient electron density to model residues Gln621, Ile622, or Trp623 located at the N terminus of the peptide, indicating that this portion is relatively mobile (Fig. 2). We previously demonstrated that a conserved salt bridge between Asp632 in the CHR and Lys574 in the NHR is critical for HIV-1 entry and inhibition (26He Y. Liu S. Jing W. Lu H. Cai D. Chin D.J. Debnath A.K. Kirchhoff F. Jiang S. Conserved residue Lys574 in the cavity of HIV-1 Gp41 coiled-coil domain is critical for six-helix bundle stability and virus entry.J. Biol.

Virol. 2008; 82: 11129-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, we found two conformers for Asp632. The distance between the side chain of conformer B of Asp632 (59% occupancy) and the side chain of Lys574 is 3.95 Å, indicating a typical salt bridge. The carboxylate of conformer A of Asp632 (41% occupancy), which is oriented closer to Lys547, accepts a hydrogen bond from Nζ atom of Lys574 side chain (distance 2.01 Å, angle 137°) (Fig. 3). In addition, we found another hydrogen bond between the side chain of conformer A of Gln567 (41% occupancy) and the side chain of His643 (distance 2.06 Å, angle 149°). Collectively, these inter-helical hydrogen bonds may contribute to the binding affinity of CP621–652 to the T21 coiled-coil trimer. Regardless of the flexibility of the N-terminal portion of CP621–652 containing the 621QIWNNMT627 motif, the conformation of residues Met626 and Thr627 are well defined. As show in Fig. 4, Thr627 plays a role of terminating the α-helical conformation by rotating the dihedral angle ψ of the residue by ∼180°, so that the N terminus of CP621–652 turns away from the helical portion of the peptide. The unusual conformation of Thr627 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the side ch"

One key enzyme in the Lands' cycle is fatty acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), which utilizes lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and fatty acyl-CoA to produce various phosphatidylcholine (PC) species. Four isoforms of LPCAT have been identified. In this study we found that LPCAT3 is the major hepatic isoform, and its knockdown significantly reduces hepatic LPCAT activity. Moreover, we report that hepatic LPCAT3 knockdown increases certain species of LysoPCs and decreases certain species of PC. A surprising observation was that LPCAT3 knockdown significantly reduces hepatic triglycerides. Despite this, these mice had higher plasma triglyceride and apoB levels. Lipoprotein production studies indicated that reductions in LPCAT3 enhanced assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins. Furthermore, these mice had higher microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistic studies in hepatoma cells revealed that LysoPC enhances secretion of apoB but not apoA-I in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, LysoPC increased MTP mRNA, protein, and activity. In short, these results indicate that hepatic LPCAT3 modulates VLDL production by regulating LysoPC levels and MTP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2027891737,"Endothelial cells contain specialized storage organelles called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) that release their content into the vascular lumen in response to specific agonists that raise intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP. We have previously shown that cAMP-mediated WPB release is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) and involves activation of the small GTPase RalA. Here, we have investigated a possible role for another PKA-independent cAMP-mediated signaling pathway in the regulation of WPB exocytosis, namely the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1 and its substrate, the small GTPase Rap1. Epinephrine stimulation of endothelial cells leads to Rap1 activation in a PKA-independent fashion. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Epac1 abolished epinephrine-induced activation of Rap1 and resulted in decreased epinephrine-induced WPB exocytosis. Down-regulation of Rap1 expression and prevention of Rap1 activation through overexpression of Rap1GAP effectively reduced epinephrine- but not thrombin-induced WPB exocytosis. Taken together, these data uncover a new Epac-Rap1-dependent pathway by which endothelial cells can regulate WPB exocytosis in response to agonists that signal through cAMP.Background: Ca2+- and cAMP-raising agonists promote exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies from endothelial cells.Results: cAMP-mediated Weibel-Palade body release depends on Rap1 activation by the exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac).Conclusion: The Epac-Rap1 pathway is involved in the regulation of cAMP-mediated Weibel-Palade body release.Significance: We unraveled a new signaling cascade that regulates cAMP-mediated Weibel-Palade body exocytosis and systemic VWF levels in plasma.

Significance: We unraveled a new signaling cascade that regulates cAMP-mediated Weibel-Palade body exocytosis and systemic VWF levels in plasma. Vascular endothelial cells provide a dynamic interface between circulating blood and underlying tissues that is critically involved in maintaining vascular integrity and homeostasis. The endothelium provides a surface for adhesion and subsequent extravasation of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. In addition, vascular endothelial cells are involved in the regulation of vascular tone, contribute to neo-vascularization, and mediate the formation of a platelet plug in the event of vascular damage. Rapid recruitment of bio-active components from intracellular storage pools has been shown to contribute to the critical role of endothelial cells in maintaining vascular homeostasis. A significant number of hemostatic components and inflammatory mediators originate from endothelial cell-specific, cigar-shaped organelles called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) 2The abbreviations used are: WPBWeibel-Palade body6-Bnz-cAMP-AMN6-benzoyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, acetoxymethyl esterAKAPA-kinase anchoring proteinDDAVP1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressinEpacexchange protein activated by cAMPHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineMe-cAMP8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphateMe-cAMP-AM8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, acetoxymethyl esterMyRIPmyosin-VIIa- and Rab-interacting proteinVWFvon Willebrand factorANOVAanalysis of variance.

Following stimulation with agonists that increase intracellular Ca2+ levels, such as thrombin or histamine, WPBs fuse with the plasma membrane, thereby releasing their content onto the cellular surface or into the circulation. Also agonists such as epinephrine and vasopressin that raise intracellular levels of cAMP have been shown to promote the release of WPBs (4Kaufmann J.E. Oksche A. Wollheim C.B. Günther G.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from umbilical veins and cultured in EGM-2 medium. Stimulation of endothelial cells with thrombin or epinephrine was performed in the following manner: HUVECs, grown in 6-well plates, were washed two times with serum-free medium (SF medium: 50% M199, 50% RPMI 1640, 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin). After washing, cells were preincubated with SF medium for 1 hour. At the beginning of stimulation, the preincubation medium was replaced by SF medium containing either 1 unit/ml thrombin, a mixture of 10 μm epinephrine, and 100 μm IBMX; a mix of 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX; 1 μm Me-cAMP-AM; or 1 μm 6-Bnz-cAMP-AM. All siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific Dharmacon Products, Lafayette, CO). For siRNA-mediated knockdown of Epac1, siGENOME SMARTpool M-007676-01 RapGEF3 was used. Individual siRNA J-007676-05 (target sequence CGUGGAACUCAUGAGAUG) derived from the ON-TARGETplus Set of 4 Upgrade, human RapGEF3 (LU-007676), was used to verify the results obtained with the siGENOME SMARTpool of RAPGEF3. For siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rap1, siGENOME SMARTpool M-003623-02 (human Rap1a) and siGENOME SMARTpool M-010364-03 (human Rap1b) were used. siGENOME NonTargeting siRNA Pool 1 (D-001206-13-05) was used as a control in these experiments. siRNA (20 pmol per well of a 6-well plate) was delivered to HUVECs by transfection using Interferin (PolyPlus, Westburg, Leusden, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected HUVECs were grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips for 72 h before stimulation. The full-length Rap1GAP cDNA clone 5767775 was obtained from Open Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Open Biosystems Products, Huntsville, AL). A myc tag was inserted at the amino terminus of Rap1GAP using the following oligonucleotide primers: Fw1, AATATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTGATTGAGAAGATGCAGGGAAAGCAGGAT, and Rev1 AATGAATTCCCTGCAGGCTAACAGCCCAGCTGGGGCATGTGCTGCT. A second PCR with forward primer Fw2, AATGGATCCGCTAGCGCCACCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTGATTGAG, and Rev1 was used to introduce NheI and SbfI restriction sites that facilitated cloning in the lentiviral vector pLV-CMV (24Kootstra N.A.

Purified GST-Ras binding domain (100 μg/sample) was precoupled to a 30-μl/sample of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. The precoupled glutathione-Sepharose was then washed three times with lysis buffer containing 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, 100 nm aprotinin, supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor tablet/50 ml. Following stimulation, cells grown in 6-well plates were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer. The activated GTP-bound form of Rap1 was then isolated from cell lysates by incubation of 300 μl of lysate with GST-Ras binding domain precoupled glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the Sepharose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were run on an SDS 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting employing an anti-Rap1 polyclonal antibody.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether Epac plays a role in cAMP-mediated WPB exocytosis, we first confirmed that 1 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM (Me-cAMP-AM) promotes release of VWF (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the PKA-specific agonist 6-Bnz-cAMP-AM also induced release of VWF at a concentration of 1 μm; however, Me-cAMP-AM and 6-Bnz-cAMP-AM are less potent in the induction of VWF secretion when compared with 10 μm epinephrine and 10 μm forskolin both supplemented with 100 μm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (Fig. 1A). When Me-cAMP-AM and 6-Bnz-cAMP-AM are used in combination at a concentration of 1 μm, an additive effect can be observed that is illustrated by a statistically significant increase of VWF secretion compared to when the stimuli are used individually, suggesting a contribution of both Epac and PKA pathways in WPB release. However, the combination of Me-cAMP-AM and 6-Bnz-cAMP-AM did not reach the level of VWF secretion induced by epinephrine + IBMX. (supplemental Fig. S1A). To further substantiate the involvement of Epac in the regulated exocytosis of WPBs in endothelial cells, we used siRNA-mediated silencing of Epac1 (Fig. 1B), followed by stimulation with different agonists. Depletion of Epac1 did not notably alter the number or distribution of WPBs (supplemental Fig. S2). In the absence of Epac1, epinephrine- and forskolin-induced release of WPBs was decreased as evidenced by the decline in released VWF (Fig. 1C). In contrast, thrombin-induced release of WPBs, which is not mediated by cAMP but uses Ca2+ as a second messenger, was not affected by knockdown of Epac1 (Fig. 1C). As expected, the Me-cAMP-AM-induced VWF release was also dependent on Epac1, whereas the 6-Bnz-cAMP-AM-induced VWF release was not (Fig. 1C). Stimulation with these agonists is accompanied by changes in cytoskeletal organization. Epinephrine and Me-cAMP-AM led to an increase in cortical actin in an Epac1-dependent manner, in line with earlier reports (29Sehrawat S. Cullere X. Patel S. Italiano Jr., J. Mayadas T.N. Role of Epac1, an exchange factor for Rap GTPases, in endothelial microtubule dynamics and barrier function.Mol. Biol.

A pool of four siRNAs targeting Epac1 was used for these experiments; assessment of an individual siRNA targeting Epac1 yielded similar results (supplemental Fig. S1B). Together, our findings show that epinephrine- and forskolin-induced release of WPBs requires Epac1. Activation of the small GTPase Rap1 by Me-cAMP and forskolin in HUVEC proceeds in an Epac-dependent manner (27Cullere X. Shaw S.K. Andersson L. Hirahashi J. Luscinskas F.W. Mayadas T.N.

Corada M. Dejana E. Bos J.L. Epac1 regulates integrity of endothelial cell junctions through VE-cadherin.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4966-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To confirm that agonists are able to activate the Epac/Rap1 pathway, we performed Rap1 activity assays. Similarly as when challenged with Me-cAMP-AM (Fig. 2A) or the cAMP-elevating compound forskolin (data not shown), endothelial cells activate Rap1 when stimulated with epinephrine and IBMX (Fig. 2B); after 5 min a sustained increase in the amount of Rap1-GTP was observed. These results indicate that triggering of WPB exocytosis with the cAMP-elevating agonist epinephrine is accompanied by the activation of Rap1. As in the original study of Vischer et al. (5Vischer U.M. Wollheim C.B. Epinephrine induces von Willebrand factor release from cultured endothelial cells. Involvement of cyclic AMP-dependent signaling in exocytosis.Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 1182-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we routinely added the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX to prevent degradation of cAMP to potentiate cAMP-mediated processes (12Rondaij M.G.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). IBMX has been reported to increase intracellular cAMP in endothelial cells, and it has been shown to increase the amount of active Rap1 in several cellular systems. To test whether the cAMP rise within endothelial cells induced by IBMX alone would suffice for WPB release, we measured VWF release from endothelial cells treated for 45 min with either 100 μm IBMX, 10 μm epinephrine, or both. Only when challenged with epinephrine in combination with IBMX were we able to detect a significant increase in VWF secretion (Fig. 2E). In agreement with previous findings (5Vischer U.M. Wollheim C.B. Epinephrine induces von Willebrand factor release from cultured endothelial cells. Involvement of cyclic AMP-dependent signaling in exocytosis.Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 1182-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), IBMX on its own only induced a modest increase in WPB release, despite its ability to activate Rap1 activation (Fig. 2C). As reported previously, incubation with epinephrine alone resulted in only a modest increase in VWF release (Fig. 2E) (5Vischer U.M. Wollheim C.B. Epinephrine induces von Willebrand factor release from cultured endothelial cells. Involvement of cyclic AMP-dependent signaling in exocytosis.Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 1182-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Also under these conditions, an increase in Rap1 activation was observed (Fig. 2C). Following incubation with thrombin (1 unit/ml), a sharp but transient increase in the amount of active Rap1 (Fig. 2D) was observed, confirming earlier findings by Cullere et al. (27Cullere X. Shaw S.K. Andersson L. Hirahashi J. Luscinskas F.W. Mayadas T.N. Regulation of vascular endothelial barrier function by Epac, a cAMP-activated exchange factor for Rap GTPase.Blood. 2005; 105: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The amount of active Rap1 was maximal after 2 min of thrombin stimulation and decreased to background levels after 10 min. Currently, the identity of the exchange factor responsible for the thrombin-induced Rap1 activation in endothelial cells is unclear"
https://openalex.org/W1982541562,"Schwanniomyces occidentalis β-fructofuranosidase (Ffase) is a GH32 dimeric enzyme that releases fructose from the nonreducing end of various oligosaccharides and essential storage fructans such as inulin. It also catalyzes the transfer of a fructosyl unit to an acceptor producing 6-kestose and 1-kestose, prebiotics that stimulate the growth of bacteria beneficial for human health. We report here the crystal structure of inactivated Ffase complexed with fructosylnystose and inulin, which shows the intricate net of interactions keeping the substrate tightly bound at the active site. Up to five subsites were observed, the sugar unit located at subsite +3 being recognized by interaction with the β-sandwich domain of the adjacent subunit within the dimer. This explains the high activity observed against long substrates, giving the first experimental evidence of the direct role of a GH32 β-sandwich domain in substrate binding. Crucial residues were mutated and their hydrolase/transferase (H/T) activities were fully characterized, showing the involvement of the Gln-228/Asn-254 pair in modulating the H/T ratio and the type β(2-1)/β(2-6) linkage formation. We generated Ffase mutants with new transferase activity; among them, Q228V gives almost specifically 6-kestose, whereas N254T produces a broader spectrum product including also neokestose. A model for the mechanism of the Ffase transfructosylation reaction is proposed. The results contribute to an understanding of the molecular basis regulating specificity among GH-J clan members, which represent an interesting target for rational design of enzymes, showing redesigned activities to produce tailor-made fructooligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1902209607,"Understanding how cell cycle is regulated in normal mammary epithelia is essential for deciphering defects of breast cancer and therefore for developing new therapies. Signals provided by both the extracellular matrix and growth factors are essential for epithelial cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which adhesion controls cell cycle in normal epithelia are poorly established. In this study, we describe the consequences of removing the β1-integrin gene from primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells in situ, using CreER. Upon β1-integrin gene deletion, the cells were unable to progress efficiently through S-phase, but were still able to undergo collective two-dimensional migration. These responses are explained by the presence of β3-integrin in β1-integrin-null cells, indicating that integrins containing different β-subunits exert differential control on mammary epithelial proliferation and migration. β1-Integrin deletion did not inhibit growth factor signaling to Erk or prevent the recruitment of core adhesome components to focal adhesions. Instead the S-phase arrest resulted from defective Rac activation and Erk translocation to the nucleus. Rac inhibition prevented Erk translocation and blocked proliferation. Activated Rac1 rescued the proliferation defect in β1-integrin-depleted cells, indicating that this GTPase is essential in propagating proliferative β1-integrin signals. These results show that β1-integrins promote cell cycle in mammary epithelial cells, whereas β3-integrins are involved in migration."

Here we exploit the human pDC cell line Gen2.2 and improved pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinases to address this issue. We demonstrate that ligands that activate TLR7 and TLR9 require the TAK1-IKKβ signaling pathway to induce the production of IFNβ via a pathway that is independent of the degradation of IκBα. We also show that IKKβ activity, as well as the subsequent IFNβ-stimulated activation of the JAK-STAT1/2 signaling pathway, are essential for the production of IFNα by TLR9 ligands. We further show that TLR7 ligands CL097 and R848 fail to produce significant amounts of IFNα because the activation of IKKβ is not sustained for a sufficient length of time. The TLR7/9-stimulated production of type 1 IFNs is inhibited by much lower concentrations of IKKβ inhibitors than those needed to suppress the production of NFκB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, suggesting that drugs that inhibit IKKβ may have a potential for the treatment of forms of lupus that are driven by self-RNA and self-DNA-induced activation of TLR7 and TLR9, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2000380235,"G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) plays a crucial role in regulating heart rate and neuronal excitability. The gating of GIRK is regulated by the association and dissociation of G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ), which are released from pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein α subunit (Gα(i/o)) upon GPCR activation in vivo. Several lines of evidence indicate that Gα(i/o) also interacts directly with GIRK, playing functional roles in the signaling efficiency and the modulation of the channel activity. However, the underlying mechanism for GIRK regulation by Gα(i/o) remains to be elucidated. Here, we performed NMR analyses of the interaction between the cytoplasmic region of GIRK1 and Gα(i3) in the GTP-bound state. The NMR spectral changes of Gα upon the addition of GIRK as well as the transferred cross-saturation (TCS) results indicated their direct binding mode, where the K(d) value was estimated as ∼1 mm. The TCS experiments identified the direct binding sites on Gα and GIRK as the α2/α3 helices on the GTPase domain of Gα and the αA helix of GIRK. In addition, the TCS and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement results suggested that the helical domain of Gα transiently interacts with the αA helix of GIRK. Based on these results, we built a docking model of Gα and GIRK, suggesting the molecular basis for efficient GIRK deactivation by Gα(i/o)."
https://openalex.org/W2046557062,"In inflamed venules, neutrophils roll on P- or E-selectin, engage P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), and signal extension of integrin α(L)β(2) in a low affinity state to slow rolling on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Cytoskeleton-dependent receptor clustering often triggers signaling, and it has been hypothesized that the cytoplasmic domain links PSGL-1 to the cytoskeleton. Chemokines cause rolling neutrophils to fully activate α(L)β(2), leading to arrest on ICAM-1. Cytoskeletal anchorage of α(L)β(2) has been linked to chemokine-triggered extension and force-regulated conversion to the high affinity state. We asked whether PSGL-1 must interact with the cytoskeleton to initiate signaling and whether α(L)β(2) must interact with the cytoskeleton to extend. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of transfected cells documented cytoskeletal restraint of PSGL-1. The lateral mobility of PSGL-1 similarly increased by depolymerizing actin filaments with latrunculin B or by mutating the cytoplasmic tail to impair binding to the cytoskeleton. Converting dimeric PSGL-1 to a monomer by replacing its transmembrane domain did not alter its mobility. By transducing retroviruses expressing WT or mutant PSGL-1 into bone marrow-derived macrophages from PSGL-1-deficient mice, we show that PSGL-1 required neither dimerization nor cytoskeletal anchorage to signal β(2) integrin-dependent slow rolling on P-selectin and ICAM-1. Depolymerizing actin filaments or decreasing actomyosin tension in neutrophils did not impair PSGL-1- or chemokine-mediated integrin extension. Unlike chemokines, PSGL-1 did not signal cytoskeleton-dependent swing out of the β(2)-hybrid domain associated with the high affinity state. The cytoskeletal independence of PSGL-1-initiated, α(L)β(2)-mediated slow rolling differs markedly from the cytoskeletal dependence of chemokine-initiated, α(L)β(2)-mediated arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2092339337,"Neurodegenerative diseases share two common features: enhanced oxidative stress and cellular inability to scavenge structurally damaged abnormal proteins. Pathogenesis of polyglutamine (poly(Q)) diseases involves increased protein misfolding, along with ubiquitin and chaperon protein-containing nuclear aggregates. In spinocerebellar ataxia, the brain and retina undergo degeneration. Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) is made on-demand in the nervous system and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in response to oxidative stress, which activates prosurvival signaling via regulation of gene expression and other processes. We hypothesized that protein misfolding-induced proteotoxic stress triggers NPD1 synthesis. We used ARPE-19 cells as a cellular model to assess stress due to ataxin-1 82Q protein expression and determine whether NPD1 prevents apoptosis. Ectopic ataxin-1 expression induced RPE cell apoptosis, which was abrogated by 100 nm docosahexaenoic acid, 10 ng/ml pigment epithelium-derived factor, or NPD1. Similarly, NPD1 was protective in neurons and primary human RPE cells. Furthermore, when ataxin-1 82Q was expressed in 15-lipoxygenase-1-deficient cells, apoptosis was greatly enhanced, and only NPD1 (50 nm) rescued cells from death. NPD1 reduced misfolded ataxin-1-induced accumulation of proapoptotic Bax in the cytoplasm, suggesting that NPD1 acts by preventing proapoptotic signaling pathways from occurring. Finally, NPD1 signaling interfered with ataxin-1/capicua repression of gene expression and decreased phosphorylated ataxin-1 in an Akt-independent manner, suggesting that NPD1 signaling modulates formation or stabilization of ataxin-1 complexes. These data suggest that 1) NPD1 synthesis is an early response induced by proteotoxic stress due to abnormally folded ataxin-1, and 2) NPD1 promotes cell survival through modulating stabilization of ataxin-1 functional complexes and pro-/antiapoptotic and inflammatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2031608580,"Excessive and persistent insults during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress lead to apoptotic cell death that is implicated in a range of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers. Macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1), a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is diversely linked to the pathogenesis of cancer. To investigate the precise molecular mechanisms of MIC-1 gene regulation, ER stress and its related signals were studied in human colon cancer cells. Functionally, MIC-1 played pivotal roles in ER stress-linked apoptotic death, which was also influenced by C/EBP homologous protein, a well known apoptotic mediator of ER stress. ER stress enhanced MIC-1 mRNA stability instead of transcriptional activation, and there were two mechanistic translocations critical for mRNA stabilization. First, C/EBP homologous protein triggered protein kinase C-linked cytosolic translocation of the HuR/ELAVL1 (Elav-like RNA-binding protein 1) RNA-binding protein, which bound to and stabilized MIC-1 transcript. As the second critical in-and-out regulation, ER stress-activated ERK1/2 signals contributed to enhanced stabilization of MIC-1 transcript by controlling the extended holding of the nucleated mRNA in the stress granules fusing with the mRNA-decaying processing body. We propose that these two sequential in-and-out modulations can account for stabilized transcription and subsequent translation of pro-apoptotic MIC-1 gene in human cancer cells under ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2075120831,"The phototaxis receptor complex composed of sensory rhodopsin II (SRII) and the transducer subunit HtrII mediates photorepellent responses in haloarchaea. Light-activated SRII transmits a signal through two HAMP switch domains (HAMP1 and HAMP2) in HtrII that bridge the photoreceptive membrane domain of the complex and the cytoplasmic output kinase-modulating domain. HAMP domains, widespread signal relay modules in prokaryotic sensors, consist of four-helix bundles composed of two helices, AS1 and AS2, from each of two dimerized transducer subunits. To examine their molecular motion during signal transmission, we incorporated SRII-HtrII dimeric complexes in nanodiscs to allow unrestricted probe access to the cytoplasmic side HAMP domains. Spin-spin dipolar coupling measurements confirmed that in the nanodiscs, SRII photoactivation induces helix movement in the HtrII membrane domain diagnostic of transducer activation. Labeling kinetics of a fluorescein probe in monocysteine-substituted HAMP1 mutants revealed a light-induced shift of AS2 against AS1 by one-half α-helix turn with minimal other changes. An opposite shift of AS2 against AS1 in HAMP2 at the corresponding positions supports the proposal from x-ray crystal structures by Airola et al. (Airola, M. V., Watts, K. J., Bilwes, A. M., and Crane, B. R. (2010) Structure 18, 436-448) that poly-HAMP chains undergo alternating opposite interconversions to relay the signal. Moreover, we found that haloarchaeal cells expressing a HAMP2-deleted SRII-HtrII exhibit attractant phototaxis, opposite from the repellent phototaxis mediated by the wild-type di-HAMP SRII-HtrII complex. The opposite conformational changes and corresponding opposite output signals of HAMP1 and HAMP2 imply a signal transmission mechanism entailing small shifts in helical register between AS1 and AS2 alternately in opposite directions in adjacent HAMPs."
https://openalex.org/W1988975901,"Aberrant myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity is commonly observed with multiple cardiac diseases, especially familial cardiomyopathies. Although the etiology of the cardiomyopathies remains unclear, improving cardiac muscle Ca(2+) sensitivity through either pharmacological or genetic approaches shows promise of alleviating the disease-related symptoms. Due to its central role as the Ca(2+) sensor for cardiac muscle contraction, troponin C (TnC) stands out as an obvious and versatile target to reset disease-associated myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity back to normal. To test the hypothesis that aberrant myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and its related function can be corrected through rationally engineered TnC constructs, three thin filament protein modifications representing different proteins (troponin I or troponin T), modifications (missense mutation, deletion, or truncation), and disease subtypes (familial or acquired) were studied. A fluorescent TnC was utilized to measure Ca(2+) binding to TnC in the physiologically relevant biochemical model system of reconstituted thin filaments. Consistent with the pathophysiology, the restrictive cardiomyopathy mutation, troponin I R192H, and ischemia-induced truncation of troponin I (residues 1-192) increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of TnC on the thin filament, whereas the dilated cardiomyopathy mutation, troponin T ΔK210, decreased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of TnC on the thin filament. Rationally engineered TnC constructs corrected the abnormal Ca(2+) sensitivities of the thin filament, reconstituted actomyosin ATPase activity, and force generation in skinned trabeculae. Thus, the present study provides a novel and versatile therapeutic strategy to restore diseased cardiac muscle Ca(2+) sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2045002564,"Huntington disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the protein huntingtin (Htt). Striatal and cortical neuronal loss are prominent features of this disease. No disease-modifying treatments have been discovered for HD. To identify new therapeutic targets in HD, we screened a kinase inhibitor library for molecules that block mutant Htt cellular toxicity in a mouse HD striatal cell model, Hdh(111Q/111Q) cells. We found that diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) inhibitor II (R59949) decreased caspase-3/7 activity after serum withdrawal in striatal Hdh(111Q/111Q) cells. In addition, R59949 decreased the accumulation of a 513-amino acid N-terminal Htt fragment processed by caspase-3 and blocked alterations in lipid metabolism during serum withdrawal. To identify the diacylglycerol kinase mediating this effect, we knocked down all four DGK isoforms expressed in the brain (β, γ, ε, and ζ) using siRNA. Only the knockdown of the family member, DGKε, blocked striatal Hdh(111Q/111Q)-mediated toxicity. We also investigated the significance of these findings in vivo. First, we found that reduced function of the Drosophila DGKε homolog significantly improves Htt-induced motor dysfunction in a fly model of HD. In addition, we find that the levels of DGKε are increased in the striatum of R6/2 HD transgenic mice when compared with littermate controls. Together, these findings indicate that increased levels of kinase DGKε contribute to HD pathogenesis and suggest that reducing its levels or activity is a potential therapy for HD."

The ability to differentiate some carbohydrates from others has been suggested to represent an ancient form of pattern recognition that has evolved to discriminate self from foreign pathogen invaders. Indeed, Sp-D is an important component of the pulmonary surfactant involved in host innate immunity capable of binding most Gram-negative bacteria as well as several Gram-positive bacteria, leading to increased opsonization and killing of bacteria (14Wright J.R.

Surfactant protein D and pulmonary host defense.Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Sp-D usually binds to its ligands by a CRD-dependent cell binding requiring calcium and inhibited by several saccharides (18Crouch E.C. Surfactant protein D and pulmonary host defense.Respir.

Besides a high level of expression in the lungs, Sp-D expression has also been reported in the small and large intestinal epithelial cells of humans, pigs, rats and, to a lesser extent mice (20Akiyama J.

Heegaard P.M. Holmskov U. Purification, characterization, and immunolocalization of porcine surfactant protein D.Immunology. 2005; 114: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sp-D expression in these locations is limited to epithelial cells in contact with an environment (17Crouch E. Wright J.R. Surfactant proteins A and D and pulmonary host defense.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Sp-D function in the intestine, however, remains unknown. Surfactant protein D has been reported to bind to macrophage SIRPα (24Gardai S.J. Xiao Y.Q. Dickinson M. Nick J.A. Voelker D.R. Greene K.E. Henson P.M.

Sp-D binding to SIRPα was reported to activate SHP-1 phosphorylation leading to the inhibition of p38 activation and decreased cytokine production (24Gardai S.J. Xiao Y.Q. Dickinson M. Nick J.A. Voelker D.R. Greene K.E. Henson P.M.

However, little is known about the structural interaction of Sp-D with SIRPα and more specifically which SIRPα domain(s) binds to Sp-D. Another closely related family member, SIRPβ, shares a high degree of homology with the SIRPα ectodomain, and whether Sp-D is also capable of binding to SIRPβ has not yet been studied. Intriguingly, no ligand has been described for SIRPβ so far. SIRPβ is a cysteine-linked homodimer with three immunoglobulin-like extracellular loops. SIRPβ, however, has a very short cytoplasmic tail, and the transmembrane domain has been reported to interact with DAP12, an adaptor protein containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in human monocytic cell lines as well as in peritoneal macrophages (26Dietrich J. Cella M. Seiffert M. Bühring H.J. Colonna M. Cutting edge: signal-regulatory protein β1 is a DAP12-associated activating receptor expressed in myeloid cells.J.

DAP12 has been shown to trigger tyrosine kinase, Syk, leading to activation of MAPK (27Hayashi A. Ohnishi H. Okazawa H. Nakazawa S. Ikeda H. Motegi S. Aoki N. Kimura S. Mikuni M. Matozaki T.

Thus, SIRPβ has been proposed to function as an activating receptor promoting macrophage phagocytosis through DAP12 (27Hayashi A. Ohnishi H. Okazawa H. Nakazawa S. Ikeda H. Motegi S. Aoki N.

In this paper, using a panel of eukaryotically expressed recombinant SIRPα domains, we report that Sp-D binds to SIRPα D3 domain in a calcium- and saccharide-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that Sp-D binds to all four N-glycosylated sites within or in immediate proximity of the D3 domain of SIRPα, with strongest binding to a N-glycosylated site located at Asn-240 on SIRPα. We show that Sp-D binds to and co-localizes with SIRPα expressed on CHO-SIRPα cells as well as to human promyelocytic cells and PMNs. Given the high degree of structural similarity of SIRPα with SIRPβ, we report that Sp-D avidly binds to the D3 domain of SIRPβ which opens new interpretations to the relative contributions of SIRP proteins to the regulation of acute inflammatory responses in vivo. Recombinant human Sp-D (R&D Systems) is commercially available. The following antibodies were used in this study: monoclonal mouse anti-human Sp-D (R&D Systems) and polyclonal goat anti-human Sp-D (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against recombinant SIRPα ectodomain was produced by Covance Research Products. Monoclonal antibodies against SIRPα D1 (SAF17.2) and SIRPα D3 (SAF4.2) have been described previously (9Lee W.Y. Weber D.A. Laur O. Severson E.A. McCall I. Jen R.P. Chin A.C. Wu T. Gernet K.M.

Briefly, they were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide for 6–7 days. Human embryonic kidney cell line with T antigen (HEK293T) and wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) were purchased from ATCC. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with plasmid pcDNA3 containing the SIRPα gene corresponding to GenBank entry BC029662.1. The GenBank entry for SIRPβ constructs was NM 006065. Cells expressing the plasmid were selected with G418 and cloned. Clones stably expressing SIRPα were selected by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) as described previously (2Lee W.Y.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension using complementary PCR primers containing the mutation (32Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction.Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). Forward and reverse end primers were designed with HindIII and BamHI sites. DNA constructs encoding various ectodomains of SIRPα tagged with His10 (SIRPα-His) were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (9Lee W.Y. Weber D.A. Laur O. Severson E.A. McCall I. Jen R.P. Chin A.C. Wu T. Gernet K.M. Parkos C.A. Novel structural determinants on SIRPα that mediate binding to CD47.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7741-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Transient transfections of HEK293T cells with SIRPα plasmids were conducted using polyethylenimine (PEI) as described previously (33Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. A versatile vector for gene and oligonucleotide transfer into cells in culture and in vivo: polyethylenimine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

His10-tagged recombinant proteins such as SIRPα D1D2D3-His were purified by gravity-flow chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen). Proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE, and protein purity was assessed by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. In vitro binding assays were performed as described previously with several changes (34Liu Y. Bühring H.J. Zen K. Burst S.L. Schnell F.J. Williams I.R. Parkos C.A.

Immulon II 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml SIRPα D1D2D3-His and blocked for 1 h with 3% BSA. 2 μg/ml rhSp-D in PBS containing 0.1 g/liter CaCl2, 0.1 g/liter MgCl2 6H2O (PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+), and 9% BSA were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-human Sp-D in PBS containing Ca2+/Mg2+ and 3% BSA was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washes, 0.4 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS containing Ca2+/Mg2+ and 3% BSA was used to detect the primary antibody. Peroxidase was detected with one-step Ultra TMB ELISA (Thermo Scientific). The reaction was stopped with 1 m H2SO4, and the A405 nm was measured. CD47 inhibition of Sp-D binding to SIRPα was performed as follows. Immulon II wells were coated with SIRPα D1D2D3-His at 1 μg/ml and further incubated with supernatants of transfected CHO cells containing soluble CD47 ectodomain fused to alkaline phosphatase (CD47AP) (34Liu Y. Bühring H.J. Zen K. Burst S.L. Schnell F.J. Williams I.R. Parkos C.A. Signal regulatory protein (SIRPα), a cellular ligand for CD47, regulates neutrophil transmigration.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10028-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Sp-D binding was assessed with mAb anti-SP-D as described above. Conversely, SIRPα D1D2D3-His-coated wells were incubated with Sp-D prior to CD47AP addition, and CD47 binding was evaluated by colorimetry using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) at 405 nm. Female BALB/c mice were immunized by injecting 50 μg of purified human SIRPα D3-His emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich). Four boosts of 50 μg of SIRPα D3-His emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) were subsequently administered intraperitoneally. Serum specificity was determined by ELISA. In brief, Immulon II 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG, γ-specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and blocked as mentioned previously. 20 μg/ml rabbit Fc-tagged SIRPα proteins were then added to the well before incubation with mouse anti-D3 serum diluted 1:1000. Detection was performed by adding 0.4 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, light chain-specific (Jackson Laboratories). Color was developed by ABTS (Sigma-Aldrich) and read at 405 nm. To further determine serum specificity, and more specifically, CD47 binding in the presence of the anti-D3 serum, microtiter wells were coated with 0.5 μg/ml SIRPα D1D2D3 ectodomain overnight followed by incubation with a 1:25 dilution of anti-SIRPα D3 serum or comparable amounts of normal control serum. Cell culture supernatant containing soluble CD47AP was added to the wells. CD47 binding was further measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Serum inhibition binding assays were performed similarly. Coated SIRPα proteins were incubated with sera. Sp-D binding was detected with 1 μg/ml polyclonal goat anti-human Sp-D and 0.4 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), followed by Ultra TMB ELISA. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (9Lee W.Y. Weber D.A. Laur O. Severson E.A. McCall I. Jen R.P. Chin A.C. Wu T. Gernet K.M. Parkos C.A.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 7741-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using 5% Western blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science). Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Bio-Rad) membrane was incubated with mAbs anti-SIRPα (SAF17.2 or SAF4.2) and the addition of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated to peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and revealed by Western blotting chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). Far Western blotting was carried out according to a previously described procedure with slight modifications (35Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. Surfactant proteins A and D bind CD14 by different mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 500 ng of denatured SIRP proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with a binding/blocking buffer (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 5% BSA) for 3–4 h and incubated overnight at room temperature in binding/blocking buffer containing 5 μg/ml rhSp-D. Sp-D bound to the membrane was further detected with 0.1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-human Sp-D and 0.4 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG followed by chemiluminescence. 500 ng of denatured His-tagged SIRPα protein was incubated with 200 units/ml N-glycosidase F from Elizabethkingia miricola (Sigma-Aldrich) in a buffer containing 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 1.2% Nonidet P-40 overnight at 30 °C. To remove O-glycosylated carbohydrates, SIRPα was incubated with 250 milliunits/ml neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (Roche Applied Science) and 125 milliunits/ml O-glycosidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, overnight at 37 °C. Human PMNs were freshly isolated from healthy donors as described previously (36Mackarel A.J. Russell K.J. Ryan C.M. Hislip S.J. Rendall J.C. FitzGerald M.X. O'Connor C.M. CD18 dependency of transendothelial neutrophil migration differs during acute pulmonary inflammation.J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2839-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, blood was subjected to density gradient centrifugation with Polymorphprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). Remaining erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic lysis. PMN activation was induced with 0.2 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with 3 μg/ml rhSp-D in either DMEM containing 9% BSA (for CHO cells) or RPMI with 3% BSA (for suspension cells) for 2 h at room temperature and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 40 min at room temperature. A permeabilization step of 0.1% Triton X-100 in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing CaCl2 (HBSS+) for 10 min at room temperature was included when nucleus staining was applied. After a blocking step, cells were incubated with primary antibodies. SIRPα ectodomain was stained with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human SIRPα serum and Sp-D by monoclonal mouse anti-human Sp-D before to be subsequently labeled with 2 μg/ml secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained using 0.1 μm To-Pro3-iodide (Invitrogen) in HBSS+ (15 min at room temperature). Suspension cells were mounted in 1:1 (v/v) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and were visualized on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). The statistical method used to analyze results was a Student's t test with two-tailed distribution using GraphPad Prism software. Results are expressed in mean ± S.E. To determine which extracellular domain(s) is involved in Sp-D binding, mutant proteins containing various domains were generated and expressed in HEK293T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028781640,"Amyloid β-precursor protein (APP) is primarily cleaved by α- or β-secretase to generate membrane-bound, C-terminal fragments (CTFs). In turn, CTFs are potentially subject to a second, intramembrane cleavage by γ-secretase, which is active in a lipid raft-like membrane microdomain. Mature APP (N- and O-glycosylated APP), the actual substrate of these secretases, is phosphorylated at the cytoplasmic residue Thr668 and this phosphorylation changes the overall conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of APP. We found that phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CTFs exist equally in mouse brain and are kinetically equivalent as substrates for γ-secretase, in vitro. However, in vivo, the level of the phosphorylated APP intracellular domain peptide (pAICD) generated by γ-cleavage of CTFs was very low when compared with the level of nonphosphorylated AICD (nAICD). Phosphorylated CTFs (pCTFs), rather than nonphosphorylated CTFs (nCTFs), were preferentially located outside of detergent-resistant, lipid raft-like membrane microdomains. The APP cytoplasmic domain peptide (APP(648–695)) with Thr(P)668 did not associate with liposomes composed of membrane lipids from mouse brain to which the nonphosphorylated peptide preferentially bound. In addition, APP lacking the C-terminal 8 amino acids (APP-ΔC8), which are essential for membrane association, decreased Aβ generation in N2a cells. These observations suggest that the pCTFs and CTFΔC8 are relatively movable within the membrane, whereas the nCTFs are susceptible to being anchored into the membrane, an interaction made available as a consequence of not being phosphorylated. By this mechanism, nCTFs can be preferentially captured and cleaved by γ-secretase. Preservation of the phosphorylated state of APP-CTFs may be a potential treatment to lower the generation of Aβ in Alzheimer disease.

Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is a causative peptide of AD and is believed to show toxicity to neurons by forming oligomers (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated from the amyloid β-precursor protein (APP), which is a type I membrane protein composed of three major spliced isoforms, APP770, APP751, and APP695, with APP695 being expressed exclusively in neurons (2Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller-Hill B.

Brain Res. 1997; 47: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). APP is primarily cleaved by either non-amyloidogenic α-secretase or amyloidogenic β-secretase at the juxtamembrane region, with a secondary cleavage by γ-secretase in the transmembrane domain. APP cleavage by the combination of β- and γ-secretases generates Aβ, whereas that of the combination of α- and γ-secretases generates an amyloidolytic (non-amyloidogenic) product (4Thinakaran G. Koo E. Amyloid precursor protein trafficking, processing, and function.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29615-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of APP amyloidogenic cleavages and its associated Aβ generation or facilitation of the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP are thought to potentially be useful therapies for AD (5Aydin D. Weyer S.W. Müller U.C. Exp. Brain Res. 2012; 217: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Alzheimer disease amyloid β-protein APP intracellular domain peptide amyloid β-precursor protein C-terminal fragment of APP truncated at primary α- or β-cleavage site detergent-resistant membrane presenilin mature APP immature APP methyl-β-cyclodextrin 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine phosphorylated C-terminal fragment nonphosphorylated C-terminal fragment APP phosphorylated at Thr668. Cleavage of APP by β-secretase generates a large N-terminal sAPPβ fragment and a short, membrane-associated C-terminal fragment, CTFβ, whereas the cleavage by α-secretase occurs within the Aβ domain and generates sAPPα and CTFα. Both amyloidogenic CTFβ and non-amyloidogenic CTFα are subsequently cleaved by the γ-secretase complex composed of nicastrin (NCT), presenilin enhancer 2 (pen-2), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH-1), and presenilin 1 or 2 (PS1 or PS2) (6Steiner H.

Following endoproteolysis to generate its N- and C-terminal fragments, presenilin forms the catalytic site of the γ-secretase complex. Both PS1 and PS2 are linked, along with APP, to causative genes for familial AD (FAD) (7De Strooper B. Annaert W.

Over 150 FAD mutations in PS1 and PS2 that increase the generation of pathogenic types of Aβ species are known (8De Strooper B. Loss-of-function presenilin mutations in Alzheimer disease. Talking point on the role of presenilin mutations in Alzheimer disease.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Sporadic AD also shows a similar pathogenic process but is associated with later onset and has no mutation(s) in the causative APP and PS genes. This points to other sources in the sporadic AD brain, which alter the APP processing. It is known that some of the APP-interacting proteins regulate the APP metabolism, including Aβ generation. Dysfunction of and/or aberrant regulation by these APP-interacting proteins may alter the APP metabolism without mutations in causative genes (9Saito Y. Sano Y. Vassar R. Gandy S. Nakaya T.

Post-translational modifications of APP are also involved in the regulation of APP function and metabolism. APP is subject to N-glycosylation (immature APP or imAPP) in the endoplasmic reticulum and the imAPP is further modified with O-glycosylation in the Golgi complex. The mature APP (mAPP), with both N- and O-glycosylation, localizes to the late protein secretory pathway in which mAPP is cleaved by secretases (4Thinakaran G. Koo E.

Regulation of amyloid β-protein precursor by phosphorylation and protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29633-29637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mAPP is further modified by phosphorylation, also occurring in the late secretory pathway. Phosphorylation of mAPP at Thr668 (numbering for APP695 isoform) in the cytoplasmic region is predominantly observed in neurons in the brain (13Iijima K. Ando K. Takeda S. Satoh Y. Seki T. Itohara S. Greengard P. Kirino Y. Nairn A.C. Suzuki T. Neuron-specific phosphorylation of Alzheimer β-amyloid precursor protein by cyclin-dependent kinase 5.J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both neurite outgrowth of differentiating PC12 cells and interaction of APP with a neural adaptor FE65 protein are affected by the phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 (14Ando K. Oishi M. Takeda S.

Role of APP phosphorylation in Fe65-dependent gene transactivation mediated by AICD.Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 plays an important role in the expression and/or regulation of APP function (11Suzuki T. Nakaya T. Regulation of amyloid β-protein precursor by phosphorylation and protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29633-29637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, the role of the phosphorylation in APP metabolism is controversial. Mutant mice possessing Ala substitution for Thr668 of APP did not show significant differences in APP metabolism, including Aβ generation, when compared with the wild-type mouse brain (17Sano Y. Nakaya T. Pedrini S. Takeda S. Iijima-Ando K. Iijima K. Mathews P.M. Itohara S. Gandy S. Suzuki T. Physiological mouse brain Aβ levels are not related to the phosphorylation state of threonine 668 of Alzheimer APP.PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This analysis would suggest that the phosphorylation state of APP at Thr668 does not play an obvious role in the direct governing of the APP metabolism in the brain in vivo. However, contrary to this observation, several reports have indicated that phosphorylation of Thr668, or amino acid substitutions mimicking phosphorylated Thr, could regulate the cleavage by γ-secretase in cultured cells (18Liu F. Su Y. Li B. Zhou Y. Ryder J. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P. May P.C. Ni B.

Phosphorylation of APP695 at Thr668 decreases γ-cleavage and extracellular Aβ.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of phosphorylation at Thr668 to induce alterations in the cleavage of APP at β- and/or γ-secretase sites is still controversial in AD brains. The phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 can likely induce a change in the overall structure of its cytoplasmic domain because Thr668 is located in the 667VTPEER672 motif, which forms a type I β-turn and amino-terminal helix-capping box structure to stabilize its carboxyl-terminal helix structure (24Ramelot T.A. Gentile L.N. Nicholson L.K.

Nicholson L.K. Phosphorylation-induced structural changes in the amyloid precursor protein cytoplasmic tail detected by NMR.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The usual procedure to explore the function of phosphorylation of a protein is to mimic the phosphorylation state by amino acid substitutions of Asp or Glu for the appropriate Thr and Ser residues (26Tomita S. Stein V. Stocker T.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity regulated by phosphorylation of stargazin-like TARPs.Neuron. 2005; 45: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, this strategy might not be suitable in the case of APP phosphorylation as the substitution of Asp for Thr668 did not alter the carboxyl-terminal helix state as remarkably as did phosphorylation of Thr668 (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, substitution with Ala668 for Thr668 of APP is found to effectively mimic the nonphosphorylated state in the helix structure of the APP cytoplasmic domain (supplemental Fig. S1) and in localization and metabolism of APP in the brain (17Sano Y. Nakaya T. Pedrini S. Takeda S. Iijima-Ando K. Iijima K. Mathews P.M. Itohara S. Gandy S. Suzuki T. Physiological mouse brain Aβ levels are not related to the phosphorylation state of threonine 668 of Alzheimer APP.PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, to reveal the role of APP phosphorylation at Thr668, we carefully examined the phosphorylation state of both APP and APP metabolic fragments in the brain, in vivo. Furthermore, because the phosphorylation state of the CTFs is higher than that of mAPP, we focused on the features of the phosphorylated forms of the CTFs as regards to their susceptibility to γ-secretase cleavage and lipid binding, in vitro. Finally, we analyzed the age-dependent changes of the phosphorylation state of CTFβ in cynomolgus monkey brain in which amyloid plaque formation has progressed in an age-dependent manner (27Kimura N. Tanemura K. Nakamura S. Takashima A. Ono F. Sakakibara I. Ishii Y. Kyuwa S. Yoshikawa Y. Age-related changes of Alzheimer disease-associated proteins in cynomolgus monkey brains.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of APP (APPcyt) was inserted into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare) at the EcoRI/BamHI sites to produce a GST fusion protein (28Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. Interaction of a neuron-specific protein containing PDZ domains with Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein.J. Biol.

The cDNA encoding APPcyt ΔC8 (APP(649–687), a cytoplasmic domain of APP695 lacking C-terminal 8 amino acids) was produced by PCR and cloned into pGEX4T-1. pcDNA3-FLAG-APP695 was described (14Ando K. Oishi M. Takeda S. Iijima K. Isohara T. Nairn A.C. Kirino Y. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Role of phosphorylation of Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein during neuronal differentiation.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare pcDNA3-FLAG-APPΔC8, the cDNA in pcDNA3-FLAG-APP695 was amplified by PCR using specific primers. The PCR products were digested with HindIII/XbaI and cloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All of the animal studies were conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Studies Committee of Hokkaido University, Shiga University of Medical Science, and the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation. The C57BL/6 line of mice housed in an SPF environment were used throughout these studies. Brain samples of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) were obtained from the Shiga University of Medical Science and the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation. Monkeys were housed in individual cages and maintained according to guidelines for experimental animal welfare. Membrane fractions were prepared from brains of wild-type mice (C57BL/6, 4 months old) as described (16Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Role of APP phosphorylation in Fe65-dependent gene transactivation mediated by AICD.Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To dephosphorylate proteins, membrane lysates (30 μg of protein) were treated with λ-protein phosphatase (400 unit; Sigma) for 4 h at 30 °C. The immunoblotting procedure was described previously (17Sano Y. Nakaya T. Pedrini S. Takeda S. Iijima-Ando K. Iijima K. Mathews P.M. Itohara S. Gandy S. Suzuki T. Physiological mouse brain Aβ levels are not related to the phosphorylation state of threonine 668 of Alzheimer APP.PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, for detection of APP CTFs, membrane lysate proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 17.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide Tris-Tricine gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with anti-APP C-terminal A8717 (Sigma) or G369 (30Oishi M.

Immunoreactants were further reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (GE Healthcare) and detected with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Proteins were separated by a standard SDS electrophoresis with 8 (w/v) or 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide Tris glycine gel and detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies; PS1 N-terminal Ab14 (31Thinakaran G.

Gandy), PS1 C-terminal (Chemicon), pen-2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and GST (Upstate Biotechnology). The protein band intensities detected by ECL were quantified with an imaging analyzer, VersaDoc (Bio-Rad). Cynomolgus monkey brain lysates were prepared from frozen stocks of temporal cortices. The tissue blocks were homogenized in a 10-fold volume of a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 μm microcystin-LR (Wako Pure Chemical) and then lysed by sonication in ice. The resulting supernatant was used for immunoblot analysis with mouse monoclonal anti-Tau HT7 (Thermo Scientific) and anti-phosphorylated Tau AT8 (Ser(P)202 and Thr(P)205, Innogenetics) antibodies, along with immunoblotting with anti-APP C-terminal A8717 (Sigma), anti-phosphorylated APP (Thr(P)668, Cell Signaling), and anti-actin (Chemicon) antibodies. APP CTFs detected by immunoblotting with anti-APP C-terminal and anti-pAPP antibodies were quantified with VersaDoc (Bio-Rad). The values of phosphorylated C99 (pC99) CTFβ were set to 1.0 and the level of the other CTF species are defined as a ratio to that of pC99. In practice, we estimated the ratio of CTFs using the following calculations: pC99:nC99:pC89:(pC83 + nC89):nC83 = 1:a:b:c:d, these ratios being determined by immunoblotting with anti-C-terminal antibody, and pC99:pC89:pC83 = 1:b:e, these ratios being determined by immunoblotting with anti-pAPP antibody. Therefore, the relative ratios of all six CTFs were expressed as: pC99:nC99:pC89:nC89:pC83:nC83 = 1:a:b:(c-e):e:d. Data were obtained from three independent experiments. The levels of phosphorylated (pCTFs) and nonphosphorylated CTFs (nCTFs) were combined and indicated as total levels of CTFs. Wild-type C57BL/6 mouse (4 months old) brains were suspended in 5 volumes of buffer H (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) including a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 μm microcystin LR. The suspension was then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer on ice. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitated membrane fraction (P100) was suspended in the same buffer, including a protease-inhibitor mixture and 1 μm microcystin LR, and used as the mouse brain membrane preparation. Aliquots (25 μg of protein) of the mouse brain membrane preparation were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, as described (32Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y.

Samples were then separated by electrophoresis in Tris-Tricine gels (17.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide). The separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, boiled in PBS for 5 min, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Reactive proteins were detected using an ECL plus detection system (GE Healthcare). Detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions were prepared according to the established DRM isolation procedure (9Saito Y. Sano Y. Vassar R. Gandy S. Nakaya T. Yamamoto T. Suzuki T.

Briefly, the brain membrane preparation from each mouse (3 months old) was homogenized in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% (v/v) CHAPSO, a protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 μm microcystin-LR. The sucrose concentration of the extract was adjusted to 42.5% (w/v) by the addition of 85% sucrose in TNE buffer; the extract was then placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 5 (4 ml) and 35% (4 ml) discontinuous sucrose gradients in TNE buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 20 h with an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top (fraction 1) of the ultracentrifuge tubes and proteins in the respective fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. The primary culture of cortical neurons was as described (9Saito Y. Sano Y. Vassar R. Gandy S. Nakaya T. Yamamoto T. Suzuki T.

Briefly, the cortex of mice at embryonic day 15.5 was dissected, and neurons were spread in a buffer containing papain and cultured at 1.5 × 105 cells in Neurobasal medium containing B27, Glutamax, and antibiotics (Invitrogen) on a poly-d-lysine-treated dish. Neurons at in vitro day 7 were incubated with Neurobasal medium containing MβCD for 2 h. After incubation, neuronal membrane fractions (P100) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The membrane preparation was used for the in vitro γ-secretase assay and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The labeling of membrane cholesterol in neurons (in vitro day 7) was investigated by microscopy analysis using the cholesterol cell-based detection assay kit including Filipin III (Cayman Chemical). Lipids were extracted with chloroform/ethanol mixtures from brain membrane preparations of C57BL/6 mouse and evaporated using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator to prepare a lipid film. The lipid film was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and agitated to prepare liposomes (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar). The brain-lipid liposomes were incubated with the indicated peptide in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and peptide bound to liposomes was recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min as described (34Sumioka A.

Briefly, GST fusion proteins were generated in Escherichia coli BL21 transformed with pGEX-4T-1 cDNA constructs and affinity purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The cytoplasmic peptides of APP(648–695), with or without phosphate at the Thr668 residue, Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) peptides (for sELISA standard) were synthesized using solid phase N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry.

To study the function of this signaling protein in inflammatory disorders, a homologous recombination approach was used to create a RasGRP4-null C57BL/6 mouse line. The resulting transgenic animals had normal numbers of MCs in their tissues that histochemically and morphologically resembled those in WT C57BL/6 mice. MCs could also be generated from RasGRP4-null mice by culturing their bone marrow cells in IL-3-enriched conditioned medium. Despite these data, the levels of the transcripts that encode the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α were reduced in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated MCs developed from RasGRP4-null mice. Although inflammation was not diminished in a Dermatophagoides farinae-dependent model of allergic airway disease, dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis was significantly reduced in RasGRP4-null mice relative to similarly treated WT mice. Furthermore, experimental arthritis could not be induced in RasGRP4-null mice that had received K/BxN mouse serum.

RT-quantitative PCR, RNA blot, and immunohistochemical data revealed that RasGRP4 is expressed in mature mouse and human MCs and their circulating progenitors. At the cellular level, the RasGRP4 transcript was detected in all examined mouse MC lines. Based on the accumulated data, RasGRP4 is expressed relatively early in developing MCs, and this signaling protein continues to be expressed in MCs as they differentiate and undergo granule maturation in tissues. Because human mononuclear phagocytes and MCs originate from a common CD34+ progenitor (7Valent P. Ashman L.K. Hinterberger W. Eckersberger F. Majdic O. Lechner K. Bettelheim P. Mast cell typing: demonstration of a distinct hematopoietic cell type and evidence for immunophenotypic relationship to mononuclear phagocytes.Blood. 1989; 73: 1778-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the failure to detect immunoreactive RasGRP4 protein in macrophages suggests that this intracellular signaling protein ceases to be expressed when circulating multipotential CD34+ progenitors become mature macrophages in tissues.

Immunogold ultrastructural studies of the in vivo differentiated MCs in the V3 mastocytosis mouse revealed that RasGRP4 tends to reside either in the cytoplasm or on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane (4Li L. Yang Y. Wong G.W. Stevens R.L. Mast cells in airway hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice express a unique isoform of the signaling protein Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 that is unresponsive to diacylglycerol and phorbol esters.J.

Subcellular fractionation studies of RasGRP4-expressing transfectants (3Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Šali A. Stevens R.L.

We therefore concluded that an intracellular factor or post-translational modification event regulates the movement of RasGRP4 from the cytoplasm to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Activation of MCs often results in the generation of diacylglycerol, and the transient production of this intracellular lipid has been linked to various signaling events in MCs. RasGRP4 possesses a 50-mer domain in its C-terminal half that closely resembles a 50-mer domain in PKC that recognizes phorbol esters and diacylglycerol. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of fibroblast transfectants that were forced to express RasGRP4 resulted in morphologic changes in the resulting cells (3Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W.

Our finding that experimental arthritis and colitis were significantly reduced in these transgenic mice relative to WT controls reveals for the first time a prominent role for this signaling protein in certain inflammatory disorders. The RasGRP4 gene (GenBankTM accession number 233046) (4Li L. Yang Y. Wong G.W. Stevens R.L. Mast cells in airway hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice express a unique isoform of the signaling protein Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein-4 that is unresponsive to diacylglycerol and phorbol esters.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) resides on mouse chromosome 7B1 downstream of the Ryr1 gene and upstream of the Spred3 gene. Using genomic DNA from C57BL/6 mice and oligonucleotides based on the genomic sequence of the chromosomal locus at GenBankTM accession number NC_000073, a PCR approach was carried out to obtain the RasGRP4-specific nucleotide sequences for the targeting vector noted in Fig. 1A. Employing the translation initiation site of the RasGRP4 transcript as a reference point (defined here as residue +1), a 2498-bp 5′-homology arm (nucleotides −2497 to 0) was cloned into the BglII-HindIII sites of the pKO-Scrambler NTK-1907 plasmid (Stratagene) downstream of the phosphoglucokinase promoter-driven neomycin resistance gene (PGK-Neo). A 3508-bp 3′-homology arm (corresponding to nucleotides +10916 to +14424) was then cloned into the SacII-SalI sites upstream of PGK-Neo. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cDNA driven by a mutant polyomavirus enhancer (MC1-TK) was used for negative selection. The linearized targeting vector was electroporated into C57BL/6 ES cells that were grown in the presence of neomycin and gancyclovir. Surviving ES cell clones that underwent homologous recombination were identified by DNA blot analysis of XmnI-digested genomic DNA hybridized with a radiolabeled 0.9-kb probe corresponding to a nucleotide sequence outside the targeting construct just downstream of the 3′-homology arm. Selected ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6J-Tyrc-2j/J blastocysts, which were then implanted into pseudopregnant CD-1 foster mothers. The resulting male chimeric mice were crossed with C57BL/6J-Tyrc-2j/J females, and non-albino pups from this animal cross were screened for germ line transmission of the mutant RasGRP4 allele. Genomic DNA was isolated from proteinase K-digested mouse tails. RasGRP4+/+, RasGRP4+/−, and RasGRP4−/− mice were identified using the PCR genotyping approaches noted in Fig. 1. We used a primer set (P1/P2) flanking the 3′-homology arm to confirm homologous recombination while backcrossing with WT C57BL/6 mice for nine generations to dilute the effects of possible non-homologous recombination and other genomic alterations. After that, we used the P3 (5′-CGGTAGTGGGCATAGTTGTTG-3′)/P4 (5′-TGCCTCTTTGTGTGTTCATATTC-3′)/P5 (5′-TTCCATTTGTCACGTCCTGCAC-3′) 3-mer primer set at a ratio of 1.0:0.75:0.25 in a PCR with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s and a final extension time of 5 min. The resulting RasGRP4-null C57BL/6 mice were housed in isolated barrier animal facilities of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Taconic (Germantown, NY). Mice from the latter colony were transported into the animal facility at the Brigham and Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where they were allowed to acclimate for at least 1 week prior to any experiment. Mice were maintained on LabDiet 5001 (Purina, St. Louis, MO) and water. All animal studies were carried out using protocols approved by our institutions' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. After euthanasia with CO2, 10 ml of PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity of each mouse and then aspirated. The resulting lavage fluid was centrifuged at 450 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet obtained was resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. For cell analysis, the number of nucleated cells in 10 μl of each lavage fluid was counted using a Neubauer chamber. For differential counts, 100-μl cytospin samples were Wright-Giemsa-stained. For flow cytometry, 5 × 104 cells were incubated with 200 ng of phycoerythrin-Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse Kit/CD117 and 200 ng of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse FcϵRIα (eBioscience) antibodies in 100 μl of PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The labeled cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and analyzed in a four-laser LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The number of CD117+/FcϵRIα+ cells and their mean fluorescence intensity at the emission ranges of the fluorophores were recorded because the obtained data should be proportional to the amount of the two receptors expressed on the surfaces of the MCs. For electron microscopy, 5 × 104 cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2) for 2 h and then in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. After washing in double-distilled H2O, the cells were pelleted and embedded in 3% agarose. They were dehydrated through an acetone series to 100% before being placed in EMbed 812 epoxy resin. 80-nm sections (RMC MT-7000 ultramicrotome) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The cell profiles were visualized using a Tecnai 12 electron microscope, and photographs of 30–35 nucleated peritoneal MCs were taken from each section. Morphometric analyses were performed using unbiased stereology techniques. The granule volume fraction (fraction of the total volume of the cell occupied by granules) and surface density (directly proportional to the membrane surface per unit of volume, a measurement of cell and granule shapes) were measured using the point-counting method in a cycloid grid, and the cell profile area (proportional to the volume of the cell) was measured using a point grid. Ears were excised, fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.0), dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Avidin binds strongly to the heparin-containing serglycin proteoglycans in the secretory granules of MCs (9Kett W.C. Osmond R.I. Moe L. Skett S.E. Kinnear B.F. Coombe D.R. Avidin is a heparin-binding protein. Affinity, specificity, and structural analysis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1620: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 5-μm cross-sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, incubated with FITC-avidin and Hoechst (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 25 °C, and then mounted with Fluoromount (Diagnostic BioSystems). Images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope with a triple-fluorescence filter (DAPI, GFP, and Texas Red). Taking advantage of the autofluorescence of the cartilage and muscle observed in the red channel, we used the Image-Pro Plus software package to delineate the dermis of the ears as the tissue between the epidermal layers, excluding all muscle and cartilage. All dermal FITC-avidin-positive cells with a Hoechst-positive nucleus were counted. Results are expressed as the number of mature MCs/mm2 of dermis. After euthanasia with CO2, harvested bone marrow cells from the femora and tibiae of WT and RasGRP4-null mice were cultured for ∼6 weeks in medium supplemented with recombinant mouse IL-3 (5 ng/ml; R&D Systems) or IL-3-enriched WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium as described previously (1Razin E. Ihle J.N. Seldin D. Mencia-Huerta J.M. Katz H.R. LeBlanc P.A. Hein A. Caulfield J.P. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Interleukin-3: a differentiation and growth factor for the mouse mast cell that contains chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycan.J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1479-1486PubMed Google Scholar). To follow their development, aliquots of 5 × 104 non-adherent cells in the culture were analyzed at different time intervals by flow cytometry as described above. The proportion of CD117+/FcϵRIα+ cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of each fluorophore were determined. mBMMCs (1 × 106, 6 weeks old) were also lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100, and their histamine content was determined by ELISA (Oxford Biomedical Research). Although WT mBMMCs constitutively express mouse MC protease (mMCP)-5 and mMCP-6, these cells can be induced to express numerous cytokines and chemokines when exposed to PMA or calcium ionophore A23187. Thus, for the PMA stimulation studies, 106 WT and RasGRP4-null mBMMCs were placed in separate 24-well culture dishes containing 1.2 ml of 50% WEHI-3-conditioned medium. 3 days later, PMA was added to a final concentration of 125–250 ng/ml. The treated cells were exposed to PMA for 40–120 min. The resulting cells were centrifuged, and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate the RNA in each sample, which was then converted into cDNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Using Qiagen validated primers sets and a Stratagene Mx3000P PCR machine, standard quantitative PCR approaches were carried out to determine the relative levels of the transcripts that encode GAPDH, mMCP-5, mMCP-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 in the samples. WT and RasGRP4-null mBMMCs also were exposed to calcium ionophore A23187 (2–8 μm; Sigma) for 30 min as described previously (10Razin E. Mencia-Huerta J.M. Lewis R.A. Corey E.J. Austen K.F.

Some of the treated cells were used to measure the net percent release of the granule constituent β-hexosaminidase (11Robinson D. Stirling J.L. N-Acetyl-β-glucosaminidases in human spleen.Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from the remainder of the untreated and calcium ionophore-treated mBMMCs for quantitative PCR analysis. Pulmonary inflammation was induced in age- and sex-matched WT and RasGRP4-null mice by intranasal instillation of 3 μg of D. farinae house dust mite extract (GREER Laboratories, Inc., Lenoir, NC) in 20 μl of 0.9% NaCl twice a week for 3 weeks as described previously (12Giannattasio G.

Control mice received only 0.9% NaCl. 24 h after the last treatment, the mice were killed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with three aliquots of 0.7 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 10% FCS and 0.5 mm EDTA. The cells in the BAL fluids were counted; cytocentrifuged onto glass slides; stained with Diff-Quick (Fisher), and differentially tallied as macrophages/monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, or eosinophils. Male WT and RasGRP4-null mice (8 weeks old) were exposed to a 1.5% solution of DSS (36–50 kDa; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) in their drinking water for 7 days as described previously (14Okayasu I. Hatakeyama S. Yamada M. Ohkusa T. Inagaki Y. Nakaya R.

Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Earlier studies revealed that exposure of WT mice to DSS for 7 days caused an ∼10–15% weight loss with minimal mortality but substantial inflammation as measured by histology at day 9. Mice therefore received an additional 2 days of regular drinking water before they were killed at day 9. The colons of the treated and untreated mice were then harvested, and the lengths were measured. The tissue was fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The histopathology was evaluated and blindly scored using a 20-point scoring system (16Garrett W.S. Lord G.M. Punit S. Lugo-Villarino G. Mazmanian S.K. Ito S. Glickman J.N. Glimcher L.H.

Arthritogenic K/BxN mouse serum containing autoantibodies against glucose-6-phosphate isomerase was administered to recipient WT and RasGRP4-null mice as described previously (17Lee D.M. Friend D.S.

To induce arthritis, each mouse received 75 μl of K/BxN mouse serum intraperitoneally diluted to a final volume of 150 μl with LPS-free PBS on experimental days 0 and 2. Before and 30 min after the initial injection, paw swelling was measured using a spring-loaded caliper as described (19Nigrovic P.A. Malbec O. Lu B. Markiewski M.M. Kepley C. Gerard N. Gerard C.

Thereafter, clinical indices were recorded at 48-h intervals and graded on a scale of 0–12. Ankles were harvested as described previously (20Shin K. Gurish M.F. Friend D.S. Pemberton A.D.

Briefly, the skin around each ankle was gently removed, and the tissue from the distal one-third of the tibia to the mid-paw was collected. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, ankles were decalcified in Kristensen's solution, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Midsagittal ankle sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological grading of synovial inflammation and cartilage and bone erosion in the ankle sections was performed as described previously (21Shin K. Watts G.F. Oettgen H.C. Friend D.S. Pemberton A.D.

The normal distribution of the samples was confirmed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test before comparing means by Student's two-tailed paired t test or series by analysis of variance. Using a homologous recombination approach and the targeting construct shown in Fig. 1, an inbred transgenic C57BL/6 mouse line was created that lacked the RasGRP4 transcript in its MCs. Despite the evolutionary conservation of the RasGRP4 gene for >75 million years, RasGRP4-null mice were viable and had no obvious developmental defect. RasGRP1 is essential for the final stages of T cell development in mice (22Dower N.A. Stang S.L. Bottorff D.A. Ebinu J.O. Dickie P. Ost"

Non-cleaved channels are inactive at high extracellular Na+ concentrations and fully cleaved channels are constitutively active. Cleavage of the α and γ subunits at multiple sites activates the channel through the release of imbedded inhibitory tracts. Peptides derived from these released tracts are also inhibitory, likely through binding at the inhibitory tract sites. We recently reported a model of the α subunit. We have now cross-linked Cys derivatives of the inhibitory peptide to the channel, using our model to predict sites at a domain interface of the α subunit that is in proximity to the N terminus of the peptide. Furthermore, peptide inhibition was mimicked in the absence of peptide by cross-linking the channel across the domain interface. Our results suggest a dynamic domain interface that can be exploited by inhibitory peptides and provides a mechanism for peptide inhibition and proteolytic activation.

ASIC1 is homotrimeric, and the extracellular region of each subunit has three peripheral helical domains (termed the thumb, finger, and knuckle) surrounding two central β sheet domains (termed palm and β-ball) that form the core of the structure. Our model placed the bound peptide at the finger-thumb domain interface, suggesting that this domain interface changes conformation upon gating. Motions around this interface were correlated with twisting motions in the pore in normal mode analysis calculations performed on both ASIC1 (14Yang H. Yu Y. Li W.G. Yu F. Cao H. Xu T.L. Jiang H.

To test our model of inhibitory peptide binding, we attempted to cross-link Cys derivatives of the peptide to the channel using bifunctional methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds. We found that sites at the finger-thumb interface crosslink to the N terminus of the peptide but not the C terminus. We also found sites in the finger domain further from the finger-thumb interface that cross-link to the C terminus of the peptide but not the N terminus. In probing the mechanism of peptide inhibition, we found that cross-linking adjacent sites at the thumb-finger interface trapped the channel in a low activity state. Our data suggest a dynamic finger-thumb interface. Narrowing the interface transitions the channel to a low activity state, providing a mechanism for peptide inhibition and proteolytic ENaC activation. cDNAs for wild type mouse ENaC α, β, and γ subunits in pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used as templates for point mutations and to synthesize cRNAs. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Targeted mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. cRNAs were prepared from corresponding cDNAs using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX). cRNA concentrations were determined spectroscopically. cRNA size was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocytes were isolated from adult female Xenopus laevis (NASCO, Plant City, FL) using a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. ENaCs were expressed in stage V–VI X. laevis oocytes by injecting 1 ng of cRNA per subunit. Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). All experiments were performed at ambient temperatures (21–23 °C) 20–30 h following cRNA injection. All peptides were synthesized and HPLC-purified by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ), and were modified by N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation. Oocytes were mounted in a 20-μl recording chamber (AutoMate Scientific, Berkeley, CA) and perfused at a flow rate of 3–5 ml/min using a high Na+ bath solution (110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Electrophysiological measurements were performed using a GeneClamp 500B voltage clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), Clampex software (Axon Instruments). Perfusion was controlled by an eight-channel pinch valve perfusion system (AutoMate Scientific). Stock solutions of peptide, MTS compounds, and amiloride were prepared for dilution into the high Na+ bath solution. Peptides were dissolved in water at 10 mm, whereas amiloride and uncharged MTS compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 100 and 10 mm, respectively. Uncharged MTS stock solutions were diluted into the aqueous high Na+ bath solution immediately preceding each experiment and used within 5 min of mixing. Solutions of charged 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) and 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) at 1 mm in high Na+ bath solution were prepared from dry powder immediately before each experiment. p values were determined by a one-way ANOVA followed a Newman-Keuls post hoc test performed with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) or by a Student's t test performed with Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Values of p < 0.01 were considered significant. To identify inhibitory peptides for use in cross-linking experiments, we assessed the ability of Cys derivatives of the inhibitory peptide Ac-LPHPLQRL-amide to inhibit ENaC. The parent peptide has an apparent affinity of 0.9 μm (8Carattino M.D. Passero C.J. Steren C.A. Maarouf A.B. Pilewski J.M. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R.

We tested several Cys derivatives: two 9-mers with a Cys added to either end of the parent sequence and five 8-mers with a Cys substitution at interior positions. We found that adding Cys to either the N terminus (N-Cys) or C terminus (C-Cys), or substituting position 6 with Cys had modest effects on peptide inhibition of ENaC currents (Table 1).

We hypothesized that selected sites near the N terminus of the peptide will cross-link to N-Cys but not to C-Cys. Our model places residues 170–175 and 281–285 of the finger and 473–477 of the thumb near the N terminus of the bound inhibitory peptide (Fig. 1A). We recently showed that N-Cys can be cross-linked to E174C but not E173C (11Kashlan O.B. Adelman J.L. Okumura S. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Grabe M.

We mutated each of the remaining sites to Cys and attempted to cross-link these mutants to both N-Cys and C-Cys using bifunctional MTS compounds with alkanediyl linkers of various lengths. We denote these compounds as MTS-n-MTS, where n indicates the number of carbon atoms between MTS groups. We co-expressed wild type and mutant ENaC α subunits with wild type β and γ subunits and measured their currents in a 110 mm Na+ bath using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. We found that MTS-n-MTS compounds irreversibly inhibited ENaC currents in the absence of inhibitory peptide and that the ENaC pore blocker amiloride attenuated this effect. We therefore labeled channels with 10 μm MTS-n-MTS in the presence of 20 μm amiloride (Fig. 1B). After a wash to establish base-line current, we added either 10 μm N-Cys or 10 μm C-Cys and allowed sufficient time (2 min) for peptide inhibition and reaction with MTS labeled channels. Peptides were then removed from the bath, and the reversibility of peptide inhibition was determined. Wild type channels exhibited an 80–90% reversibility of inhibition with either peptide after labeling with each of the MTS reagents tested (Fig. 1C). Mutant channels showed similar near-complete reversibility for inhibition with C-Cys after treatment with MTS compounds (Fig. 1, C, E, and F). In contrast, N-Cys inhibition was less reversible for several mutants. This effect was dependent on the ENaC Cys mutant and the length of the cross-linker. We interpreted a reduction of inhibition reversibility with a given MTS-n-MTS compound as a specific N-Cys/ENaC mutant crosslink if reversibility was lower than that for C-Cys with the same mutant and for either peptide with wild type ENaC. Of the sites tested in the thumb α4–α5 loop, Cys substitutions at 473–477 each cross-linked to N-Cys (Fig. 1C). Except for Y474C, successful cross-linking depended on the length of the alkanediyl linker of the MTS compound. Of the sites 170–175 at the N terminus of helix α1, we previously examined MTS-4-MTS cross-linking of N-Cys and C-Cys to Cys introduced at Glu-173 and Glu-174 (11Kashlan O.B. Adelman J.L. Okumura S. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Grabe M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data provided evidence for cross-linking between E174C and N-Cys but not cross-linking involving E173C. Here, we also found that D171C cross-linked to N-Cys in a linker length-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). This is consistent with residues at positions 171 and 174 facing the same side on a helix near the N terminus of the bound peptide. We also tested Cys substitutions at sites 281–285 (Fig. 1F). Of these, only I284C cross-linked N-Cys. Our model places Tyr-474 adjacent to the N terminus of the bound peptide. As Y474C/N-Cys cross-linking was not linker length-dependent, we hypothesized that Y474C and N-Cys may be able to form a disulfide bond. We added N-Cys to oocytes expressing Y474C in the absence of pretreatment with MTS compounds (Fig. 1D). Upon removal of peptide from the bath, reversal of inhibition was incomplete (29 ± 8%, n = 7). We repeated the experiment but supplemented the post-peptide wash with the reducing agent DTT. This treatment resulted in complete reversal of N-Cys inhibition of Y474C (99 ± 19%, n = 6, p < 10−5 versus absence of DTT by unpaired Student's t test). In the absence of peptide inhibition, treatment with DTT alone modestly stimulated ENaC currents (19 ± 11%, n = 4). These results suggest that Y474C and N-Cys spontaneously form a disulfide bond. Using the same logic as above, we hypothesized that sites near the C terminus of the peptide may cross-link to C-Cys but not to N-Cys. Our model positions residues 166–169, 250–251, and 269–270 of the finger near the C terminus of the bound inhibitory peptide (Fig. 2A). We mutated each site to Cys and assessed the ability of MTS-n-MTS compounds to cross-link C-Cys and N-Cys to the channel using the protocol described above (Fig. 1B). We interpreted our data as evidence of a specific C-Cys/ENaC mutant cross-link in a manner analogous to that for Fig. 1. We found linker length-dependent C-Cys cross-linking to residues S269C and S270C preceding helix α2 (Fig. 2C). We did not report results for E167C and K250C due to poor functional expression in oocytes. These data are consistent with the bound peptide depicted in our α ENaC model (11Kashlan O.B. Adelman J.L. Okumura S. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Grabe M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Namely, (i) that the peptide assumes an extended conformation in the bound state, (ii) that the N terminus of the bound peptide lies at the interface of the finger and thumb domains comprised of the 171/174 face of helix α1, the α4–α5 loop of the thumb, and the C-terminal half of helix α2 (Fig. 1), and (iii) that the C terminus of the bound peptide lies near the N terminus of helix α2 (Fig. 2A). We previously proposed that the 8-mer peptide inhibits ENaC current by damping motions near the finger-thumb interface that are associated with potential gating motions in the pore (11Kashlan O.B. Adelman J.L. Okumura S. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Grabe M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This hypothesis of peptide inhibition builds upon the proposal by Jasti and colleagues (12Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Structure of acid-sensing ion channel 1 at 1.9 Å resolution and low pH.Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), which speculated that relative motions between the finger and thumb domains induced by ligand binding transduce conformational changes through the thumb domain to the pore. Residues D171C of the finger and Y474C of the thumb clearly form cross-links to N-Cys (Fig. 1, C and E), suggesting that these are neighboring residues (Fig. 3A). We hypothesized that we could recapitulate the inhibitory effect of peptide binding, in the absence of peptide, by cross-linking D171C and Y474C. Preliminary experiments examining the effect of MTS-2-MTS on currents from wild type channels showed a slow time-dependent inhibition of ENaC current that was DTT-insensitive (Fig. 3B). When we examined the effect of MTS-2-MTS on currents from the D171C,Y474C double mutant, we observed a biphasic (rapid followed by a slow phase) inhibition of ENaC current that was partially DTT-sensitive. The slow phase of inhibition for the double mutant was similar to the inhibition time course for wild type. Furthermore, the rapid phase of double mutant inhibition was paralleled by a lag phase for wild type. To kinetically separate these effects, we performed experiments in which we added MTS-2-MTS for 15 s, corresponding to the fast inhibitory phase, followed by a 30-s wash and subsequent DTT addition (Fig. 3C). Under these conditions, MTS-2-MTS induced a DTT-sensitive inhibition of ENaC currents for the double mutant that was greater than that for wild type or for either the D171C or Y474C single mutants (Fig. 3, C and D). This effect required a bifunctional compound, as DTT-sensitive inhibition was less when using the comparable monofunctional MTS-2 (Fig. 3D). We also observed a length requirement, as we observed a significant effect with the methanediyl, ethanediyl, and propanediyl bis-MTS compounds but not with the bifunctional butanediyl and pentanediyl compounds. These data suggest that alkanediyl linkers with three or fewer carbons sufficiently constrain the distance between D171C and Y474C at the finger-thumb interface to induce channel closure, whereas longer linkers do not. However, we cannot discriminate between the possibilities that the longer linkers insufficiently constrain this interface to influence channel Po or that the longer linkers do no react with both introduced Cys residues. The longer linkers were active in our assays as DTT-insensitive inhibition generally increased with the length of the linker (see supplemental Table 1). Based on our finding that constraining the finger and thumb domains to a tight conformation resulted in channel inhibition, we predicted that pushing them apart would increase currents. We tested our hypothesis using electrostatics. Helix α1 in our model spans residues 170–187 and hosts seven residues bearing carboxylate groups and one Arg. Using the Y474C mutant, we tested whether adding a positively or negatively charged group to the α4–α5 loop in the thumb domain would change channel current. Upon addition of positively charged MTSET, currents decreased rapidly (Fig. 4A). The loss of current was sustained after MTSET was removed, suggesting a covalent modification. Finally, DTT reversed the effect of MTSET, consistent with a covalent modification at the introduced Cys. These data reinforce the notion that a tight finger-thumb domain interface is synonymous with channel inhibition. Upon addition of negatively charged MTSES, currents also decreased. Current reduction was sustained following MTSES removal, suggesting covalent modification. But in contrast to MTSET, DTT did not reverse the effect of MTSES. As reported by others, we found that neither MTSET nor MTSES affected wild type ENaC currents. We were able to inhibit channel currents using MTS reagents to cross-link the finger and thumb domains. We also were able to reproduce this effect using electrostatics. In each case, we found that currents were reduced by 50% or less. It is possible that either a fraction of the channels were cross-linked resulting in channels unable to open or that nearly all of the channels were cross-linked, resulting in channels with a reduced Po. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we added MTS-2-MTS in three 15-s pulses separated by 30-s intervals to D171C,Y474C mutant channels. In the former case, we predict that additional pulses of MTS-2-MTS would inhibit channels further. In the latter case, we predict that additional MTS-2-MTS pulses would have little effect. We found that the first pulse reduced ENaC currents by 35%, and that the second and third pulses reduced ENaC currents by a further 4 to 6% each (Fig. 5A). Similar experiments performed with wild type ENaC resulted in a 6–7% change in current with each MTS-2-MTS pulse. These data are consistent with the notion that a tight conformation at finger-thumb interface is associated with a lower Po but not exclusively associated with the closed state of the channel. Our α ENaC model places the N terminus of the inhibitory 8-mer peptide at the finger-thumb interface, and its C terminus near the beginning of helix α2, far from the finger-thumb interface (11Kashlan O.B. Adelman J.L. Okumura S. Blobner B.M. Zuzek Z. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Grabe M. Constraint-based, homology model of the extracellular domain of the epithelial Na+ channel α subunit reveals a mechanism of channel activation by proteases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cross-linking data are clearly consistent with this model of inhibitory peptide binding. We hypothesized that the peptide draws the finger and thumb together in the peptide bound state, which is inhibitory. Peptide release frees the finger and thumb to move, allowing the channel to more readily assume an open conformation. This idea is supported by our demonstration that cross-linking D171C and Y474C across the finger-thumb interface reduces channel activity. These sites were selected because they each cross-linked with the N-Cys peptide and were in close proximity in our α ENaC model. The inhibitory effect of cross-linking D171C and Y474C demonstrated a length requirement, suggesting that linkers with three or fewer carbons sufficiently constrained the finger-thumb interface to favor the closed channel conformation. Longer linkers either did not cross-link or allowed sufficient mobility at the interface so as to have little effect. We also reproduced the cross-linking effect by placing opposing charges at this interface. Taken together, these data are the first experimental evidence of movement between the finger and thumb domains of ENaC and show that such rearrangements affect channel gating. The stabilization of a specific conformation at a dynamic domain interface provides a mechanism for the allosteric inhibition of ENaC by peptides. We propose that proteolytic ENaC activation functions in an analogous manner by releasing a constraint at the finger-thumb interface. In all of our experiments designed to constrain movements between the α4–α5 loop of the thumb domain and helix α1 of the finger domain, we never observed >50% inhibition despite saturating the effect of the MTS reagent. We draw two important conclusions from this observation. First, the gate does not change its conformation in a lockstep mechanism with the finger-thumb interface. Cross-linked channels still transition between closed and open states but likely exhibit a lower Po than their non-cross-linked counterparts. Second, the 26-mer and 8-mer peptides derived from the 206–231 inhibitory tract also inhibit ENaC through additional mechanisms. We conclude this based on the fact that each peptide can achieve 80–90% inhibition at saturation. Our model postulates extensive interactions between the peptide and other parts of the finger domain, which suggests additional structures have a role in peptide inhibition. Our data link dynamic changes at the finger-thumb interface to functional changes at the channel gate. Although we were able to inhibit the channel by exploiting this interface, we were not able to stimulate the channel. We attempted to stimulate ENaC currents by introducing like charges at the interface. Modification of Y474C channels with MTSES led to reduced channel activity, which was an unexpected result. Furthermore, DTT did not reverse the effect of MTSES, in contrast to its effect on MTSET-modified Y474C channels. It is possible that MTSES modification led to a change in the conformation of the α4–α5 loop that prevented DTT access to the modified Cys at position 474. Alternatively, MTSES modification led to misfolding of the α4–α5 loop that could not be reversed even after MTSES modification was reversed by DTT. We speculate that rather than pushing helix α1 and the α4–α5 loop apart, MTSES modification of Y474C led to a non-reversible thumb loop conformational change that reduced channel currents. The thumb domains of the ENaC/degenerin family of ion channels are poorly conserved yet share two important features: two predicted helices and 10 absolutely conserved Cys that form a five-disulfide bond ladder (12Jasti J.

These hallmark features of ENaC/degenerin channels suggest that the antiparallel arrangement of the two thumb helices in ASIC1 is widely conserved. In the ASIC1 structure, the thumb connects to the palm near the opening of the pore and extends up from the membrane toward the finger. The thumb also interacts with the β-ball and finger of the same subunit and the palm of a neighboring subunit. Our data suggests that the 8-mer inhibitory peptide exploits the finger-thumb interface to stabilize the channel in the closed conformation. Recent data suggest that Cl−, which inhibits ENaC, binds at the thumb-palm intersubunit interface (16Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. Extracellular chloride regulates the epithelial sodium channel.J. Biol.

It remains to be determined whether the relative finger-thumb movements also involve the thumb-palm intersubunit interface. Furthermore, it is unclear whether inhibitory peptides, Cl−, and other extracellular allosteric inhibitors (e.g. Na+) recruit the same allosteric machinery but use different sites to trigger conformational changes. The rigidity implied by the presence of five disulfide bonds in the thumb suggests that movement at any thumb interdomain interface will induce movement at other thumb interdomain interfaces. We reported recently that mutations in the thumb near the outer mouth of the pore modulated the efficacy of multiple extracellular stimuli, suggesting mechanistic convergence (18Shi S. Ghosh D.D.

As ENaC/degenerin channels have evolved to respond to numerous extracellular stimuli, the basic architecture of the thumb domain seems to have been preserved. In this work, we found evidence for movement at a finger-thumb interface where an inhibitory peptide binds. Influencing interdomain interfaces that involve the thumb may be a general mechanism for extracellular ligand gating among ENaC/degenerin channels. We thank Michael Grabe for helpful discussions.

TLP stimulated expression of several growth-related genes including p21 (p21Waf1/Cip1). TLP-mediated activation of the p21 upstream promoter in cells was shown by a promoter-luciferase reporter assay. The p53-binding sequence located in the p21 upstream promoter and p53 itself are required for TLP-mediated transcriptional activation. TLP and p53 bound to each other and synergistically enhanced activity of the upstream promoter. TLP specifically activated transcription from the endogenous upstream promoter, and p53 was required for this activation. Etoposide treatment also resulted in activation of the upstream promoter as well as nuclear accumulation of TLP and p53. Moreover, the upstream promoter was associated with endogenous p53 and TLP, and the p53 recruitment was enhanced by TLP.

The regions critical for the conformational change of PrP remain mostly debated and the extent of sequence change acceptable for prion conversion is poorly documented. To achieve progress on these issues, we applied a reverse genetic approach using the Rov cell system. This allowed us to test the susceptibility of a number of insertion mutants to conversion into prion in the absence of wild-type PrP molecules. We were able to propagate several prions with 8 to 16 extra amino acids, including a polyglycine stretch and His or FLAG tags, inserted in the middle of the protease-resistant fragment. These results demonstrate the possibility to increase the length of the loop between helices H2 and H3 up to 4-fold, without preventing prion replication. They also indicate that this loop probably remains unstructured in PrPSc. We also showed that bona fide prions can be produced following insertion of octapeptides in the two C-terminal turns of H2. These insertions do not interfere with the overall fold of the H2-H3 domain indicating that the highly conserved sequence of the terminal part of H2 is not critical for the conversion. Altogether these data showed that the amplitude of modifications acceptable for prion conversion in the core of the globular domain of PrP is much greater than one might have assumed. These observations should help to refine structural models of PrPSc and elucidate the conformational changes underlying prions generation.

https://openalex.org/W1979681119,"Rat septal cells, induced to enter a terminal differentiation-like state by temperature shift, produce prion protein (PrP) levels 7x higher than their proliferative counterparts. Host PrP accumulates on the plasma membrane, newly elaborated nanotubes, and cell-to-cell junctions, important conduits for viral spread. To find if elevated PrP increased susceptibility to FU-CJD infection, we determined agent titers under both proliferating and arresting conditions. A short 5 day arrest and a prolonged 140 day arrest increased infectivity by 5x and 122x (>2 logs) respectively as compared to proliferating cells. Total PrP rapidly increased 7x and was even more elevated in proliferating cells that escaped chronic arrest conditions. Amyloid generating PrP (PrP-res), the “infectious prion” form, present at ∼100,000 copies per infectious particle, also increased proportionately by 140 days. However, when these highly infectious cells were switched back to proliferative conditions for 60 days, abundant PrP-res continued to be generated even though 4 logs of titer was lost. An identical 4 log loss was found with maximal PrP and PrP-res production in parallel cells under arresting conditions. While host PrP is essential for TSE agent spread and replication, excessive production of all forms of PrP can be inappropriately perpetuated by living cells, even after the initiating infectious agent is eliminated. Host PrP changes can start as a protective innate immune response that ultimately escapes control. A subset of other neurodegenerative and amyloid diseases, including non-transmissible AD, may be initiated by environmental infectious agents that are no longer present."
https://openalex.org/W2886765649,"Phospholipids undergo extensive remodeling by the Lands’ Cycle after de novo biosynthesis. Enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis have been studied extensively but not those involved in remodeling. One key enzyme in the Lands’ Cycle is fatty acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) which utilizes lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and fatty acyl-CoA to produce various phosphatidylcholine (PC) species. Four isoforms of LPCAT have been identified. We found, in this study, that LPCAT3 is the major hepatic isoform and its knockdown significantly reduces hepatic LPCAT activity. We also found that adenovirus-shRNA-mediated LPCAT3 knockdown in mice significantly increases different LysoPC with 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2 fatty acids and reduces certain PC species in the liver. More importantly, LPCAT3 knockdown significantly reduces hepatic triglyceride levels but induces plasma triglyceride and apoB levels. Lipoprotein production studies indicated that LPCAT3 deficiency enhanced triglyceride-rich apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Further, the knockdown mice had significantly higher microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistic studies in hepatoma cells revealed that LysoPC enhances secretion of apoB but not apoA-I in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, LysoPC increased MTP mRNA, protein, and activity levels. In short, these results indicate that hepatic LPCAT3 modulates VLDL production by regulating LysoPC levels and MTP expression."

Does the SS have a role in dictating the conformation and function of the protein as well? Methodology/Principal Findings We generated two variants of the Als5 protein without and with the SS in order to address the above question. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, we show that in the case of Als5, an adhesin of C. albicans, the C-terminal deletion of 20 amino acids (SS) results in a significant alteration in conformation and function of the mature protein. Conclusions/Significance We propose that the locking of the conformation of the precursor protein in an alternate conformation from that of the mature protein is one probable strategy employed by the cell to control the behaviour and function of proteins intended to be GPI anchored during their transit through the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2063510672,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a pathophysiologic condition characterized by hypoxemia and right ventricular strain. Proliferation of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells is central to the pathology of PH in animal models and in humans. Methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP2) regulates proliferation in a variety of cell types including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. MetAP2 is inhibited irreversibly by the angiogenesis inhibitor fumagillin. We have previously found that inhibition of MetAP2 with fumagillin in bleomycin-injured mice decreased pulmonary fibrosis by selectively decreasing the proliferation of lung myofibroblasts. In this study, we investigated the role of fumagillin as a potential therapy in experimental PH. In vivo, treatment of rats with fumagillin early after monocrotaline injury prevented PH and right ventricular remodeling by decreasing the thickness of the medial layer of the pulmonary arteries. Treatment with fumagillin beginning two weeks after monocrotaline injury did not prevent PH but was associated with decreased right ventricular mass and decreased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, suggesting a direct effect of fumagillin on right ventricular remodeling. Incubation of rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (RPASMC) with fumagillin and MetAP2-targeting siRNA inhibited proliferation of RPASMC in vitro. Platelet-derived growth factor, a growth factor that is important in the pathogenesis of PH and stimulates proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, strongly increased expression of MetP2. By immunohistochemistry, we found that MetAP2 was expressed in the lesions of human pulmonary arterial hypertension. We propose that fumagillin may be an effective adjunctive therapy for treating PH in patients."

It can lead to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. PBC also shows some regional differences with respect to incidence and prevalence that are becoming more pronounced each year. Recently, researchers have paid more attention to PBC. To evaluate the development of PBC research during the past 11 years, we determined the quantity and quality of articles on this subject. We also compared the contributions of scientists from the US, UK, Japan, Italy, Germany, and China.The English-language papers covering PBC published in journals from 2000 through 2010 were retrieved from the PubMed database. We recorded the number of papers published each year, analyzed the publication type, and calculated the accumulated, average impact factors (IFs) and citations from every country. The quantity and quality of articles on PBC were compared by country. We also contrasted the level of PBC research in China and other countries.The total number of articles did not significantly increase during the past 11 years. The number of articles from the US exceeded those from any other country; the publications from the US also had the highest IFs and the most citations. Four other countries showed complex trends with respect to the quantity and quality of articles about PBC.The researchers from the US have contributed the most to the development of PBC research. They currently represent the highest level of research. Some high-level studies, such as RCTs, meta-analyses, and in-depth basic studies should be launched.

However, the relationship between these oncogenes and PP2A activity is not clear. To address this, we queried the connectivity of these molecules in silico.

The original Hahn and Weinberg (1Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Modeling the molecular circuitry of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) experiments identified a minimal suite of genetic events required for transformation of human fibroblasts and epithelial cells (2Ahuja D. Sáenz-Robles M.T. Pipas J.M. SV40 large T-antigen targets multiple cellular pathways to elicit cellular transformation.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7729-7745Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Cell transformation describes a set of phenotypes present (to varying degrees) among cancer-derived or cancer-like cells, but absent from normal cells. These include morphologic changes, growth in low serum, ability to grow at reduced seeding densities, ability to ignore confluence signals (foci formation), the ability to ignore attachment signals (growth in soft agar), and the ability to grow as xenografts in immunocompromised mice. The key point is that cells lacking all of these phenotypes are considered untransformed, albeit they may be immortal, whereas the presence of at least one phenotype is taken as an indication of transformation. Experimentally, these phenotypes typically are observed on a continuum in which growth in soft agar and growth as a xenograft are considered completely transformed, albeit these do not always correlate (3Seger Y.R. García-Cao M. Piccinin S. Cunsolo C.L. Doglioni C. Blasco M.A. Hannon G.J. Maestro R. Transformation of normal human cells in the absence of telomerase activation.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). That said, a particular genetic configuration may indicate that a particular oncogene/tumor suppressor contributes to specific transformation-associated phenotypes, but not all of them. Activated Ras combined with the inactivation of the Rb and p53 pathways and the expression of telomerase is sufficient to transform cells. However, complete transformation to anchorage-independent growth and growth as a xenograft in immunocompromised mice also requires the inhibition of the serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A. 4The abbreviations used are: PP2Aprotein phosphatase 2ASTsmall t-antigenLTlarge T-antigenMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastRbretinoblastomaNSCnonsilencing shRNA control. Inhibition of PP2A could be accomplished by the loss of one of the scaffolding A subunits, the loss of one of the regulatory B subunits, or the expression of the SV40 viral oncogene, small t-antigen (ST). Alternatively, expression of a diverse assortment of oncogenes including MYCT58A, activated PI3K, and activated AKT and RAC1 could also replace ST, presumably bypassing the need to down-regulate the phosphatase (4Westermarck J. Hahn W.C. Multiple pathways regulated by the tumor suppressor PP2A in transformation.Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 152-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).

Consistent with the latter possibility, Ingenuity Pathway analysis identified CDKN1B, the CDK inhibitor p27, as a common target of the gene products that could replace ST. p27 turnover is dependent on the phosphorylation of this protein, which can be reversed by PP2A. Furthermore, reducing p27 in human mesothelioma cells or in mouse fibroblasts conspired with the inactivation of the Rb and p53 pathways and the maintenance of long telomeres to transform these cells to anchorage-independent growth and growth in xenografts. Consequently, we propose that p27 levels represent a nexus of signaling input that cooperates with Rb inactivation to unshackle the restraints on cell proliferation leading to complete cell transformation. This might explain its value as a prognostic marker in multiple human tumors. Primary MEFs were isolated and cultured as described (8Vidal A. Millard S.S. Miller J.P. Koff A.

MEFs and mesothelial cells were grown in DME medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. For suspension culture, asynchronously growing cells were trypsinized and transferred to dishes coated with 0.9% agarose as described previously (1.2 × 105 cells/ml). Cells were incubated at 37 °C. Passage 1 primary MEFs were infected with SV40 or DL888 at a multiplicity of infection of 50 in a minimal volume of medium for 1 h at 37 °C, with rocking every 10 min. Complete medium was then added to each plate. The medium was changed 24 h after infection, and cells were passaged when they reached ∼80% confluence. Cell lines of all genotypes were established for eight passages and used in transformation assays as described below. To knock down p27, human mesothelial cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing shRNA p27-2 (CCTGTGTACATAACTCTGTAA) or p27-3 (CCGACGATTCTTCTACTCAAA) (Open Biosystems).

Briefly, 1 × 102 cells of each cell line were mixed with 3 × 105 WT primary MEFs and plated in triplicate 60-mm dishes. Cells were fed every 2–3 days for 14 days, when the plates were stained with crystal violet, and foci were counted. The ability of cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner was measured by plating them in soft agar. The wells of a 6-well dish were coated with 2 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2× complete MEF medium and 1.2% SeaPlaque agarose (Cambrex) (final 0.6% agarose). Asynchronously growing cultures of 8 × 104 to 1.6 × 105 uninfected primary MEFs or infected cell lines were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of 2× medium and 0.6% SeaPlaque agarose (final 0.3% agarose). This cell suspension was layered onto each of four agarose-coated wells (1.6 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at room temperature until solid (>2 h). The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C and fed weekly with 1–2 ml of 1× medium. For human mesothelial cells transduced with shRNA lentiviruses, G418 was included in each layer of agarose at a final concentration of 450 μg/ml. After 5–6 weeks of growth, images of each well were taken using a stereomicroscope and IPLab or Volocity software, and only those colonies visible to the naked eye were counted. SV40- and DL888-infected cell lines were injected into nude mice to determine their tumorigenicity. Cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio (v/v) with Matrigel (BD Pharmingen) and injected into the right flank of male nude mice (2 × 106 or 5 × 106 cells/animal). Tumor growth was monitored for 20 weeks or until the animal had to be euthanized when tumor size exceeded 100 cm3. 200 ng of His-tagged human p27 was phosphorylated by incubation with 200 ng of purified cyclin B1-CDK1 complex as described (11Zhu X.H.

After boiling for 5 min to inactivate the kinase, precipitated material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant containing phospho-p27 was transferred in aliquots to fresh tubes, and increasing amounts of purified PP2A complexes (Upstate Biotech Millipore) were added. After incubation at 30 °C for 45 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Alternatively, the experiment was performed in the presence of cold ATP, and p27 phosphorylation status was determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. ST has two genetically defined activities required for transformation. First, ST can displace the B subunit from the PP2A complex and inhibit its activity (12Cho U.S. Morrone S. Sablina A.A.

ST can also affect the transcription of a number of genes, including cyclin A2 (23Porrás A. Bennett J. Howe A. Tokos K. Bouck N. Henglein B. Sathyamangalam S. Thimmapaya B. Rundell K. A novel simian virus 40 early-region domain mediates transactivation of the cyclin A promoter by small t-antigen and is required for transformation in small t-antigen-dependent assays.J.

To first investigate whether these oncogenes might act through a single target that is regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, we performed in silico experiments using the bioinformatics software Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. This enabled us to define a network of proteins anchored by the four oncoproteins that can substitute for ST (Myc, RAC1, AKT1, and RalA) and by cyclin A2 (CCNA2), a representative of the transcriptional program controlled by ST (23Porrás A. Bennett J. Howe A. Tokos K. Bouck N. Henglein B. Sathyamangalam S. Thimmapaya B. Rundell K.

We then expanded this network in an unbiased manner by unsupervised additions of 20 directly interacting molecules at a time through three iterations, until an anchor was connected to greater than 30 other components in the network. This limit allowed us to keep the network to a usable size and reduces the possibility that signaling cross-talk would obfuscate the primary connectivity relationships. Rather than applying statistical considerations to this type of aggregate network analysis, which depends on literature citation rather than quantitative measurement and does not account for cell type specificity, we simply asked how connected each of these products were to the anchors. We identified 18 gene products that were directly linked to at least two of the anchor nodes (Fig. 1A). All the gene products and their connections to the anchors are indicated in Fig. 1B. RhoA, TSC2, LOC643751, CDKN1B, and TAF1B appeared in the top quartile of this list (Fig. 1C). LOC643751 was directly linked to RAC1 and Myc and linked to AKT1 through a single intermediate, PRKCZ, but it could not be linked through any single intermediate to either RalA or CCNA2. CDKN1B (p27) was connected directly to Myc, CCNA2, and AKT1, connected to RAC1 indirectly through RhoA, and connected to RalA indirectly through TSC2. TAF1B was directly linked to CCNA2 and Myc but could not be linked to any other node through any single intermediate. Only the nexus of TSC2, RhoA, and p27 was linked to all anchors directly or through a single intermediate. Observations reported in the literature place p27 downstream of TSC2 and RhoA. The growth-suppressive activity of TSC2 depends on p27 (25Soucek T. Rosner M. Miloloza A. Kubista M. Cheadle J.P. Sampson J.R. Hengstschläger M.

Noncatalytic requirement for cyclin A-cdk2 in p27 turnover.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6058-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, p27 is a single target downstream of RalA (through TSC2), RAC1 (through RhoA), Myc, AKT1, and CCNA2. Accordingly, we sought to experimentally test whether p27 loss could substitute for ST in cell transformation similarly to what had been reported for the other oncogenes. We first looked in human mesothelial cells that support a persistent noncytopathic infection with SV40. In keeping with studies of other human cell types, immortalized mesothelial cells expressing both hTERT and LT were transformed to anchorage-independent growth by subsequent infection with SV40 or transfection with a plasmid expressing ST alone, but were not transformed by infection with a mutant SV40 virus, DL888, that lacks ST expression (9Yu J. Boyapati A. Rundell K. Critical role for SV40 small t-antigen in human cell transformation.Virology. 2001; 290: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similarly, these mesothelial cells could be transformed either by expressing a combination of activated AKT1 and RAC1 (7Skoczylas C. Fahrbach K.M. Rundell K. Cellular targets of the SV40 small t-antigen in human cell transformation.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) or by expressing c-MYCT58A alone instead of ST. 5R. Katzman and K. Rundell, personal communication. Importantly, p27 expression increased in DL888-infected cells relative to the amount in wild type SV40-infected cells when plated in suspension (Fig. 2A), indicating that ST was needed to reduce the accumulation of p27 during human mesothelial cell transformation. To determine whether the increased amount of p27 observed in the DL888-infected cells contributed to impaired transformation, we superinfected the DL888-infected cells with a lentivirus expressing either of two shRNAs directed against human p27CDKN1B (p27-2 and p27-3) or a nonsilencing shRNA control (NSC) and selected pools of transduced cells with G418. As shown in Fig. 2B, the amount of p27 was similar in the SV40-infected and DL888-NSC-infected cells, but was lower in the DL888-infected cells that were superinfected with the p27-specific shRNA constructs. Knocking down p27 did not affect accumulation of LT or cyclin A in DL888-infected cells (Fig. 2B). To determine whether these cells were transformed, we then examined their ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. The cells expressing the control shRNA did not grow in soft agar, whereas a significant number of cells expressing either p27 shRNA construct did (Fig. 2C). The transformation efficiency of cells with less p27 increased approximately 10–20-fold. Statistically, the difference between the p27-2- and p27-3-expressing cell lines was not significant. Therefore, reduced expression of p27 could at least partially substitute for ST function in human cell transformation. However, manipulating gene expression by shRNA vectors has limitations. The use of genetically engineered p27 knock-out mouse cells allows us to avoid any complications associated with inefficient shRNA knockdown, and the availability of p27 knock-in mutant cell lines allows us to examine the role of p27 phosphorylation in transformation. Furthermore, unlike human cells that require more genetic manipulations to be transformed, primary mouse cells can be transformed by the expression of LT and ST alone. Mouse cells immortalized by 3T3 culture or genetically by Ink4a/Arf deletion are less dependent on ST for cell transformation (data not shown). We infected three independently derived clones of passage 1 wild type and p27 knock-out (p27D51/D51) primary MEFs with either wild type SV40, expressing both LT and ST, or a mutant virus, DL888, which expresses only LT at a multiplicity of infection of 50. At this multiplicity of infection, the ability of DL888 and SV40 to induce foci formation in a confluent monolayer was equivalent (Fig. 3A) (36Bouck N. Beales N. Shenk T. Berg P. di Mayorca G.

However, although SV40 was ∼10-fold better at inducing growth in soft agar when compared with DL888 in wild type cells (Fig. 3B) (36Bouck N. Beales N. Shenk T. Berg P. di Mayorca G.

The genotype of the virus and the cells did not grossly affect the expression of LT (Fig. 3C). Similar results were seen with two other viruses that contained mutations in ST, C97S and C103"
https://openalex.org/W1964191799,"Background Newer techniques are required to identify atherosclerotic lesions that are prone to rupture. Electric impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is able to provide information about the cellular composition of biological tissue. The present study was performed to determine the influence of inflammatory processes in type Va (lipid core, thick fibrous cap) and Vc (abundant fibrous connective tissue while lipid is minimal or even absent) human atherosclerotic lesions on the electrical impedance of these lesions measured by EIS. Methods and Results EIS was performed on 1 aortic and 3 femoral human arteries at 25 spots with visually heavy plaque burden. Severely calcified lesions were excluded from analysis. A highly flexible micro-electrode mounted onto a balloon catheter was placed on marked regions to measure impedance values at 100 kHz. After paraffin embedding, visible marked cross sections (n = 21) were processed. Assessment of lesion types was performed by Movats staining. Immunostaining for CD31 (marker of neovascularisation), CD36 (scavenger cells) and MMP-3 (matrix metalloproteinase-3) was performed. The amount of positive cells was assessed semi-quantitatively. 15 type Va lesions and 6 type Vc lesions were identified. Lesions containing abundant CD36-, CD31- and MMP-3-positive staining revealed significantly higher impedance values compared to lesions with marginal or without positive staining (CD36+455±50 Ω vs. CD36- 346±53 Ω, p = 0.001; CD31+436±43 Ω vs. CD31- 340±55 Ω, p = 0.001; MMP-3+ 400±68 Ω vs. MMP-3- 323±33 Ω, p = 0.03). Conclusions Atherosclerotic lesions with abundant neovascularisation (CD31), many scavenger receptor class B expressing cells (CD36) or high amount of MMP-3 immunoreactivity reveal significantly higher impedance values compared to lesions with marginal or no detection of immunoreactivity. Findings suggest that inflammatory processes in vulnerable plaques affect the impedance of atherosclerotic lesions and might therefore be detected by EIS."

Although it is believed that peptides which interact strongly with the TCRs of naive CD4 T cells favor Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation and low affinity peptide-MHC/TCR interactions favor Th2 differentiation, it remains unclear precisely how weak TCR interactions affect TCR signaling (2Datta S.

Moreover, it is believed that the strength of the TCR signal influences downstream signaling events, which in turn dictate transcription factor and cytokine gene transcription.

We have previously shown that A9 profoundly suppresses immunity to CII in the murine arthritis model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) by inducing suppressive cytokines and that it binds very weakly to murine I-Aq (4Myers L.K.

The purified collagen was dissolved in cold 20 mm acetic acid at 4 mg/ml and stored frozen at −70 °C until used. The synthetic peptides were purchased from Biomolecules Midwest Inc. (Waterloo, IL). DBA/1 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice transgenic for a CII-specific TCR-Vα11.1/Vβ8.3 were established and bred in the animal core facility of the Rheumatic Diseases Research Core Center, University of Tennessee as described previously (8Myers L.K. Rosloniec E.F. Cremer M.A. Kang A.H. Collagen-induced arthritis, an animal model of autoimmunity.Life Sci. 1997; 61: 1861-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained in groups of six in polycarbonate cages and fed standard rodent chow (Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and water ad libitum. The mouse facility had routine testing for mouse hepatitis and Sendai viruses. Another strain of mice genetically deficient in the FcRγ chain has been bred onto the DBA/1 background for 12 generations (9Kleinau S. Martinsson P. Heyman B.

Immunol. 2003; 33: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In some experiments these mice were intercrossed with DBA/1qCII24 to produce a new strain expressing the TCR transgene but deficient in the production of FcRγ. Heterozygous mice carrying a deleted Syk allele (Syktm1Tyb, which is referred to as Syk-) were obtained from Victor Tybulewicz (National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). The mutation was backcrossed onto the DBA/1qCII24 tg strain having the DBA/1 genetic background as well as the collagen-specific TCR transgene and maintained in heterozygous (Syk+/−) form. The TCR transgene-positive mice were identified by flow cytometric analysis of the expression of the Vb8 TCR. Bone marrow chimeras with the Syk−/− hematopoietic system were generated by fetal liver transplantation using fetuses from days 15.5–18.5 of embryogenesis (E15.5–18.5) that were obtained from timed matings of Syk+/− DBA/1qCII24 carriers. The 8–16-week-old DBA/1 recipient mice were lethally irradiated as described and then injected intravenously with unfractionated fetal liver cell suspensions. On average, fetal liver cells from a single donor were injected into 5–8 recipients. Syk−/− fetuses were identified according to their characteristic petechiated appearance, and their genotype was confirmed by allele-specific PCR analysis. Fetal livers from DBA/1qCII24 Syk+/+ mice were used to generate wild type control chimeras. Peripheral blood samples were taken 4–6 weeks after transplantation and stained with phycoerythrin-labeled antibodies against Vb8. For the analysis of Syk protein levels, total splenocytes were immunoblotted using anti-Syk (N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti β-actin (clone AC-74; Sigma) antibodies. Spleens were collected from TCR transgenic mice, and the single-cell suspension was prepared by mechanical disruption in complete DMEM medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm l-glutamine). CD4+ naive T cells were isolated using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, Ca) using a negative selection protocol. The purity of the recovered CD4+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry after staining with anti-CD4+ mAb and were >95% pure. Cells were cultured for varying lengths of time (30 s to 60 min or overnight) with APCs (I-Aq-positive splenocytes) that had been prepulsed with A2, A9, or other analog peptide(s). In some experiments, after a short culture period at 37 °C, the cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysates of whole cells were separated using SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, the membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% no-fat dry milk for 2 h and incubated overnight with phospho-specific antibodies in TBS-Tween 20, 3% milk. The membrane was then incubated with a secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and subjected to Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection (ECL Western blot kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To detect protein levels, the membranes were re-stripped and blocked with 3% no-fat milk, incubated with anti-pan antibodies, and then analyzed by ECL. The detection of intracellular phosphoproteins in T cells was carried out as follows. CD4+ T cells were purified by magnetic separation then stimulated with peptide-prepulsed antigen-presenting cells for differing time periods (1–60 min). Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol. Both fluorescent-conjugated phospho-specific antibodies and antibodies specific for T cell surface markers (CD3, CD4, and TCR-β) were added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Evaluation of the status of the intracellular phosphorylation was determined using CellQuest and FlowJo software after analysis with a Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The peptide representing the immunodominant determinant of CII, ATGPLGPKGQTGEBGIAGFKGEQGPK (CII246–270), where B stands for 4-hydroxyproline, is designated peptide A2 (12Baldwin C.T. Reginato A.M.

The APL containing three specific amino acid substitutions at positions 260, 261, and 263, CII245–270 (A260, B261, and N263), were chemically synthesized by a solid-phase procedure and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (13Rosloniec E.F. Kang A.H. Myers L.K. Cremer M.A. Collagen-induced arthritis.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 1997; (Chapter 15, Unit 15): 11-24Google Scholar). Antibodies including anti-phospho-specific antibodies recognizing Erk, p38, JNK/SAPK, Zap-70, and Syk were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and the anti-GATA-3 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Retroviral vectors expressing Myc-tagged Syk and Zap-70 as well as FLAG-tagged FcRγ and TCR-ζ were developed as previously described (14Kim Y.I. Park J.E. Martinez-Hernandez A. Yi A.K. CpG DNA prevents liver injury and shock-mediated death by modulating expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15258-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coding region of each was amplified by PCR using murine spleen cDNA as a template and then inserted into a pIRES-hrGFPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vector. T hybridoma cells expressing a collagen-reactive TCR were transfected with the construct vectors using Lipofectamine Plus transfection reagents. Stable transfectants were selected, and the resulting T cell lines were cultured with APCs. As a source of APCs, we transfected RAW264.7 cells with retroviral constructs coding for both the α and β chains of I-Aq. APCs were pulsed with saturating concentrations of A9, wild type peptide A2, or an irrelevant peptide overnight. To confirm functionality, CII-reactive T cell hybridoma cells transfected with an empty control retroviral construct were cultured with peptide pulsed APCs (I-Aq -expressing RAW 264.7 cells), and supernatants were analyzed for cytokine expression. As expected, culture with A2-pulsed APCs induced both Th1 cytokines (IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4), whereas culture with A9 peptide induced only Th2 cytokines (IL-4.) An irrelevant peptide was unable to induce cytokines. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. To measure cytokines, inguinal lymph node cells were cultured (5 × 105 CD4+ T cells/ml) with wild type APCs (I-Aq-positive splenocytes) (1:2 ratio) that had been prepulsed with 100 μg/ml concentrations of the various peptides (A2 or A9) (each cell population was confirmed by flow cytometry to have >95% purity). Supernatants were collected at 72 h and analyzed for the presence of IL-4, IL-10, IL-2, INFγ, and IL-17 using a Bio-plex mouse cytokine assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Values are expressed as pg/ml and represent the mean values for each group. The CD4+ T cells from DBA/1qcII24 mice (FcRg+/+) or FcRγ-deficient mice (FcRIγ−/−) were activated by APCs prepulsed with 200 μg/ml of A2 or A9 or no peptide for the indicated time period. The cells were harvested, and total RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 0.1 mg of total RNA in a 20-ml reaction volume at 37 °C using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). T-bet or actin fragment was amplified using RT-PCR (2 ml cDNA in 20 ml reaction volume) using Tag polymerase (PCR conditions: Step 1, 95 °C for 5 min; Step 2, 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 3 s, 72 °C for 30 s; Step 3, 72 °C for 10 min; 4 °C 1 h (T-bet: 35 cycle; actin, 20 cycle). We have previously established that mice immunized with CII and treated with A9 use an alternative to the canonical T cell signaling pathway. T cells from these mice use an activation pathway in which Syk replaces Zap-70 to initiate T cell functions (3Tang B. Zhou J. Park J.E. Cullins D. Yi A.K. Kang A.H. Stuart J.M. Myers L.K. T-Cell Receptor-Signaling Induced by an Analog Peptide of type II Collagen Requires Activation of Syk.Clin. Immunol. 2009; 133: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Utilization of this pathway, instigated by A9·I-Aq, results in the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines that function to down-regulate CIA. It is known that, FcRγ shares structural similarities with CD3-ζ and under some circumstances can substitute for it (15Krishnan S. Warke V.G. Nambiar M.P. Tsokos G.C. Farber D.L. The FcR γ-subunit and Syk kinase replace the CD3 ζ-chain and ZAP-70 kinase in the TCR signaling complex of human effector CD4 T cells.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether FcRγ activation was required for Syk to function in T cells. To execute these studies rapidly and efficiently, we used the DBA/1qCII24 mouse, which is transgenic for a TCR specific for the immunodominant epitope of CII and has large numbers of naïve CII-specific T cells (16Brand D.D. Myers L.K. Whittington K.B. Latham K.A. Stuart J.M. Kang A.H. Rosloniec E.F. Detection of early changes in autoimmune T cell phenotype and function after intravenous administration of type II collagen in a TCR-transgenic model.J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To examine the appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated intracellular substrates, the CD4+ cells from the transgenic mice were cultured with I-Aq-positive splenocytes prepulsed with either a peptide representing the immunodominant determinant of CII (A2) or A9. As shown in Fig. 1, triggering by either peptide induced an increase in the phosphorylation of a number of intracellular proteins within 5 min of activation. The time frame of this response to peptide/Aq stimulation is similar to that obtained with anti-CD3 stimulation. However, there are striking differences in the patterns of phosphorylation obtained between the two peptides. A2·I-Aq activates the cannonical pathway, specifically Zap-70 followed by activation of the three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Erk-1/2, JNK, and p38. On the other hand, A9·I-Aq activates Syk but not Zap-70 followed by phosphorylation of only two of the MAPKs, JNK and p38, but not Erk-1/2. As A9·I-Aq stimulation induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk rather than Zap-70, we asked whether this activation required FcRγ. To answer this question we used FcRγ−/− CD4+ T cells that were stimulated at varying times and compared the results to those obtained using FcRγ+/+ cells. Examination by Western blots (Fig. 1) revealed a marked increase in the phosphorylation of Syk, JNK, and p38 upon A9·I-Aq activation in DBA/1qCII24 FcRγ+/+ cells. In contrast, no major activation was detected in the phosphorylation of the corresponding molecules in the lysates of cells from DBA/1qCII24 FcRγ−/− mice. The same FcRγ−/− T cells, however, successfully activated Zap-70, and all the MAPKs when stimulated by A2, giving results comparable with those of T cells obtained from mice sufficient in FcRγ+/+. Taken together these data show that FcRγ is required for Syk and MAPK activation by A9·I-Aq but plays no role in the canonical pathway triggered by A2·I-Aq. A final outcome of A9·I-Aq stimulation is the secretion of cytokines associated with the Th2 T cell phenotype (4Myers L.K. Tang B. Rosioniec E.F. Stuart J.M. Kang A.H. An altered peptide ligand of type II collagen suppresses autoimmune arthritis.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 27: 345-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the zinc finger transcription factor GATA3 is known to up-regulate the expression of Th2 cytokines in T cells, we examine the induction of GATA3 after A9·I-Aq stimulation. CD4+ T cells from DBA/1qCII24 mice either sufficient or deficient in FcRγ were activated by APCs prepulsed with A2 or A9 for 1 h. When GATA3 expression was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2), no GATA3 induction was detected in FcRγ−/− CD4+ T cells stimulated by A9, whereas the GATA3 induction by A2 remained intact. The FcRγ sufficient T cells showed GATA3 induction after stimulation with either peptide (Fig. 2A). These data confirm that FcRγ is required for GATA3 up-regulation by A9·I-Aq but plays no role in the GATA3 activation triggered by A2·I-Aq. In contrast, the absence of FcRγ had no effect on the induction of the transcription factor T-bet (the transcription factor that controls the expression of Th1 cytokines) when the T cells were stimulated by A2·I-Aq (Fig. 2B), whereas A9 did not induce T-bet regardless of whether T cells were FcRγ-sufficient or -deficient. Because we have demonstrated that A9-induced T cell activation is dependent upon FcRγ, we resolved to definitively establish the requirement for Syk in this alternative signaling pathway. Because a homozygous genetic deletion of syk is embryonic lethal, we developed bone marrow chimeras, generated by fetal liver transplantation, using fetal livers from DBA/1 mice containing both the qCII24 transgene and the Syk−/− phenotype as a source of CD4+ T cells. The Syk−/− CD4+ T cells were collected from chimeric spleens, ands activated by APCs prepulsed with A2 or A9 for various time periods, and the cell lysates were collected and analyzed for activation of three MAPKs: JNK, p38, and Erk. As shown in Fig. 3, there was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 upon A9·I-Aq activation in cells from DBA/1qCII24 Syk+/+ mice. By contrast, no major phosphorylation of the corresponding molecules in the lysates of cells from Syk−/− mice was detected. On the other hand, the activation of MAPKs by A2 in CD4+ T cells from Syk-deficient mice was comparable with that of cells from Syk-sufficient mice. Studies of the induction of GATA3 in cells from Syk-deficient mice closely followed the design of the experiments used to investigate FcRγ-deficient cells. The CD4+ T cells from chimeric Syk+/+ or Syk−/− DBA/1qCII24 mice were activated by APCs prepulsed with A2 or A9 for 1 h. After activation the cells were lysed, and whole cell lysates were collected and analyzed for GATA3 (Fig. 4). As anticipated, GATA3 was not induced in CD4+ T cells from Syk−/− mice when they were exposed to A9, whereas it was induced by A2·I-Aq. GATA-3 was induced in Syk-sufficient cells when they were activated with either peptide. These data confirm that Syk is required for the induction of GATA-3 by A9·I-Aq but not for induction by A2·I-Aq. We have demonstrated previously that the A9 APL induces T cells to secrete suppressive cytokines, specifically IL-4 and IL-10 (17Myers L.K. Rosloniec E.F. Seyer J.M. Stuart J.M. Kang A.H. A synthetic peptide analogue of a determinant of type II collagen prevents the onset of collagen-induced arthritis.J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4652-4658PubMed Google Scholar, 18Myers L.K. Tang B.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3589-3595PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to quantify cytokine secretion of T cells genetically deficient in Syk when responding to A2 and A9. The Syk−/− mice were immunized with CII, and the draining lymph nodes were collected for in vitro studies to determine the response to both A2 and A9. As shown in Table 1, the supernatants from cultures of CD4+ cells from Syk−/− mice that were cultured with A2 contained levels of Th1, Th17, and Th2 cytokines significantly greater than background. These values are similar to those obtained when T cells were cultured with Syk+/+ T cells. On the other hand supernatants from cells cultured with A9 failed to elicit Th1, Th2, or Th17 cytokines, confirming that Syk is required for the APL-induced T cell cytokine responses.TABLE 1Cytokine responsesGeno-typeAntigenCytokinesIL-2IFN-γIL-17IL-4IL-10pg/mlSyk−/−No Ag49 ± 4170 ± 43154 ± 555 ± 5105 ± 25A26011 ± 10ap ≤ 0.05.4149 ± 85bp < 0.001.3,219 ± 85bp < 0.001.67 ± 12*7,458 ± 18ap ≤ 0.05.A96 ± 63271 ± 55234 ± 833 ± 2139 ± 42Syk+/+No Ag62 ± 4352 ± 255272 ± 279 ± 295 ± 8A21352 ± 19*7,350 ± 382bp < 0.001.15,210 ± 207ap ≤ 0.05.75 ± 6ap ≤ 0.05.3,511 ± 28ap ≤ 0.05.A921 ± 2659 ± 195359 ± 2267 ± 3ap ≤ 0.05.2,850 ± 20ap ≤ 0.05.a p ≤ 0.05.b p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab To unravel the complex sets of interactions that occur in this alternate signaling pathway, we developed reagents to precisely define the protein-protein interactions. As a source of APCs, we transfected RAW264.7 cells with constructs coding for both the α and β chains of I-Aq. These cells were then pulsed with either A2 or A9 and served as antigen-presenting cells. To determine the critical interactions involved in signaling when T cells were activated with either A9·I-Aq or A2·I-Aq, we generated retroviral constructs coding for the various signaling molecules incorporating either Myc or FLAG (Fig. 5). A collagen-reactive T cell hybridoma was transfected with various combinations of retroviral constructs so that it contained one of the following four combinations: 1) MSCV/Zap-70-Myc and CD3-ζ-FLAG; 2) MSCV/Zap-70-Myc and FcRγ-FLAG; 3) MSCV/Syk-Myc and CD3-ζ-FLAG; 4) MSCV/Syk-Myc and FcRγ-FLAG. The use of these constructs allowed us to determine whether Zap-70 associated with either CD3-ζ or FcRγ and in addition whether Syk associated with either CD3-ζ or FcRγ. We used a combination of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting to demonstrate that activation of T cells overexpressing both CD3-ζ and Zap-70 with A2 but not A9 resulted in a physical association between CD3- ζ and Zap-70 (Fig. 5A). Neither peptide induced the association of CD3-ζ with Syk (Fig. 5B). In addition we demonstrated that when T cells that overexpressed both FcRγ and Syk were activated by A9 but not A2, there was a physical association of FcRγ and Syk (Fig. 5D). Neither peptide induced the association of FcRγ with Zap-70 (Fig. 5C). We conclude that the activation of T cells through the interaction of the class II MHC·A2-TCR complex leads to the recruitment of Zap-70 to CD3-ζ, whereas activation of the MHC·A9-TCR complex leads to the alternative recruitment of Syk to FcRγ. To determine whether the interaction between Syk and FcRγ was dependent upon tyrosine residues, a mutant FcRγ was developed that was FLAG-tagged and contained critical mutations in the two tyrosines of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), i.e. Y65F and Y76F (Fig. 6). T cells were generated that overexpressed both Syk-Myc and FcRγ-FLAG, either the wild type or the mutant. As shown in Fig. 6, immunoprecipitation with either FLAG or Myc followed by blotting with the other antibody led to the detection of Syk and FcRγ only when cells contained the wild type FcRγ. These data confirm that the interaction between Syk and FcRγ is dependent upon the tyrosines contained within the ITAM of FcRγ. Based on the results of these experiments, it seemed likely that FcRγ must associate with the TCR·CD3 complex. To evaluate this possibility, we transfected collagen-specific T cell hybridoma cells with either CD3-ζ-FLAG or FcRγ-FLAG and performed immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for TCR Vβ8 or FLAG and immunoblotting with the other antibody. These experiments confirm that the α/βTCR receptor complexes contain both CD3-ζ and FcRγ (Fig. 7). In this study we characterize a TCR signaling pathway utilized when T cells are activated by the APL A9 and contrast it with the canonical CD3-ζ-associated pathway used when cells are activated by a peptide representing the immunodominant epitope of CII. A qualitative change in the pathways involved causes polarization of the T cell activation response so that there is production of GATA3 and not T-bet. This alternate pathway requires both FcRγ and Syk. Although T cell signaling has been studied extensively using T cell lines or clones, our studies are unique in our use of undifferentiated CD4+ T cells tested directly ex v"
https://openalex.org/W2082489582,"Two types of dye-linked L-proline dehydrogenase (PDH1, α4β4-type hetero-octamer, and PDH2, αβγδ-type heterotetramer) have been identified so far in hyperthermophilic archaea. Here, we report the crystal structure of a third type of L-proline dehydrogenase, found in the aerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix, whose structure (homodimer) is much simpler than those of previously studied L-proline dehydrogenases. The structure was determined at a resolution of 1.92 Å. The asymmetric unit contained one subunit, and a crystallographic 2-fold axis generated the functional dimer. The overall fold of the subunit showed similarity to that of the PDH1 β-subunit, which is responsible for catalyzing L-proline dehydrogenation. However, the situation at the subunit-subunit interface of the A. pernix enzyme was totally different from that in PDH1. The presence of additional surface elements in the A. pernix enzyme contributes to a unique dimer association. Moreover, the C-terminal Leu(428), which is provided by a tail extending from the FAD-binding domain, shielded the active site, and an L-proline molecule was entrapped within the active site cavity. The K(m) value of a Leu(428) deletion mutant for L-proline was about 800 times larger than the K(m) value of the wild-type enzyme, although the k(cat) values did not differ much between the two enzymes. This suggests the C-terminal Leu(428) is not directly involved in catalysis, but it is essential for maintaining a high affinity for the substrate. This is the first description of an LPDH structure with L-proline bound, and it provides new insight into the substrate binding of LPDH."
