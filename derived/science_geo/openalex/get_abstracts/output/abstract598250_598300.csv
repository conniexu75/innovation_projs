https://openalex.org/W2735132087,"The CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene editing both at single genes and in multiplexed loss-of-function screens, thus enabling precise genome-scale identification of genes essential for proliferation and survival of cancer cells. However, previous studies have reported that a gene-independent antiproliferative effect of Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage confounds such measurement of genetic dependency, thereby leading to false-positive results in copy number-amplified regions. We developed CERES, a computational method to estimate gene-dependency levels from CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens while accounting for the copy number-specific effect. In our efforts to define a cancer dependency map, we performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens across 342 cancer cell lines and applied CERES to this data set. We found that CERES decreased false-positive results and estimated sgRNA activity for both this data set and previously published screens performed with different sgRNA libraries. We further demonstrate the utility of this collection of screens, after CERES correction, for identifying cancer-type-specific vulnerabilities."

At two loci (JAK2 and A1CF), experimental analysis in mice showed lipid changes consistent with the human data. We also found that: (i) beta-thalassemia trait carriers displayed lower TC and were protected from coronary artery disease (CAD); (ii) excluding the CETP locus, there was not a predictable relationship between plasma HDL-C and risk for age-related macular degeneration; (iii) only some mechanisms of lowering LDL-C appeared to increase risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D); and (iv) TG-lowering alleles involved in hepatic production of TG-rich lipoproteins (TM6SF2 and PNPLA3) tracked with higher liver fat, higher risk for T2D, and lower risk for CAD, whereas TG-lowering alleles involved in peripheral lipolysis (LPL and ANGPTL4) had no effect on liver fat but decreased risks for both T2D and CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2766417400,"Objective We report on the effect of hemoadsorption therapy to reduce cytokines in septic patients with respiratory failure. Methods This was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter trial. Mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome were eligible for study inclusion. Patients were randomly assigned to either therapy with CytoSorb hemoperfusion for 6 hours per day for up to 7 consecutive days (treatment), or no hemoperfusion (control). Primary outcome was change in normalized IL-6-serum concentrations during study day 1 and 7. Results 97 of the 100 randomized patients were analyzed. We were not able to detect differences in systemic plasma IL-6 levels between the two groups (n = 75; p = 0.15). Significant IL-6 elimination, averaging between 5 and 18% per blood pass throughout the entire treatment period was recorded. In the unadjusted analysis, 60-day-mortality was significantly higher in the treatment group (44.7%) compared to the control group (26.0%; p = 0.039). The proportion of patients receiving renal replacement therapy at the time of enrollment was higher in the treatment group (31.9%) when compared to the control group (16.3%). After adjustment for patient morbidity and baseline imbalances, no association of hemoperfusion with mortality was found (p = 0.19). Conclusions In this patient population with predominantly septic shock and multiple organ failure, hemoadsorption removed IL-6 but this did not lead to lower plasma IL-6-levels. We did not detect statistically significant differences in the secondary outcomes multiple organ dysfunction score, ventilation time and time course of oxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W2766858627,"Synthetic beta cells were fabricated through 'vesicles-in-vesicle' liposomal superstructures equipped with glucose-sensing and membrane-fusion machinery, thus enabling sensing of graded glucose levels and secretion of insulin via fusion processes. Generating artificial pancreatic beta cells by using synthetic materials to mimic glucose-responsive insulin secretion in a robust manner holds promise for improving clinical outcomes in people with diabetes. Here, we describe the construction of artificial beta cells (AβCs) with a multicompartmental 'vesicles-in-vesicle' superstructure equipped with a glucose-metabolism system and membrane-fusion machinery. Through a sequential cascade of glucose uptake, enzymatic oxidation and proton efflux, the AβCs can effectively distinguish between high and normal glucose levels. Under hyperglycemic conditions, high glucose uptake and oxidation generate a low pH (<5.6), which then induces steric deshielding of peptides tethered to the insulin-loaded inner small liposomal vesicles. The peptides on the small vesicles then form coiled coils with the complementary peptides anchored on the inner surfaces of large vesicles, thus bringing the membranes of the inner and outer vesicles together and triggering their fusion and insulin 'exocytosis'."
https://openalex.org/W2952949211,"Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 163 vervet monkeys from Africa and the Caribbean shows high diversity among taxa and identifies signatures of selection. Selection signals affect viral processes, and genes that show response to SIV in vervets but not macaques have elevated selection scores. Vervet monkeys are among the most widely distributed nonhuman primates, show considerable phenotypic diversity, and have long been an important biomedical model for a variety of human diseases and in vaccine research. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 163 vervets sampled from across Africa and the Caribbean, we find high diversity within and between taxa and clear evidence that taxonomic divergence was reticulate rather than following a simple branching pattern. A scan for diversifying selection across taxa identifies strong and highly polygenic selection signals affecting viral processes. Furthermore, selection scores are elevated in genes whose human orthologs interact with HIV and in genes that show a response to experimental simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in vervet monkeys but not in rhesus macaques, suggesting that part of the signal reflects taxon-specific adaptation to SIV."

https://openalex.org/W2765258268,"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a cellular endosome- and lysosome-localized protein that restricts numerous virus infections. IFITM3 is activated by palmitoylation, a lipid posttranslational modification. Palmitoylation of proteins is primarily mediated by zinc finger DHHC domain–containing palmitoyltransferases (ZDHHCs), but which members of this enzyme family can modify IFITM3 is not known. Here, we screened a library of human cell lines individually lacking ZDHHCs 1–24 and found that IFITM3 palmitoylation and its inhibition of influenza virus infection remained strong in the absence of any single ZDHHC, suggesting functional redundancy of these enzymes in the IFITM3-mediated antiviral response. In an overexpression screen with 23 mammalian ZDHHCs, we unexpectedly observed that more than half of the ZDHHCs were capable of increasing IFITM3 palmitoylation with ZDHHCs 3, 7, 15, and 20 having the greatest effect. Among these four enzymes, ZDHHC20 uniquely increased IFITM3 antiviral activity when both proteins were overexpressed. ZDHHC20 colocalized extensively with IFITM3 at lysosomes unlike ZDHHCs 3, 7, and 15, which showed a defined perinuclear localization pattern, suggesting that the location at which IFITM3 is palmitoylated may influence its activity. Unlike knock-out of individual ZDHHCs, siRNA-mediated knockdown of both ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7 in ZDHHC20 knock-out cells decreased endogenous IFITM3 palmitoylation. Overall, our results demonstrate that multiple ZDHHCs can palmitoylate IFITM3 to ensure a robust antiviral response and that ZDHHC20 may serve as a particularly useful tool for understanding and enhancing IFITM3 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2576520471,"Nelson Freimer and colleagues analyze gene expression data from multiple tissue samples combined with genotype data from vervet monkeys to catalog expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). They generate a transcriptome resource analogous to the GTEx project and perform comparative and eQTL enrichment analyses for various traits. By analyzing multitissue gene expression and genome-wide genetic variation data in samples from a vervet monkey pedigree, we generated a transcriptome resource and produced the first catalog of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a nonhuman primate model. This catalog contains more genome-wide significant eQTLs per sample than comparable human resources and identifies sex- and age-related expression patterns. Findings include a master regulatory locus that likely has a role in immune function and a locus regulating hippocampal long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose expression correlates with hippocampal volume. This resource will facilitate genetic investigation of quantitative traits, including brain and behavioral phenotypes relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2766020779,"Metastasis significantly reduces the survival rate of osteosarcoma (OS) patients. Therefore, identification of novel targets remains extremely important to prevent metastasis and treat OS. In this report, we show that SPARCL1 is downregulated in OS by epigenetic methylation of promoter DNA. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that SPARCL1 inhibits OS metastasis. We further demonstrated that SPARCL1-activated WNT/β-catenin signaling by physical interaction with various frizzled receptors and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6, leading to WNT–receptor complex stabilization. Activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling contributes to the SPARCL1-mediated inhibitory effects on OS metastasis. Furthermore, we uncovered a paracrine effect of SPARCL1 on macrophage recruitment through activated WNT/β-catenin signaling-mediated secretion of chemokine ligand5 from OS cells. These findings suggest that the targeting of SPARCL1 as a new anti-metastatic strategy for OS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2767042390,"The specificity of membrane traffic involves tethers at destination organelles that selectively capture incoming transport vesicles to allow SNAREs on opposing membranes to then assemble and drive fusion. Tethers include both protein complexes and long coiled-coil proteins, although how they contribute to specificity remains unclear. The golgin coiled-coil proteins at the Golgi apparatus capture vesicles from different origins, but the vesicle-specific molecular cues that they recognize are unknown. Vesicle tethering is typically a transient process and therefore is challenging to interrogate in vivo. Thus, we have used a system in which an ectopic golgin causes vesicles to accumulate in a tethered state. By applying proximity biotinylation to the golgin-captured vesicles, we identify TBC1D23, an apparently catalytically inactive member of a family of Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), as a vesicle-golgin adaptor that is required for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking. The Rab GAP domain of TBC1D23 binds to a conserved motif at the tip of golgin-245 and golgin-97 at the trans-Golgi, while the C terminus binds to the WASH complex on endosome-derived vesicles. Thus, TBC1D23 is a specificity determinant that links the vesicle to the target membrane during endosome-to-Golgi trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2765862227,"During normal tumor growth and in response to some therapies, tumor cells experience acute or chronic deprivation of nutrients and oxygen and induce tumor vascularization. While this occurs predominately through sprouting angiogenesis, tumor cells have also been shown to directly contribute to vessel formation through vascular mimicry (VM) and/or endothelial transdifferentiation. The extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms underlying tumor cell adoption of endothelial phenotypes, however, are not well understood. Here we show that serum withdrawal induces mesenchymal breast cancer cells to undergo VM and that knockdown of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator, Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), or overexpression of the ZEB1-repressed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-200c, miR-183, miR-96 and miR-182 inhibits this process. We find that secreted proteins Fibronectin 1 (FN1) and serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family E member 2 (SERPINE2) are essential for VM in this system. These secreted factors are upregulated in mesenchymal cells in response to serum withdrawal, and overexpression of VM-inhibiting miRNAs abrogates this upregulation. Intriguingly, the receptors for these secreted proteins, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and Integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), are also targets of the VM-inhibiting miRNAs, suggesting that autocrine signaling stimulating VM is regulated by ZEB1-repressed miRNA clusters. Together, these data provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of VM and suggest that miRNAs repressed during EMT, in addition to suppressing migratory and stem-like properties of tumor cells, also inhibit endothelial phenotypes of breast cancer cells adopted in response to a nutrient-deficient microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2765908685,"The small heme-containing protein cytochrome b5 can facilitate, inhibit, or have no effect on cytochrome P450 catalysis, often in a P450-dependent and substrate-dependent manner that is not well understood. Herein, solution NMR was used to identify b5 residues interacting with different human drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes. NMR results revealed that P450 enzymes bound to either b5 α4-5 (CYP2A6 and CYP2E1) or this region and α2-3 (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and suggested variation in the affinity for b5. Mutations of key b5 residues suggest not only that different b5 surfaces are responsible for binding different P450 enzymes, but that these different complexes are relevant to the observed effects on P450 catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2765435137,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are heterogeneous and can adopt a spectrum of activation states between pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic in response to the microenvironment. We have previously shown that TTI-621, a soluble SIRPαFc fusion protein that blocks the CD47 “do-not-eat” signal, promotes tumor cell phagocytosis by IFN-γ-primed macrophages. To assess the impact of CD47 blockade on diverse types of macrophages that are found within the tumor microenvironment, six different polarized human macrophage subsets (M(-), M(IFN-γ), M(IFN-γ+LPS), M(IL-4), M(HAGG+IL-1β), M(IL-10 + TGFβ)) with distinct cell surface markers and cytokine profiles were generated. Blockade of CD47 using TTI-621 significantly increased phagocytosis of lymphoma cells by all macrophage subsets, with M(IFN-γ), M(IFN-γ+LPS) and M(IL-10 + TGFβ) macrophages having the highest phagocytic response. TTI-621-mediated phagocytosis involves macrophage expression of both the low- and high-affinity Fcγ receptors II (CD32) and I (CD64), respectively. Moreover, macrophages with lower phagocytic capabilities (M(-), M(IL-4), M(HAGG+IL-1β)) could readily be re-polarized into highly phagocytic macrophages using various cytokines or TLR agonists. In line with the in vitro study, we further demonstrate that TTI-621 can trigger phagocytosis of tumor cells by diverse subsets of isolated mouse TAMs ex vivo. These data suggest that TTI-621 may be efficacious in triggering the destruction of cancer cells by a diverse population of TAMs found in vivo and support possible combination approaches to augment the activity of CD47 blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2766092881,"Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) functions in migration and/or invasion of several human cancers; however, the role of MLK3 in colorectal cancer (CRC) invasion is unknown. MLK3 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAP3K) which activates MAPK pathways through either kinase-dependent or -independent mechanisms. Human colorectal tumors display increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or oxidative stress. ROS, such as H2O2, are important for carcinogenesis and activate MAPK signaling pathways. In human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells treated with H2O2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) were activated and MLK3 exhibited reduced electrophoretic mobility (shift) in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), which was eliminated by phosphatase treatment. Pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine, the ERK1/2 inhibitor UO126, or ERK1/2 siRNA knockdown blocked the H2O2-induced shift of MLK3, while MLK3 inhibition with Cep1347 did not. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on H2O2-treated HCT116 cells, endogenous MLK3 associated with endogenous ERK1/2 and B-Raf. Active ERK1 phosphorylated kinase dead FLAG-MLK3 in vitro, whereas ERK1 phosphorylation of kinase dead FLAG-MLK3-S705A-S758A was reduced. Both MLK3 siRNA knockdown and FLAG-MLK3-S705A-S758A expression decreased ERK1/2 activation in H2O2-treated cells. Prolonged H2O2 treatment activated ERK1/2 and promoted invasion of colon cancer cells, which was attenuated by MLK3 siRNA knockdown. Furthermore, S705A-S758A-FLAG-MLK3 demonstrated decreased oxidative-stress induced colon cancer cell invasion, but increased interaction with GST-B-Raf as compared with wild-type-FLAG-MLK3 in H2O2-treated cells. These results suggest oxidative stress stimulates an ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of MLK3 on Ser705 and Ser758, which promotes MLK3-dependent B-Raf and ERK1/2 activation; this positive feedback loop enhances the invasion of colon cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2766290511,"Soil represents the largest terrestrial organic carbon pool. To address global climate change, it is essential to explore the soil organic carbon storage patterns and their controlling factors. We investigated the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in 48 grassland sites along the Eurasian steppe eastern transect (ESET) region, which covers the Inner Mongolia grassland subregion and Mongolia grasslands subregion. Specifically, we analyzed the SOCD in the top 30 cm soil layer and its relationships with climatic variables, soil texture, grazing intensity and community biomass productivity. The results showed that the average SOCD of the ESET was 4.74 kg/m2, and the SOCD of the Inner Mongolia grassland subregion (4.11 kg/m2) was significantly lower than that of the Mongolia grassland subregion (5.79 kg/m2). Significant negative relationships were found between the SOCD and the mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP) and grazing intensity in the ESET region. The MAT and grazing intensity were identified as the major factors influencing the SOCD in the ESET region; the MAP and MAT were the major factors influencing the SOCD in the Inner Mongolia grassland subregion; and the MAT and soil pH were the major factors influencing the SOCD in the Mongolia grassland subregion."
https://openalex.org/W2765964655,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major risk factor for the development of chronic liver disease. The disease typically progresses from chronic HCV to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and death. Chronic inflammation associated with HCV infection is implicated in cirrhosis and HCC, but the molecular players and signaling pathways contributing to these processes remain largely unknown. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a molecule of interest in HCV-associated HCC because it has critical roles in virus-, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-, and IFN-induced signaling pathways. IRF5 is also a tumor suppressor, and its expression is dysregulated in several human cancers. Here, we present first evidence that IRF5 expression and signaling are modulated during HCV infection. Using HCV infection of human hepatocytes and cells with autonomously replicating HCV RNA, we found that levels of IRF5 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated. Of note, reporter assays indicated that IRF5 re-expression inhibited HCV protein translation and RNA replication. Gene expression analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of cancer pathway mediators and autophagy proteins rather than in cytokines between IRF5- and empty vector–transfected HCV replicon cells. IRF5 re-expression induced apoptosis via loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulated autophagy, and inhibited hepatocyte cell migration/invasion. Analysis of clinical HCC specimens supports a pathologic role for IRF5 in HCV-induced HCC, as IRF5 expression was down-regulated in livers from HCV-positive versus HCV-negative HCC patients or healthy donor livers.

https://openalex.org/W2766165672,"Colistin is considered a last-resort antibiotic against most gram-negative bacteria. Recent discoveries of a plasmid-mediated, transferable mobilized colistin-resistance gene (mcr-1) on all continents have heralded the imminent emergence of pan–drug-resistant superbacteria. The inner-membrane protein MCR-1 can catalyze the transfer of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) to lipid A, resulting in colistin resistance. However, little is known about the mechanism, and few drugs exist to address this issue. We present crystal structures revealing the MCR-1 catalytic domain (cMCR-1) as a monozinc metalloprotein with ethanolamine (ETA) and d-glucose, respectively, thus highlighting 2 possible substrate-binding pockets in the MCR-1–catalyzed PEA transfer reaction. Mutation of the residues involved in ETA and d-glucose binding impairs colistin resistance in recombinant Escherichia coli containing full-length MCR-1. Partial analogs of the substrate are used for cocrystallization with cMCR-1, providing valuable information about the family of PEA transferases. One of the analogs, ETA, causes clear inhibition of polymyxin B resistance, highlighting its potential for drug development. These data demonstrate the crucial role of the PEA- and lipid A–binding pockets and provide novel insights into the structure-based mechanisms, important drug-target hot spots, and a drug template for further drug development to combat the urgent, rising threat of MCR-1–mediated antibiotic resistance.—Wei, P., Song, G., Shi, M., Zhou, Y., Liu, Y., Lei, J., Chen, P., Yin, L.

https://openalex.org/W2766837307,"Sensitivity to noise, particularly road traffic noise, can increase cortisol levels and result in changes in immune system biomarkers. Therefore, continuous exposure to noise can have an effect on immune function, hormonal levels, and cardiovascular function, leading to hypertension and stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in stress-and immune system-related biomarkers according to the self-reported sensitivity to noise and exposure to road traffic noise, to ultimately determine the potential effects of noise on health. A survey was conducted through questionnaire (ISO/TS 15666) sent to 172 female subjects in Korea, including 128 from Ulsan and 44 from Seoul. The average noise level was calculated, and blood samples were collected for measurements of cortisol levels, Natural killer (NK) / Natural killer T (NKT) cell populations, and NK cell activity (through measurements of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (INF-γ) concentrations). Multivariate linear regression analysis of the measured biomarkers according to the road traffic noise level and self-reported noise sensitivity was conducted adjusting for the effects of age, alcohol status, smoking status, regular exercise, and residence period. IL-12 levels increased, whereas the NKT cell population decreased with increasing noise levels. The results further suggested that cortisol levels are more influenced by the subject’s sensitivity to noise than to the level of chronic road traffic noise. Therefore, noise appears to have the largest effect on IL-12 levels as well as the population and activity of NKT cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that low-level road traffic noise and sensitivity to noise can affect health by causing changes in the immune response through mechanisms other than increased cortisol."
https://openalex.org/W2765953135,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the interdependence between intracellular trafficking and epithelial cell polarity are poorly understood. Here we show that inactivation of class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (CIII-PI3K), which produces phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) on endosomes, disrupts epithelial organization. This is caused by dysregulation of endosomally localized Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as STK11), which shows delocalized and increased activity accompanied by dysplasia-like growth and invasive behaviour of cells provoked by JNK pathway activation. CIII-PI3K inactivation cooperates with RasV12 to promote tumour growth in vivo in an LKB1-dependent manner. Strikingly, co-depletion of LKB1 reverts these phenotypes and restores epithelial integrity. The endosomal, but not autophagic, function of CIII-PI3K controls polarity. We identify the CIII-PI3K effector, WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing 2 (WDFY2), as an LKB1 regulator in Drosophila tissues and human organoids. Thus, we define a CIII-PI3K-regulated endosomal signalling platform from which LKB1 directs epithelial polarity, the dysregulation of which endows LKB1 with tumour-promoting properties."
https://openalex.org/W2766207955,"The interface between the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is critical for several processes, including visual pigment regeneration and retinal attachment to the RPE. One of its most important functions is the exchange of metabolites between the photoreceptors and RPE because photoreceptor cells have very high energy demands, largely satisfied by oxidative metabolism. The riboflavin (RF) cofactors, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), are two key cofactors involved in oxidative metabolism. We have previously shown that retbindin is a photoreceptor-specific RF-binding protein exclusively expressed in the rods and present in the interphotoreceptor matrix at the interface between the RPE and photoreceptor outer segments. Here, we show that retbindin ablation in mice causes a retinal phenotype characterized by time- and dose-dependent declines in rod and cone photoreceptor functions as early as 120 days of age. Whereas minor retinal ultrastructural defects were observed at all ages examined, a significant decline occurred in photoreceptor nuclei at 240 days of age (∼36.8% rods and ∼19.9% cones). Interestingly, significant reductions in FAD and FMN levels were observed before the onset of degeneration (∼46.1% FAD and ∼45% FMN). These findings suggest that the reduced levels of these flavins result in the disruption of intracellular mechanisms, leading to photoreceptor cell death. Altogether, our results suggest that retbindin is a key player in the acquisition and retention of flavins in the neural retina, warranting future investigation into retbindin’s role in photoreceptor cell death in models of retinal degenerative disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2766640217,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from blood can be probed for the expression of treatment targets. Immunofluorescence is often used for both the enumeration of CTC and the determination of protein expression levels related to treatment targets. Accurate and reproducible assessment of such treatment target expression levels is essential for their use in the clinic. To enable this, an open source image analysis program named ACCEPT was developed in the EU-FP7 CTCTrap and CANCER-ID programs. Here its application is shown on a retrospective cohort of 132 metastatic breast cancer patients from which blood samples were processed by CellSearch® and stained for HER-2 expression as additional marker. Images were digitally stored and reviewers identified a total of 4084 CTCs. CTC’s HER-2 expression was determined in the thumbnail images by ACCEPT. 150 of these images were selected and sent to six independent investigators to score the HER-2 expression with and without ACCEPT. Concordance rate of the operators’ scoring results for HER-2 on CTCs was 30% and could be increased using the ACCEPT tool to 51%. Automated assessment of HER-2 expression by ACCEPT on 4084 CTCs of 132 patients showed 8 (6.1%) patients with all CTCs expressing HER-2, 14 (10.6%) patients with no CTC expressing HER-2 and 110 (83.3%) patients with CTCs showing a varying HER-2 expression level. In total 1576 CTCs were determined HER-2 positive. We conclude that the use of image analysis enables a more reproducible quantification of treatment targets on CTCs and leads the way to fully automated and reproducible approaches."

A number of possible causes of NAFLD have been studied, but the exact mechanism has not yet been elucidated.A total of 304 consecutive subjects who underwent general health examinations including abdominal ultrasonography, transient elastography and abdominal fat computed tomography were prospectively enrolled. Significant steatosis was diagnosed by ultrasonography and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) assessed by transient elastography.Visceral fat area (VFA) was significantly related to hepatic steatosis assessed by CAP, whereas body mass index (BMI) was related to CAP only in univariate analysis. In multiple logistic regression analysis, VFA (odds ratio [OR], 1.010; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.019; P = 0.028) and triglycerides (TG) (OR, 1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.011; P = 0.022) were independent risk factors for significant hepatic steatosis. The risk of significant hepatic steatosis was higher in patients with higher VFA: the OR was 4.838 (P<0.001; 95% CI, 2.912-8.039) for 100<VFA≤200 cm2 and 7.474 (P<0.001; 95% CI, 2.462-22.693) for VFA >200 cm2, compared to patients with a VFA ≤100 cm2.Our data demonstrated that VFA and TG is significantly related to hepatic steatosis assessed by CAP not BMI. This finding suggests that surveillance for subjects with NAFLD should incorporate an indicator of visceral obesity, and not simply rely on BMI."
https://openalex.org/W2765560085,"P. expansum is regarded as one of the most important postharvest rots of apple fruit and is also of great concern to fruit processing industries. Elucidating the pathogenicity mechanism of this pathogen is of utmost importance for the development of effective and safe management strategies. Although, many studies on modification of the host environment by the pathogen were done, its interactions with fruit during the early stages of infection and the virulence factors that mediate pathogenicity have not been fully defined. Effectors carrying LysM domain have been identified in numerous pathogenic fungi and their role in the first stages of infection has been established. In this study, we identified 18 LysM genes in the P. expansum genome. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that P. expansum LysM proteins belong to a clade of fungal-specific LysM. Eleven of the discovered LysM genes were found to have secretory pathway signal peptide, among them, 4 (PeLysM1 PeLysM2, PeLysM3 and PeLysM4) were found to be highly expressed during the infection and development of decay of apple fruit. Effect of targeted deletion of the four putative PeLysM effectors on the growth and pathogenicity was studied. Possible interactions of PeLysM with host proteins was investigated using the yeast-two-hybrid system."
https://openalex.org/W2765880379,"Objective Cell-free DNA from maternal plasma can be used for non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidies and single gene disorders, and also has applications as a biomarker for monitoring high-risk pregnancies, such as those at risk of pre-eclampsia. On average, the fractional cell-free fetal DNA concentration in plasma is approximately 15%, but can vary from less than 4% to greater than 30%. Although quantification of cell-free fetal DNA is straightforward in the case of a male fetus, there is no universal fetal marker; in a female fetus measurement is more challenging. We have developed a panel of multiplexed insertion/deletion polymorphisms that can measure fetal fraction in all pregnancies in a simple, targeted sequencing reaction. Methods A multiplex panel of primers was designed for 35 indels plus a ZFX/ZFY amplicon. cfDNA was extracted from plasma from 157 pregnant women, and maternal genomic DNA was extracted for 20 of these samples for panel validation. Sixty-one samples from pregnancies with a male fetus were subjected to whole genome sequencing on the Ion Proton sequencing platform, and fetal fraction derived from Y chromosome counts was compared to fetal fraction measured using the indel panel. A total of 157 cell-free DNA samples were sequenced using the indel panel, and informativity was assessed, along with the proportion of fetal DNA. Results Using gDNA we optimised the indel panel, removing amplicons giving rise to PCR bias. Good correlation was found between fetal fraction using indels and using whole genome sequencing of the Y chromosome (Spearmans r = 0.69). A median of 12 indels were informative per sample. The indel panel was informative in 157/157 cases (mean fetal fraction 14.4% (±0.58%)). Conclusions Using our targeted next generation sequencing panel we can readily assess the fetal DNA percentage in male and female pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2766066147,"Umami taste perception is mediated by the heterodimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), formed by the assembly of T1R1 and T1R3 subunits. T1R1 and T1R3 subunits are class C GPCRs whose members share common structural homologies including a long N-terminal domain (NTD) linked to a seven transmembrane domain by a short cysteine-rich region. The NTD of the T1R1 subunit contains the primary binding site for umami stimuli, such as L-glutamate (L-Glu) for humans. Inosine-5’-monophosphate (IMP) binds at a location close to the opening of the T1R1-NTD “flytrap”, thus creating the observed synergistic response between L-Glu and IMP. T1R1/T1R3 binding studies have revealed species-dependent differences. While human T1R1/T1R3 is activated specifically by L-Glu, the T1R1/T1R3 in other species is a broadly tuned receptor, sensitive to a range of L-amino acids. Because domestic cats are obligate carnivores, they display strong preferences for some specific amino acids. To better understand the structural basis of umami stimuli recognition by non-human taste receptors, we measured the binding of selected amino acids to cat T1R1/T1R3 (cT1R1/cT1R3) umami taste receptor. For this purpose, we expressed cT1R1-NTD in bacteria as inclusion bodies. After purification, refolding of the protein was achieved. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies revealed that cT1R1-NTD was well renatured with evidence of secondary structures. Using size-exclusion chromatography coupled to light scattering, we found that the cT1R1-NTD behaves as a monomer. Ligand binding quantified by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence showed that cT1R1-NTD is capable of binding L-amino acids with Kd values in the micromolar range. We demonstrated that IMP potentiates L-amino acid binding onto renatured cT1R1-NTD. Interestingly, our results revealed that IMP binds the extracellular domain in the absence of L-amino acids. Thus, this study demonstrates that the feasibility to produce milligram quantities of cT1R1-NTD for functional and structural studies."
https://openalex.org/W2766188047,"Gastric cancer risk is varied among different regions of Thailand. We examined the characteristics of Helicobacter pylori infection in two regions of Thailand. The H. pylori status of 273 dyspeptic patients (136 from the South and 137 from the North; a low and high incidence of gastric cancer region, respectively) was evaluated, and virulence genotypes (cagA, vacA, hrgA and jhp0562-positive/β-(1,3)galT) were determined. The overall H. pylori infection rate was 34.1% (93/273). The prevalence was higher in the North than in the South (50.4% vs. 17.6%, P <0.001) and was significantly higher among individuals with the following characteristics: low income, birthplace in the Northeast or North regions, agricultural employment, or consumption of alcohol or unboiling water. Among these socio-demographic determinants, region was an independent risk factor for H. pylori infection (odds ratio = 6.37). Patients including both H. pylori infected and uninfected cases who lived in the North had significantly more severe histological scores than those in the South. In contrast, among H. pylori-positive cases, patients in the South had significantly more severe histological scores than those in the North. Of the 74 strains cultured, 56.8% carried Western-type cagA, with a higher proportion in the South than in the North (76.2% vs. 49.1%, P = 0.05). In disagreement with the current consensus, patients infected with the Western-type cagA strains had more severe inflammation scores in the antrum than those infected with the East Asian-type cagA strains (P = 0.027). Moreover, Western-type cagA strains induced more severe histological scores in patients from the South than those of either genotype from the North. Other virulence genes had no influence on histological scores. The incidence of gastric cancer in Thailand was different among regions and corresponded to differences in the prevalence of H. pylori infection. More careful follow-up for patients in the South will be required, even if they are infected with H. pylori carrying Western-type cagA."
https://openalex.org/W2766465375,"How GPCRs and G proteins interact is important for their biologic functions and their functions as pharmacologic targets. It is still an open question whether receptors and G proteins are preassembled in a complex or interact only after receptor activation. We compared the propensity of the two Gs-coupled serotonin (5-HT) receptors 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 to associate with G protein prior to agonist activation. Combining receptor-immobilized fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer methodologies, we observed that 5-HT7 receptors markedly reduced the diffusion of both Gα and Gβγ at the cell surface, which indicated 5-HT7 receptor preassociation with Gs. This is in sharp contrast to the 5-HT4 receptor for which the diffusion of Gαβγ was not modified, and agonist activation brought together the receptor and Gγ, which is consistent with interaction by collision coupling. Agonist activation of 5-HT7 dissociated Gγ from the receptor, whereas Gαs underwent a rapid conformational change with respect to both Gγ and the receptor, followed by a slower dissociation of Gγ from both Gαs and the receptor. Taken together, these data demonstrate a different propensity among receptors to preassociate with G protein in the absence of ligand and reveals a rapid conformational change in Gαs upon activation by the receptor.—Andressen, K. W., Ulsund, A. H., Krobert, K. A., Lohse, M. J., Bünemannn M., Levy, F. O.

In this analysis, we explored the hypothesis that empagliflozin may have an impact on urinary peptides associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this post-hoc, exploratory analysis, we investigated urine samples obtained from 40 patients with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes (T1D) before and after treatment with empagliflozin for 8 weeks to for significant post-therapy changes in urinary peptides. We further assessed the association of these changes with CKD in an independent cohort, and with a previously established urinary proteomic panel, termed CKD273. 107 individual peptides significantly changed after treatment. The majority of the empagliflozin-induced changes were in the direction of “CKD absent” when compare to patients with CKD and controls. A classifier consisting of these 107 peptides scored significantly different in controls, in comparison to CKD patients. However, empagliflozin did not impact the CKD273 classifier. Our data indicate that empagliflozin induces multiple significant changes in the urinary proteomic markers such as mucin and clusterin. The relationship between empagliflozin-induced proteomic changes and clinical outcomes merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2765919408,"Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a side effect of many anti-cancer drugs including the vinca alkaloids, is characterized by a severe pain syndrome that compromises treatment in many patients. Currently there are no effective treatments for this pain syndrome except for the reduction of anti-cancer drug dose. Existing data supports the model that the pain associated with CIPN is the result of anti-cancer drugs augmenting the function of the peripheral sensory nociceptors but the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of anti-cancer drugs on sensory neuron function are not well described. Studies from animal models have suggested a number of disease etiologies including mitotoxicity, axonal degeneration, immune signaling, and reduced sensory innervations but these outcomes are the result of prolonged treatment paradigms and do not necessarily represent the early formative events associated with CIPN. Here we show that acute exposure to vinca alkaloids results in an immediate pain syndrome in both flies and mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure of isolated sensory neurons to vinca alkaloids results in the generation of an inward sodium current capable of depolarizing these neurons to threshold resulting in neuronal firing. These neuronal effects of vinca alkaloids require the transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TrpA1) channel, and the hypersensitization to painful stimuli in response to the acute exposure to vinca alkaloids is reduced in TrpA1 mutant flies and mice. These findings demonstrate the direct excitation of sensory neurons by CIPN-causing chemotherapy drugs, and identify TrpA1 as an important target during the pathogenesis of CIPN."
https://openalex.org/W2766062430,"Objective Microvascular dysfunction is an important underlying mechanism of microvascular diseases. Determinants (age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and smoking) of macrovascular diseases affect large-artery endothelial function. These risk factors also associate with microvascular diseases. We hypothesized that they are also determinants of microvascular (endothelial) function. Methods In The Maastricht Study, a type 2 diabetes-enriched population-based cohort study (n = 1991, 51% men, aged 59.7±8.2 years), we determined microvascular function as flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar %-dilation and heat-induced skin %-hyperemia. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the associations of cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, waist circumference, total-to-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 24-h systolic blood pressure, and cigarette smoking) with retinal and skin microvascular function. Results In multivariate analyses, age and FPG were inversely associated with retinal and skin microvascular function (regression coefficients per standard deviation (SD) were -0.11SD (95%CI: -0.15;-0.06) and -0.12SD (-0.17;-0.07) for retinal arteriolar %-dilation and -0.10SD (-0.16;-0.05) and -0.11SD (-0.17;-0.06) for skin %-hyperemia, respectively. Men and current smokers had -0.43SD (-0.58;-0.27) and -0.32SD (-0.49;-0.15) lower skin %-hyperemia, respectively. 24-h systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio were not statistically significantly associated with these microvascular functions. Conclusions Associations between cardiovascular risk factors and retinal and skin microvascular function show a pattern that is partly similar to the associations between cardiovascular risk factors and macrovascular function. Impairment of microvascular function may constitute a pathway through which an adverse cardiovascular risk factor pattern may increase risk of diseases that are partly or wholly of microvascular origin."

SERCA activity is regulated by a variety of small transmembrane peptides, most notably by phospholamban in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin in skeletal muscle. However, how phospholamban and sarcolipin regulate SERCA is not fully understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of phospholamban and sarcolipin on calcium translocation and ATP hydrolysis by SERCA under conditions that mimic environments in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. For pre-steady-state current measurements, proteoliposomes containing SERCA and phospholamban or sarcolipin were adsorbed to a solid-supported membrane and activated by substrate concentration jumps. We observed that phospholamban altered ATP-dependent calcium translocation by SERCA within the first transport cycle, whereas sarcolipin did not. Using pre-steady-state charge (calcium) translocation and steady-state ATPase activity under substrate conditions (various calcium and/or ATP concentrations) promoting particular conformational states of SERCA, we found that the effect of phospholamban on SERCA depends on substrate preincubation conditions. Our results also indicated that phospholamban can establish an inhibitory interaction with multiple SERCA conformational states with distinct effects on SERCA's kinetic properties. Moreover, we noted multiple modes of interaction between SERCA and phospholamban and observed that once a particular mode of association is engaged it persists throughout the SERCA transport cycle and multiple turnover events. These observations are consistent with conformational memory in the interaction between SERCA and phospholamban, thus providing insights into the physiological role of phospholamban and its regulatory effect on SERCA transport activity.

https://openalex.org/W2766908147,"The viral protein R (Vpr) is an accessory virulence factor of HIV-1 that facilitates infection in immune cells. Cellular functions of Vpr are tied to its interaction with DCAF1, a substrate receptor component of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Recent proteomic approaches suggested that Vpr degrades helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) DNA helicase in a proteasome-dependent manner by redirecting the CRL4-DCAF1 E3 ligase. However, the precise molecular mechanism of Vpr-dependent HLTF depletion is not known. Here, using in vitro reconstitution assays, we show that Vpr mediates polyubiquitination of HLTF, by directly loading it onto the C-terminal WD40 domain of DCAF1 in complex with the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Mutational analyses suggest that Vpr interacts with DNA-binding residues in the N-terminal HIRAN domain of HLTF in a manner similar to the recruitment of another target, uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2), to the CRL4-DCAF1 E3 by Vpr. Strikingly, Vpr also engages a second, adjacent region, which connects the HIRAN and ATPase/helicase domains. Thus, our findings reveal that Vpr utilizes common as well as distinctive interfaces to recruit multiple postreplication DNA repair proteins to the CRL4-DCAF1 E3 ligase for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation."

The nitrogen-fixing ability of endophytic diazotroph was verified by the nifH-PCR assay that showed positive nitrogen fixation ability. These identified strains were classified by 879F-RAPD and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. RAPD analyses revealed that the 10 strains were clustered into seven 879F-RAPD groups, suggesting a clonal origin. 16S rRNA sequencing analyses allowed the assignment of the 10 strains to known groups of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including organisms from the genera Paenibacillus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea. These representative genus are not endophytic diazotrophs in the conventional sense. They may have obtained nitrogen fixation ability through lateral gene transfer, however, the evolutionary forces of lateral gene transfer are not well known.

Manometry and PFM strength data were collected and classified according to the modified Oxford scale. A simple linear regression was performed to determine the classification scale of manometry using the modified Oxford scale as the explanatory variable and the arithmetic mean of the manometry measurements as the response variable.The average age was 52.80 (±8.78; CI: 51.67-53.93) years. Manometry showed an average of 35.1 (±22.7; CI: 32.1-38.0) cmH2O and most women (29.7%) scored grade 3 on the modified Oxford scale. According to the proposed scale, values between 7.5 to 14.5 cmH2O correspond to very weak pressure; 14.6 to 26.5 cmH2O represent weak pressure; 26.6 to 41.5 cmH2O represent moderate pressure; 41.6 to 60.5 cmH2O represent good pressure, and values above 60.6 cmH2O correspond to strong pressure.Manometry values were rated on a five-point scale.

https://openalex.org/W2766176003,"Background The majority of tuberculosis in migrants to Canada occurs due to reactivation of latent TB infection. Risk of tuberculosis in those with latent tuberculosis infection can be significantly reduced with treatment. Presently, only 2.4% of new migrants are flagged for post-landing surveillance, which may include latent tuberculosis infection screening; no other migrants receive routine latent tuberculosis infection screening. To aid in reducing the tuberculosis burden in new migrants to Canada, we determined the cost-effectiveness of using different latent tuberculosis infection interventions in migrants under post-arrival surveillance and in all new migrants. Methods A discrete event simulation model was developed that focused on a Canadian permanent resident cohort after arrival in Canada, utilizing a ten-year time horizon, healthcare system perspective, and 1.5% discount rate. Latent tuberculosis infection interventions were evaluated in the population under surveillance (N = 6100) and the total cohort (N = 260,600). In all evaluations, six different screening and treatment combinations were compared to the base case of tuberculin skin test screening followed by isoniazid treatment only in the population under surveillance. Quality adjusted life years, incident tuberculosis cases, and costs were recorded for each intervention and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in relation to the base case. Results In the population under surveillance (N = 6100), using an interferon-gamma release assay followed by rifampin was dominant compared to the base case, preventing 4.90 cases of tuberculosis, a 4.9% reduction, adding 4.0 quality adjusted life years, and saving $353,013 over the ensuing ten-years. Latent tuberculosis infection screening in the total population (N = 260,600) was not cost-effective when compared to the base case, however could potentially prevent 21.8% of incident tuberculosis cases. Conclusions Screening new migrants under surveillance with an interferon-gamma release assay and treating with rifampin is cost saving, but will not significantly impact TB incidence. Universal latent tuberculosis infection screening and treatment is cost-prohibitive. Research into using risk factors to target screening post-landing may provide alternate solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2765210128,"Metastasis accounts for most of cancer-related deaths. Paracrine signaling between tumor cells and the stroma induces changes in the tumor microenvironment required for metastasis. Transcription factor c-Myb was associated with breast cancer (BC) progression but its role in metastasis remains unclear. Here we show that increased c-Myb expression in BC cells inhibits spontaneous lung metastasis through impaired tumor cell extravasation. On contrary, BC cells with increased lung metastatic capacity exhibited low c-Myb levels. We identified a specific inflammatory signature, including Ccl2 chemokine, that was expressed in lung metastatic cells but was suppressed in tumor cells with higher c-Myb levels. Tumor cell-derived Ccl2 expression facilitated lung metastasis and rescued trans-endothelial migration of c-Myb overexpressing cells. Clinical data show that the identified inflammatory signature, together with a MYB expression, predicts lung metastasis relapse in BC patients. These results demonstrate that the c-Myb-regulated transcriptional program in BCs results in a blunted inflammatory response and consequently suppresses lung metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2765901437,"Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone involved in the regulation and maturation of kinases and transcription factors. In Caenorhabditis elegans, it contributes to the development of fertility, maintenance of muscle structure, the regulation of heat-shock response and dauer state. To understand the consequences of Hsp90-depletion, we studied Hsp90 RNAi-treated nematodes by DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry. We find that upon development of phenotypes the levels of chaperones and Hsp90 cofactors are increased, while specific proteins related to the innate immune response are depleted. In microarrays, we further find many differentially expressed genes related to gonad and larval development. These genes form an expression cluster that is regulated independently from the immune response implying separate pathways of Hsp90-involvement. Using fluorescent reporter strains for the differentially expressed immune response genes skr-5, dod-24 and clec-60 we observe that their activity in intestinal tissues is influenced by Hsp90-depletion. Instead, effects on the development are evident in both gonad arms. After Hsp90-depletion, changes can be observed in early embryos and adults containing fluorescence-tagged versions of SEPA-1, CAV-1 or PUD-1, all of which are downregulated after Hsp90-depletion. Our observations identify molecular events for Hsp90-RNAi induced phenotypes during development and immune responses, which may help to separately investigate independent Hsp90-influenced processes that are relevant during the nematode’s life and development."
https://openalex.org/W2963167022,"The unwelcome evolution of malignancy during cancer progression emerges through a selection process in a complex heterogeneous population structure. In the present work, we investigate evolutionary dynamics in a phenotypically heterogeneous population of stem cells (SCs) and their associated progenitors. The fate of a malignant mutation is determined not only by overall stem cell and differentiated cell growth rates but also differentiation and dedifferentiation rates. We investigate the effect of such a complex population structure on the evolution of malignant mutations. We derive exact analytic results for the fixation probability of a mutant arising in each of the subpopulations. The analytic results are in almost perfect agreement with the numerical simulations. Moreover, a condition for evolutionary advantage of a mutant cell versus the wild type population is given in the present study. We also show that microenvironment-induced plasticity in invading mutants leads to more aggressive mutants with higher fixation probability. Our model predicts that decreasing polarity between stem and differentiated cells turnover would raise the survivability of non-plastic mutants; while it would suppress the development of malignancy for plastic mutants. We discuss our model in the context of colorectal/intestinal cancer (at the epithelium). This novel mathematical framework can be applied more generally to a variety of problems concerning selection in heterogeneous populations, in other contexts such as population genetics, and ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2765138888,"This paper presents an adaption of the fractional order terminal sliding mode control (AFTSMC) strategy for DC-DC Buck converter. The following strategy aims to design a novel nonlinear sliding surface function, with a double closed-loop structure of voltage and current. This strategy is a fusion of two characteristics: terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) and fractional order calculation (FOC). In addition, the influence of “the controller parameters” on the “performance of double closed-loop system” is investigated. It is observed that the value of terminal power has to be chosen to make a compromise between start-up and transient response of the converter. Therefore the AFTSMC strategy chooses the value of the terminal power adaptively, and this strategy can lead to the appropriate number of fractional order as well. Furthermore, through the fractional order analysis, the system can reach the sliding mode surface in a finite time. And the theoretical considerations are verified by numerical simulation. The performance of the AFTSMC and TSMC strategies is tested by computer simulations. And the comparison simulation results show that the AFTSMC exhibits a considerable improvement in terms of a faster output voltage response during load changes. Moreover, AFTSMC obtains a faster dynamical response, smaller steady-state error rate and lower overshoot."
https://openalex.org/W2765156527,"The portrayal of obesity in the media is often one of negativity. Consequently, it may generate an increase in stigma. Obesity stigma, a form of social discrimination, is responsible for many of the negative psychological and physiological effects on individual wellness. These effects not only impact individual health, but also affect the economy, and ultimately, societal wellness. In an attempt to examine the influence of the media on obesity stigma, this study tested the hypothesis that positive priming would lead to a reduction in obesity stigma. To further our understanding of this relationship, we: 1) examined the role of priming on physiological measures (e.g. salivary alpha amylase and skin conductance) in 70 college students by introducing positive and negative media images of individuals with obesity, and 2) assessed psychological measures (e.g. perceived stress, need to belong, and self-esteem, and Body Mass Index). After the priming manipulation, participants read a vignette depicting the discrimination of an individual with obesity and answered subsequent questions assessing participants' attributional blame of obesity. Results of this study revealed that priming affects physiological responding to obesity stigmatization. In conclusion, these findings suggest that incorporating positive media images of individuals with obesity may be an effective tool for reducing stigma and the various physiological consequences associated with it, which in turn, can enhance societal health and wellness."

This study comprised 6,150 adults 19 or more years old who took both periodontal examination and nutrition survey. The frequency of yogurt and milk intake was examined with a food frequency questionnaire. The amount of calcium intake was calculated with dietary intakes data gained from complete one-day 24-hour recall interviews. Periodontitis was assessed using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for the whole sample and subgroups with the strata of age, gender, or smoking, in a complex sampling design. Less intake of yogurt was significantly associated with periodontitis (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidential interval [CI] 0.70-0.97), but neither less intake of milk (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.20) nor lower intake of calcium (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.21) was significantly associated with periodontitis. In the subgroup analysis, no difference in the association of yogurt intake with periodontitis was found according to the strata of age, gender, and smoking. In conclusion, periodonitis was significantly associated with the less intake of yogurt among the Korean adults, but the calcium contained in yogurt is not likely to cause it."
https://openalex.org/W2765516875,"Phylogenetic studies are a valuable tool to understand viral transmission patterns and the role of immigration in HIV-1 spread. We analyzed the spatio-temporal relationship of different HIV-1 non-B subtype variants over time using phylogenetic analysis techniques. We collected 693 pol (PR+RT) sequences that were sampled from 2005 to 2012 from naïve patients in different hospitals in southern Spain. We used REGA v3.0 to classify them into subtypes and recombinant forms, which were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis through maximum likelihood (ML) using RAxML. For the main HIV-1 non-B variants, publicly available, genetically similar sequences were sought using HIV-BLAST. The presence of HIV-1 lineages circulating in our study population was established using ML and Bayesian inference (BEAST v1.7.5) and transmission networks were identified. We detected 165 (23.4%) patients infected with HIV-1 non-B variants: 104 (63%) with recombinant viruses in pol: CRF02_AG (71, 43%), CRF14_BG (8, 4.8%), CRF06_cpx (5, 3%) and nine other recombinant forms (11, 6.7%) and unique recombinants (9, 5.5%).

Most patients infected with HIV-1 non-B variants were men (63%, p < 0.001) aged over 35 (73.5%, p < 0.001), heterosexuals (92.2%, p < 0.001), from Africa (59.5%, p < 0.001) and living in the El Ejido area (62.4%, p<0.001). We found lineages of epidemiological relevance (mainly within Subtype A1), imported primarily through female sex workers from East Europe. We detected 11 transmission clusters of HIV-1 non-B Subtypes, which included patients born in Spain in half of them. We present the phylogenetic profiles of the HIV-1 non-B variants detected in southern Spain, and explore their putative geographical origins. Our data reveals a high HIV-1 genetic diversity likely due to the import of viral lineages that circulate in other countries. The highly immigrated El Ejido area acts as a gateway through which different subtypes are introduced into other regions, hence the importance of setting up epidemiological control measures to prevent future outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2765523312,"Animals rely on complex signaling network to mobilize its energy stores during starvation. We have previously shown that the sugar-responsive TGFβ/Activin pathway, activated through the TGFβ ligand Dawdle, plays a central role in shaping the post-prandial digestive competence in the Drosophila midgut. Nevertheless, little is known about the TGFβ/Activin signaling in sugar metabolism beyond the midgut. Here, we address the importance of Dawdle (Daw) after carbohydrate ingestion. We found that Daw expression is coupled to dietary glucose through the evolutionarily conserved Mio-Mlx transcriptional complex. In addition, Daw activates the TGFβ/Activin signaling in neuronal populations to regulate triglyceride and glycogen catabolism and energy homeostasis. Loss of those neurons depleted metabolic reserves and rendered flies susceptible to starvation."
https://openalex.org/W2766868729,"Rationale Flow cytometry (FCM) of ventricular myocytes (VMs) is an emerging technology in adult cardiac research that is challenged by the wide variety of VM shapes and sizes. Cellular variability and cytometer flow cell size can affect cytometer performance. These two factors of variance limit assay validity and reproducibility across laboratories. Washing and filtering of ventricular cells in suspension are routinely done to prevent cell clumping and minimize data variability without the appropriate standardization. We hypothesize that washing and filtering arbitrarily biases towards sampling smaller VMs than what actually exist in the adult heart. Objective To determine the impact of washing and filtering on adult ventricular cells for cell sizing and FCM. Methods and results Left ventricular cardiac cells in single-cell suspension were harvested from New Zealand White rabbits and fixed prior to analysis. Each ventricular sample was aliquoted before washing or filtering through a 40, 70, 100 or 200μm mesh. The outcomes of the study are VM volume by Coulter Multisizer and light-scatter signatures by FCM. Data are presented as mean±SD. Myocyte volumes without washing or filtering (NF) served as the “gold standard” within the sample and ranged from 11,017 to 46,926μm3. Filtering each animal sample through a 200μm mesh caused no variation in the post-filtration volume (1.01+0.01 fold vs. NF, n = 4 rabbits, p = 0.999) with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (%CV) of <5% for all 4 samples. Filtering each sample through a 40, 70 or 100μm mesh invariably reduced the post-filtration volume by 41±10%, 9.0±0.8% and 8.8±0.8% respectively (n = 4 rabbits, p<0.0001), and increased the %CV (18% to 1.3%). The high light-scatter signature by FCM, a simple parameter for the identification of ventricular myocytes, was measured after washing and filtering. Washing discarded VMs and filtering cells through a 40 or 100μm mesh reduced larger VM by 46% or 11% respectively (n = 6 from 2 rabbits, p<0.001). Conclusion Washing and filtering VM suspensions through meshes 100μm or less biases myocyte volumes to smaller sizes, excludes larger cells, and increases VM variability. These findings indicate that validity and reproducibility across laboratories can be compromised unless cell preparation is standardized. We propose no wash prior to fixation and a 200μm mesh for filtrations to provide a reproducible standard for VM studies using FCM."
https://openalex.org/W2766304344,"Transgenic rabbits carrying mammary gland specific gene constructs are extensively used for excreting recombinant proteins into the milk. Here, we report refined phenotyping of previously generated Venus transposon-carrying transgenic rabbits with particular emphasis on the secretion of the reporter protein by exocrine glands, such as mammary, salivary, tear and seminal glands. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon transgenic construct contains the Venus fluorophore cDNA, but without a signal peptide for the secretory pathway, driven by the ubiquitous CAGGS (CAG) promoter. Despite the absence of a signal peptide, the fluorophore protein was readily detected in milk, tear, saliva and seminal fluids. The expression pattern was verified by Western blot analysis. Mammary gland epithelial cells of SB-CAG-Venus transgenic lactating does also showed Venus-specific expression by tissue histology and fluorescence microscopy. In summary, the SB-CAG-Venus transgenic rabbits secrete the recombinant protein by different glands. This finding has relevance not only for the understanding of the biological function of exocrine glands, but also for the design of constructs for expression of recombinant proteins in dairy animals."
https://openalex.org/W2766759283,"A bioactive chemical constituent, doliroside A, from Chinese traditional herbal medicine Dolichos falcata Klein was isolated, purified and identified by 60% ethanol extraction, thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Molecular interaction mechanism between doliroside and amyloid β42 protein was evaluated by thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT), circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscope (AFM), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) from the aspects of kinetics, secondary structure, morphology, and thermodynamics, respectively. Results show that the purity of doliroside A is 99.9% by HPLC, and its chemical structure is identified by 1H- and 13C-NMR. Doliroside A is observed to be concentration-dependent inhibiting the fibrillation of Aβ42 with the IC50 value of 26.57 ± 1.6 μM. CD and DSC results imply that doliroside A can bind to the nuclei and oligomers of Aβ42 to form a stable complex and suppress Aβ42 fibrillation. AFM images show that doliroside A, after bound to the nuclei and oligomers, redirect Aβ42 into off-pathway, amorphous oligomers. These findings not only provide a full insight into the molecular interaction mechanisms between Aβ42 and doliroside A, but also facilitate the development of new native anti-AD drug of doliroside A compound."
https://openalex.org/W2765404298,"Nasal mucosa and olfactory bulb are separated by the cribriform plate which is perforated by olfactory nerves. We have previously demonstrated that the cribriform plate is permissive for T cells and monocytes and that viruses can enter the bulb upon intranasal injection by axonal transportation. Therefore, we hypothesized that nasal mucosa and olfactory bulb are equipped to deal with constant infectious threats. To detect genes involved in this process, we compared gene expression in nasal mucosa and bulb of mice kept under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions to gene expression of mice kept on non-SPF conditions using RNA deep sequencing. We found massive alterations in the expression of immune-related genes of the nasal mucosa, while the bulb did not respond immunologically. The absence of induction of immune-related genes in the olfactory bulb suggests effective defence mechanisms hindering entrance of environmental pathogens beyond the outer arachnoid layer. The genes detected in this study may include candidates conferring susceptibility to meningitis."
