https://openalex.org/W2025641804,Ruby crystals were subjected to a static pressure greater than 1 megabar in a diamond-windowed pressure cell. The pressure was monitored continuously by observing the spectral shift of the sharp fluorescent R(1) ruby line excited with a cadmium-helium gas-diffusion laser beam. One megabar appears to be the highest pressure ever reported for a static experiment in which an internal calibration was employed.

Large leaves associated with these fruits are thought to represent parts of the same kind of plant because the leaves and fruits are the only plant fossils at this locality to have distinctive, morphologically identical, yellow bodies within their carbonaceous remains. These fossils provide a rare opportunity to study the morphology of an ancient angiosperm and illustrate the antiquity of certain features considered primitive by comparative angiosperm morphologists."

Hydrocarbons appear to persist in the water to varying degrees with the most persistent being the cycloparaffins, then the isoparaffins, and finally the aromatics."

Minerals of the ultramafic suite appear to have equilibrated in the range 1000 degrees to 1300 degrees C between 45 and 65 kilobars, whereas the temperature range for minerals of the eclogitic suite is 850 degrees to 1250 degrees C. At present, models relating the partitioning of magnesium and iron between coexisting phases are not sufficiently rigorous to determine a value for the pressure of equilibration of these eclogitic suite inclusions."

https://openalex.org/W2061710524,Several reports and investigations have suggested that an association exists between estrogen drug use and increased risks of cancer. The incidence of cancer of the endometrium has risen in the past few years following rapid expansion of estrogen use. It has been found that the association between estrogens and endometrial cancer applies to women taking conjugated estrogens for menopausal symptoms as well as the nonsteroidal estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). The increase in endometrial cancer was most marked in Caucasian women in high socioeconomic groups who are 50 years of age or older. Studies have indicated that estrogens especially when unopposed by progesterone may play a causal role in the development of endometrial cancer. There are preliminary indications that the sequential type of oral contraceptive (OC) may be associated with endometrial cancer. Other investigations have found that use of OCs has increased the risk of breast cancer in women already predisposed to it. Definite answers to the questions about OCs and cancer will take time.
