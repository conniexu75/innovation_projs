https://openalex.org/W2061780012,"The function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as a Cl− channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells is extensively documented. However, less is known about the molecular determinants of CFTR residence in the apical membrane, basal regulation of its Cl− channel activity, and its reported effects on the function of other transporters. These aspects of CFTR function likely require specific interactions between CFTR and unknown proteins in the apical compartment of epithelial cells. Here we report that CFTR interacts with the recently discovered protein, EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50). EBP50 is concentrated at the apical membrane in human airway epithelial cells, in vivo, and CFTR and EBP50 associate inin vitro binding assays. The CFTR-EBP50 interaction requires the COOH-terminal DTRL sequence of CFTR and utilizes either PDZ1 or PDZ2 of EBP50, although binding to PDZ1 is of greater affinity. Through formation of a complex, the interaction between CFTR and EBP50 may influence the stability and/or regulation of CFTR Cl−channel function in the cell membrane and provides a potential mechanism through which CFTR can affect the activity of other apical membrane proteins.

CF is caused by mutation in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which functions as a cAMP-regulated Cl− channel at the apical cell surface (1Riordan J.R.

The CF phenotype includes changes in cellular processes distinct from those involving Cl−transport, including sodium hyperabsorption and abnormalities in the processing of mucins (4Harris A. Q. J.

The most common cause of CF are mutations that lead to the formation of an abnormally folded CFTR protein that does not reach the cell surface (2Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W.

Even wild type CFTR is inefficiently transported to the cell surface, with up to 70% of the newly synthesized proteins failing to achieve a stable conformation that escapes quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Cheng S.H.

Knowledge of the protein-protein interactions that are involved in CFTR-mediated regulation of other epithelial transport proteins, and the interactions that control the trafficking, localization, and regulation of CFTR, is incomplete. Recently, the amino terminus of CFTR was shown to interact with syntaxin 1, with implications both for insertion of CFTR into the plasma membrane and regulation of channel activity (9Naren A.P.

Other interactions that stabilize CFTR or regulate its function remain to be identified.Compartmentalization of CFTR in a multiprotein complex might regulate CFTR activity by stabilizing the protein at the cell surface or by increasing the efficiency by which kinases and phosphatases control the channel. The presence of such a complex may also explain how CFTR modulates the activity of other epithelial cell transport proteins. A common mechanism to establish multiprotein complexes is via protein-protein interactions with submembranous scaffolding proteins (10Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 11Pontig C.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Sheng M. Kim E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ion channels and transport proteins may associate via their COOH-terminal cytosolic tails with proteins that contain PDZ domains (13Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 15Xia X.-M.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDZ domains (originally identified in postsynaptic density-95, discs large, and ZO-1) are found in a large number of multifunctional proteins, where they mediate protein-protein interactions at structures including the postsynaptic density in neurons and junctional complexes in epithelia (10Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 11Pontig C.P.

Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). There is a short consensus sequence at the COOH terminus of membrane proteins that is critical for the interaction with PDZ domains; one consensus sequence consists of the amino acids (D/E)(T/S)XV (10Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar,18Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 7376Crossref Scopus (1212) Google Scholar).The COOH-terminal cytosolic domain of CFTR is highly conserved across species and terminates with the amino acids DTRL (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5854) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that CFTR may exist in a multiprotein complex at the apical plasma membrane via interaction with a PDZ-containing scaffolding protein. Although several PDZ-containing proteins are known to be expressed in epithelia, many, including ZO-1 and ZO-2, are largely restricted to junctional complexes (19Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 20Willott E. Balda M.S. Heintzelman M. Jameson B. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a 50-kDa human protein containing two PDZ domains was identified and cloned based on its ability to associate with ezrin, a protein found in the apical domain of epithelial cells (21Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This protein, ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), is also localized at the apical surface and is expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues (21Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Human EBP50, and its rabbit homologue NHE-RF (Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor) share domain organization and sequence homology with E3KARP (NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein), and both proteins may associate with the Na+-H+ exchanger NHE3 to confer cAMP-mediated inhibition of Na+-H+exchange (22Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 23Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, the COOH terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor has recently been shown to associate with the first PDZ domain of EBP50 (24Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We determined the distribution of EBP50 in human airway epithelia and studied the biochemical interaction between EBP50 and CFTR. The identification of proteins that associate with CFTR, either directly or via scaffolding proteins, will facilitate our understanding of why absence of CFTR leads to severe abnormalities in epithelial cell function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBecause ezrin is concentrated at the apical membrane of many epithelia (25Berryman M. Franck M.Z. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vaheri A. Carpen O. Heiska L. Helander T.S. Majander-Nordenswan P. Sainio M. Timonen T. Turunen O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we first determined if EBP50 was similarly distributed in airway epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis of sections from human bronchi using antisera directed against EBP50 demonstrated intense staining of the apical cell surface with little staining of cilia or internal structures (Fig.1). This localization establishes that EBP50 is concentrated in airway epithelial cells in the apical compartment, where CFTR is targeted and functions as a Cl−channel.Both ezrin and EBP50 are expressed in several epithelial cell lines derived from bronchus, colon, and kidney (Fig.2 A), but not in cells of neuroendocrine origin (not shown). Multiple EBP50 species are seen in all the cell lines shown, most likely representing differentially phosphorylated forms (21Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Ezrin and EBP50 are binding partners (21Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar,32Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18378-18384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar), so these proteins could form part of a subapical membrane-anchoring complex specific to epithelia. To evaluate this possibility in airway epithelial cells, we analyzed the expression and distribution of CFTR, ezrin, and EBP50 in soluble and particulate fractions prepared from CalU3 cell lysates. CalU3 cells are a human airway epithelial cell line that expresses robust levels of CFTR. CFTR was present only in the particulate fraction, whereas EBP50 and ezrin were distributed equally in soluble and particulate fractions (Fig.2 B). Because ezrin and EBP50 do not have membrane-spanning domains, their presence in the particulate fraction is consistent with their cytoskeletal origin or association with membranes through an interaction with integral membrane proteins of epithelia.Figure 2Distributions of EBP50 and ezrin in epithelial cell lines. A, whole cell lysates (20 μg) prepared from epithelial cell lines were analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-EBP50 (1:10,000) or mouse anti-ezrin (1:1000) antisera. Proteins were visualized following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera and ECL reagent. B, CalU3 cell homogenates were separated into soluble and particulate fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-CFTR R domain (1:200), rabbit anti-EBP50 (1:5000), or mouse anti-ezrin (1:1000). Samples from two separate extractions were analyzed with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether CFTR and EBP50 might interact, we immobilized GST or GST-EBP50 on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated these affinity resins with CalU3 cell lysates. Endogenous full-length CFTR was recovered bound to the GST-EBP50 beads but not to GST beads (Fig.3 A), indicating that EBP50 and CFTR are capable of interacting. When we performed similar assays in the presence of a peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 22 amino acids of CFTR, the association between GST-EBP50 and CFTR was significantly decreased (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the COOH terminus of CFTR is involved in the interaction with EBP50. Because the CFTR peptide, in which the final four amino acid residues were replaced by glycines (CFTRmut), failed to block the association between GST-EBP50 and full-length CFTR (Fig. 3 B), the last four residues of CFTR (DTRL) must play a critical role in the association.Figure 3. Affinity precipitation of EBP50 and CFTR from CalU3 cell lysates. A, GST or GST-EBP50 were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with ∼500 μg of CalU3 cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. The bound fraction was electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE and immuoblotted with rabbit anti-CFTR R domain (1:200). A schematic of GST-EBP50 with PDZ1, PDZ2, and the COOH-terminal ezrin binding domain is shown. B, binding of CFTR to GST-EBP50 was assayed as described for A in the presence of 400 nm wild type CFTR or CFTRmut peptide. Binding of CFTR to GST-EBP50 in the presence of CFTR or CFTRmut peptides was determined by immunoblot analysis as described forA. The sequences of wild type CFTR and CFTRmut peptides are shown. C, CFTR, CFTRmut, and SkM2 peptides were immobilized on streptavidin-agarose and incubated with ∼500 μg of CalU3 cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed, and bound and unbound fractions were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-EBP50 antisera (1:5000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the COOH terminus of CFTR was sufficient to mediate the interaction with EBP50, we immobilized biotinylated peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal 22 amino acids of CFTR (Fig. 3 B) on streptavidin beads and incubated the immobilized peptide with CalU3 cell lysates. We found that EBP50 bound to the CFTR COOH-terminal peptide and was depleted from the lysate (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, there was no association between EBP50 and the CFTRmut peptide (Fig. 3 C). These data demonstrate that EBP50 and CFTR interact and further demonstrates that the COOH terminus of CFTR is sufficient to mediate the interaction. To test the specificity of the interaction between CFTR and EBP50, we performed assays using a peptide derived from the COOH terminus of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel (SkM2) as an affinity ligand. It is known that the SkM2 peptide can precipitate syntrophins from lysates via a PDZ interaction (16Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SkM2 failed to bind EBP50 (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that the PDZ domains of EBP50 discriminate between the cytosolic tails of different proteins containing COOH-terminal PDZ-binding motifs.The reciprocal affinity purifications demonstrate that EBP50 and CFTR proteins associate and that the association is mediated by the COOH terminus of CFTR. However, these results do not distinguish direct binding of CFTR and EBP50 from binding that occurs via an accessory protein. We used a combination of in vitro binding assays, gel overlays, and surface plasmon resonance to determine whether CFTR and EBP50 associate directly. EBP50 contains two PDZ domains and has an ezrin binding site at its extreme COOH terminus (Ref. 33Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18378-18384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar; Fig.3 A). We immobilized the biotinylated wild type and CFTRmut peptides on streptavidin-agarose beads and incubated the beads with purified GST-EBP50. Wild type CFTR bound GST-EBP50, and, as we observed previously, the mutant CFTR peptide lacking the COOH-terminal DTRL did not (Fig. 4 A). We also demonstrated a direct interaction between the COOH terminus of CFTR and full-length EBP50 in gel overlay assays (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, we observed that the COOH-terminal peptide could bind both PDZ1 and PDZ2 of EBP50 (Fig. 4 B). Although the CFTR peptide binds PDZ1 and PDZ2 of EBP50 in overlay (Fig. 4 B) and pull-down assays (Not shown), we did not observe binding of the CFTR peptide to the PDZ domain of β2-syntrophin (Fig.4 B).Figure 4In vitro interactions between CFTR peptides and EBP50. A, CFTR and CFTRmut peptides were immobilized on streptavidin-agarose and incubated with 100 nmGST-EBP50 for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound and unbound fractions were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and GST-EBP50 was detected by immunoblotting using mouse anti-GST antisera (1:5000). B, 500 ng of each fusion protein was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with 100 nm CFTR peptide and visualized by incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence. The experiment was performed three times with identical results. In one experiment, CFTR peptide failed to bind 500 ng of GST, and CFTRmut peptides failed to bind all samples. C, CFTR and CFTRmut peptides were immobilized on neutravidin-coated CM5 sensor chips, and 1.25 μg of GST-EBP50 was applied at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min. Relative binding is plotted in resonance units (RU) on the y axis and time in seconds is plotted on thex axis. D, CFTR peptide was immobilized on neutravidin-coated CM5 sensor chips, and GST-PDZ1 OR GST-PDZ2 was applied in increasing concentrations. The sensorgram shows relative binding in resonance units for 1.25 μg of fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We performed surface plasmon resonance measurements to compare the relative strength of binding of the CFTR peptide with the EBP50 PDZ domains. We confirmed that the mutant CFTR peptide was unable to bind full-length EBP50, even when tested at very high concentrations (Fig.4 C), and found that PDZ1 bound the wild type CFTR peptide significantly better than PDZ2 (Fig. 4 D). The apparent binding affinity for PDZ1 was ∼40 nm, suggesting a high affinity interaction between the COOH terminus of CFTR and EBP50. Recently the rabbit homologue of EBP50 (NHE-RF) was shown to bind the COOH terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor via PDZ1(24). This raises the possibility that the tails of CFTR and the β2-adrenergic receptor compete for binding to EBP50; however, it is not well established that the β2-adrenergic receptor is expressed on apical membranes where CFTR resides.Our data demonstrate that EBP50 in airway epithelial cells is concentrated at the apical membrane (Fig. 1), and EBP50 can associate directly with the cytoplasmic tail of the apical membrane protein, CFTR (Figs. 3 and 4). The association occurs because of the interaction of the terminal DTRL of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of CFTR with the PDZ domains in EBP50. The PDZ domains of EBP50 do not recognize the COOH terminus of SkM2 (Fig. 3 A) and the COOH terminus of CFTR will not interact with the PDZ domain of β2-syntrophin (Fig.4 B). These observations and the close cellular localization of CFTR and EBP50 argue that the interactions between EBP50 and CFTR are specific.Together with previous data demonstrating that ezrin and EBP50 interact directly in cells (21Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), our experiments identify three members of a potential regulatory complex present at the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells (Fig. 5). Furthermore, because ezrin is a major actin binding protein in epithelia (25Berryman M. Franck M.Z. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Algrain M.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results identify EBP50 as an intermediate for linking an apical membrane protein to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Such an interaction provides a mechanism through which modifications of cytoskeletal structure can be transmitted to CFTR (37Cantiello H.F. Exp. Physiol. 1996; 81: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Orat A.G. Xiao Y.-F. Ausiello D.A. Cantiello H.F. Am. J.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C1077-C1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the association of CFTR with a cytoskeletal complex could serve as an anchor that determines its specific location within microdomains of the apical membrane (40Gray M.A. Harris A. Coleman L. Greenwell J.R. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C240-C251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or its residence time at the cell surface. CFTR open probability is regulated by the competing actions of protein kinases and phosphatases, and ezrin was recently reported to function as an anchoring protein for PKA (41Dransfield D. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, binding to EBP50 may position the phosphorylation sites of CFTR within close proximity of PKA, and it would not be surprising if such a complex included other kinases or phosphatases that regulate CFTR (42Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 43Hanrahan J.W. Mathews C.J. Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A.

CFTR interacts with EBP50 by association with PDZ1; proteins that associate with PDZ2 with high affinity remain to be identified. The COOH terminus of EBP50 interacts with ezrin and ezrin associates with actin. Ezrin may serve to position PKA in close proximity to CFTR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because EBP50 contains two PDZ domains (Fig. 3 A) and PDZ1 binds CFTR with higher affinity (Fig. 4 D), it is likely that additional apical proteins interact with PDZ2. Participation of CFTR and other epithelial ion transport proteins in a common complex in the subapical compartment could be the basis for reported functional observations that CFTR influences the activity of other epithelial ion transporters (45Stutts M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2108675544,"Rapid glutamatergic synaptic transmission is mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors and depends on their precise localization at postsynaptic membranes opposing the presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites. Postsynaptic localization ofN-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors may be mediated by the synapse-associated proteins (SAPs) SAP90, SAP102, and chapsyn-110. SAPs contain three PDZ domains that can interact with the C termini of proteins such asN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits that carry a serine or threonine at the -2 position and a valine, isoleucine, or leucine at the very C terminus (position 0). We now show that SAP97, a SAP whose function at the synapse has been unclear, is associated with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors. AMPA receptors are probably tetramers and are formed by two or more of the four AMPA receptor subunits GluR1–4. GluR1 possesses a C-terminal consensus sequence for interactions with PDZ domains of SAPs. SAP97 was present in AMPA receptor complexes immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of rat brain. After treatment of rat brain membrane fractions with the cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) and solubilization with sodium dodecylsulfate, SAP97 was associated with GluR1 but not GluR2 or GluR3. In vitro experiments with recombinant proteins indicate that SAP97 specifically associates with the C terminus of GluR1 but not other AMPA receptor subunits. Our findings suggest that SAP97 may be involved in localizing AMPA receptors at postsynaptic sites through its interaction with the GluR1 subunit.

The prevailing excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain is glutamate (1Collingridge G.L. Lester R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 143-210PubMed Google Scholar, 2Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 365-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Upon its release from presynaptic sites, this neurotransmitter binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate rapid excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain (1Collingridge G.L. Lester R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 143-210PubMed Google Scholar, 2Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 365-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Several immuno-electron microscopic studies have demonstrated that ionotropic glutamate receptors are clustered at postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses (3Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. J. Comp.

Two major glutamate receptor families exist, namely N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); GRIP, glutamate receptor-interacting protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SAP, synapse-associated protein. receptors, which mediate Ca2+ influx, and non-NMDA receptors, which are usually not Ca2+-permeable (1Collingridge G.L. Lester R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 143-210PubMed Google Scholar, 2Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Non-NMDA receptors are further divided into α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and kainate receptors. At low frequency, synaptic transmission normally depends nearly exclusively upon AMPA receptors. On the other hand, kainate and NMDA receptors require higher frequencies for activation. NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx is necessary for different forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long term potentiation (1Collingridge G.L. Lester R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 143-210PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bear M.F. Malenka R.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 8Castillo P.E. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). At different synapses in the hippocampus and in other brain areas, a few bursts of high frequency electric stimulation that activate NMDA receptors induce a long lasting increase in synaptic transmission, the hallmark of long term potentiation. Glutamate receptors are thought to be heterotetramers consisting of homologous subunits (39Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). AMPA receptors are formed by two or more of the four AMPA receptor subunits designated GluR1–4 (9Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K. Wada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 501-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMDA receptors are heterooligomers composed of one or two NR1 and two or three NR2 subunits. One NR1 subunit and four different NR2 subunits (NR2A-D) have been identified (6Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 10Sheng M.

Hydrophobicity plots indicated the presence of four hydrophobic regions termed M1-M4 in all glutamate receptor subunits. The N terminus is extracellular and is followed by the transmembrane region M1. There is now strong evidence that the hydrophobic region M2 of glutamate receptors loops only partially into the plasma membrane and then back into the cytosol. M3 and M4 are transmembrane regions. The C terminus is localized on the intracellular side of the plasma membrane (12Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S.

Synapse-associated proteins (SAPs) constitute a family of closely related proteins that has been implicated in the process of clustering NMDA receptors at postsynaptic sites (14Kornau H.C.

A prototypic SAP consists of three PDZ domains in the N-terminal part followed by an SH3 domain and a guanylate kinase-like domain in the C-terminal region. The guanylate kinase-like domain does not appear to be catalytically active (18Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J.

These interactions are mediated by the first and second PDZ domain of these SAPs and require the presence of a valine, isoleucine, or leucine at the very C-terminal position (designated as the 0 position) of the NMDA receptor subunits (17Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 26Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). In addition, serine or threonine has to be present at the −2 position, which is two amino acids upstream of the C-terminal 0 position (17Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.C. Curr. Opin.

Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). GluR1 possesses a threonine at the C-terminal −2 position and leucine at the 0 position. The C terminus of GluR1, thereby, constitutes a consensus site for SAP binding via interaction with PDZ domains (17Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.C. Curr. Opin.

Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), does not coimmunoprecipitate with solubilized NMDA receptors, in contrast to SAP90/PSD-95, chapsyn-110/PSD-93, and SAP102 (28Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In addition, the synaptic function of SAP97 has been unclear. Here we show that SAP97 is associated with AMPA receptors in vivo. It binds to the GluR1 subunit and does not appear to directly interact with the GluR2 or GluR3 subunits. Our findings raise the possibility that SAP97 may be important for AMPA receptor localization at synaptic junctions. Crude membrane fractions were prepared from rat brains in the presence of protease inhibitors, washed by resuspension and re-centrifugation in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA), solubilized in buffer A containing protease inhibitors and 1% of either deoxycholate or Triton X-100 or SDS, cleared by ultracentrifugation, and used for immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting as described (29Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12107-12115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation after SDS solubilization, a 7-fold volume of a 1% Triton X-100 solution in buffer A was added. This procedure converts the pure SDS micelles into mixed micelles containing mainly Triton X-100 and a much smaller fraction of SDS. The result is a significant reduction in the potential of SDS to dissolve and denature proteins, allowing the addition of antibodies for immunoprecipitation (30Firestone G.L. Winguth S.D.

For chemical cross-linking, membrane fractions were washed by resuspension in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, followed by centrifugation and then incubated for 10 min on ice with 200 μm of the cross-linking agent dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP). The reaction was stopped by adding Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 100 mmbefore solubilization with SDS. Subsequent immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described earlier (29Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12107-12115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors were precipitated using antibody 54.2 (αNR1), which specifically binds to NR1 (29Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

The anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody αGST had been produced by immunizing rabbits with recombinant GST that had been expressed from the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Escherichia coli and had been affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose. For control immunoprecipitations, chromatographically purified nonspecific rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. These control precipitations were performed to exclude the possibility that SAPs interacted nonspecifically with either rabbit IgG or the resin during the immunoprecipitation procedures rather than with the respective glutamate receptor subunits.

GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the protocols suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham). Briefly, overnight cultures from single colonies were grown in 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with aeration to saturation, diluted 1:10 with LB medium, and incubated under the same conditions for 2–4 h until the culture reached anA600 of about 1.0. For induction, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1–0.5 mm) was then added, and the bacteria were incubated for another 4–5 h and harvested by centrifugation. Bacteria were resuspended in 50 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 15 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, (TBS) containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme and gently sonicated on ice with a tip sonicator, applying three bursts for 10 s on a low intensity setting. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and after 20 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (30,000 rpm, 60 min, 4 °C, 45Ti rotor). The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham) at 4 °C for 1–2 h, and the resins were extensively washed with TBS. To measure in vitro interactions between dissociated AMPA receptor subunits and recombinant GST-SAP fusion proteins, 20-μl resin samples loaded with 1 μg of GST-SAP90, GST-SAP97, or GST-SAP102 fusion proteins (see preceding paragraph) were incubated with 2 ml of Triton X-100-neutralized SDS extracts of brain membranes (see previous section), washed three times with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, once with 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, and then extracted with SDS sample buffer for immunoblotting as described (29Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12107-12115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the C termini of AMPA receptor subunits with respect to the interaction with SAP97, GST fusion proteins carrying the C-terminal amino acids of GluR1, GluR2, or GluR4 were expressed and adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose as described above. After thorough washing with TBS, the GST fusion proteins were eluted with 15 mm glutathione, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.2. Recombinant SAP97 was expressed from the pRK174-SAP97 vector without a tag (see above) in the E. coli strain BL21DE3 (Novagen) as described above with the following variation. Cultures were grown until an A600 of 0.6 was reached and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cultures were harvested, the bacteria were lysed, and the recombinant proteins were solubilized as above. The cleared lysates were frozen at −80 °C for storage. SAP97 was immunoprecipitated from these lysates using αSAP97 and protein G-Sepharose, and the precipitates were washed with TBS and then incubated with 1 μg of the GST fusion proteins carrying the C-terminal amino acids of GluR1, GluR2, or GluR4. After further washing, the pellets were extracted for immunoblotting with αGST. NMDA receptor complexes can be solubilized from synaptic membranes with ionic detergents such as deoxycholate or SDS but not with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (Fig. 1,NR2A/B) (11Blahos J., II Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, SAP90/PSD-95, SAP102, and chapsyn-110/PSD-93 can only be efficiently extracted from synaptic membranes with SDS (25Lau L.-F. Mammen A. Ehlers M.D. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C.

Therefore, we tested whether these SAPs are associated with NMDA receptors after solubilization with deoxycholate. Immunoprecipitation of NMDA receptors with the αNR1 antibody resulted in the coprecipitation of proteins immunoreactive with antibodies against SAP102 (Fig. 2, lane 2) or chapsyn-110/PSD-93 (data not shown). Similarly, SAP90/PSD-95, SAP102, and chapsyn-110/PSD-93 immunoreactive proteins coimmunoprecipitate with NMDA receptors solubilized in SDS extracts (25Lau L.-F. Mammen A. Ehlers M.D. Kindler S.

These results indicate that NMDA receptors can form complexes with SAP90/PSD-95, SAP102, and chapsyn-110/PSD-93 that are resistant to dissociation by SDS and deoxycholate.Figure 2Coimmunoprecipitation of SAP97 and AMPA receptors. Crude membrane fractions were solubilized with deoxycholate (lanes 1–3) or Triton X-100 (lanes 4–7), and the proteins indicated at the bottom were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the respective antibodies before immunoblotting with αSAP102 (lanes 1–3) or αSAP97 antibodies (lanes 4–7). SAP102 coprecipitated with deoxycholate-extracted NMDA but not AMPA receptor complexes (lanes 1 and 2) and SAP97 with Triton X-100-solubilized AMPA receptors (lanes 4 and 5) but not control antibodies or NR1 subunits (lanes 6 and7). Positions of marker proteins are given on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors are completely solubilized by Triton X-100 (Fig. 1). Immunoblotting of either a crude membrane fraction from rat brain or a Triton X-100 extract or a deoxycholate extract of the membrane fraction with αGluR1 yielded equally strong signals in all three fractions. Because identical amounts of the crude membrane fraction had been used as starting material for all three samples, these results show that not only deoxycholate but also Triton X-100 can efficiently solubilize AMPA receptors. After extraction with deoxycholate, SAP102 is not associated with AMPA receptor αGluR1 immunocomplexes (Fig. 2, lane 1). Taken together, these findings indicate that AMPA receptors do not form a deoxycholate-resistant complex with SAP102 or the other two SAPs, which are inefficiently extracted with Triton X-100 and are usually found associated with NMDA receptors. The synaptic function of SAP97, the fourth SAP family member, has not been elucidated. Like AMPA receptors, SAP97 is readily extracted by Triton X-100 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, one of the AMPA receptor subunits possesses an established C-terminal consensus sequence for PDZ domain binding. We, therefore, tested whether SAP97 is associated with AMPA receptors. Triton X-100 solubilizes AMPA receptors as a complex containing several different AMPA receptor subunits (9Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K. Wada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 501-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Triton X-100-solubilized AMPA receptor complexes with either αGluR1 or αGluR2/3 antibodies resulted in coprecipitation of a protein immunoreactive to SAP97 antibodies (Fig.2, lanes 4 and 5). Immunoprecipitation with control antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”) did not yield SAP97-immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2, lane 6), thus excluding the possibility that SAP97 directly bound nonspecifically either to the resin or to antibodies not directed against the AMPA receptor-SAP97 complex. It is possible that, after initial solubilization, SAP97 would then be free to bind to GluR1 or other proteins carrying a C-terminal PDZ binding consensus sequence. Like all the NR2 subunits, four of the eight NR1 splice isoforms possess a C-terminal consensus sequence for PDZ domain binding (33Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether SAP97 would bind to NR1 subunits solubilized with Triton X-100. A significant portion of NR1 can be extracted by Triton X-100 from crude brain membrane fractions. These NR1 subunits are not associated with NR2 subunits. They may derive from microsomes that originate from the endoplasmic reticulum and may correspond to an immature NR1 form that is not assembled with NR2 subunits (11Blahos J., II Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We did not detect the presence of a SAP97-immunoreactive protein in NR1 immunoprecipitates from these Triton X-100 extracts (Fig. 2, lane 7). These observations make it unlikely that SAP97 associates after solubilization with potential but physiologically irrelevant binding partners such as NR1 subunits containing a C-terminal PDZ binding sequence. Accordingly, the association of SAP97 with AMPA receptor immunocomplexes appears to be specific. After solubilization of brain extracts with SDS, αGluR1 immunoprecipitated GluR1 (Fig.3 A, lane 1) but not GluR2/3 (lane 4). Similarly, precipitation with αGluR2/3 yielded GluR2/3 but no GluR1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 A,lanes 5 and 2, respectively). Accordingly, SDS dissociates the different AMPA receptor subunits from each other. To"

Here we identified several amino acid residues in C. sordellii lethal toxin that are essential for the enzyme activity of the active toxin fragment. Exchange of aspartic acid at position 286 or 288 with alanine or asparagine decreased glucosyltransferase activity by about 5000-fold and completely blocked glucohydrolase activity. No enzyme activity was detected with the double mutant D286A/D288A. Whereas the wild-type fragment of C. sordelliilethal toxin was labeled by azido-UDP-glucose after UV irradiation, mutation of the DXD motif prevented radiolabeling. At high concentrations (10 mm) of manganese ions, the transferase activities of the D286A and D288A mutants but not that of wild-type fragment were increased by about 20-fold. The exchange of Asp270 and Arg273 reduced glucosyltransferase activity by about 200-fold and blocked glucohydrolase activity. The data indicate that the DXD motif, which is highly conserved in all large clostridial cytotoxins and also in a large number of glycosyltransferases, is functionally essential for the enzyme activity of the toxins and may participate in coordination of the divalent cation and/or in the binding of UDP-glucose.

The toxins differ in cosubstrate and protein substrate specificity. Whereas α-toxin from C. novyi catalyzes theN-acetylglucosaminylation by using UDP-GlcNAc as a cosubstrate (13Selzer J. Hofmann F.

In addition, Ras proteins (Ras, Rap, Ral) are modified by C. sordellii lethal toxin (11Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Toxin-induced glucosylation of low molecular mass GTPases occurs at Thr37 of Rho (Thr35 of all other GTPases) (10Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This amino acid residue is conserved in all low molecular mass GTPases and involved in divalent cation and nucleotide binding. Moreover, Thr35/Thr37 is located in the effector region of the GTPases, and glucosylation appears to block the interaction of the GTPases with their effectors (15Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Herrmann C. Ahmadian M.R. Hofmann F. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16134-16139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, glucosylation of Rho proteins by large clostridial cytotoxins renders the GTPases biologically inactive (17Aktories K. Just I. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 441-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The large clostridial cytotoxins possess molecular masses between 250 and 308 kDa and are, therefore, the biggest bacterial toxins known. It has been suggested that these toxins are constructed of three functional parts (18Von Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; : 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The C terminus, which consists of a large region of repetitive oligopeptides, is assumed to be important for receptor binding to the eukaryotic target (19Pothoulakis C. Gilbert R.J. Cladaras C. Castagliuolo I. Semenza G. Hitti Y. Montcrief J.S. Linevsky J. Kelly C.P. Nikulasson S. Desai H.P. Wilkins T.D. LaMont J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic region almost in the middle of the toxins is believed to participate in membrane translocation, and finally, the N terminus harbors the enzyme activity. Deletion analysis performed with C. difficile toxin B, and with C. sordellii lethal toxin revealed that a fragment consisting of the N-terminal 546 amino acid residues possesses full glucosyltransferase activity and is able to induce the typical cytotoxic effects after microinjection (20Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Hofmann F. Busch C. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that various families of glycosyltransferases, which exhibit high sequence homology within the same family but no overt similarity between different families, share a common small motif consisting of DXD, which appears to be essential for enzyme activity (26Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of large clostridial cytotoxins with these glycosyltransferases revealed that the same motif is also conserved in the bacterial toxins. Therefore, we studied whether this short motif has any functional relevance and is involved in enzyme activity of the toxins. Here we report that the exchange of aspartic acid residues 286 and 288, which form the DXD motif in C. sordellii lethal toxin, decreases the glucosyltransferase activity several thousand-fold and blocks the glucohydrolase activity, indicating an essential role in catalysis. Moreover, we identified additional amino acid residues located in close vicinity of the DXD motif, which are of functional importance and conserved in all large clostridial cytotoxins. 14C-labeled UDP-hexoses were obtained from DuPont NEN Life Science Products (Dreieich, Germany). Polymerase chain reaction primers were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. Amplification of the C. difficile toxin B fragment CDB1 and C. sordellii CS1 and construction of C-terminal truncated fragments B546 and LT546 were performed as described previously (20Hofmann F.

Sequencing of CS1 and CDB1, their truncated derivatives LT546 and B546, and the mutated clones was done with the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) to check both for correct cloning and mutations due to polymerase chain reaction amplification. Sequencing was performed at least twice with overlapping DNA fragments. The recombinant GTP-binding proteins RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, Ha-Ras, and Ral were prepared from their fusion proteins as described (10Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M.

The recombinant toxin fragments were expressed and purified as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (see Fig. 2). GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins from the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX2T were isolated by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Germany) followed by removing glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins with glutathione elution buffer (10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Recombinant Rap1a was a gift of Dr. A. Wittinghofer (MPJ Dortmund, Germany). Recombinant GTP-binding proteins (50 μg/ml) were incubated with recombinant toxin fragment LT546 or mutated fragments of LT at the indicated concentrations in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μm14C-UDP-glucose for 30 min at 37 °C or for the indicated periods. The total volume was 20 μl. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequently by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Quantitative data are given as arbitrary units as means ± S.E. (n = 3). LT546 and the mutated fragments (at the indicated concentrations) were incubated with 20 μm14C-labeled UDP-glucose and 100 μm unlabeled UDP-glucose in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm bovine serum albumin, 100 μmMnCl2. The total volume was 10 μl. Samples of 1.5 μl were taken out at each time point and subjected to thin layer chromatography with PI-cellulose plates (Merck, catalog number 1.05579, Darmstadt, Germany) and 0.2 m LiCl as mobile phase in order to separate hydrolyzed glucose from UDP-glucose. The plates were dried and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. Quantitative data are given as pmol per time indicated as means ± S.E. (n = 3). Indicated proteins (2 μg) were incubated on ice, in the presence of 50 μm[β-32P]5N3-UDPGlc, reactions were allowed to equilibrate for 30 s, followed by UV irradiation with a hand-held UV lamp (254/366 nm) with the glass face removed at a distance of 3 cm for 3 min. For competition experiments, 1 mm of unlabeled UDP-glucose was added to the reaction mixture just before the addition of [β-32P]5N3-UDPGlc. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of sample buffer. Thereafter, radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. For microinjection studies, HeLa cells were grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 4 mmglutamine/penicillin/streptomycin and plated on Cellocate (Eppendorf, Germany) coverslips at about 105 cells/dish at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Microinjection was performed with the Microinjector 5242 and Micromanipulator 5171 from Eppendorf. It has been reported recently that the amino acid motif DXD is crucial for the activity of the yeast mannosyltransferase Mnn1p (26Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).2 This motif is also conserved among the large clostridial cytotoxins in a region of high homology of the toxins (Fig.1). To elucidate the significance of this motif for the enzymatic activity of the toxins, we constructed various mutants of the enzymatically active N-terminal fragment LT546 ofC. sordellii lethal toxin and expressed them in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The conserved amino acid residues were changed to alanine or asparagine, respectively, and Fig. 2 Ashows the SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins. At first, we tested the single mutants D286ALT546 and D288ALT546 and the double mutant D286A/D288ALT546. In contrast to the active wild-type fragment, the mutants did not glucosylate any of the substrates of LT when applied at a concentration of 1 nm (Fig.3 A). Increasing the concentration of the wild-type fragment up to 100 nmresulted in a significant modification of Rac1, Rap1a, Ras, and Cdc42, whereas RhoA was much less labeled. At the same concentration (100 nm), the mutants caused only a faint labeling of Ras, Rap1a, Ral, and Rac1 but not of RhoA or Cdc42 (Fig. 3 B). This decrease in activity of the mutant proteins was most likely not caused by major changes in the overall structure of the protein, because the susceptibility of the toxins toward trypsin treatment was not changed (Fig. 2 B). To get more quantitative data, the time courses of glucosylation of Ras by these mutants were examined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the initial activities of the mutants D286ALT546 and D288ALT546 were reduced by more than 5000-fold with respect to the activity of the wild type fragment, while the double mutant D286A/D288ALT546 was completely inactive. Similar inhibition was observed when the aspartic acid residues were changed to asparagine (not shown). To exclude the possibility that the loss of transferase activity was caused by an inhibition of the interaction of small GTPases with the transferase, we determined the UDP-glucohydrolase activity of the mutants in the absence of a protein substrate. As shown in Figs. 4 B,8 B, and 8 C, no glucohydrolase activity of the mutants was detected. A similar inhibition of glucosyltransferase activity was obtained with the related C. difficile toxin B in the presence of Rac1 protein as substrate when the aspartic acid residues of the DXD motif of toxin B were changed to alanine (Fig. 3 C).Figure 4Glucosyltransferase and glucohydrolase activities of LT546 mutants.

Fig.5 shows that the wild-type toxin fragment was labeled by [β-32P]5N3-UDP-glucose after UV irradiation. The addition of unlabeled UDP-glucose blocked the radiolabeling. By contrast, the single mutants D286ALT546 and D288ALT546 and the double mutant D286A/D288ALT546 were not labeled, suggesting that the respective aspartic acid residues are important for UDP-glucose binding or for photoaffinity labeling with azido-UDP-glucose. Like various eukaryotic glycosyltransferases (22Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9444-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson R.E. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) the glucosyltransferase activity ofC. sordellii lethal toxin depends on manganese ions (11Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether alteration of the DXD motif affects the Mn2+ dependence of the glucosyltransferase activity of LT. As reported recently for the holotoxin, the active wild-type fragment of LT exhibited maximal activity at 1 mmMn2+ (Fig. 6). The maximal increase in activity by the addition of manganese was by about 40% under the conditions used. Further increase in the concentration of the divalent cation > 1 mm reduced the enzyme activity. The single exchange of the aspartic acid residues of the DXD motif of LT changed the Mn2+ dependence. As shown in Fig.6, the enzyme activity of the D288ALT546 mutant was affected at higher concentrations of Mn2+ than the wild-type fragment. Whereas at 10 mm Mn2+ the enzyme activity of the wild-type LT fragment was decreased, the enzyme activity of the mutant was increased by about 20-fold. Similar findings were obtained with the D286ALT546 mutant (not shown). By contrast, the double mutant was not affected by Mn2+, not even at a high concentration of the divalent cation (not shown). In order to further characterize the mutant fragments, we tested their biological activity by microinjection studies. For this purpose, the wild-type toxin fragment or the mutant toxins were injected into HeLa cells. As reported recently for C. difficile toxin B, microinjection of the wild-type fragment LT546 induced the typical morphological changes observed after treatment of cells with the holotoxin (Fig.7 A). Changes occurred 30 min after treatment of cells. In contrast to these findings, no change in cell morphology was observed, even 4 h after microinjection, when the single mutant D288ALT546 (Fig. 7 C) or D286ALT546 (not shown) or the double mutant protein D286AD288ALT546 (Fig.7 D) was applied. We also mutated various other amino acid residues that are conserved in all clostridial toxins and are located in the region of the DXD motif (Fig. 1). We tested the mutants K278ALT546, G281ALT546, G282ALT546, and P291ALT546 for transferase activity with Ras as a substrate. As can be seen in Fig.8, all of these mutants exhibited similar properties with respect to both glucosyltransferase and glucohydrolase activity as compared with the wild-type toxin fragment, indicating no essential roles in catalysis. Moreover, these mutants were fully active after microinjection into culture cells (shown for K278ALT546; Fig.7 B) and could be labeled by [β-32P]5N3-UDP-glucose (shown for G282ALT546; Fig. 5). By contrast, exchange of amino acid residues Tyr284, Asp270, or Arg273 to alanine decreased the enzyme activity, whereas the transferase and glycohydrolase activity of the Tyr284 mutant was reduced by 40- and 50-fold, respectively (Fig. 9). The glucosyltransferase activities of the D270ALT546 and R273ALT546 mutants were reduced by at least 200-fold (Fig. 9), and no glucohydrolase activity was detected (Fig. 9 C). Whereas microinjection of the Y284ALT546 mutant induced the typical cytotoxicity, the D270ALT546 and R273ALT546 mutants exhibited variable results. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that these mutant proteins possess a small cytotoxic activity dependent on the amount of toxin microinjected. Recently, we and others reported that the N terminus of C. difficile toxin B and of the lethal toxin from C. sordellii harbors the glucosyltransferase activity of the toxins (20Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Hofmann F. Busch C. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Barroso L.A. Montcrief J.S. Lyerly D.M. Wilkins T.D. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 16: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we continued the structure-function analysis of this family of large clostridial cytotoxins and report the demonstration that a small motif formed by two aspartic acid residues (DXD) appears to be essential for enzyme activity of the toxins. Changes of the aspartic acid residues at positions 286 and 288 of C. sordellii lethal toxin to alanine or asparagine reduced the enzyme activity by at least 5000-fold. Microinjection studies corroborated that these mutant proteins had lost their cytotoxic activity. Because the amino acid exchanges blocked transferase and glycohydrolase activity but did not cause major changes in the sensitivity toward trypsin digestion, we suggest that these aspartic acid residues are essentially involved in the enzyme activity of the toxin. The finding that also in C. difficile toxin B changes of the DXD motif caused inhibition of the enzyme activity supports their essential role. In fact, these aspartic acid residues appear to form a highly conserved motif (DXD), which is present not only in all large clostridial cytotoxins but also in a large number of different eukaryotic transferases (26Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the DXD motif is essential for the Golgi α-1,3-mannosyltransferase Mnn1p of S. cerevisiae (26Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The same motif, which is frequently surrounded by a hydrophobic region, was recognized in several related transferases such as in β-1,4-galactosyltransferases, α-1,3-galactosyltransferases, glucuronyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, glycogenins, and others (26Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this motif is observed also in various bacterial glycosyltransferases like LPS synthases. Of all of the glycosyltransferases containing the DXD motif, those showing most similarity to the clostridial toxins in the region surrounding the motif were members of the family related to the Och1p α-1,6-mannosyltransferase (Fig. 1). It has been suggested that the DXD motif participates in the coordination of the divalent cation by glycosyltransferases (26Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the activity of C. sordellii lethal toxin depends on the presence of Mn2+ ions (11Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies in our laboratory indicate that the activities of all large clostridial cytotoxins depend on Mn2+ions. 2H. Genth, K. Aktories, F. Hofmann, C. Busch, and I. Just, manuscript in preparation. Divalent cations (mostly manganese ions) are suggested to be important for the binding of the nucleotide-sugar that serves in all glycosyltransferases as the cosubstrate (25Tsopanakis A.D. Herries D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The notion that the DXD motif is somehow involved in the UDP-glucose binding of LT is supported by the photoaffinity studies with azido-UDP-glucose. The wild-type fragment of LT was radiolabeled in the presence of [β-32P]5N3-UDP-glucose after UV irradiation. The incorporation of azido-UDP-glucose was specific by the criterion of competitive inhibition induced by excess unlabeled UDP-glucose. By contrast, mutants of the DXD motif were not photoaffinity-labeled in the presence of the azido-UDP-glucose derivative. Interestingly, at high concentrations of Mn2+ions, the activity of the single DXD mutants was largely increased (about 20-fold), whereas the double mutants exhibited no activity even in the presence of 10 mm Mn2+. If the DXD motif is indeed involved in divalent cation binding, it is feasible that the presence of one aspartic acid residue of the DXD motif allows binding of Mn2+ and UDP-glucose, albeit with lower affinity, explaining the increase in activity with high concentrations of manganese ions. However, it should be noted that, even at high concentrations of Mn2+, the activities of the single DXD mutants were reduced by several hundred-fold as compared with the wild-type LT fragment. Moreover, we did not observe photoaffinity labeling of 5-azido-UDP-glucose with the single DXD mutants even at high Mn2+concentrations (not shown). In addition to the DXD motif, we changed several other amino acid residues that are located in the same region and are highly conserved within the family of large clostridial cytotoxins. Exchange of the glycine doublet (Gly281/Gly282), which was conserved not only in the clostridial glucosyltransferases but also in the yeast Och1p family of mannosyltransferases, did not change the enzyme activity of the mutant toxin. Unaltered activity was also observed with the mutant K278ALT546. However, we observed a 50-fold reduction with the mutant Y284ALT546 and an about 200-fold reduction in activity with the D270ALT546 and R273ALT546 mutants. However, all of these mutations did not show as large a decrease in activity as that observed with the DXD motif mutants, suggesting that these amino acid residues play not a direct role in catalysis. Nevertheless, those residues that showed the most effect after exchange apart from the DXD motif are also conserved in the Och1p family. The full enzyme activity and cytotoxicity (after microinjection) ofC. difficile toxin B and of C. sordellii lethal toxin depend on the presence of the N-terminal 546 amino acid residues of the holotoxins. The amino acid sequences of these fragments are about 75% identical, showing no major changes in the similarity of amino acid sequences in the area around the DXD motif. Most distantly related in their primary structure are C. novyiα-toxin and C. sordellii lethal toxin with only 35% amino acid sequence identity at the N terminus (amino acids 1–546 of LT; amino acids 1–551 of α-toxin). However, a stretch of 30 amino acid residues between amino acid residues 264 and 294 is about 73% identical. Part of this highly conserved region is the DXD motif. Thus, from the data reported in this paper, we conclude that this region is essential for enzyme activity and most likely part of or near the active site of the glucosylating toxins.

Here we describe the cloning of the genes for the 58- and 55-kDa subunits using peptide sequence analysis and searching of the yeast genome data base. The 58-kDa subunit, encoded by the POL31 gene, shows 23–28% sequence similarity to the 48-kDa subunit of human Polδ and to S. pombe Cdc1. POL31 is allelic toHYS2 and SDP5.

Very limited sequence similarity was observed between Pol32p andSchizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc27, the functionally analogous subunit in S. pombe Polδ. The POL32 gene is not essential, but a deletion mutant shows cold sensitivity for growth and is sensitive to hydroxyurea and DNA damaging agents. In addition, lethality was observed when the POL32 deletion mutation was combined with conditional mutations in either the POL3 orPOL31 gene. Pol32Δ strains are weak antimutators and are defective for damage-induced mutagenesis. ThePOL32 gene product binds proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

This insight is based on extensive in vitro studies using the simian 40 virus as a model system, and on genetic and biochemical studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (reviewed in Refs. 1Sugino A.

These genetic studies have not only shown a role for Polδ in bulk DNA replication but also for maintaining genome fidelity via the proofreading exonuclease activity of this enzyme (3Morrison A.

The small subunit is required for efficient stimulation of the polymerase processivity by the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (9Zhou J.Q. He H. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G.

Our previous studies of S. cerevisiae Polδ indicated that the enzyme might consist of three or more subunits (11Bauer G.A. Heller H.M. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, Polδ has been isolated from S. pombe as an enzyme with five distinct subunits, four of which also appear to be subunits based on genetic arguments (12Zuo S.J. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Wang T. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe an improved purification of S. cerevisiae Polδ as a three-subunit enzyme, the cloning of the two small subunits of Polδ, and a genetic and biochemical analysis of those subunits. Surprisingly, deletion of the gene for the smallest subunit, POl32, was not a lethal mutation. Nevertheless, it resulted in a phenotype consistent with its involvement in DNA replication. We also show that this subunit interacts with PCNA. In the accompanying article (55Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the properties of a two-subunit form of Polδ, which is analogous to mammalian Polδ, is compared with the three-subunit form. The Escherichia coli strains used were DH5α, BL21 (DE3), and ABLE-C, lac(lacZω−)[KanR McrA- McrCB- McrF- Mrr- HsdR(rK- mK-)][F′ proAB lacIqZDM15 Tn10 (TetR)]. Some of the plasmids containing the POL32 gene were toxic to E. coli. They were successfully propagated in ABLE-C cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) which maintained these plasmids at a reduced copy number. The yeast strains are listed in TableI. Most strains were constructed using standard genetic methods. To obtain a “START to STOP”POL32 deletion strain, the HIS3 gene was PCR amplified with two-hybrid POL32-HIS3 primers as described (13Baudin A. Ozier-Karogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The PCR product was used to transform diploid strain YM4590 to His+. Correct integration of HIS3 in thePOL32 locus was confirmed by PCR with appropriate primers and by Southern analysis. The resulting diploid was sporulated to give PY74a. To obtain additional POL32 deletion mutants, genomic DNA from PY74 was PCR amplified with two primers which were located about 330 nucleotides upstream and 250 nucleotides downstream of theHIS3 integration site, respectively, and the appropriatehis3 strains, e.g. PY116, transformed with the PCR product to His+, PY117 (Table I). Proper integration and loss of the POL32 gene were confirmed by PCR and by Southern analysis.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceBJ405MATα trp1 prb1–1122 prc1–407 pep4–3.E.

Desired isogenic haploid strains were obtained that were either pol32Δ,cdc2-1, or both, and were in addition ura3-52 and contained pBL384. These strains were transformed with plasmid pBL389. Subsequently, isolates which had lost plasmid pBL384 were obtained by growth on tryptophan-containing media, resulting in strains PY131, PY132, and PY130, respectively (Table I). A derivative of PY130 that contained both plasmids pBL384 and pBL389 was also used in the analysis (Table III). Pol31 ts (hys2-1) mutant strain KSH542 was transformed with centromere plasmid pBL331 (POL31 TRP1). In this plasmid-containing strain, thePOL32 gene was deleted by integrative transformation with the HIS3 cassette as described above. This strain was then transformed with plasmid pBL389 and subsequently, isolates that had lost plasmid pBL331 were obtained by growth on tryptophan-containing media, resulting in strain PY133 (Table I). A derivative of PY133 which contained both plasmids pBL331 and pBL389 was also used in the analysis (Table III).Table IIIPlasmid loss in double mutantsStrainChromosomal genotypeAdditional plasmidPlasmid loss%PY130pol32Δ pol3ts0PY130pol32Δ pol3tspBL38430PY131pol32Δ POL355PY132POL32 pol3ts80PY133pol32Δ pol31ts0PY133pol32Δ pol31tspBL33130KSH542-1POL32 pol31ts80All strains contained centromere plasmid pBL389 (POL32 URA3) The strains were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” Their genotypes are given in Table I.

LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Standard media were used as described (14Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). YPDA medium is yeast extract/peptone/dextrose with 20 μg/ml adenine. Hydroxyurea (75 mm final concentration) was added to YPDA after autoclaving. With the exception of pBL385, all plasmids in this study are derived from standard ColE1 based AmpR vectors. Gene coordinates are based on those given in theSaccharomyces genome data base (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/) with the first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon defined as +1. In the genome data base the POL31 (HYS2,SDP5) gene is YJR006w and the POL32 gene is YJR043c. Plasmid pBL331 contains a genomic XbaI-SalIPOL31 fragment (coordinates −139 to +2044) cloned into theSpeI-SalI sites of pRS314 (Bluescript ARS CEN TRP1) (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The POL31 gene was PCR amplified with an amino-terminal primer which introduces an NcoI site at the initiation codon position and a carboxyl-terminal primer which extends beyond the genomic PvuII site (coordinate +1559). The NcoI-PvuII fragment was cloned into theNcoI-HindIII (filled) sites of pPY55, thereby putting the POL31 gene under control of the phage T7 promoter (16Percival K.J. Klein M.B. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2593-2598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is plasmid pBL361. The accuracy of the amplified DNA was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. pBL384 contains a 2.2-kilobase yeast genomic SpeI-PstI fragment (coordinates −542 to +1656) cloned into theSpeI-PstI sites of pRS314 (Bluescript ARS CEN TRP1). pBL389 was derived from pBL384 by recloningPOL32 into pRS316 (Bluescript ARS CEN URA3) using appropriate polylinker restriction sites. The POL32 gene in pBL384 was PCR amplified with a primer which introduces aBclI site at nucleotides 3–8 and a carboxyl-terminal primer which extends beyond the HincII site (nucleotides +1113). The BclI (filled)-HincII fragment was cloned into the NcoI (filled)-SalI (filled) sites of pMON5839 (pACYCori KanR) putting the gene under control of the Ptac-G10L promoter-leader. This is plasmid pBL385. The plasmids used in the two-hybrid analysis were made in vector pCH435 (derived from pGBT8 by insertion of a more extensive polylinker; a gift of Dr. Chris Hardy, Washington University) for fusions to the bacterial lexA DNA-binding domain, and in pACT2 for fusions to the yeastGAL4 activation domain. In the POL30,POL31, and POL32 fusion constructs, the translational start sites of these genes were placed at appropriate polylinker sites, whereas in the POL3 construct theNcoI site at amino acid 9 was used for fusions. The resulting fusion plasmids were pBL237 (lexA-POL30), pBL240 (GAL4AD-POL30), pBL323 (GAL4AD-POL3), pBL363 (lexA-POL31), pBL364 (GAL4AD-POL31), pBL390 (lexA-POL32), and pBL391 (GAL4AD-POL32). The purification is largely based on the one published previously (11Bauer G.A. Heller H.M. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, all buffers contained 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmNaHSO3, 2 μm pepstatin A, and 4 μm leupeptin. The NaCl concentration in millimolar in the buffer is indicated with a subscript. Strain BJ405 was grown, broken open, and fractionated with ammonium sulfate as described before (11Bauer G.A. Heller H.M. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ammonium sulfate precipitate from 2 kg of yeast cells was resuspended in 500 ml of GF buffer (25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) and passed through a 4000-ml Bio-Gel P-4 desalting column in the same buffer. The desalted material contained residual ammonium sulfate and was diluted with buffer GF to obtain a conductivity equivalent to GF80. It was batch-absorbed to 500 ml of S-Sepharose equilibrated in GF50. The beads were washed with 1000 ml of GF100 and eluted with 1200 ml of GF600. Protein-containing fractions (500 ml) were dialyzed against 2 × 3 liters of buffer QS (40 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.3) for 4 and 16 h. The dialysate which had a conductivity equivalent to QS40 was cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto a 300-ml Q-Sepharose HR column (Pharmacia). After washing with 2 column volumes of QS40the column was eluted with a 3-liter linear gradient of Q40to Q500. This step separated Polδ from the other DNA polymerases. The Polδ-containing fractions eluted early in the gradient at ∼QS150–200. They were loaded on a 100-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated in GF buffer containing 50 mm ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 200 ml of the same buffer and eluted with a 1200-ml linear gradient from 50 to 700 mm ammonium sulfate in buffer GF. The Polδ-containing fractions eluted late in the gradient at ∼400–500 mmammonium sulfate. They were dialyzed against 2 volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 15 ml of buffer PR (30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.2% ampholytes 3.5–9, and no glycerol, no Nonidet P-40) containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. Just prior to injection onto the HPLC column, 3 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate was added to bring the final ammonium sulfate concentration to 1.8 m in buffer PR. The suspension was injected onto a 20-ml propyl-silica gel HPLC column in PR containing 1.8 mammonium sulfate and the column eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient from 1.8 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer PR. Polδ eluted prior to bulk protein early in the gradient at ∼1.2–1.3m ammonium sulfate. Fractions were dialyzed against buffer MS (30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% ampholytes 3.5–9) until the conductivity was equivalent to that of MS100 and fractionated on a 1-ml MonoS column with a 15-ml gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer MS. The active fractions which eluted at 300–400 mm NaCl were diluted with 2 volumes of buffer MQ (30 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.3, no NaHSO3, 0.1% ampholytes 3.5–9) and fractionated on a 0.3-ml MonoQ column with a 5-ml linear gradient from 50 to 500 mm NaCl in MQ buffer. Polδ eluted as a single peak at MQ200. Polδ MonoQ fraction (30 μg) was concentrated by acetone precipitation and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, appropriate gel slices were excised and treated with lysyl endopeptidase as described (17Kawasaki H. Emori Y. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The peptides were recovered from the gel slices by centrifugation through a nylon mesh (18Kobayashi M. Hiura N. Matsuda K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They were separated by reverse phase HPLC and sequenced by the protein chemistry facility at Washington University. Strain BL21 (DE3) contained pBL361 (POL31), pBL385 (POL32), or both. A single colony was grown overnight in 10 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, or both, and inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium at 37 °C. When the OD595reached 0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture shaken for another 3 h at 37 °C. The culture was then harvested and the cells suspended in 5 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10% sucrose, and an equal volume of 2 × lysis buffer was added (lysis buffer is 50 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 μmleupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin A, 5 mm sodium bisulfite, and 3 mm dithiothreitol). All further steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Lysozyme was added to 0.6 mg/ml and the mixture was stored on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. Nonidet P-40 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were then added to 0.05% and 1 mm, respectively, and, after another 10 min on ice, the mixture was sonicated to reduce the viscosity. After a spin at 27,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was washed with 10 ml of wash buffer (lysis buffer, except that the pH of the Tris-HCl was reduced to 7.5 and NaCl was added to 2 m final). After repeating the wash procedure, the precipitate was homogenized with 10 ml of denaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 m urea, 2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was shaken gently for 1 h and spun for 30 min at 27,000 ×g. The supernatant was diluted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml with denaturation buffer and dialyzed for 2 × 3 h against 2 × 200 ml of dialysis buffer (40 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm pepstatin A, 10 mm NaHSO3, 2 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 mmammonium sulfate). The solution was cleared by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). 200-μl samples were injected onto a 20-ml Superose 12 column in 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10% ethylene glycol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.2m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmNaHSO3, and 2 μm each of leupeptin and pepstatin A. The column was run at 25 °C at 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 300 μl were collected and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein-protein interaction blots were carried out with a PCNA derivative containing an amino-terminal phosphorylatable tag, Ph-PCNA, MRRASVGS-PCNA. Ph-PCNA was overproduced in E. coli from plasmid pMM83 (a gift of Michael McAlear, Wesleyan University) and purified as wild-type PCNA (20Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The replication properties of Ph-PCNA were indistinguishable from wild-type (data not shown). Phosphorylation of 1 μg of Ph-PCNA was carried out in a 50-μl reaction containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 3 units of bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase (catalytic subunit, Sigma) at 30 °C for 30 min. The labeled protein was passed through a Sephadex G-50 column, equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, to remove unincorporated radioactivity. All blotting steps were carried out at room temperature. Yeast Polδ or urea extracts from E. coli cell lysate pellets were electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the proteins transferred electrophoretically to GeneScreen. The membrane was equilibrated in Buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), then incubated for 10 min in 7 guanidinium hydrochloride in buffer A, followed by sequential 2-fold dilutions with buffer A for 10 min each until a concentration of 0.4m guanidinium was reached. The membrane was then immersed for 10 min in Buffer A, followed by incubation in 5% nonfat milk in buffer A for 10 min and 25% fetal calf serum in Buffer A for 20 min to block the membrane. The membrane was probed with 100 ng/ml of32P-labeled Ph-PCNA (1–2 × 106 cpm/ml) in Buffer A containing 25% fetal calf serum for 2 h at room temperature, then washed in 2 × 50 ml of buffer A for 1–2 min, and processed for autoradiography (21Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 50-μl reaction contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgAc2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 80 μm each dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, 20 μm [3H]dTTP (400 cpm/pmol), 200 μg/ml activated salmon sperm DNA, 1 mm spermidine, and enzyme. Assays were assembled on ice and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. They were stopped by addition of 100 μl of 25 mm EDTA, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, followed by 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 10 min on ice, the mixture was filtered over a GF/C filter. The filter was washed with 2 × 2 ml of 1 m HCl, 0.05 m sodium pyrophosphate, rinsed with ethanol, dried, and counted in a counting fluid in a liquid scintillation counter. One unit of enzyme incorporates 1 pmol/min of nucleotide into acid-insoluble radioactivity. When inhibition by BuPhdGTP was measured, the concentration of dGTP was lowered to 10 μm. To measure forward mutation rates to canavanine resistance, PY82 or PY83 cells were grown to saturation in YPDA broth, diluted to approximately 100 cells/ml in 20 separate cultures for each strain, and again grown to saturation in YPD. Cells were then plated on complete synthetic media without arginine and with 80 μg/ml canavanine (14Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Colonies appearing after 4 days of growth at 30 °C were counted. Reversion or suppression of the lys2-1 ochre mutation was measured similarly in strains PY71 and PY125. Plating was on synthetic complete media lacking lysine. 20-ml cultures of PY82 and PY83 each were grown to saturation at 30 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with water, resuspended to 5 × 107 cells/ml in 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, briefly sonicated to disperse clumped cells, and treated with 0.75% MMS at room temperature. Aliquots were quenched in an equal volume of 10% cold Na2S2O3. The cultures were either further diluted and plated on complete synthetic medium lacking arginine to determine survival, or concentrated 4-fold and plated on complete synthetic medium without arginine and with 80 μg/ml canavanine to determine mutation frequencies. Several canavanine plates were used to obtain mutation frequency data points when survival was low. To obtain UV-survival curves and UV-induced mutagenesis frequencies, the sonicated cells in phosphate buffer were plated on the two media and immediately irradiated with the indicated doses of UV light. Colonies appearing after 4 days of growth at 30 °C were counted. Our attempts to obtain acceptable quantities of Polδ based on the original purification scheme were hampered by several problems relating to enzyme instability, enzyme loss, and proteolysis (11Bauer G.A. Heller H.M. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, use of a mildly hydrophobic HPLC column (propyl silica gel) resulted in large losses in yield and activity. Yet this matrix appeared very desirable as it greatly separated Polδ from bulk protein. We found that inclusion of broad-range ampholytes (3.5–9) in the buffers substantially increased both yield and activity of Polδ, in particular when silica gel columns were used. Therefore, ampholytes were included in all columns starting at the propyl silica gel step. The purification is summarized in Table II.Table IIPurification of PolδStepMgUnits (× 10−3)Units/mg (× 10−3)Ammonium sulfate16,0009,2000.6S-Sepharose2,4007,8003.2Q-Sepharose HR3551,8005.0Heparin-agarose751,50015Propyl silica gel0.9650720MonoS0.384201,100MonoQ0.233001,300One unit of polymerase incorporates 1 pmol/min of nucleotide into acid-insoluble radioactivity using activated DNA as a template-primer.

See “Materials and Methods” for details. Analysis of the final preparation by SDS-PAGE showed three polypeptides of 125, 58, and 55 kDa which copurified (Fig.1). The presence of the 55-kDa polypeptide had varied considerably between preparations of Polδ. It was present at apparent stoichiometrical levels in some preparations (11Bauer G.A. Heller H.M. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but virtually absent from others (22Bauer G.A. Burgers P.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7506-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This variation was found to be due to highly variable staining intensity of this subunit with silver. The silver staining method by Morrissey (23Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar) gave the most consistent results and confirmed that the 55-kDa polypeptide was present in all preparations of Polδ analyzed (data not shown). When 30 μg of Polδ was separated by SDS-PAGE in preparation for peptide sequencing and the gel stained by Coomassie, the same three polypeptides and no significant levels of other polypeptides were observed (data not shown). Amino acid sequence analysis resulted in only one short peptide sequence for the 58-kDa subunit (Fig. 2). A BLAST search of the complete yeast data base revealed only one perfect match to this sequence, but there were several other genes with only one mismatch. The perfect match was with HYS2. This gene was initially isolated in a screen for yeast mutants which confer hydroxyurea-sensitive cell growth (24Sugimoto K. Sakamoto Y. T"
https://openalex.org/W2153262927,"Yeast DNA polymerase δ (Polδ) consists of three subunits encoded by the POL3, POL31, andPOL32 genes. Each of these genes was cloned under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1–10 promoter and overexpressed in various combinations. Overexpression of all three genes resulted in a 30-fold overproduction of Polδ, which was identical in enzymatic properties to Polδ isolated from a wild-type yeast strain. Whereas overproduction of POL3 together withPOL32 did not lead to an identifiable Pol3p·Pol32p complex, a chromatographically distinct and novel complex was identified upon overproduction of POL3 andPOL31. This two-subunit complex, designated Polδ*, is structurally and functionally analogous to mammalian Polδ. The properties of Polδ* and Polδ were compared. A gel filtration analysis showed that Polδ* is a heterodimer (Pol3p·Pol31p) and Polδ a dimer of a heterotrimer, (Pol3p·Pol31p·Pol32p)2. In the absence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Polδ* showed a processivity of 2–3 on poly(dA)·oligo(dT) compared with 5–10 for Polδ. In the presence of PCNA, both enzymes were fully processive on this template. DNA replication by Polδ* on a natural DNA template was dependent on PCNA and on replication factor C. However, Polδ*-mediated DNA synthesis proceeded inefficiently and was characterized by frequent pause sites. Reconstitution of Polδ was achieved upon addition of Pol32p to Polδ*.

SCGL medium contains per liter: 1.7 g of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 5 g of ammonium sulfate, 30 ml of glycerol, 20 ml of lactic acid, 1 g of glucose, 20 g of agar for solid media, 20 mg each of adenine, uracil, histidine, tryptophan, proline, arginine, and methionine, 30 mg each of isoleucine, tyrosine, and lysine, 50 mg of phenylalanine, and 100 mg each of leucine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, valine, threonine, and serine. Uracil, tryptophan, and/or leucine were omitted when appropriate to ensure the selective maintenance of plasmids. Prior to autoclaving, the pH of the media was adjusted to 5–6 with concentrated sodium hydroxide. After 2–3 days when the OD660 had reached 0.8–1, the culture was used to inoculate 1200 ml of SCGL media. After overnight growth, when the OD660 was about 1, 1200 ml of YPGL were added. YPGL contains per liter: 10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone, 30 ml of glycerol, 20 ml of lactic acid, 2 g of glucose, and 20 mg of adenine. Prior to autoclaving, the pH of the media was adjusted to 5–6 with concentrated sodium hydroxide. The culture was equally divided over two 4-liter flasks and grown at 30 °C for 3 h. Solid galactose (2% final concentration) was then added to each flask and after 4 h of continuous shaking the cells were harvested.Enzyme PurificationAll steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. The following buffers were used: buffer A: 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 175 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm DTT, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.5 mm p-methylphenylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine,10 mmNaHSO3.

Salt concentrations (as NaCl) are indicated by a suffix, e.g. BufferA500 = Buffer A + 500 mm NaCl. Buffers were precooled on ice water.Bead beating was carried out in a 350-ml chamber containing 175 ml of glass beads (0.4–0.5 mm diameter) and 80–100 g, wet weight, of cells, resuspended in an equal volume of 2 × buffer A. The chamber was cooled in ice water and the beater turned on for 45 s, followed by a cooling period of 2 min, for a total beating time of 5 min. The lysate was poured in a cold graduated cylinder and the beads were washed with 50 ml of extraction buffer. An aliquot was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min (cleared lysate, see Table I). The volume of the crude lysate was measured and 40 μl of 10% Polymin P were added per ml of lysate. After 5 min of mixing, the lysate was spun for 40 min at 13,000 rpm in a GSA rotor. Solid ammonium sulfate (0.28 g/ml) was added to the supernatant and dissolved by stirring. The precipitate was collected at 13,000 rpm for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer B. After dialysis against 2 × 500 ml of buffer B for 8 h each, the dialysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 20 min.Table IOverproduction of PolδPOL genesRelative DNA polymerase activityLysate(NH4)2SO4PCMonoQaPolδ activity only.None (vector)1111POL31 + POL321.2POL3821.52.2POL3 + POL3114121317bIncludes Polδ* activity.POL3 + POL3292.52.22.6POL3 + POL31 + POL3220221832DNA polymerase assays on activated DNA were carried out in the presence of BuPhdGTP to eliminate most of the contribution due to Polα.

The following buffers were used: buffer A: 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 175 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm DTT, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.5 mm p-methylphenylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine,10 mmNaHSO3. Buffer B consisted of 25 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.5 mm p-phenylsulfonyl fluoride. Buffer C was 30 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm DTT, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, 5 mm NaHSO3. Buffer D was 30 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, 2 μm pepstatin A, 2 μmleupeptin, 0.1% (v/v) ampholytes 3.5–9. Salt concentrations (as NaCl) are indicated by a suffix, e.g. BufferA500 = Buffer A + 500 mm NaCl. Buffers were precooled on ice water.Bead beating was carried out in a 350-ml chamber containing 175 ml of glass beads (0.4–0.5 mm diameter) and 80–100 g, wet weight, of cells, resuspended in an equal volume of 2 × buffer A. The chamber was cooled in ice water and the beater turned on for 45 s, followed by a cooling period of 2 min, for a total beating time of 5 min. The lysate was poured in a cold graduated cylinder and the beads were washed with 50 ml of extraction buffer. An aliquot was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min (cleared lysate, see Table I). The volume of the crude lysate was measured and 40 μl of 10% Polymin P were added per ml of lysate. After 5 min of mixing, the lysate was spun for 40 min at 13,000 rpm in a GSA rotor. Solid ammonium sulfate (0.28 g/ml) was added to the supernatant and dissolved by stirring. The precipitate was collected at 13,000 rpm for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer B. After dialysis against 2 × 500 ml of buffer B for 8 h each, the dialysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 20 min.Table IOverproduction of PolδPOL genesRelative DNA polymerase activityLysate(NH4)2SO4PCMonoQaPolδ activity only.None (vector)1111POL31 + POL321.2POL3821.52.2POL3 + POL3114121317bIncludes Polδ* activity.POL3 + POL3292.52.22.6POL3 + POL31 + POL3220221832DNA polymerase assays on activated DNA were carried out in the presence of BuPhdGTP to eliminate most of the contribution due to Polα.

In this study, we report that ASP does not only affect mature melanocytes but can also inhibit the differentiation of melanoblasts. We show that both αMSH and forskolin promote the differentiation of murine melanoblasts into mature melanocytes and that ASP inhibits this process. We present evidence that the expression of a specific melanogenic transcription factor, microphthalmia, and its binding to an M box regulatory element, is inhibited by ASP. We also show that, in B16 murine melanoma cells, ASP inhibits αMSH-stimulated expression of tyrosinase, tyrosine-related proteins 1 and 2 through an inhibition of the transcription activity of their respective promoters. Further, ASP inhibits αMSH-induced expression of the microphthalmia gene and reduces the level of microphthalmia in the cells. Our data demonstrate that ASP can regulate both melanoblast differentiation and melanogenesis, pointing out the key role of microphthalmia in the control of these processes.

Our data demonstrate that ASP can regulate both melanoblast differentiation and melanogenesis, pointing out the key role of microphthalmia in the control of these processes. Melanocytes are present in the skin and hair follicles as a dispersed population of differentiated cells, after they migrated along the dorsolateral pathway from the neural crest, as nonpigmented precursors, the melanoblasts (1Le Douarin N. Dupin E. Baroffio A. Dulac C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 138: 269-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In mature melanocytes, melanin synthesis involves three specifically expressed enzymes: tyrosinase (2Hearing V.J. Jimenez M. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1) 1The abbreviations used are: TRP, tyrosinase-related protein; ASP, agouti signal protein; αMSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; mi, microphthalmia; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; MC1R, melanocortin 1 receptor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: TRP, tyrosinase-related protein; ASP, agouti signal protein; αMSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; mi, microphthalmia; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; MC1R, melanocortin 1 receptor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) that control the quantity and the type of melanins. Indeed, two types of melanins are synthesized during melanogenesis; pheomelanins that are yellow to red pigments and eumelanins that are black to brown. Tyrosinase, which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of this process, is required for synthesis of both melanin types, while TRP1 and TRP2 appear to be involved mainly in eumelanin synthesis (5Burchill S.A. Thody A.J. Ito S. J. Endocrinol. 1986; 109: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, a transcription factor, belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix family, named microphthalmia (Mi in mouse and MITF in human) and expressed in a limited number of tissues such as heart, mast cells, osteoclast precursors, and melanocytes, has been involved in melanocyte survival, development, and differentiation (6Hodgkinson C.A.

Similarly, mutation in the human homologue of the mouse microphthalmia gene has been linked to abnormal pigmentation observed in Waardenburg syndrome type II-A (9Hughes A.E. Newton V.E. Liu X.Z.

Further, studies have shown that Mi through binding to the M box (a highly conserved 10-base pair motif, GTCATGTGCT) strongly stimulates tyrosinase (11Yasumoto K. Yokoyama K. Shibata K. Tomita Y. Shibahara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8058-8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), TRP1 (12Yavuzer U. Keenan E. Lowings P. Vachtenheim G. Currie G. Goding C.R.

The relative amount of eumelanin and pheomelanin pigments in mammals is controlled by the genetic loci agouti andextension; extension encodes the receptor for α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH), also called the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and agouti encodes a 131-amino acid protein containing a signal sequence, the agouti-signal protein (ASP) (14Takeuchi T.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). ASP, which is produced in the dermal papilla cells within the hair follicle, acts on follicular melanocytes to switch them from eumelanin to pheomelanin production (19Miller M.W. Duhl D.M.J.

In humans, the mechanism that controls the class of melanin synthesized (eumelanin or pheomelanin) has not been elucidated. It is well established that αMSH increases the synthesis of eumelanin in human melanocytes (18Suzuki I. Cone R. Im S. Nordlund J. Abdel-Malek Z.

A human homologue for the mouse agouti locus has been cloned and its product functions similarly to the mouse proteinin vivo and in vitro (22Kwon H.Y. Bultman S.J. Löffler C. Chen W.J. Furdon P.J.

Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Barsh G.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); however, its physiological function in humans remains to be elucidated. ASP seems to act as an antagonist of αMSH signaling mediated by the mouse melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R). However, its mechanism of action is still controversial. This effect appears to be mediated in part by the ability of ASP to act as an inhibitor of αMSH binding to the MC1R (24Lu D. Willard D. Patel I.R. Kadwell S. Overton L. Kost T. Luther M. Chen W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed ASP also inhibits the melanogenic activity of agents such as forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP, which mimic the effects of αMSH but act downstream of the MC1R (31Suzuki I. Tada A. Ollmann M.M. Barsh G.S. Im S. Lamoreux M.L. Hearing V.J. Nordlund J.J. Abdel-Malek Z.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 838-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vivo, it has been clearly shown that ASP decreases eumelanin synthesis due to a slight inhibition of the tyrosinase activity and to an almost complete loss of TRP1 and TRP2 expression (32Kobayashi T. Viera W.D. Potterf B. Sakai C. Imokawa G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2301-2309PubMed Google Scholar). In human or murine cultured cells, ASP inhibits eumelanin synthesis, cell proliferation, tyrosinase activity and reduces the level of TRP1 without significantly altering the level of tyrosinase (30Sakai C.

To further understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of melanogenesis by agouti protein, we studied its effect on tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 expression and on the transcription activities of the corresponding promoters in B16 melanoma cells. Further, we investigated the effect of ASP on microphthalmia, a transcription factor that mediates, through its binding to an M box motif upstream of the TATA box, the activation of tyrosinase, TRP1 and TRP2 promoter by cAMP elevating agents (13Bertolotto C.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, we address the question of whether ASP inhibits the cAMP- or αMSH-induced differentiation of melanoblasts into functional melanocytes. Using melb-a cells, a cloned immortal line of murine melanoblasts inducible to differentiate to melanocytes, we show that αMSH and forskolin promote the differentiation of melanoblasts into melanocytes, a process that can be partially prevented by agouti signal protein. Forskolin, α melanocyte-stimulating hormone ([Nle4, d-Phe7]-αMSH), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, β-glycerophosphate, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin were from Sigma. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was from Promega. RPMI medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, trypsin, and LipofectAMINE reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal calf serum was from Hyclone. The C5 monoclonal antibody was raised against a histidine fusion protein expressed from the amino-terminalTaq-sac fragment of human MITF cDNA and produces a specific gel mobility super shift with microphthalmia, but not with the related proteins TFE3, TFEB, and TFEC (35Weilbaecher K.N.

The αPEP7, αPEP1, and αPEP8 polyclonal antibodies were raised against the carboxyl termini of, respectively, mouse tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 proteins. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and rabbit antibodies were from Dakopatts. Mouse ASP was purified from the medium of a T. ni baculovirus expression system (36Willard D.H. Bodnar W. Harris C. Kiefer L. Nichols J.S. Blanchard S. Hoffman C. Moyer M. Burkhart W. Weiel J. Luther M.A. Wilkison W.O. Rocque W.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12341-12346Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The melb-a line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (20 nm), bFGF (1 ng/ml), fetal calf serum (5%), and glutamine (2 mm) without feeder cells. To induce differentiation, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and bFGF were replaced by forskolin (20 μm) or αMSH (10 nm) and fetal calf serum was 10%. Melanoblasts were treated 24 h after plating and every 48 h for 6 days (a total of three treatments). In the conditions where ASP was added with forskolin or αMSH, a 15-min preincubation period was performed. B16-F10 melanoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. Melb-a cells were treated with 10 nm αMSH or 20 μm forskolin in the presence or absence of 1 μm ASP for a total of 6 days as described above. For B16 melanoma cells, the treatment period was 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg/lane) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis. Following transblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (1 h at 100 V) and blocking in 5% nonfat milk in saline buffer, the membranes were incubated with αPEP7, αPEP1, and αPEP8, each at 1:3000 dilution. Microphthalmia protein was detected with the C5 monoclonal antibody at 1:10 dilution. To check equivalent loading and transfer of the gels, anti-ERK1 antibodies were used (1:3000). The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (1:4000). The immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence, using the ECL Amersham kit. l-Dopa colorimetric stain for tyrosinase was performed as described previously (37Jimenez-Cervantes C. Valverde P. Garcı́a-Borron J.C. Solano F. Lozano J.A. Pigment Cell Res. 1993; 6: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of total protein extracts were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, boiling was avoided, and the samples were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were equilibrated in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6). Colorimetric staining was carried out by incubating the gels for about 15 min at 37 °C in a solution of 1.5 mml-dopa and 4 mm 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). B16 melanoma cells were seeded in 24-well dishes, and transient transfections were performed the following day using 2 μl of LipofectAMINE and 0.35 μg of total plasmid DNA in a 200-μl final volume as indicated in the figure legends. After transfection, cells were incubated with 3 nmαMSH, in the presence or in the absence of 0.6 μm ASP. pCMV-β-galactosidase was transfected with the test plasmids to control the variability in transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, soluble extracts were harvested in 50 μl of lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The reporter plasmids, containing the 2.2-kilobase pair fragment of the mouse tyrosinase promoter, the 1.1-kilobase pair fragment of the mouse TRP1 promoter, and the 0.6-kilobase pair fragment of the human TRP2 promoter upstream from the luciferase reporter gene, were previously described (13Bertolotto C.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid containing the 2.1-kilobase pair fragment 5′ of the transcription start site of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene was isolated from SpMITF 1, kindly provided by Dr. Shibahara (38Fuse N. Yasumoto K.I. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Melb-a cells were stimulated for six days with 10 nm αMSH or 20 μm forskolin in the presence or absence of 1 μm ASP, and nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar), except that phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaVO4, 5 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) were added to the nuclear extraction buffer. A double-stranded synthetic tyrosinase M box probe (5′-GAAAAAGTCATGTGCTTTGCAGAAGA-3′) was γ-32P-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. One μg of nuclear protein was preincubated in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 80 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.1 μg poly(dI·dC), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm spermidine for 15 min on ice. Then 200,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe was added to the binding reaction for 10 min at room temperature. For antibody supershift assay, nuclear extracts were preincubated with 0.3 μl of the C5 monoclonal antibody directed against microphthalmia. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.5% TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 2 h at 100 V. After fixation in 7% acetic acid, gels were dried and autoradiographed. Quantitation of the bands were performed using the NIH Image 1.54 software. In B16 melanoma cells, it was shown that ASP inhibits tyrosinase activity and production of melanin (33Graham A. Wakamatsu K. Hunt G. Ito S. Thody A.J. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, regulation concerning the three melanogenic enzymes has not been investigated. Therefore, we performed Western blot experiments on B16 cells exposed for 48 h to 10 nm αMSH in the presence or absence of 1 μm ASP (Fig. 1). ASP almost completely abolished the αMSH-induced expression of tyrosinase. Potential inhibition of tyrosinase expression by ASP was not detectable under basal conditions owing to its low level of expression in B16 melanoma cells. In addition, ASP reduced both basal and αMSH-stimulated expressions of TRP1 and TRP2. To gain more insight into the mechanisms by which ASP modulates the expression of the three melanogenic enzymes, we studied the transcription regulation of their promoters. For this purpose, B16 cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding promoters and exposed to αMSH in the presence or absence of ASP. Tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 promoter activities were stimulated upon αMSH treatment (between 4- and 7-fold over basal levels). ASP partially inhibited basal activities (about 50% for all three promoters) and completely prevented the effect of αMSH on these promoter activities (Fig. 2). We have recently proposed that microphthalmia, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family, is involved in the regulation of tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 expression by cAMP-elevating agents (13Bertolotto C. Buscà R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Hence, we studied the effects of ASP treatment on the expression of microphthalmia and on its promoter activity. As seen by Western blot analysis, a 4-h incubation with αMSH-stimulated microphthalmia expression but this was completely inhibited upon ASP addition (Fig. 3,left). Further, microphthalmia promoter activity was up-regulated by αMSH (about 3-fold over basal), and this effect was dramatically blocked in the presence of ASP (Fig.3, right). These results demonstrate that the inhibition of melanogenic enzyme expression by ASP involves a transcriptional mechanism and a down-regulation of microphthalmia gene expression. Melb-a cells underwent differentiation in the presence of 20 μm forskolin or 10 nm αMSH for 1 week. We then evaluated tyrosinase activity by carrying out tyrosinase activity stains in polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (Fig.4). We observed an increased activity following αMSH and forskolin treatments that was significantly reduced by ASP. ASP also inhibited basal activity of tyrosinase. To demonstrate further that ASP inhibits αMSH- and forskolin-induced differentiation of melanoblasts, we performed Western blot experiments with anti-tyrosinase, anti-TRP1, and anti-TRP2 antibodies (Fig. 5). Cells were treated for 6 days as described under “Methods.” The levels of tyrosinase and TRP1 were markedly increased with αMSH and forskolin treatments. However, possibly due to the high expression of TRP2 in melanoblasts, αMSH and forskolin did not promote a marked increase of the expression of the mature form of TRP2 (upper band). On the other hand, it appears that αMSH and forskolin induced a markedde novo synthesis of TRP2 (lower band). Treatment with 1 μm ASP significantly reduced the expression of TRP1 and TRP2 in basal and stimulated conditions. Interestingly, in these cells the effects of ASP on tyrosinase expression were quite different from those obtained with B16 cells. Indeed, while ASP reduced expression of tyrosinase in basal and forskolin conditions, inhibition in the presence of αMSH was much fainter. These results indicate that ASP is able to prevent almost completely the spontaneous differentiation of melanoblasts into melanocytes. Furthermore, ASP promoted a partial but significant decrease in αMSH and forskolin-induced differentiation. Next we studied the effects of αMSH and ASP treatment on the expression of microphthalmia and its binding to the M box. Western blot experiments showed that microphthalmia is constitutively expressed in melanoblasts and that its expression is transiently enhanced by αMSH treatment with a maximum at 3 h and noticeably less stimulation by 18 h (Fig. 6). We then studied the effects of these treatments on microphthalmia binding to oligonucleotides containing the M box (Fig.7). Melb-a nuclear extracts obtained 3 h after the last differentiation treatment formed complexes with the labeled M box probe, and the amount of complex was increased upon forskolin (5–6-fold) and αMSH (6-fold) treatments. ASP reduced the formation of these M box complexes by 50–70%. The C5 antibody directed against microphthalmia induced a supershift of the labeled DNA probes (arrow), indicating that the increased band induced upon MSH treatment and the reduced band induced upon MSH + ASP treatment represent the binding of microphthalmia to the M box. The complexes were almost totally displaced by an excess of unlabeled M box (data not shown), demonstrating that the binding observed with melb-a nuclear extracts was indeed specific to the M box. Skin pigmentation involves a set of complex developmental mechanisms occurring outside as well as inside the embryonic skin, such as (i) emergence of the melanocyte lineage among neural crest cells, (ii) the migration of melanocyte precursors from the neural primordium to the epidermis and hair follicles, and (iii) cell proliferation and final maturation of melanoblasts into melanin-producing cells, as reviewed in Bennett (40Bennett D.C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 146: 191-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). αMSH is thought to play an important role in the differentiation of mouse melanocytes in the epidermis and hair bulb by inducing tyrosinase activity, melanin formation, increased dendricity and transfer of melanosomes. It is now well established that structure and function of melanocytes are controlled by both genetic factors and the local tissue environment. In vivo, αMSH promotes the production of eumelanin, while expression of the agouti gene promotes the production of pheomelanin. In vitrostudies have shown that ASP could induce pheomelanogenesis in eumelanic melanocytes (30Sakai C. Ollmann M. Kobayashi T. Abdel-Malek Z. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Imokawa G. Barsh G.S. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Graham A. Wakamatsu K. Hunt G. Ito S. Thody A.J. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrating that ASP alone is sufficient to elicit such changes. It has also been shown that ASP could down-regulate the stimulation of melanogenesis induced by forskolin and αMSH (30Sakai C. Ollmann M. Kobayashi T. Abdel-Malek Z. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Imokawa G. Barsh G.S. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Suzuki I. Tada A. Ollmann M.M. Barsh G.S. Im S. Lamoreux M.L. Hearing V.J. Nordlund J.J. Abdel-Malek Z.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 838-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that ASP can by itself inhibit spontaneous and induced-differentiation of melanoblasts into melanocytes. Syntheses of tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 are down-regulated and total tyrosinase activity is decreased in basal-, forskolin-, and αMSH-stimulated conditions by ASP. We have also shown that in B16 melanoma cells, used as a model of partially differentiated melanocytes, ASP almost completely inhibited the expression of tyrosinase stimulated by αMSH. TRP1 and TRP2 expressions were down-regulated under these conditions. It is interesting that inhibition by ASP of melanoblast differentiation induced by αMSH involves a weak effect on tyrosinase expression as compared with the inhibition exerted on TRP1 and TRP2 expression in the same conditions. This observation is consistent with the fact that tyrosinase expression is indispensable for pheomelanogenesis while decrease in TRP1 and TRP2 is a requisite. Thus in a long term process such as differentiation, ASP preserves the acquisition of tyrosinase enzyme and prevents or strongly reduces TRP1 expression which may lead to a population of melanocytes producing pheomelanins instead of eumelanins. This observation is to be compared with the marked inhibition exerted by ASP on αMSH-induced expression of tyrosinase in B16 melanoma cells. This suggests the existence of different mechanisms between inhibition of melanoblast differentiation and inhibition of melanogenesis in differentiated melanocytes. Moreover, the fact that ASP does inhibit basal and forskolin-induced expression of tyrosinase in melanoblasts suggests a specific and different mechanism for ASP inhibition of the cAMP-induced events. The mechanisms of ASP action are only partially elucidated. Competitive inhibition of melanocortin binding has been proposed as a first hypothesis since ASP antagonizes the effects of αMSH and inhibits125I-labeled nucleoside diphosphate-αMSH binding (24Lu D. Willard D. Patel I.R. Kadwell S. Overton L. Kost T. Luther M. Chen W. Woychik R.P. Wilkison W.O. Cone R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). A classic antagonist used at concentrations 100 times above the ligand concentrations as we did, should have completely blocked the effects of αMSH. However, in some of our experiments, this was not the case. These results suggest that in certain conditions, ASP does not antagonize completely the effect of αMSH through the MC1R. Moreover, ASP can inhibit basal melanogenesis and spontaneous differentiation as well as forskolin-induced melanogenic events; this observation weakens the antagonist-only hypothesis. The effects of ASP on basal and forskolin-induced differentiation fit better with the hypothesis that ASP would be an inverse agonist of the MC1 receptor. Inverse agonists, ligands that suppress spontaneous receptor signaling activity, have been described for a growing number of G-protein coupled receptors: the β2-adrenoreceptor of myocardial cells (41Bond R.A. Leff P. Johnson T.D. Milano C.A. Rockman H.A., MC Minn T.R. Apparsundaram S. Hyek M.F. Kenakin T.P. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (42Westphal R.S. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 937-942PubMed Google Scholar), and the calcitonin receptors (43Pozvek G. Hilton J.M. Quiza M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hence, ASP appears likely to act both as an antagonist of αMSH binding on MC1R and an inverse agonist to block both the effects induced by cAMP elevating agents and basal effects. We show that down-regulation of differentiation in melb-a cells and of melanogenesis in B16 cells involve inhibition of tyrosinase, TRP1 and TRP2 expression to different extents. In B16 cells, we also demonstrate that this down-regulation results from inhibition of the tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 promoters. Besides the fact that we described for the first time an inhibitory effect on the transcription activity of genes for the enzymes involved in melanogenesis, it is interesting that, in melanoma cells, ASP exhibited a strong inhibition on both basal and αMSH-stimulated activities of the corresponding promoters. Recently, we suggested that microphthalmia, through the binding to M box, mediates the effect of cAMP on tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 promoter activities (13Bertolotto C. Buscà R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In B16 cells, ASP inhibits the activity of the microphthalmia promoter and markedly reduces the expression of the protein. Since microphthalmia has been shown to transactivate tyrosinase (11Yasumoto K. Yokoyama K. Shibata K. Tomita Y. Shibahara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8058-8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), TRP1 (12Yavuzer U. Keenan E. Lowings P. Vachtenheim G. Currie G. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 123-134PubMed Google Scholar), and TRP2 (13Bertolotto C. Buscà R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) promoters, we propose that the inhibition of microphthalmia expression by ASP is responsible for the decrease in melanogenic enzyme expression. Beside its putative role in cAMP-induced melanogenesis, the microphthalmia gene plays a crucial role in development and survival of melanocytes and controls the tissue-specific expression of the melanogenic genes. Therefore, we focused our attention on the expression of microphthalmia in melanoblasts during differentiation and the effect of ASP on this process. We observed that microphthalmia is constitutively expressed in melanoblasts, and that αMSH and forskolin increase its expression as well as its binding to the M box. ASP inhibited the αMSH and forskolin-stimulated expression and binding of microphthalmia to the M box. Our results suggest that αMSH and forskolin promote differentiation of melanoblasts into melanocytes and that ASP partially blocks this cAMP-stimulated differentiation and also spontaneous (basal) differentiation, probably through an inhibition of microphthalmia gene expression. Taken together, our studies indicate a key regulatory role for agouti signal protein in melanocyte differentiation and in melanogenesis, and point to the involvement of microphthalmia in these processes.

SNARE proteins have been implicated in the docking and fusion of these vesicles with the cell membrane. The role of Munc18c, previously identified as an n-Sec1/Munc18 homolog in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, in insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking has now been investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In these cells, Munc18c was predominantly associated with syntaxin4, although it bound both syntaxin2 and syntaxin4 to similar extents in vitro. In addition, SNAP-23, an adipocyte homolog of SNAP-25, associated with both syntaxins 2 and 4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of Munc18c in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer resulted in inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in a virus dose-dependent manner (maximal effect, ∼50%) as well as in inhibition of sorbitol-induced glucose transport (by ∼35%), which is mediated by a pathway different from that used by insulin. In contrast, Munc18b, which is also expressed in adipocytes but which did not bind to syntaxin4, had no effect on glucose transport. Furthermore, overexpression of Munc18c resulted in inhibition of insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4, but not of that of GLUT1, to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that Munc18c is involved in the insulin-dependent trafficking of GLUT4 from the intracellular storage compartment to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by modulating the formation of a SNARE complex that includes syntaxin4.

Insulin stimulates glucose transport into muscle and adipose tissue by inducing the translocation of vesicles containing the glucose transporter GLUT4 from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane (1Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). This process is thought to be a major contributor to the mechanism by which insulin reduces the blood concentration of glucose. The binding of insulin to its receptor on the surface of target cells results in receptor autophosphorylation and receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of several additional proteins, including insulin receptor substrates 1–4 (IRS1 to IRS4). 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI, phosphoinositide; NSF,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; v- and t-SNAREs, vesicle and target membrane SNAREs; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; pfu, plaque-forming unit; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. The phosphorylated IRS proteins then bind other proteins, such as phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, SHP-2, and GRB2, that contain SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains (3White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase is thought to play a role in the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 (4Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R.

A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which activation of PI 3-kinase results in GLUT4 translocation remains unclear (6Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) hypothesis was initially proposed to explain the process of neurotransmitter secretion (7Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar, 8Söllner T. Bennett M.B. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles at the plasma membrane are initiated by the interaction of proteins, known as v-SNAREs (synaptobrevin/VAMP), located on the vesicle surface with corresponding proteins, known as t-SNAREs (syntaxin, SNAP-25), located on the target membrane. Membrane fusion is subsequently mediated by the cytosolic proteins α-, β-, and γ-SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein) and NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein), which binds SNAP and hydrolyzes ATP. This hypothesis was subsequently applied to vesicle transport from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane in cells other than neurons. Thus, SNARE proteins have been implicated in the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles in adipocytes. Members of the VAMP/synaptobrevin family of proteins were first shown to localize in GLUT4 vesicles in rat adipocytes (9Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such VAMP/synaptobrevin proteins were identified as VAMP2 and cellubrevin/VAMP3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (10Volchuk A.

Syntaxins 2, 4, and 5 are also expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12Timmers K.I. Clark A.E. Omatsu-Kanbe M. Whiteheart S.W. Bennett M.K. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, with the use of neurotoxins that cleave VAMP2 and cellubrevin/VAMP3, these proteins were shown to function as v-SNAREs in the trafficking of GLUT4 vesicles to the plasma membrane (11Tamori Y.

Microinjection of the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin4 (14Cheatham B. Volchuk A. Kahn C.R. Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Klip A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, the SNARE complexes bound by recombinant NSF and α-SNAP in proteins solubilized from rat adipocyte membranes contained syntaxin4 but not syntaxin2 (12Timmers K.I. Clark A.E. Omatsu-Kanbe M. Whiteheart S.W. Bennett M.K. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These studies thus suggest that syntaxin4 functions as a t-SNARE in the docking and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles at the plasma membrane in adipocytes. However, although VAMP2 and VAMP3 (v-SNAREs) as well as syntaxin4 (t-SNARE) appear to play essential roles in GLUT4 translocation in these cells, the mechanism by which insulin might regulate these SNARE components remains unknown.

E. James (University of Queensland, Australia). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated in response to the cytoplasmic region of syntaxin2 and to full-length Munc18b were kindly provided by M. K. Bennett (University of California, Berkeley) and V. M. Olkkonen (National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland), respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibody to c-MYC (monoclonal antibody 9E10) was purchased from Oncogene Science, Inc. Mouse full-length Munc18c cDNA and SNAP-23 cDNA were obtained as described previously (35Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rat full-length Munc18a cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction with specific oligonucleotide primers (5′-GAACGCCATGGCCCCCATTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATTTTAACTGCTTATTTCTTCG-3′ (antisense)) and total RNA from rat brain. Mouse full-length Munc18b cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with specific oligonucleotide primers (5′-GATGGCGCCCTTGGGGCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCAGGGCAGGGCCACACC-3′ (antisense)) from a mouse fat cell cDNA library (CLONTECH). Munc18a, Munc18b, and Munc18c were tagged with a human c-MYC epitope by adding (at the cDNA level) a 14-amino acid sequence (AEEQKLISEEDLLK) at their COOH termini. Complementary DNAs encoding rat syntaxins 1a, 2, 3, and 4 were kindly provided by R. H. Scheller (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Adipogenesis was induced by treatment with insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine as described previously (37Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were subjected to experiments after 8–13 days. COS cells were also maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Samples in Laemmli sample buffer (65 mm Tris, 3% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, bromphenol blue (0.025 mg/ml)) containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The separated proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane in the presence of a solution containing 20 mm Tris, 230 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 0.02% SDS. The membrane was exposed for 1 h to blocking buffer (80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk) and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 20% FBS, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. After washing with PBST solution (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), the membrane was incubated for 60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or goat antibodies to mouse IgG (Promega) diluted in PBST (1:3000) and was then washed twice in PBST. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was performed as described previously (38Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were scraped and homogenized in TES buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 225 mm sucrose), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g. The resulting pellet was layered on top of a 1.12 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 101,000 ×g, after which the plasma membrane fraction was collected from the interface of the two solutions. Immunoprecipitation of syntaxins 2 or 4 or of Munc18c from extracts of the plasma membrane fraction (prepared with a solution containing 50 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was performed with the corresponding specific antibodies. With the use of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), COS cells were transiently transfected with full-length cDNAs encoding SNAP-23 or c-MYC epitope-tagged Munc18a, -b, or -c that had been cloned into the expression vector pcDL-SRα (35Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fukisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the resulting extracts were incubated, with constant agitation, at 4 °C for 1 h with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated with 2 to 3 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic portions of syntaxins 1a, 2, 3, or 4. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and proteins bound to the beads were then eluted with 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with either a monoclonal antibody to c-MYC (for Munc18a, -b, or -c) or antibodies to SNAP-23. Recombinant adenovirus vectors were generated by cloning cDNAs into pAxCAwt (40Kanegae Y. Lee G. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakai T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), which contains the CAG promoter (41Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst .). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar), and cotransfection into 293 cells with DNA-TPC, as described previously (42Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Protein-encoding viruses were screened by immunoblot analysis and cloned by limiting dilution. Adenovirus vectors were propagated by a standard procedure and then purified and titrated as described previously (43Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Eight to 11 days after induction of differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected for 2 h at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), in plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell, as determined by limiting dilution assay in 293 cells. The adipocytes were subjected to various experiments about 48 h after infection. 3T3-L1 cells were deprived of serum by incubation in 12-well plates with DMEM for 2 h. The cells were then incubated with 100 nminsulin for 20 min or 600 mmd-sorbitol for 40 min in 0.45 ml of KRH buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm KH2PO4). Glucose transport was initiated by the addition of 0.05 ml of KRH buffer containing 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (final concentration, 0.05 mm; 0.25 μCi) to each well, and after 5 min, transport was terminated by washing cells three times with ice-cold KRH buffer. The cells were solubilized with 0.5% SDS, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Translocation of GLUT1 or GLUT4 to the plasma membrane was measured by the plasma membrane lawn assay as described previously (44Kotani K. Carozzi A.J. Sakaue H. Hara K. Robinson L.J. Clark S.F. Yonezawa K. James D.E. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In brief, 3T3-L1 cells cultured on coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with poly-l-lysine (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS. Cells were incubated in a hypotonic solution (0.33 KHMgE buffer, comprising 30 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm EGTA) and then disrupted by placement under an ultrasonic microprobe in KHMgE buffer containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Sonicated cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to GLUT1 and mouse monoclonal antibodies to GLUT4. After washing three times with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to mouse IgG. The cells were washed with PBS, mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS containingp-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml), and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To investigate the functional roles of Munc18 isoforms, syntaxins, and SNAP-23 in GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we examined the affinity of Munc18 isoforms and SNAP-23 for GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic portions of syntaxins 1a, 2, 3, or 4. Interaction with syntaxin5 was not assessed because this protein appears to function as a t-SNARE in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (45Dascher C. Matteson J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29363-29366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SNAP-23 as well as Munc18a, -b, and -c tagged at their COOH termini with a human c-MYC epitope were transiently expressed in COS cells, and the corresponding cell extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing immobilized GST-syntaxin fusion proteins. After washing, proteins eluted from the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to c-MYC (for the three Munc18 isoforms) or to SNAP-23. Munc18a, which is identical to n-Sec1 and Munc18–1, bound to the GST fusion proteins containing syntaxins 1a, 2, and 3, but there was no detectable binding of Munc18a to syntaxin4 (Fig.1). Munc18b showed a pattern of binding similar to that of Munc18a. In contrast, Munc18c showed a marked interaction with syntaxins 2 and 4, interacted to a much lesser extent with syntaxin1, and exhibited no detectable binding to syntaxin3. Although it is not clear whether the Munc18 isoforms expressed in COS cells bind directly or indirectly to the recombinant GST-syntaxin proteins, these results show that Munc18c is the only Munc18 isoform that interacts substantially with syntaxin4 in vitro. The observation that SNAP-23, an adipocyte homolog of SNAP-25 (35Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), interacted markedly with syntaxins 1a and 4 and slightly with syntaxin2 is consistent with our previous results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system (35Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Given that syntaxins 2 and 4 (8Söllner T. Bennett M.B. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar) and Munc18b and -c (31Tellam J. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) are the major syntaxin and Munc18 isoforms in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, it is likely that Munc18b interacts with syntaxin2 and that Munc18c interacts with syntaxins 2 or 4 in these cells. We next examined the physiological interactions among Munc18b or -c, syntaxins 2 or 4, and SNAP-23 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our polyclonal antibodies generated in response to a synthetic COOH-terminal peptide of Munc18c are highly specific and do not recognize Munc18a or Munc18b overexpressed in COS cells, as assessed by immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These antibodies detected a major protein of 67 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of Munc18c, on immunoblot analysis of a detergent extract of the plasma membrane fraction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.2 A). In contrast, we did not detect Munc18b in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for this Munc18 isoform (data not shown). Previous studies have detected Munc18b mRNA by Northern blot analysis (31Tellam J. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and Munc18b protein by immunoblot analysis (16Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) in these cells. This discrepancy is probably attributable to a difference in the efficacy of the antibodies used in the present and previous (16Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) studies; we were able to detect Munc18b overexpressed in COS cells. Polyclonal antibodies generated in response to GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic portions of rat syntaxins 2 or 4 or to a GST fusion protein containing mouse SNAP-23 detected proteins of the predicted molecular sizes in the detergent extracts of plasma membranes from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2, B–D). Next, we confirmed that both syntaxins 2 and 4 were immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of the plasma membrane fraction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the corresponding specific antibodies (Fig. 2, B andC). Despite the interaction of Munc18c with both syntaxins 2 and 4 in the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 1), Munc18c was coimmunoprecipitated with syntaxin4 but not with syntaxin2 (Fig.2 A). In contrast, SNAP-23 was coimmunoprecipitated with both syntaxin2 and syntaxin4 (Fig. 2 D), consistent with the results of the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 1). When the immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies to Munc18c, syntaxin4 (Fig. 2 C), but not syntaxin2 (Fig. 2 B) or SNAP-23 (Fig. 2 D), was coprecipitated with Munc18c. In summary, Munc18c was detected in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was associated with syntaxin4 but not with syntaxin2. SNAP-23 associated with both syntaxins 2 and 4 in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, although it was not associated with syntaxin4 complexed with Munc18c. To examine the function of Munc18b and Munc18c in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we prepared recombinant adenoviruses that were expressed with an efficiency of >95% in these cells as assessed by β-galactosidase staining (46Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both c-MYC epitope-tagged Munc18b and -c were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the use of this adenovirus-mediated gene transfer system. Both proteins were expressed to similar extents in an m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig.3, A and C). Moreover, the amount of overexpressed Munc18c bound to syntaxin4 also increased in an m.o.i.-dependent manner and was maximal at an m.o.i. of 15–30 pfu/cell (Fig. 3 C); overexpressed Munc18b did not bind syntaxin4 (Fig. 3 A). Overexpression of Munc18b had no significant effect on glucose transport,"

Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Initially cloned from bovine parathyroid cells, the CaR is highly expressed in the tissues involved in regulating [Ca2+]o including the parathyroid (PT), calcitonin-secreting cells of the thyroid (C cells), and several regions of the kidney (1Brown E.M.

Interestingly, the CaR is also distributed in a number of other tissues which do not have well established roles in the control of [Ca2+]o. These include several regions of the brain (e.g. the subfornical organ and hypothalamus), the pituitary, collecting duct of the kidney, lung, and the intestines (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In many of these tissues the physiological role of the CaR is not understood. One possibility is that the CaR senses endogenous ligands other than [Ca2+]o, thus allowing the CaR to function in a number of specialized capacities in different CaR-expressing tissues. The CaR is activated by both polyvalent cations and polycationic molecules that interact with the extracellular domain of the receptor (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi D. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar, 9Quinn S.J. Ye C.-P. Diaz R. Kifor O. Bai M. Vassilev P. Brown E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1315-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This might take place through the screening of charged side chains of acidic or basic amino acids, rather than the more classical binding through hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. If its endogenous agonists act by screening charges on the CaR, then activation of the receptor by these ligands should be modulated by conditions such as changes in ionic strength (10Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1993; 268: 873-876Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). With the addition of salts, the ionic strength will increase and the ability of the polycationic ligand to activate the CaR should be diminished. Likewise, the removal of salts and the resultant decrease in ionic strength should have the opposite effect. These effects of ionic strength can be explained by changes in the Debye length of the electrical field surrounding the charged agonist. The Debye length is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength of the extracellular solution. For example, addition of NaCl would increase the ionic strength of the solution and should increase the concentration of [Ca2+]o required for half-maximal activation of the CaR. Interestingly, theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor shares some regions of homology with the CaR, and both receptors can be modulated by divalent cations, spermine and polycationic molecules such as neomycin (11Pullan L.M. Stumpo R. Powel R.J. Paschetto K.A. Britt M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Reynolds I.J. Miller R.J. Eur. J.

Furthermore, modulation of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor by spermine and pH are susceptible to ionic strength, suggesting that they may also act through charge screening (10Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1993; 268: 873-876Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Ionic strength can have substantial effects on a number of different cell types, particularly those involved in the regulation of fluid volume, osmolality and extracellular sodium. The subfornical organ and hypothalamus regulate the secretion of vasopressin by sensing the systemic levels of various hormones, including angiotensin II, and the level of NaCl (15Denton D.A.

Early studies using injections of NaCl into these regions of the brain suggested that there existed a sodium sensor, since NaCl injections were much more effective in the control of vasopressin and drinking behavior than a hyperosmotic but nonionic solution (18Fitzsimons J.T. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 583: 15-25Google Scholar). Later research indicated that both ionic strength and osmolality may be sensed by the circumventricular organs and hypothalamic nuclei (e.g. paraventricular and supraoptic) (19Thornton S.N. deCaro G.

However, ionic strength and osmolality are intimately linked since NaCl is both the major salt and osmolyte in the extracellular fluid and blood. The mechanisms underlying osmotic and sodium sensing has not been fully delineated. Osmosensing is thought to involve changes in cell volume that result in the modulation of stretch-activated ion channels on the plasma membrane (23Leng G. Mason W.T. Dyer R.G. Prog. Neuroendocrinol. 1982; 34: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Oliet S.H.R. Bourque C.W. Trends Neucrosci. 1994; 17: 340-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The existence of and mechanisms involved in sodium sensing remain poorly understood. Some tissues normally experience large changes in ionic strength, such as the collecting duct of the kidney, where ionic strength and osmolality may act in a more independent manner since urea is a major contributor to the osmolality of the urine. Nevertheless, urinary salt composition can vary greatly for both sodium and potassium, whose concentrations can easily range from 50 to 200 mm. In addition, the area close to the plasma membrane of some nephron segments may experience large changes in local ionic strength when ion transport activity is high, particularly in the absence of water transport as in the renal thick ascending limb. The following studies indicate that ionic strength is an important modulator of CaR activation. Changes in ionic strength can alter the electrical field surrounding polycationic CaR agonists, thus providing a potential mechanism for modulating their activation of the CaR. In addition, ionic strength might also modify the state of the receptorper se, leading to a change in the sensitivity of the CaR to its agonists. The ramifications of these actions of ionic strength are far reaching and must be considered wherever the CaR is expressed. Dispersed parathyroid cells were prepared from parathyroid glands of 1–3 week-old calves using digestion with collagenase and DNase, and PTH secretion was assessed by radioimmunoassay as described previously (25LeBoff M.S. Shoback D. Brown E.M. Thatcher J. Lembruno R. Beudoin D. Henry M. Wilson R. Pallotta J. Marynick S. Stock J. Leight G. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These cell lines were the generous gift of Dr. Kimberly Rogers, NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc., Salt Lake City, UT. The CaR-expressing HEK 293 cells were stably transfected with the human parathyroid CaR (26Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and selected by hygromycin resistance. The transfected HEK 293 cells express the CaR on the membrane surface and are responsive to addition of CaR agonists to the external medium (26Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Coverslips with near-confluent HEK cells were loaded with fura-2/AM and placed diagonally into thermostatted cuvettes equipped with a magnetic stirrer, using a modification of techniques we used previously (26Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The bath solution was stirred at 37 °C, and CaR agonists were added to the desired final concentration. Excitation monochrometers were centered at 340 and 380 nm with emission light collected at 90° using a long-pass emission filter. The 340/380 excitation ratio of emitted light and in vitro calibrations were used to calculate [Ca2+]i as described previously (26Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R.

The transfected cells were labeled with [3H]inositol (∼10 μCi/106 cells) overnight in medium 199 (with 10 μl/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 15% bovine serum), washed with solution (10 mm LiCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in Eagle's MEM with Earle's salts), and then incubated with polyvalent cations for 30 min. The reactions were terminated with a final concentration of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After sedimentation of precipitated debris and removal of trichloroacetic acid by ether extraction, inositol phosphates in the aqueous phase were subsequently separated on Dowex anion exchange columns. The radioactive inositol monophosphate, bisphosphate, trisphosphate, and tetrakisphosphate were eluted stepwise with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 m formate containing 0.1 mformic acid, respectively, and quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter (27Brown E.M. El-Hajj Fuleihan G. Chen C.J. Kifor O. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1064-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The CaCl2 activity was calculated using determinations of osmolality (Osmette A, Precision Scientific, Natick MA) of solutions containing differing concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2. In our standard solution containing 125 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm CaCl2, the osmolality was 272 mOsm. With addition of 5 and 10 mmCaCl2, the osmolality increased by 10 and 20 mOsm, respectively, yielding a mean activity coefficient of ∼0.5 for CaCl2. Addition or removal of 80 mm NaCl had little effect on the changes in osmolality measured with addition of CaCl2. The ionized Ca2+ concentration (the sum of electrostatically bound Ca2+ and active Ca2+) was measured using an ion-selective electrode electrolyte analyzer, AVL 987-S (AVL Scientific Corp., Roswell, GA). Solutions were made with Ca2+ concentration varying from 0.5 to 6 mm and NaCl concentrations varying from 45 to 205 mm. Hypo-osmotic reduction in NaCl concentration by 40 and 80 mm as well as hyperosmotic increase in NaCl concentration by 40 and 80 mmdid not change the measurement of ionized Ca2+. The effect of ionic strength on activation of the calcium-sensing receptor by external Ca2+ was studied by adding or removing NaCl from the extracellular media followed by the elevation of [Ca2+]o. Changes in cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) were used as an indicator of CaR activation in CaR-expressing HEK cells. Osmolality was not held constant in these experiments; rather both ionic strength and osmolality were allowed to change concomitantly, as would occurin vivo. Fig. 1 Ashows the effect of changing the concentration of NaCl on activation of the CaR by 2.5 mm[Ca2+]o in HEK 293 cells that have been stably transfected with the human CaR. When NaCl is elevated, the [Ca2+]i response to 2.5 mm [Ca2+]o is attenuated, while removal of NaCl produces an enhanced response. The dose-dependence of the effects of external NaCl on CaR activation by [Ca2+]o are shown in Fig.1 B. They indicate that peak [Ca2+]i transients, due to Ca2+ mobilization, as well as sustained [Ca2+]i increases, due to modification of Ca2+ movement across the plasma membrane, are modulated in a similar direction and magnitude by changes in NaCl concentration. The concentration-response relationships for activation of the CaR by [Ca2+]o were compared in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl (Fig.2 A). With no alteration in NaCl, the threshold for cell activation is ∼1.5 mmcalcium with an EC50 of ∼3.5 mm calcium. With addition of NaCl in 20 mm increments, the threshold and EC50 both shift to the right suggesting either a change in the CaR or the ability of [Ca2+]oto activate the receptor. The change in EC50 was linear with changes in NaCl both above and below that in our standard solution (Fig. 2 B). Agonist activation of the CaR leads to stimulation of phospholipase C and increased production of inositol phosphates in CaR-transfected HEK cells as well as cells expressing the receptor endogenously. To ensure that the ionic strength effect described above involved activation of the CaR, inositol phosphate production was also examined during stimulation in the presence of different NaCl concentrations. As with the [Ca2+]i responses, inositol phosphate accumulation was likewise shifted in a similar manner, with enhanced accumulation observed with decreased ionic strength and the converse with increased ionic strength (Fig.3). Two broad classes of CaR agonists are polyvalent cations (i.e.Ca2+ and Gd3+) and polycationic molecules (i.e. spermine and neomycin). To test the generality of the effects of ionic strength on CaR activation, the CaR-transfected HEK cells were stimulated by spermine in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl. Similar to the effects on [Ca2+]o activation, ionic strength shifted the dose-response relationship for spermine so that the EC50 was inversely proportional to the ionic strength (Fig.4, A and B). In the case of spermine, the relationship between ionic strength and EC50 was clearly nonlinear, a trend that may be magnified by the multiple positive charges spaced out along the spermine molecule. Experiments were also performed maintaining osmolality constant while NaCl was varied in the extracellular media. For removal of NaCl, the NaCl was substituted by sucrose (i.e. 40 mm NaCl was replaced by 80 mm sucrose), while addition of NaCl involved replacement of sucrose in a Hepes-buffered solution containing 80 mm sucrose with 40 mmNaCl. Fig. 5 shows that iososmotic changes in NaCl produced similar shifts in the dose-response relationship of [Ca2+]o activation of the CaR as hyperosmotic and hypo-osmotic changes in NaCl. The iso-osmotic comparisons were as follows: standard solution plus 80 mm sucrose (EC50 3.4 mm)versus standard solution plus 40 mm NaCl (EC50 4.6 mm) for hyperionic changes; and standard solution (EC50 3.6 mm)versus standard solution with the addition of 80 mm sucrose and the removal of 40 mm NaCl (EC50 2.4 mm) for hypoionic changes. Addition of 80 mm sucrose appeared to cause a slight (<10%) shift in the EC50 for CaR activation under all conditions suggesting a small osmotic or sucrose effect. Addition or removal of NaCl in solutions with or without sucrose had the same effect on EC50, indicating that the large shifts were due to ionic strength, not osmolality. Untransfected cells are not responsive to [Ca2+]o and other CaR agonist, regardless of the ionic strength. The effects of NaCl may involve a sensor of sodium, chloride, or ionic strength. Different salts were used to determine the mechanism of the NaCl effect. Addition of 40 mm choline chloride or potassium chloride had the same effect on the EC50 for activation of the CaR-transfected HEK cells by [Ca2+]o as did addition of 40 mm NaCl (Fig. 6 A). Likewise the addition of 40 mm sodium iodide or 40 mm sodium bicarbonate had similar effects as did 40 mm NaCl (Fig. 6 b). These data indicate that neither sodium nor chloride are specific modulators of CaR activation, rather it is the change in ionic strength that modifies the activation of the CaR by [Ca2+]o. To determine if the effect of ionic strength was specific to the CaR, activation of endogenous G protein-coupled receptors on the HEK 293 cells were examined in solutions of varying concentrations of NaCl (Fig.7, A and B). Purinergic and thrombin receptors were tested using ATP and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (SRLLRNP), respectively, as ligands. Determination of the EC50 for thrombin receptor activation indicates that optimal activation of the thrombin receptor was found at physiological NaCl concentration and ionic strength with little effect observed with subtraction or addition of 40 mm NaCl to the standard medium (Fig. 7 c). With changes in NaCl of a 80 mm magnitude, the thrombin receptor became less sensitive to agonist stimulation. Activation of the purinergic receptor by ATP showed a slight trend toward reduced sensitivity with increasing ionic strength; however, removal or addition of 80 mm NaCl also resulted in a substantial decline in receptor sensitivity to agonist stimulation (Fig. 7 D) as well as a blunted maximal [Ca2+]i response. Bradykinin produced only a small [Ca2+]iresponse in HEK 293 cells, which made it difficult to use when testing the effects of ionic strength on activation of this endogenous receptor. However, addition or removal of 40 mm NaCl also had little effect on the sensitivity toward bradykinin (data not shown). At a constant concentration of receptor agonist, changes in ionic strength will modulate the degree of CaR receptor activation. This is represented in Fig.8 as the change in the magnitude of receptor activation at an agonist concentration equal to the EC50 concentration in our standard medium. With changes in ionic strength, the CaR shows a simple linear relationship between the change in receptor activation by either [Ca2+]o or spermine and ionic strength. These data suggest that ionic strength can both positively and negatively modulate CaR activation in the presence of a constant calcium concentration. In this way, the CaR could act as an ionic strength or NaCl sensor. Thrombin receptor agonist peptide and ATP stimulation shows a more complex relationship, indicating optimal or near-optimal receptor activation at physiological ionic strength and reduced activation with either increases or decreases in ionic strength. To better understand the potential physiological impact of ionic strength on tissues expressing endogenous CaR, the effect of addition of NaCl on PTH secretion was assessed in bovine parathyroid cells. These experiments on the secretion of PTH showed a right shift in the [Ca2+]o-PTH concentration-response relationship, indicating a reduced sensitivity toward [Ca2+]o (Fig.9) with increased ionic strength. Addition of 40 mm NaCl produced a [Ca2+]o set-point increase of 0.5 mm, when compared with the osmotic control of 80 mm sucrose addition. The CaR is activated by agonists possessing multiple positive charges, including polyvalent cations (i.e. Ca2+and Gd3+) and polycationic molecules (i.e.spermine and neomycin) (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi D. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar, 2Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Given this shared characteristic of CaR ligands, it is quite likely that these agonists act on the extracellular domain through an electrochemical mechanism, rather than a biochemical one. One possibility is that these cationic agonists may screen negatively charged residues of the extracellular domain of CaR, thus altering the conformation of the receptor. Indeed, multiple negative residues are grouped within this domain, particularly in the amino acid sequence of 126–251 (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi D. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A.

Physiol. 1997; 273: C1315-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If screening of charge is an important mechanism of agonist action, then activation of the CaR should be modulated by ionic strength. The Debye length of the electrical field around a soluble polycationic ligand is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength. With a decreased ionic strength and a longer Debye length, the polycationic ligands should be more effective at screening negatively charged residues of the extracellular domain. Furthermore, the positively and negatively charged residues could have a greater impact on the conformation of the receptor, as their charge will not be screened as effectively by the reduced concentrations of monovalent ions present in the solution. Consistent with this model, decreased ionic strength allowed for more effective activation of the CaR by both Ca2+ and spermine. Likewise an increase in ionic strength and a decrease in the Debye length attenuates the actions of [Ca2+]o and spermine as if the affinity of the agonist for the receptor had been reduced. The measurements of ionized Ca2+ by ion-sensitive electrodes and unassociated CaCl2 by freezing-point depression indicate that there are no large changes in the ionized Ca2+ or active Ca2+ in the hypotonic or hypertonic solutions used in our experiments, consistent with the modest changes in the mean activity coefficient of CaCl2previously reported for CaCl2 only solutions or NaCl:CaCl2 mixtures (28Butler J.N.

Our observed mean activity coefficient for CaCl2 of ∼0.5 is similar to that measured by others and the subtle change in these parameter were beyond the sensitivity of our equipment (28Butler J.N.

The mean activity coefficient of CaCl2, which represents the single ion activity coefficients of Ca2+ and Cl−, varies by less than 10% in solutions of ionic strength between 0.1 and 0.2m. Since the single ion activity coefficient of Cl− changes with ionic strength and is the principle counterion for Ca2+, the calculated single ion activity coefficient of Ca2+ has a value ∼0.3 in a NaCl solution of 0.15 mol/kg ionic strength and can vary by 10–25% in solutions of ionic strength between 0.1 and 0.2 m, depending on the assumptions employed in the method of estimation (28Butler J.N.

The calculated single ion activity coefficient of Ca2+ also varies slightly with concentration of added CaCl2. Using the mean activity coefficient values for CaCl2 reported in Butler (28Butler J.N. Biophys.

Exposure to physiological levels of hypoxia (5% O2, ∼50 mm Hg) rapidly induced a persistent phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133, an event that is required for CREB-mediated transcriptional activation. Hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of CREB was more robust than that induced by any other stimulus tested, including forskolin, depolarization, and osmotic stress. Furthermore, this effect was not mediated by any of the previously known signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation of CREB, including protein kinase A, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, ribosomal S6 kinase-2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2. Hypoxic activation of a CRE-containing reporter (derived from the 5′-flanking region of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene) was attenuated markedly by mutation of the CRE. Thus, a physiological reduction in O2 levels induces a functional phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 via a novel signaling pathway.

Hypoxic/ischemic trauma is a primary factor in the pathology of many disease states. Even brief periods of localized oxygen deprivation can result in severe cellular and tissue damage, such as that produced by cerebral or myocardial infarction. Severe hypoxia results in depletion of cellular ATP levels and cessation of oxidative phosphorylation, which results in profound deficiencies in cellular function (1Gibson G.E. Pulsinelli W. Blass J.P. Duffy T.E. Am. J. Med. 1981; 70: 1247-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that sophisticated mechanisms have evolved which allow the cell to adapt to moderate levels of hypoxia long before ATP depletion occurs (2Hochachka P.W. Buck L.T.

In recent years, the mechanisms underlying adaptation of mammalian cells to hypoxia have begun to be elucidated. A major component of this adaptation is regulation of gene expression. A number of genes have been identified, including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 1The abbreviations used are: TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; CRE, cyclic AMP response element; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase; MAPKAP kinase-2, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2. which are involved in the adaptive response to hypoxia (4Semenza G.L.

However, the primary mechanism(s) by which cells sense changes in oxygen levels and transduce this signal into the molecular events associated with changes in gene expression remain unknown. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells are a catecholaminergic cell line that has proven to be a useful system to study hypoxia-regulated gene expression. An acute reduction in oxygen tension triggers a variety of cellular responses in PC12 cells, including depolarization (8Zhu W.H. Conforti L. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Millhorn D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C658-C665Crossref Google Scholar) and inhibition of an oxygen-sensitive K+ channel conductance (9Conforti L. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Prolonged (>3 h) exposure to hypoxia also leads to an induction of TH gene expression and mRNA stability (10Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

The specific intracellular signaling pathways by which reduced oxygen stimulates expression of these genes are not understood. Multiple signaling pathways converge at the level of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that regulates expression of CRE-containing genes (for reviews, see Refs. 11Frank D.A.

Given the role for CREB in regulating genes that mediate a multitude of cellular responses, we investigated whether physiological levels of hypoxia regulate CREB phosphorylation and function. All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. PC12 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum, and with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). PKA-deficient (123.7) PC12 cells, kindly provided by Dr. J. A. Wagner (Cornell University Medical College, New York), were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 0.1 mg/ml G418. To compare wild-type PC12 cells with 123.7 cells, PC12 cells were grown in the same media in the absence of G418. When cells reached 85–90% confluence in 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning), they were exposed either to continued normoxia or placed in an oxygen-regulated incubator (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) in an environment of 5% O2, 5% CO2, balanced with N2, for various times. In previous studies, we have shown that the partial pressure of oxygen in the media of cells exposed to 5% O2is in the range of 30–50 mm Hg (10Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments in which cells were pretreated with drugs or vehicle, cells were switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing either drugs at the indicated concentrations, or the corresponding vehicle, for the indicated times before the start of hypoxia. For immunoblotting analysis, cells were harvested by scraping in 0.25 ml of 1% SDS and were sonicated briefly with a microtip ultrasonic cell disruptor (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). In some experiments, samples were solubilized in an ice-cold nondenaturing lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. In these experiments, lysates were centrifuged 10 min at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C to remove any Triton-insoluble material. Both solubilization protocols gave similar experimental results. Samples containing 50–100 μg of protein were then run on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Protogel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using standard electrophoresis and electroblotting procedures. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were then imunolabeled overnight at 4 °C with antibodies specific for either Ser133 phospho-CREB (1:1,000, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or which recognize equally phospho- and dephospho-CREB (1:1,000, New England Biolabs). Immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions. In some cases, blots were stripped and reprobed with another antibody. Blots were stripped by incubation for 1 h at 50 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 1 h in several changes of phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 at room temperature and probed with ECL to confirm that antibodies had been removed completely. Blots were then reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. Immunoreactivity was quantified using densitometric analysis with an ImagePro digital analysis system (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Immunoreactivity for CREB was found to be linear over a 5-fold range of protein concentrations. The TH-CAT reporter plasmids (−272TH)CAT and (−272CRE−)CAT (26Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 14: 241-242Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Dona Chikaraishi (Duke University, Durham, NC). PC12 cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes with 2 μg of either (−272TH)CAT or (−272CRE−)CAT using LipofectAMINE, using the manufacturer's recommended conditions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Beginning 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed for 24 h to either hypoxia (5% O2) or normoxia (21% O2). Cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml, and samples containing 120 μg of protein were analyzed in duplicate for CAT levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Boehringer Mannheim, GmBH). Data are normalized per total μg of protein in each sample. In each experiment, cells were transfected in quadruplicate dishes, and duplicate samples were analyzed for CAT activity. In each experiment, the variance in the range of CAT values was less than 15% from the mean value. After exposure to hypoxia or normoxia, cells were assayed for PKA enzyme activity exactly as described previously (27Beitner-Johnson D. Leibold J. Millhorn D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 241: 61-66Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PKA specific activity was calculated as the difference in 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) and phosphorylation found in the presence of PKI6–22, a specific inhibitor of PKA. 8-Bromo-cAMP-stimulated activity averaged 20-fold higher than that observed in the presence of PKI6–22. In each experiment, PKA activity levels were normalized per μg of protein. PKA enzyme activity was found to be linear over a 30-fold range of protein concentrations (between 0.5 and 15 μg of protein/assay). PC12 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 100-mm dishes. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were exposed for various times, between 20 min and 6 h, to hypoxia (5% O2) or 300 mmsorbitol. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm SB203580 (kindly provided by Dr. John C. Lee, Smith Kline Beecham, King of Prussia, PA) before exposure to sorbitol. Cells were harvested by scraping in 0.4 ml of an ice-cold nondenaturing lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were incubated 20 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged 10 min at 14,000 ×g to remove Triton-insoluble material. Aliquots containing 1 mg of total protein were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of an anti-MAPKAP kinase-2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) coupled to protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). MAPKAP kinase-2 enzyme activity was then assayed in an immunocomplex kinase assay, using 10 μg of a specific MAPKAP kinase-2 substrate peptide from a MAPKAP kinase-2 immunoprecipitation kinase kit, exactly as described in the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxia (5% O2) for various times between 0 and 24 h, as shown in Fig. 1. Whole cell extracts were immunolabeled with an antibody specific for Ser133-phosphorylated CREB. Hypoxia induced a dramatic increase in phospho-CREB immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 A). The effect peaked at 6 h but persisted strongly at 24 h of exposure to hypoxia. This effect was not caused by changes in the total amount of CREB, as shown in Fig. 1 B, where cell extracts were immunolabeled with an antibody that recognizes phospho- and dephospho-CREB equally. The effect of osmotic stress on CREB phosphorylation was also examined. In Fig. 1 C, it can be seen that exposure of PC12 cells to 300 mm sorbitol also rapidly induces Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB. Unlike hypoxia, which required several hours to produce a maximal effect, sorbitol-stimulated CREB phosphorylation was maximal at the earliest time point examined (20 min). Exposure of SK-N-MC cells to arsenite, another stressor, has been reported to induce CREB phosphorylation (18Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). To evaluate the relative effect of hypoxia on CREB phosphorylation, we compared the ability of hypoxia to stimulate phosphorylation of CREB with that of forskolin and KCl-induced depolarization. As shown in Fig.2, hypoxia induced a robust Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB, with an average effect greater than that produced by either forskolin- or KCl-induced depolarization, two prototypical stimuli used to activate CREB. Multiple protein kinases are known to phosphorylate CREB at Ser133, including PKA (20Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). To determine whether the induction of CREB phosphorylation was mediated by PKA, we tested the effect of hypoxia on CREB phosphorylation in PKA-deficient PC12 cells (123.7) (28Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells express mutant regulatory subunits of PKA which constitutively inactivate the catalytic activity of both type I and type II PKA (28Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA enzyme assays confirmed that 123.7 cells had negligible 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated PKA activity compared with parental PC12 cells (Table I). PKA-deficient PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxia (5% O2) for 0, 1, 6, or 24 h. We found that the effect of hypoxia on CREB phosphorylation persisted in the absence of PKA (Fig. 3); that is, hypoxia induced an increase in phospho-CREB immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 A) but did not alter total CREB immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 B). It can also be seen in Fig. 3 A that two major CREB-immunoreactive proteins were detected in 123.7 cells. The lower band corresponds to ATF-1, a structurally related CRE-binding transcription factor that cross-reacts with this antibody (18Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of ATF-1 was also induced by hypoxia.Table IPKA activity in PKA-deficient (123.7) PC12 cells versus parental PC12 cellsCells+ 8-Bromo-cAMP (10 μm)+ PKI (10 μm)pmol/min/mg proteinpmol/min/mg proteinPC12 (parental)72 ± 153.8 ± 0.8PC12 (123.7)3.2 ± 0.92.5 ± 0.2Parental and 123.7 PC12 cells were grown and assayed for PKA activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are from a single experiment and are expressed as average enzyme activity ± S.E. and represent four dishes in each group.

Ca2+-dependent protein kinases, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase- I, -II, and -IV and PKC, are also known to stimulate phosphorylation of CREB (21Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs III, W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 22Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E.

To test whether a Ca2+-dependent protein kinase mediates phosphorylation of CREB by hypoxia, PC12 cells were exposed for 6 h to either normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (5% O2) in the presence or absence of Ca2+. In Fig.4 A, PC12 cells were preloaded with 100 μm BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator, in Ca2+-free medium supplemented with 1 mm EGTA and were then exposed to hypoxia. The hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of CREB persists in the absence of both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4 A). Identical results were obtained when cells were exposed to hypoxia in the absence of only extracellular Ca2+ (i.e.Ca2+-free medium supplemented with 1 mm EGTA but without preloading cells with BAPTA-AM; data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with either chelerythrine chloride or Ro 31-8220, two inhibitors of PKC, also failed to inhibit hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 4, B and C). Both of these drugs were found to inhibit PKC enzyme activity effectively in PC12 cell extracts (data not shown). Nerve growth factor-induced phosphorylation of CREB has been shown to be mediated by RSK-2 (14Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar,24Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that in addition to its inhibitory effects on PKC, Ro 31-8220 is also a potent inhibitor of RSK-2 and p70S6K (31Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Neither Ro 31-8220 nor PD-098059, a selective inhibitor of activation of MEK, which is an upstream activator of RSK-2 (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), affected the ability of hypoxia to induce phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 4, C and D), although these drugs did block nerve growth factor-stimulated CREB phosphorylation (data not shown). Similarly, hypoxia-induced phosphorylation persisted in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 4 E), an inhibitor of p70S6K activation (33Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that MAPKAP kinase-2, an enzyme that lies downstream of the stress-activated protein kinase p38/RK (34Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakeilny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar), can phosphorylate CREB in vitro and that fibroblast growth factor or arsenite-induced CREB phosphorylation in SK-N-MC cells can be blocked by the selective p38 inhibitor SB203580 (18Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, SB203580 also did not inhibit phosphorylation of CREB by hypoxia (Fig. 4 F), although SB203580 did inhibit completely sorbitol-induced stimulation of MAPKAP kinase-2 activity in PC12 cells (see below). Hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of CREB was also not attenuated by either wortmannin or LY294002, two inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (data not shown). Finally, there is some evidence that cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G) can, under certain conditions, mediate CREB phosphorylation in vitro (37Colbran J.L. Roach P.J. Fiol C.J. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of CREB persisted strongly in the presence of each of the three inhibitors of protein kinase G, including KT-5823, methylene blue, and 8-bromo-cGMP (data not shown). Various stressors, including sodium arsenite, osmotic stress, UV light, and inflammatory cytokines, have been shown to activate MAPKAP kinase-2 via a p38-dependent pathway (18Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar,19Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at least two isoforms of p38, stress-activated protein kinase-3 (SAPK-3) and SAPK-4, have been identified which are not sensitive to inhibition by SB203580 (39Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 40Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered the possibility that MAPKAP kinase-2 could mediate hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of CREB via a member of the p38 family which was not sensitive to SB203580. PC12 cells were exposed for various times between 0 and 6 h to 5% O2 or for 20 min to 300 mm sorbitol. MAPKAP kinase-2 was immunoprecipitated, and enzyme activity was assayed in an immune complex kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 5, hypoxia had no effect on MAPKAP kinase-2 enzyme activity, whereas MAPKAP kinase-2 was strongly activated by sorbitol. Activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 by sorbitol was blocked completely by pretreatment of cells with SB203580. Taken together with the fact that hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of CREB was not inhibited by SB203580 (Fig.4 F), these results show that the effects of hypoxia on CREB are clearly not mediated by either MAPKAP kinase-2 or another p38-dependent protein kinase. Thus, it appears that a novel stress-activated signaling pathway (independent of MAPKAP kinase-2) exists and that this pathway mediates robust phosphorylation of CREB in response to hypoxia in PC12 cells. Phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 is necessary, but not sufficient, to activate CREB-mediated transcription (12Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next asked whether the Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB resulted in functional activation of a hypoxia-regulated gene. Expression of the TH gene has been shown to be activated in response to physiological levels of hypoxia both in vivo (42Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Bayliss D.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and in vitro (10Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat TH gene contains a consensus CRE localized at −45 to −38 nucleotides relative to the transcriptional start site (43Fung B.F. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2044-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test for a possible role for CREB in activation of the TH gene by hypoxia, we compared the effect of hypoxia on a TH reporter plasmid (−272TH)CAT and a similar construct in which the CRE had been mutated, (−272CRE−)CAT (26Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 14: 241-242Google Scholar, 43Fung B.F. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2044-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Hypoxia activated wild-type TH-CAT activity by approximately 3-fold, an effect similar to that of forskolin or KCl on this construct (25Nagamoto-Combs K. Piech K.M. Best J.A. Sun B. Tank A.W. J.

https://openalex.org/W2042618439,"Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) is one of the earliest events in angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT1) receptor (R)-mediated signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The coupling mechanisms of AT1 Rs to PLC, however, are controversial, because both tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ and G protein-dependent PLC-β activation pathways have been reported. The expression of PLC-β1, furthermore, has not been consistently demonstrated in VSMCs. Here we identified the PLC subtypes and subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in AT1 R-PLC coupling using cultured rat VSMCs. Western analysis revealed the expression of PLC-β1, -γ1, and -δ1 in VSMCs. Ang II-stimulated inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation measured at 15 s, which corresponds to the peak response, was significantly inhibited by electroporation of antibodies against PLC-β1, but not by anti-PLC-γ and -δ antibodies. Electroporation of anti-Gαq/11 and -Gα12 antibodies also showed significant inhibition of the Ang II-induced IP3 generation at 15 s, while anti-Gαi and Gα13 antibodies were ineffective. Furthermore, in VSMCs electroporated with anti-Gβ antibody and cells stably transfected with the plasmid encoding the Gβγ-binding region of the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase1, the peak Ang II-stimulated PLC activity (at 15 s) was significantly inhibited. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, had no effect on the peak response to Ang II stimulation, but significantly inhibited IP3 production after 30 s, a time period which temporally correlated with PLC-γ tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Ang II. Moreover, electropor-ation of anti-PLC-γ antibody markedly inhibited the IP3production measured at 30 s, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ contributes mainly to the later phase of PLC activation. Thus, these results suggest that: 1) AT1receptors sequentially couple to PLC-β1 via a heterotrimeric G protein and to PLC-γ via a downstream tyrosine kinase; 2) the initial AT1 receptor-PLC-β1 coupling is mediated by Gαq/11βγ and Gα12βγ; 3) Gβγ acts as a signal transducer for activation of PLC in VSMCs. The sequential coupling of AT1 receptors to PLC-β1 and PLC-γ, as well as dual coupling of AT1 receptors to distinct Gα proteins, suggests a novel mechanism for a temporally controlled, highly organized and convergent Ang II-signaling network in VSMCs.

Alexander R.W. Swales J.D. Textbook of Hypertension. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1994: 244-253Google Scholar). In VSMCs, most of the Ang II effects are mediated by AT1 receptors which belong to the 7-transmembrane spanning, heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor family (2Sasaki K. Yamano Y. Bardhan S.

Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The rat AT1receptor has been shown in various preparations to be capable of coupling to various α-subunits (Gq, Gq/11, and Gi/o) (4Kai H. Fukui T. Lassègue B. Shah A. Minieri C.A. Griendling K.K.

Physiol. 1996; 271: H595-H601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may provide insights into the potential mechanism by which a single AT1 receptor stimulates various signaling cascades.Recently, it has become apparent that AT1 receptors also couple to Gα13β1γ3, a heterotrimeric G protein whose α-subunit belongs to the nonpertussis toxin-sensitive Gα12 family. In rat portal vein myocytes, the Gβγ subunits derived from Gα13 apparently mediate Ang II activation of an L-type Ca2+ channel (6Macrez-Leprêtre N. Kalkbrenner F. Morel J.L. Schultz G. Mironneau J.

Although Gα12 transduces thrombin receptor activation of AP-1-mediated gene expression (8Post G.R. Collins L.R. Kennedy E.D. Moskowitz S.A. Aragay A.M. Goldstein D. Brown J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1679-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and both Gα12 and Gα13 activate Jun kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, the most proximal signals remain to be defined.Ang II binding to AT1 receptors in VSMC causes a distinctly biphasic response, with a rapid and transient activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC to produce inositol trisphosphates (IP3) and diacylglycerol, followed by prolonged activation of phospholipase D (9Griendling K.K. Tsuda T. Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: S27-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). IP3 formation is markedly increased within a few seconds, reaches a maximum at 15 s, and then gradually returns to control levels (10Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Rittenhouse S.E. Hypertension. 1985; 7: 447-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although activation of PLC is one of the earliest events in Ang II signaling (10Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Rittenhouse S.E. Hypertension. 1985; 7: 447-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which AT1 receptors couple to PLC in VSMCs are controversial.Three families of mammalian PLC isozymes, PLC-β, -γ, and -δ, have been described based on their molecular structure and mechanism of regulation (11Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). PLC-β isozymes have been shown to be activated by Gα and Gβγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins, while PLC-γ isozymes are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (11Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). PLC-δ isozymes are smaller (85 kDa) than PLC-β and -γ (150 and 145 kDa, respectively) and their function remains unclear (11Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In general, G protein-coupled receptors are assumed to activate PLC-β isozymes by coupling to the heterotrimeric G proteins (11Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), while growth factor receptors are proposed to activate PLC-γ by tyrosine phosphorylation (11Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). However, in rat VSMCs, Marrero et al. (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that activation of the G protein-coupled AT1 receptor induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ, although potential involvement of G proteins was not analyzed. We previously showed that Ang II-stimulated PLC activation is mediated by a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein (13Socorro L. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), at least in part represented by Gαq/11 (4Kai H. Fukui T. Lassègue B. Shah A. Minieri C.A. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 96-104PubMed Google Scholar), in these same cells. We also showed that prolonged incubation with Ang II causes selective down-regulation of Gαq/11, providing indirect additional evidence that the AT1 receptor interacts with Gαq/11 in intact VSMCs as demonstrated in vitro (4Kai H. Fukui T. Lassègue B. Shah A. Minieri C.A. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 96-104PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our reports, AT1 receptors in other systems have been shown to couple to PLC-β via Gαq/11 (14Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ku C.Y. Qian A. Wen Y. Anwer K. Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although Gαq/11-mediated activation of PLC-β is only partial (4Kai H. Fukui T. Lassègue B. Shah A. Minieri C.A. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 96-104PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D.G. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rat and rabbit VSMCs, however, PLC-β1 protein has been difficult to detect (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Homma Y. Sakamoto H. Tsunoda M. Aoki M. Takenawa T. Ooyama T. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In human aortic VSMCs, Schelling et al. (18Schelling J.R. Nkemere N. Konieczkowski M. Martin K.A. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1558-C1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that both PLC-β1 and PLC-γ are expressed, and that Ang II-PLC signaling is mediated by PLC-β1, but not by PLC-γ. Thus, in VSMCs, it remains unclear which PLC isozymes are expressed, and whether AT1receptor-PLC activation is mediated by direct coupling to G protein subunits or by stimulation of a downstream tyrosine kinase.In addition to these uncertainties, it is unclear how tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ, which occurs at 30 s to 1 min (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could mediate the earliest measurable increase in IP3 formation (<5 s) (10Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Rittenhouse S.E. Hypertension. 1985; 7: 447-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in response to Ang II. Since the most proximal signal transmission by G protein-coupled receptors is likely achieved through the heterotrimeric G protein subunits, Gα and Gβγ, both of which have been shown to stimulate PLC-β in other systems (11Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the earliest activation of PLC by AT1receptors occurs through the coupling to Gα or Gβγ, and the later phase of IP3 generation involves tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ. Thus, the present study was designed to clarify the role of tyrosine kinases and G proteins in AT1 receptor-PLC coupling, and to identify the PLC subtypes and the subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in their coupling in VSMCs. For this purpose, we measured IP3 production by Ang II in cultured rat VSMCs electroporated with specific antibodies against PLC isozymes and G protein subunits, and in cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding the Gβγ-binding region of the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1ct) (19Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to sequester free Gβγ. We provide evidence for the temporal dispersion of AT1 receptor signals through the sequential activation of PLC-β1 and PLC-γ, and for a role for Gαq/11 and Gα12 as well as their associated Gβγ subunits in activation of PLC-β1.DISCUSSIONThe mechanisms by which AT1 receptors activate PLC in rat VSMCs are controversial, because the expression of PLC-β1 protein has not been consistently detected (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Homma Y. Sakamoto H. Tsunoda M. Aoki M. Takenawa T. Ooyama T. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and both direct coupling to G proteins (4Kai H. Fukui T. Lassègue B. Shah A. Minieri C.A. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 96-104PubMed Google Scholar, 13Socorro L. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and downstream tyrosine kinase-dependent activation mechanisms (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported. Here, we provide evidence that PLC-β1 and PLC-γ are both functionally expressed in rat VSMCs and demonstrate that they may be sequentially activated by Ang II. Their mechanisms of activation are quite different: PLC-β1 coupling to the AT1 receptor appears to be mediated by Gαq/11βγ and Gα12βγ heterotrimeric G proteins, while PLC-γ activation is dependent on a downstream tyrosine kinase. It appears that the active subunit transducing PLC-β1 stimulation may include Gβγ derived from a nonpertussis toxin-sensitive G protein α-subunit.In the present study, we identified a full-length (150 kDa) PLC-β1 as well as a 100-kDa fragment in rat VSMCs using an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of rat PLC-β1 (Santa Cruz) (Fig. 1). These two major bands of PLC-β1 were also detected by a different mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the amino terminus of PLC-β1 of rat origin (Transduction Laboratories) (data not shown), and disappeared when the antibody was preincubated with the control peptide used for antibody generation, suggesting that both bands represent PLC-β1 isoforms or fragments. Schelling et al. (22Schelling J.R. Gentry D.J. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F682-F690PubMed Google Scholar) have previously detected the 100-kDa PLC-β1 fragment in rat aortic VSMCs using the same rabbit polyclonal PLC-β1 antibody. Thus, the 100-kDa band may represent a PLC proteolytic fragment (22Schelling J.R. Gentry D.J. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F682-F690PubMed Google Scholar) or a truncated PLC-β1 isoform reported in other species (23Su X. Chen F. Hokin L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12925-12931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancies regarding PLC-β1 detection between our results and those of others (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Homma Y. Sakamoto H. Tsunoda M. Aoki M. Takenawa T. Ooyama T. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) may be due to variations in VSMC phenotype or differences in the antibodies or the cell extraction methods used for immuodetection.We also provided direct evidence that PLC-β1 plays an important role in the early phase of AT1 receptor-PLC coupling in rat VSMCs, because electroporation of specific anti-PLC-β1 antibody markedly inhibited the maximum IP3 generation observed at 15 s after Ang II stimulation (Fig. 2). Consistent with our results, Schelling et al. (18Schelling J.R. Nkemere N. Konieczkowski M. Martin K.A. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1558-C1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that introduction of PLC-β1 antibody inhibits Ang II-stimulated inositol phosphate production in β-escin-permeabilized human aortic VSMCs. We found that a tyrosine kinase is involved in the later phase of AT1 receptor-PLC coupling, because the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein attenuated only the later phase (≥30 s) of Ang II-stimulated IP3 formation (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with the reports by Marrero et al. (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who showed inhibition of Ang II-induced IP3 formation by genistein, but the earliest time point measured was 30 s. The genistein-induced inhibition of IP3 production is temporally correlated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ in response to Ang II (Fig. 3)(12). Furthermore, the later phase of IP3 production (at 30 s) was markedly inhibited by electroporation of anti-PLC-γ antibody, indicating that AT1 receptors couple to PLC-γ in the later phase of PLC activation. However, a partial involvement of PLC-β1 in the later phase cannot be ruled out, because the inhibition by genistein was incomplete and anti-PLC-β1 antibody also inhibited the Ang II-induced IP3 production at 30 s by 38% (data not shown). In contrast, Schelling et al. (18Schelling J.R. Nkemere N. Konieczkowski M. Martin K.A. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1558-C1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to detect inhibition of the Ang II-induced PLC activation by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in human VSMCs. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that they measured total inositol phosphate accumulation during 10 min of Ang II stimulation as PLC activation, which may mostly reflect the peak PLC-β-mediated response and mask the contribution of PLC-γ. Taken together, these results suggest that AT1 receptors sequentially couple to PLC-β1 (<30 s) and PLC-γ (≥30 s) to generate IP3 in rat VSMCs. This idea is supported by the observation that intracellular Ca2+ mobilization induced by classical growth factors, which is mediated via tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ without prior G-protein-dependent PLC-β activation, occurs much more slowly than that induced by Ang II in VSMCs (12Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Since PLC-β1 is activated by Gα or Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (11Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), we next investigated the subunits of G proteins that couple AT1 receptors to PLC-β1. Our results suggest that AT1 receptors activate PLC-β1 via dual coupling to Gαq/11 and Gα12, based on the observation that electroporation of anti-Gαq/11 and -Gα12, but not anti-Gαi and -Gα13, antibodies significantly inhibited Ang II-stimulated IP3 production measured at 15 s (Fig.4). We have verified that Gαi, Gαq/11, Gα12, and Gα13 are ubiquitously expressed in rat VSMCs by immuoblot analysis (4Kai H. Fukui T. Lassègue B. Shah A. Minieri C.A. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 96-104PubMed Google Scholar). 2M. Ushio-Fukai, R. W. Alexander, and K. K. Griendling, unpublished data. Gα12 is a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and has been shown to be involved in growth-related signaling pathways; however, specific effectors regulated by Gα12 have not been previously identified (25Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The inability of the anti-Gαi antibody to block IP3 production serves as a negative control, since we have previously reported that Ang II-induced PLC activation is mediated by pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins (13Socorro L. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The failure of the anti-Gα13 antibody to inhibit Ang II-induced PLC activation is unlikely to be due to an inability of the antibody to block Gα function, because Macrez-Leprêtre et al. (6Macrez-Leprêtre N. Kalkbrenner F. Morel J.L. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10095-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) recently showed that microinjection of the same Gα13antibody inhibits Ang II-induced Ca2+ mobilization in rat portal vein myocytes. Although it is generally believed that AT1 receptors activate PLC-β via Gαq/11protein (14Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar), several reports showed the possible involvement of other G proteins in AT1 receptor-PLC coupling. Indeed, we have previously reported that long-term treatment with vasopressin, which selectively down-regulates Gαq/11 by 90%, inhibits Ang II-induced IP3 production by only 30% (4Kai H. Fukui T. Lassègue B. Shah A. Minieri C.A. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 96-104PubMed Google Scholar). Gutowskiet al. (16Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D.G. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that in membranes derived from NG 108-15 cells and rat liver, Ang II-induced stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was partially inhibited (30–60%) by an anti-Gαq/11 antibody (16Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D.G. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the present result is the first demonstration that AT1 receptors couple not only to Gαq/11 but also to Gα12 to activate PLC-β1 in rat VSMCs. Furthermore, we recently found that AT1 receptor coupling to tonic phospholipase D activation is not mediated by Gαq/11, but rather exclusively by Gα12 in rat VSMCs.2 Therefore, it is becoming clear that AT1 receptors couple to both Gαq/11 and the Gα12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins, as has been reported for other G protein-coupled receptors (26Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell Signaling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Gαqclass of α subunits, Gα12 does not stimulate inositol hydrolysis in vitro (25Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of Gα12 may be rather to provide specific receptor-G protein coupling, thus promoting GTPase activity and release of Gβγ subunits for activating PLC in VSMCs.A critical role of Gβγ as a signal transducer for PLC activation was demonstrated by the inhibition of Ang II-stimulated IP3formation by electroporation of anti-Gβ antibody and by overexpression of the βARK1ct, which has been used as a specific Gβγ antagonist (19Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it has been suggested that Gβγ-mediated activation of PLC-β is associated with a relatively low increase in IP3 (27Zhang B.-X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24387-24393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that both Gβγ and Gαq/11 cooperatively activate PLC-β to produce large amounts of IP3 in intact VSMCs.Our present result extends the original concept that Gβγ transduces the signal for pertussis toxin-sensitive pathways (28Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Gβγ has recently been shown to mediate PTX-insensitive activation of PLC in Xenopus oocytes (29Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and to be involved in c-Jun kinase activation by Gαq-coupled m1 muscarinic receptors in COS-7 cells (30Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We recently found that the Gβγ derived from Gα12/13 transduces AT1 receptor-mediated tonic phospholipase D activation in rat VSMCs.2 Thus, Gβγ appears to be a common signal transducer in both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive signaling pathways in certain cell types.In summary, the present study demonstrates that the early phase of Ang II-induced PLC activation occurs through coupling to PLC-β1 via Gαq/11 and Gα12 as well as their associated Gβγ subunits, and the later phase involves a downstream tyrosine kinase, presumably via phosphorylation of PLC-γ. The sequential coupling of AT1 receptors to PLC-β1 and PLC-γ suggests a novel mechanism for a temporally controlled, highly organized and convergent Ang II-signaling network in VSMCs.

Alexander R.W. Swales J.D. Textbook of Hypertension. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1994: 244-253Google Scholar). In VSMCs, most of the Ang II effects are mediated by AT1 receptors which belong to the 7-transmembrane spanning, heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor family (2Sasaki K. Yamano Y. Bardhan S.

https://openalex.org/W1978596704,"We report the cDNA sequence and catalytic properties of a new member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The 1134-base pair cDNA isolated from the human liver cDNA library encodes a 317-amino acid protein, retinol dehydrogenase 4 (RoDH-4), which exhibits the strongest similarity with rat all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases RoDH-1, RoDH-2, and RoDH-3, and mouse cis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase (≤73% identity). The mRNA for RoDH-4 is abundant in adult liver, where it is translated into RoDH-4 protein, which is associated with microsomal membranes, as evidenced by Western blot analysis. Significant amounts of RoDH-4 message are detected in fetal liver and lung. Recombinant RoDH-4, expressed in microsomes of Sf9 insect cells using BacoluGold Baculovirus system, oxidizes all-trans-retinol and 13-cis-retinol to corresponding aldehydes and oxidizes the 3α-hydroxysteroids androstane-diol and androsterone to dihydrotestosterone and androstanedione, respectively. NAD+ and NADH are the preferred cofactors, with apparent Km values 250–1500 times lower than those for NADP+ and NADPH. All-trans-retinol and 13-cis-retinol inhibit RoDH-4 catalyzed oxidation of androsterone with apparentKi values of 5.8 and 3.5 μm, respectively. All-trans-retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein (type I) exhibits a similarKi value of 3.6 μm. Unliganded cellular retinol-binding protein has no effect on RoDH activity. Citral and acyclic isoprenoids also act as inhibitors of RoDH-4 activity. Ethanol is not inhibitory. Thus, we have identified and characterized a sterol/retinol-oxidizing short chain dehydrogenase/reductase that prefers NAD+ and recognizes all-trans-retinol as substrate. RoDH-4 can potentially contribute to the biosynthesis of two powerful modulators of gene expression: retinoic acid from retinol and dihydrotestosterone from 3α-androstane-diol.

Short chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases are either cytosolic or membrane-bound enzymes with a subunit molecular mass of 25–35 kDa that utilize a vast variety of substrates, including steroids and prostaglandins (1Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Chosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Recently, this family of enzymes has expanded to include the retinol-oxidizing dehydrogenases (2Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol.

Retinol dehydrogenases are involved in the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid, the activating ligand for a family of nuclear receptors (7Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). All-trans-retinoic acid is produced from all-trans-retinol in two oxidative steps: all-trans-retinol is oxidized to all-trans-retinal and then further to all-trans-retinoic acid. Retinol dehydrogenases catalyze the rate-limiting step: the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde (8Napoli J.L. Race K.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the effects of retinoic acid on gene transcription and regulation have been intensively studied during the last decade, the exact enzymes that synthesize this morphogen and the mechanisms that regulate its production in tissues are not fully understood. Enzymatic activity capable of oxidizing retinol to retinaldehyde is readily detected in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions of total cell homogenates (9Posch K. Napoli J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2296-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The cytosolic activity has been linked to the NAD+-dependent medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; CRBP, cellular retinol-binding protein; RoDH, retinol dehydrogenase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 3α-adiol, 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol; androsterone, 5α-androstan-3α-ol-17one; dihydrotestosterone, 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one; androstanedione, 5α-androstan-3,17-dione; CRAD, cis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. which, in addition to trans and cis forms of retinol, oxidize a variety of aliphatic and a number of cyclic alcohols (10Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 15: 85-90Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the cells, most retinol is bound to the cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) (11Chytil F. Ong D.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ADHs cannot oxidize the bound form of retinol. 2N. Y. Kedishvili, W. H. Gough, W. I. Davis, S. Parsous, T.-K. Li, and W. F. Boston, unpublished observations. The first enzyme purified by following its ability to oxidize CRBP-bound retinol, RoDH-1, turned out to be a microsomal NADP+-dependent short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (3Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cDNA for RoDH-1 was initially isolated from a rat liver cDNA library, and later on, its mouse homolog was cloned and found to share 98% amino acid sequence identity with the rat enzyme (6Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Two more closely related enzymes were subsequently cloned, RoDH-2 (4Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28408-28412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), with 82% sequence identity to RoDH-1, and RoDH-3 (12Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. Gene. 1996; 169: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with 95% sequence identity, establishing a multigene family of all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases. The physiological role of these NADP+-dependent enzymes in retinoic acid biosynthesis in vivo has been questioned because of the cellular ratios of the reduced and oxidized forms of NADP+ (13Duester G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the liver cytosol, and presumably other tissues, the NADP+/NADPH ratio is about 0.01, whereas the NAD+/NADH ratio is about 1000 (14Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), suggesting that enzymes that prefer NADP+ will function in the reductive rather than oxidative direction. We became interested in finding an isoenzyme of RoDH that would function efficiently in the oxidative direction (i.e. prefer NAD+ as cofactor) and would recognize all-trans-retinol as substrate, because it was clear that RoDH exists in multiple isoenzymic forms. Here, we report a cDNA sequence and catalytic properties of a new human short chain dehydrogenase/reductase that shares more than 70% sequence identity with rat RoDHs, recognizes all-trans-retinol, and prefers NAD+ over NADP+. A human liver λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was screened with the [α-32P]dATP-labeled coding region of rat RoDH-1 prepared by PCR amplification of the rat liver mRNA with gene-specific primers designed according to a published sequence (3Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The hybridization conditions were as follows: 25% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll 400), 5× saline-sodium-phosphate-EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C overnight. After hybridization, the Nytran filters were washed several times in 6× SSC (150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.5), 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and the final wash was performed in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Positive recombinant phage plaques were purified, and phage DNA was isolated using a Qiagen Lambda kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The DNA insert was obtained by digestion with EcoRI and subcloned into a M13mp19RF digested with EcoRI. Sense and antisense single-stranded M13 DNAs were each sequenced at least twice. The cDNA probe was prepared byEcoRI digestion of the cDNA clone in M13 vector and purified by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. The human adult and fetal multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe in ExpressHyb hybridization solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Briefly, the blots were prehybridized in ExpressHyb solution for 30 min at 68 °C and transferred to a fresh solution containing 2 ×106 cpm/ml of the denatured radiolabeled cDNA. The hybridization was performed at 68 °C for 1 h. The blots were rinsed in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS several times at room temperature and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. The blots were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C with two intensifying screens for 1 week. The N-terminal fragment of RoDH-4 cDNA in M13 vector was amplified by PCR using primers Eco5′ (sense, CGG GAA TTC CAG GTG CTG AGC CAC CTG; nucleotides at position 200–217) and Hin3′ (antisense, AGA AAG CTT TGT CTC TCA CGC ACT CC; nucleotides at position 430–446). The primers carried recognition sites for restriction endonucleasesEcoRI and HindIII, respectively (underlined). The C-terminal fragment of RoDH-4 cDNA was amplified using primers Hin5′ (sense, CCA AAG CTT GTG TGG TCA ACG TCT CCA GT; nucleotides at position 609–628) and Xho3′ (antisense, AGA CTC GAG TGG CAT CCC AGC CAG CTG; nucleotides at position 981–998), which carried recognition sites for restriction endonucleasesHindIII and XhoI, respectively (underlined). Both PCRs were heated for 5 min at 94 °C and cooled to 72 °C, 2 μl of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) were added, and 30 cycles were run as follows: denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 52 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 6 min. The PCR fragments were purified by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel and subcloned into pET32a vector (Novagen) digested withEcoRI/HindIII andHindIII/XhoI, respectively, using Rapid Ligation kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). Competent BL21 E. coli cells were transfected with ligation mixtures and spread onto TY hard agar plates containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. The pET32a vectors that contained inserts were sequenced to verify the sequence of the inserts and were transfected into BL21(DE3) cells. The expression of recombinant proteins in BL21(DE3) cells was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA600 of 0.8–1.0. The cultures were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 1× binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and homogenized twice using a French press. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1× binding buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged to remove all soluble proteins. The pellet was resuspended in the 1× binding buffer supplemented with 6 m urea and incubated on ice for 1 h shaking. The solubilized proteins were loaded onto a His Bind Resin charged with NiSO4 at room temperature and equilibrated with 1× binding buffer plus 6 m urea. Protein was eluted with 1× elute buffer plus 6 m urea. From a 1-liter culture, 5.5 mg of the N-terminal fragment and 3.5 mg of the C-terminal fragment were obtained. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to remove urea. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 500-μg portions of each protein mixed 1:1 with adjuvant five times at 3-week intervals. A 1:2000 dilution of each anti RoDH-4 antiserum detected ∼1 ng of the corresponding recombinant protein. Sf9 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and were grown in a monolayer at 27 °C in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with yeastolate and lactalbumin hydrolysate (each to 3330 mg/liter), fetal bovine serum (10%), gentamycin (10 μg/ml), and amphotericin (2.5 μg/ml). At confluency, cells were sloughed off and split 1:3. The RoDH-4 cDNA was subcloned into theXbaI/BglII restriction sites of pVL1392 vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The expression construct was sequenced to verify the sequence of RoDH-4. The cotransfection of Sf9 cells with RoDH-4-pVL1392 and BaculoGold DNA was performed according to manufacturer's protocol (Pharmingen). Briefly, 2.5 million Sf9 cells were cotransfected with a mixture of 2 μg of sterile RoDH-4-pVL1392 and 0.5 μg of BaculoGold DNA. The infected cells were incubated for 5 days at 27 °C, and the medium was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g to remove detached cells. The supernatant was amplified two more times, and the titer of the amplified supernatant was determined by plaque assay. To produce recombinant RoDH-4, attached Sf9 cells were infected at virus:cell ratio of 10:1. Cells were collected after 3 days of incubation at 27 °C; resuspended in 0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT; and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The unbroken cells, cellular debris, and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 2 h and resuspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol. Microsomal suspension was aliquoted into small portions and stored frozen at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Lowry (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A sample of frozen human liver was homogenized in 50 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmEDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 105,000 ×g for 2 h to isolate the membranes. Twenty-one micrograms of protein from each fraction, 105,000 × gsupernatant, and 105,000 × g pellet were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, washed several times with PBST, and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of either anti-N-terminal or anti-C-terminal antiserum overnight. After washing with PBST, the membrane was incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of 125I-labeled protein A. The bands were visualized by overnight exposure to x-ray film (Kodak X-OMAT AR). The coding region of CRBP (type I) cDNA (16Sherman D.R. Lloyd R.S. Chytil F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was amplified from rat liver total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR using Pfu polymerase. The gene-specific nucleotide primers carried restriction sites forBamHI and EcoRI endonucleases. The PCR product was subcloned into the corresponding sites in pGEX-2T expression vector and sequenced. The recombinant protein was produced at 30 °C overnight in TG-1 E. coli cells in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 200 μg/ml ampicillin as a fusion with glutathioneS-transferase. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PBS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and lysed using a French press. The fusion protein was purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography on a glutathione-agarose column. The purified fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. CRBP was separated from glutathioneS-transferase by elution with 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT from a Q Sepharose column. The yield of CRBP was about 14 mg per liter of culture. The final preparation exhibited a single protein band of approximately 16 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of functional protein was determined from the fluorescence titration curve of apo-CRBP with retinol (17Ong D.E. Chytil F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 828-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excitation was at 350 nm; emission was measured at 480 nm. The fluorescence values were corrected for contribution of free retinol. The purified recombinant CRBP was incubated with excess of free retinol for 1–2 h in the dark. The free retinol was separated from the bound by elution of the S Superose column with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The final preparation of CRBP-retinol had a ratio ofA350/A280 of 1.75. Steady-state kinetics were performed in 90 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and 40 mm KCl at 37 °C in siliconized glass tubes. The radiolabeled steroids (NEN Life Science Products) 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol (3α-adiol) (41 Ci/mmol), 5α-androstan-3α-ol-17one (androsterone) (45 Ci/mmol), and 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one (dihydrotestosterone) (43.5 Ci/mmol) were diluted with cold steroids (Sigma) to achieve the required specific radioactivity of each steroid. Aqueous solutions of the substrates were prepared by adding 100× stock of the radiolabeled substrate in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), so that the final concentration of Me2SO in the reaction mixture did not exceed 1%. Equimolar amounts of bovine serum albumin were added to improve the solubility of steroids. The suspensions were sonicated for 10 min, and the concentration of the radiolabeled substrate in the aqueous phase was verified by counting an aliquot of the suspension. The 250-μl reactions were started with the addition of cofactor and stopped after 15 min by addition of 3.5 ml of methylene chloride. The aqueous phase was removed and methylene chloride was evaporated under stream of N2. Steroids were dissolved in 50 μl of ethanol; 10 μl were spotted on alumina oxide thin layer chromatography plates (Sigma) and resolved by development in chloroform/ethyl acetate (3:1), according to Biswas and Russell (18Biswas M.G. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The RF values for steroids under these conditions were 0.26 for 3α-adiol, 0.48 for androsterone, 0.53 for dihydrotestosterone, and 0.82 for 5α-androstan-3,17-dione (androstanedione). The lanes were cut into pieces ∼1 cm wide and counted in scintillation liquid (Bio-Safe II). For determination of apparent Km values, five concentrations between 0.6 and 1 μm were used for androsterone, 0.25–4 μm for dihydrotestosterone, and 0.1–2.5 μm for adiol. Initial velocities (nmol of product formed/mg of protein) were obtained by linear regression. The amount of product formed was less than 10% within the 15-min reaction time and was linearly proportional to the amount of microsomes added. The Km values for oxidation of alcohols were determined at a fixed NAD+ (1 mm) concentration; for reduction of dihydrotestosterone, values were determined at a fixed NADH (0.5 mm) concentration. EachKm determination was repeated at least three times. A control without added cofactor was included with each experiment. The apparent Km values for cofactors were determined with six concentrations between 0.05–6.4 μm for NAD+, 0.25–8 mm for NADP+, 15–1000 μm for NADPH, and 0.15–10 μm for NADH. Retinol inhibition of steroid oxidation was evaluated by incubating RoDH-4-containing microsomes with 1 mm NAD+, 4 concentrations of androsterone, and 3 concentrations of retinol in reaction buffer. All retinol solutions and reaction mixtures were kept in the dark. Each data set was evaluated for fit to different types of inhibition (19Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 18-159Google Scholar). Kinetics of initial velocities were evaluated by non-linear regression of inhibition equations using the method of Marquart (20Marquart D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar). Assays of RoDH-4-catalyzed oxidation and reduction of retinoids were performed in 90 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and 40 mm KCl at 37 °C in siliconized glass tubes. Retinoid stock solutions in Me2SO were added to the reaction buffer along with equimolar bovine serum albumin and sonicated for 10 min. Experiments with tritiated retinol showed that this procedure improved solubilization of retinol. The concentration of Me2SO in the reaction mixture did not exceed 1%. The 500-μl reactions were started with the addition of cofactor and stopped after 30 min by addition of an equal volume of cold ethanol supplemented with 100 μg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene and an internal standard, retinol acetate. Reactions were placed on ice and extracted twice with 7 volumes of hexane. The aqueous phase was removed, and hexane was evaporated under a stream of N2. Retinoids were dissolved in 200 μl of mobile phase, and an aliquot was analyzed by HPLC. All HPLC procedures were performed using an automatic injector 710WIS from Waters and a Varian 9010 pump. Elution was monitored at 370 nm with a variable wavelength Varian 9050 detector connected to a Hewlett Packard P3390 integrator. The stationary phase was a Beckman ultrasphere ODS column (4.6 mm x 15 cm). The mobile phase consisted of 0.05 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0:acetonitrile:tetrahydrofuran (70:168:12). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Under these conditions, all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinaldehyde, and retinol acetate eluted at 13, 17, and 34 min, respectively. All-trans-retinal was quantitated by comparing its peak height to a calibration curve of the amount of pure retinal injected onto the column versus the resulting peak heights. To isolate human homologs of rat RoDH isoenzymes, we prepared a RoDH-1 cDNA probe by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of rat liver mRNA with gene-specific primers. The radiolabeled RoDH-1 cDNA was used to screen the human liver λgt10 cDNA library. We applied low stringency conditions for screening the library, because our goal was to find an enzyme with similar (recognition of all-trans-retinol) but not identical properties (preference for NAD+, not NADP+). Four positives were identified during the first round of screening. Two of these positive clones were purified and sequenced. The longest clone contained a 1308-base pair cDNA (Fig. 1), which exhibited 78% nucleotide sequence identity with RoDH-1 cDNA in the coding region. Similar to RoDH-1, the human cDNA encoded a 317-amino acid protein including a starting Met. The deduced protein product exhibited features characteristic of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family of enzymes, such as putative consensus sequence for the cofactor binding site, G(X)3GXG, at Gly-36, and the active site consensus sequence, Y(X)3K, at Tyr-176. The new human short chain dehydrogenase/reductase showed the highest sequence identity with the recently reportedcis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase from mouse (73%), rat RoDH forms 1 and 3 (72%), and rat RoDH-2 (71%). Because rat RoDHs share 98% sequence identity with their mouse homologs, we assumed that the human cDNA cloned in this study encoded a previously unknown form of short chain dehydrogenase/reductase, and we called the new isoenzyme RoDH-4. The tissue distribution of RoDH-4 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). A very strong signal was observed in human liver, similar to the expression patterns of rat all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases (3Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

In addition, relatively high levels of hybridizing message were detected in fetal liver and lung (Fig. 2). The size of the message in fetal lung was somewhat smaller than in fetal liver. This could be due to cross-hybridization with a closely related gene product or to a different processing of the mRNA. The tissue distribution of RoDH-4 was distinctively different from that of the mousecis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase (6Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the two humancis-retinol dehydrogenases that are not active toward all-trans-retinol (2Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 5Mertz J.R. Shang E. Piantedosi R. Wei S. Wolgemuth D.J. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11744-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether the mRNA for RoDH-4 is translated into RoDH-4 protein in the human liver by Western blot analysis. Antibodies were raised against the N-terminal and the C-terminal fragments of RoDH-4 expressed in E. coli as described under “Materials and Methods.” A sample of frozen human liver was homogenized and fractionated by centrifugation into cytosol and microsomes. RoDH-4 protein was detected by incubation with either anti-N-terminal or anti-C-terminal antiserum (Fig. 3). A single band of 35 kDa appeared in the 105,000 × gmembrane fraction using either antiserum (Fig. 3, lane P), indicating that RoDH-4 message is translated into a protein in human liver, and the protein is associated with membranes. This is similar to the subcellular localization of other RoDH isoenzymes. To obtain a catalytically active enzyme, the cDNA for RoDH-4 was expressed in insect cells using the BaculoGold Baculovirus system. The full-length cDNA was subcloned into the pVL1392 transfer vector and cotransfected with linearized BaculoGold DNA into Sf9 cells. The recombinant virus was amplified and used to produce recombinant RoDH-4. The identity of the band was confirmed by Western blotting using polyclonal antiserum raised against partial RoDH-4. Our attempts to solubilize the recombinant enzyme and purify it from the membranes using Triton X-100 led to complete inactivation of the enzyme. Thus, intact membranes were used for kinetic characterization of RoDH-4. Human RoDH-4 was most similar to the mousecis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase (CRAD) (6Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and rat all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases RoDH-1, RoDH-2, and RoDH-3 (3Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y.

Both CRAD and RoDH were recently found to oxidize the 3α-hydroxysteroids 3α-adiol and androsterone to dihydrotestosterone and androstanedione, respectively (6Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Recently, we identified two isoforms of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), which are targeted to the nucleus by an alternatively spliced nuclear localization signal (NLS). Here we report that cotransfection with constitutively active mutants of CaM kinase I or CaM kinase IV specifically blocks nuclear targeting of CaM kinase II as a result of phosphorylation of a Ser immediately adjacent to the NLS of CaM kinase II. Both CaM kinase I and CaM kinase IV are able to phosphorylate this Ser residue in vitro, and mutagenesis studies suggest that this phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient to block nuclear targeting. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that introduction of a negatively charged residue at this phosphorylation site reduces binding of the kinase to an NLS receptor in vitro, thus providing a mechanism that may explain the blockade of nuclear targeting that we have observedin situ.

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions control a myriad of signal transduction processes within the cell including cell growth and differentiation, metabolic pathways, and gene expression. The specificity of some kinases mediating these reactions is attained by a strict substrate specificity that limits the action of these dedicated kinases to a single or limited number of potential targets. Other kinases, however, are able to phosphorylate a large number of proteinsin vitro, so the in vivo specificity of these kinases must occur through a different mechanism. Examples of these multifunctional or general protein kinases include protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) 1The abbreviations used are: CaM kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NLS-R, NLS receptor; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. family consisting of CaM kinase I, CaM kinase II, and CaM kinase IV (reviewed in Refs. 1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and2Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). All of these kinases are able to phosphorylate nuclear transcription factors in vitro at sites that either activate or repress gene expression and so all of these kinases have the capacity, at least theoretically, to alter cellular phenotype through changes in protein expression. Over the past decade, the evidence that this actually occurs in vivo is becoming increasingly strong; for example, there is now abundant evidence that protein kinase A mediates activation of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein through phosphorylation of a key Ser residue (3Chrivia J.C.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of a kinase is necessary for phosphorylation of nuclear proteins such as transcription factors, although there are examples of transcription factors that are activated in the cytoplasm and then translocate to the nucleus (5Flanagan W. Corthesy B. Bram R. Crabtree G. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 6Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The ability of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A to be released from cytoplasmic tethering and then passively diffuse into the nucleus, where it can phosphorylate nuclear proteins such as cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, has been described (7Bacskai B.J. Hochner B. Mahaut-Smith M. Adams S.R. Kaang B.K. Kandel E.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1993; 260: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). More recently, active export of protein kinase A out of the nucleus under certain conditions based on a nuclear export signal has also been reported (8Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Regulation of protein kinase C localization appears to occur, at least in part, through isoform-specific targeting to anchoring proteins that are presumably located near its substrates (9Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). CaM kinase I has been localized predominantly to the cell cytoplasm, while CaM kinase IV is predominantly nuclear (10Nakamura Y. Okuno S. Kitani T. Otake K. Sato F. Fujisawa H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 204: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the mechanisms governing the subcellular localization of these two kinases have not yet been elucidated. Isoform-specific targeting of CaM kinase II to the nucleus based on an alternatively spliced nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been described (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaM kinase II is composed of a multigene family derived from four related genes: α, β, γ, and δ (reviewed in Refs. 1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and 2Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The αB, δB, and γA isoforms of CaM kinase II all share a common core NLS amino acid sequence, KKRK, which is homologous to the NLS of the SV40 large T antigen (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of the δB and αB isoforms of CaM kinase II both in situ andin vivo has been reported (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); γA is also presumably a nuclear isoform, although this has not been investigated. Other isoforms of CaM kinase II do not contain any known NLS sequence and localize to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, CaM kinase II forms multimers of 8–12 subunits in situ and in vivo,and the final localization of the multimer to the nucleus or cytoplasm appears to be based on whether it is composed of predominantly nuclear or cytoplasmic isoforms (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These multimers are of sufficient size (400–600 kDa) that any transport of intact holoenzyme across the nuclear membrane is likely to require an active, nuclear export signal or NLS-dependent process. Immunostaining of brain sections has demonstrated nuclear localization of CaM kinase II in regions with high expression levels of nuclear forms and cytoplasmic localization of the kinase in regions expressing predominantly cytoplasmic forms (13Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, like the other multifunctional protein kinases, CaM kinase II does appear to have access to the cell nucleus, but such access depends on the type and ratio of isoforms expressed. Many different nuclear events have been ascribed to CaM kinase II. This kinase is capable of regulating nuclear envelope breakdown in sea urchin eggs (14Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), releasing Xenopus oocytes from meiotic metaphase arrest (15Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Mery J. Means A. Doree M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), promoting the maturation of oocytes (16Waldmann R. Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and blocking the cell cycle at the G2 to M transition (17Planas-Silva M.D. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II has also been shown to activate the CCAAT enhancer element-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) (18Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and recently has been shown to block activity of the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein and either block or activate the related transcription factor ATF-1 through phosphorylation of both positive and negative regulatory sites (19Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 20Sun P. Lou L. Maurer R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17957-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Many of these studies utilized a truncated mutant of CaM kinase II, which does not associate into holoenzymes and is able to diffuse freely between the nucleus and cytoplasm as a result of its small size. Presumably, nuclear localization of CaM kinase II would be required in order to mediate processes involving phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors. A recent study demonstrates that, among three transfected isoforms of CaM kinase II, only the nuclear-targeted isoform is able to activate an atrial natriuretic factor promoter construct in cultured ventricular myocytes, while the two cytoplasmic isoforms of CaM kinase II do not affect expression of this construct (22Ramirez M.T. Zhao X. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, autophosphorylation of cytoplasmic CaM kinase II was shown to cause translocation of the kinase to the postsynaptic density in cultured hippocampal neurons (23Strack S. Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13467-13470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We are interested in whether there are mechanisms other than isoform-specific expression that can affect the abililty of CaM kinase II to localize to the nucleus and, by doing so, be available to translate Ca2+ elevations into the processes described above. The capability of many NLS-containing proteins to translocate to the nucleus is affected either positively or negatively by phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 24Jans D. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We have studied the ability of the other multifunctional kinases, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, CaM kinase I, and CaM kinase IV, to alter nuclear targeting of CaM kinase II through phosphorylation. We report here that CaM kinase I and CaM kinase IV are capable of phosphorylating a Ser residue immediately adjacent to the NLS of αB- and δB-CaM kinase II and that this phosphorylation causes reduced binding to an NLS receptor and blocks targeting of CaM kinase II to the cell nucleus. The cloning of the α, αB, and δB isoforms of CaM kinase II into the SRα eukaryotic expression vector has been described previously (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Mutants of αB-CaM kinase II incorporating the following underlined Ser to Ala and Ser to Asp mutations adjacent to the NLS, KKRKAAAA (S332–335A), KKRKDDDD (S332–335D), KKRKSSSA (S335A) and KKRKSSAS (S334A) were generated by oligonucleotide-mediated, site-directed PCR mutagenesis of wild-type αB-CaM kinase II with subcloning of the amplified, mutant fragment back into its corresponding position in αB-CaM kinase II. The method for PCR site-directed mutagenesis has been described (26Ho S. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Mutants of αB-CaM kinase II incorporating the following underlined Ser to Ala, Ser to Asp, and Ser to Glu mutants adjacent to the NLS, KKRKASSS (S332A), KKRKSASS (S333A), KKRKDSSS (S332D), KKRKESSS (S332E), KKRKSDSS (S333D), and KKRKSESS (S333E), were derived through oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of αB-CaM kinase II according to the manufacturer's protocols (CLONTECH Transformer kit). All mutants described above code for proteins identical to full-length, wild-type αB-CaM kinase II except for the underlined mutations. A mutant incorporating the NLS of αB-CaM kinase II into the 5′-end of α-CaM kinase II was generated by annealing two 49-mers, 5′-GATGAATGATGGCGTGAAGAAAAGAAAGTCCAGTTCCAGCGTTGGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CCAACGCTGGAACTGGACTTTCTTTTCTTCACGCCATCATTCATCTGCA-3′, and then cloning this annealed multimer into the PstI andSacI sites of hemagglutinin-tagged α-CaM kinase II (27Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) (the tagged version of α-CaM kinase II was used because it contains 5′-cloning sites not present in untagged α-CaM kinase II). This produces a mutant that is identical to full-length α-CaM kinase II except for replacement of amino acid residues 2 and 3 from α-CaM kinase II with 13 amino acids encompassing residue numbers 324–336 of αB-CaM kinase II and four residues retained from the hemagglutinin tag. The 5′-sequence of this construct beginning with residue 1 is as follows: MNDGVKKRKSSSSV GAQLIT … The underlined portion denotes the region derived from αB-CaM kinase II including the NLS, the portion in italics denotes the retained region from the hemagglutinin tag, and the portion in normal lettering following the italics resumes with residue 4 of α-CaM kinase II and continues uninterrupted through the remainder of the protein (not shown). All mutants were screened initially by restriction analysis and then verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Restriction enzymes and oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Human CaM kinase I clones, including 1) a full-length, wild-type clone, 2) a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent, truncated clone coding for residues 1–294, and 3) these same two constructs with an activating T177D mutation were a generous gift from A. Means (Duke University) (28Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In order to clone these constructs into the SRα expression vector, the PstI site of SRα was cleaved and blunted with Klenow fragment, and an oligonucleotide linker containing aBglII site (Life Technologies, Inc.) was ligated into this site by standard techniques. The CaM kinase I clones were then cut withBamHI and EcoRI, producing fragments encoding the entire kinase reading frame, which was then cloned into theEcoRI and BglII sites of SRα. Rat CaM kinase IV, including a full-length, wild-type clone as well as a Ca2+-independent, truncated clone coding for residues 1–313 cloned into a pCMV expression vector was also a gift of A. Means (29Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The full reading frame for CaM kinase IV was cloned out of this vector by cutting at the 5′-end of the coding region withNotI, blunting this site with T4 DNA polymerase, and then cutting the 3′-end with ApaI. This fragment was then cloned into the EcoRV and ApaI sites of SRα. A clone containing the entire reading frame of human calmodulin was a generous gift of P. Yaswen. SRα-calmodulin was created by cutting the 5′-end of this clone with NcoI, blunting with Klenow fragment, cutting the 3′-end with KpnI, and then cloning this fragment into the EcoRV and KpnI sites of SRα. All subcloning procedures were performed according to standard techniques, and all enzymes and buffers were obtained from Life Technologies and New England Biolabs Inc. SRα-protein kinase A was a gift of M. Muramatsu (DNAX, Palo Alto, CA). An expression vector for CaM kinase kinase was a generous gift of Thomas Soderling (30Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). SRα-protein kinase C and SRα-calcineurin have been described (31Nghiem P. Ollick T. Gardner P. Schulman H. Nature. 1994; 371: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% supplemented calf serum (Hyclone Labs) in a 10% CO2 incubator as described previously (25Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). DNA was purified using the Qiagen and Merlin (Bio 101, Vista, CA) systems according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were plated onto 35-mm cell culture dishes (Falcon) on the day prior to transfection at a density such that they were approximately 70% confluent on the day of transfection. For each transfection, 1.5–1.75 μg of total DNA was combined with 5 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transfection was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The transfection medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% supplemented calf serum 5 h post-transfection, and the cells were then left in the incubator for a total of approximately 48 h post-transfection prior to fixation or harvest. For immunofluorescence studies, 0.25 μg of CaM kinase II was cotransfected with 1.25 μg of empty SRα vector, SRα-CaM kinase I, or SRα-CaM kinase IV. For cotransfections including calmodulin and/or CaM kinase kinase, 0.25 μg of CaM kinase II was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of CaM kinase I or IV with or without 0.5 μg of SRα-calmodulin with or without 0.5 μg of CaM kinase kinase. For NLS binding studies, 1.5 μg of CaM kinase II was used for transfection. Fixation and staining of COS-7 cells were performed on 35-mm tissue culture dishes as described previously (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of α-CaM kinase II and αB-CaM kinase II was performed with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both isoforms of CaM kinase II. Immunodetection of hemagglutinin-tagged CaM kinase II was performed with a monoclonal antibody to this tag (Boehringer Mannheim). Secondary antibody detection with a rhodamine-linked goat anti-mouse antibody and fluorescence microscopy and photography were performed as described (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In order to quantitate nuclear localization of the kinase, 100 transfected cells per plate were scored in a blinded fashion as to whether the kinase was predominantly nuclear or predominantly cytoplasmic. The identity of the nucleus was verified by comparative phase-contrast microscopy. Cells in which definitive localization of CaM kinase II staining could not be established (a small fraction of the total) were omitted from analysis. Purified CaM kinase I was a generous gift of A. Nairn (Rockefeller University), and purified CaM kinase IV was a generous gift of A. Means. Peptides with the amino acid sequences CGVKKRKSSSSVQMME and CGVKKRKASSSVQMME were generated on an automated peptide synthesizer. Phosphorylation of these peptides by CaM kinase I and CaM kinase IV was carried out for 5 min at 30 °C in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mmPIPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 Ci/mmol), and 50 μm peptide. Reactions were initiated by the addition of kinase and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. Reaction mixes were then spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman), washed extensively with water, and then counted for Cerenkov radiation. αB-CaM kinase II, made kinase-inactive with a K42M point mutation (referred to as αB-CaM kinase IIi) as well as αB-CaM kinase IIi with the S332A point mutation were expressed in COS-7 cells and purified as described (25Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,31Nghiem P. Ollick T. Gardner P. Schulman H. Nature. 1994; 371: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Kuret J.A. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these two inactive mutants of αB-CaM kinase II by purified CaM kinase I was performed at 30 °C for 5 min in a 50-μl reaction mix containing 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (2.5 Ci/mmol), 1 μmcalmodulin, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylation of these CaM kinase II mutants by purified CaM kinase IV was performed under similar conditions, except that bovine serum albumin was used at 1 mg/ml and the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was 1.0 Ci/mmol. Equal amounts of purified αB-CaM kinase IIi with or without S332A were used in each reaction mix as verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining of the CaM kinase II samples (data not shown). The concentration of CaM kinase II used between experiments ranged from 0.01 to 0.02 mg/ml. The phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding either CaM kinase I or CaM kinase IV at a concentration of 5 μg/ml to the reaction mix and terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. The reactions were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Scanning densitometry was performed on an Arcus AGFA II scanner using NIH Image for data analysis. Phosphorylation of αB-CaM kinase IIi by either CaM kinase I or CaM kinase IV was quantified by densitometry and assigned the value of 100%; phosphorylation of αB-CaM kinase IIiS332A was divided by this value to determine its corresponding percentage of phosphorylation. The NLS receptor (NLS-R) m-pendulin fused with a His6 tag within the bacterial expression vector pET-30a (Novagen) was a generous gift of S. Adam (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) (33Chi N.C. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The NLS-R construct was transformed into BL21 bacteria (Novagen) and grown in 200 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin and amplified with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described (33Chi N.C. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The bacteria were pelleted, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Tris (carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium metabisulfite and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The bacterial suspension was frozen with liquid nitrogen, thawed, and then sonicated for a total of 3 min on ice at a setting of 50 W. The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × gat 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, aliquoted, quick frozen with liquid N2, and then stored at −80 °C. The His6 NLS-R was complexed to Ni2+-containing agarose resin (Qiagen) at a ratio of 6 mg of NLS-R-containing lysate to 50 μl of resin for 60 min at 4 °C with tumbling in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. The beads were then spun down and washed once in the same buffer and then three times in interaction buffer, a modification of a buffer used by Rexach and Blobel for NLS/NLS-R interaction (34Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) containing 40 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm TCEP, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% casaminoacids (Difco), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. COS-7 cells transfected with α-CaM kinase II wild type, αB-CaM kinase II wild type, and mutants of αB-CaM kinase II containing the individual point mutations S332A, S332D, and S332E were lysed by sonication and centrifuged, and kinase activity in the soluble fraction was assayed as described (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Kinase lysates were diluted in interaction buffer to produce equal concentrations of kinase based on the kinase activity assay, and these were then added to equal aliquots of the Ni2+-resin·NLS-R complexes (10 μl of resin per sample in 250 μl of interaction buffer) and tumbled at 4 °C for 60 min. After tumbling, the resin was spun down at 3,000 × gfor 1 min and then washed four times over 15 min in interaction buffer. The resin pellets were then stripped of protein in 20 μl of buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl. The supernatants stripped from the beads were then run on a 9% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the resulting blots were subjected to Western blotting for α-isoforms of CaM kinase II as described previously (14Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Each sample of kinase to be used for NLS-R binding was also subjected to Western blotting in parallel with the NLS-R-bound samples to ensure that kinase concentration as determined by kinase activity was equal to kinase level detected by Western blot. Densitometry and image analysis were performed as described above for phosphorylation experiments. For all quantitative analysis, the amount of each kinase that bound to the NLS-R·Ni2+-resin complex was divided by the amount of that kinase in the prebinding samples, and this ratio was compared for each kinase isoform and mutant analyzed, with the binding of wild type αB-CaM kinase II assigned the value of 100%. All chemicals used were obtained from Sigma except as indicated. For other NLS receptor constructs, His6-NPI-1 was a gift of S. Adam (33Chi N.C. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), GST-NPI-1 and GST-NPI-3 were gifts of R. O'Neil and P. Palese (35O'Neil R. Palese P. Virology. 1995; 206: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and GST-karyopherin α was a gift of M. Rexach and G. Blobel (Rockefeller University) (34Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). As we previously reported (12Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), α-CaM kinase II, which lacks a functional NLS, localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig.1 A) when transfected into COS-7 cells, while αB-CaM kinase II, which contains an NLS, localizes almost entirely to the cell nucleus (Fig. 1 Band Table I). We next sought to determine whether the activation of any known signal transduction pathway could alter the localization of αB-CaM kinase II to the nucleus. In order to do this, αB-CaM kinase II was cotransfected into COS-7 cells with cDNA constructs encoding several different protein kinases: the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A and constitutively active truncation mutants of CaM kinase I, CaM kinase IV, protein kinase Cβ, and the protein phosphatase calcineurin. After 48 h, the localization of CaM kinase II was determined by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes α-CaM kinase II isoforms. No effect on the nuclear localization of αB-CaM kinase II was noted when cotransfected with protein kinase A, protein kinase C, or calcineurin (data not shown). However, when cotransfected with constitutive, Ca2+/ca"

Here, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are shown to express two isoforms of the NFAT family endogenously, which are localized differentially in cells under resting conditions. Using a retroviral NFAT-specific luciferase reporter, we show that VSMC support previously unrecognized complexities in NFAT-mediated transcription, including evidence for negative regulation by Ca2+ signaling and positive regulation through co-activation of adenylyl cyclase and Ca2+ mobilization. The VSMC mitogen platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) induces NFAT-mediated transcription in VSMC. Thrombin and angiotensin II, which activate Gαq-coupled receptors, are significantly weaker inducers of NFAT-mediated luciferase expression than is PDGF-BB. However, co-stimulation studies show that Gαq receptor agonists augment the NFAT-mediated transcriptional response to PDGF-BB. This synergy can be explained in part by augmented intracellular Ca2+ transients elicited by multiple agonist challenges. These data indicate that agonists for phospholipase C-coupled receptors stimulate NFAT-mediated transcription in VSMC differentially, and that NFAT can function to integrate co-activating signals in the extracellular environment.

Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular Ca2+ stimulates calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic NFAT, leading to its nuclear translocation (2Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Macrolide immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 (6Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), block this step. In the nucleus, NFAT forms a heteromeric transcriptional co-activator complex with AP1 proto-oncogene partners that are co-induced downstream of receptor activation (3Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This multimeric NFAT complex participates in the transactivation of several cytokine genes by interactions with purine-rich genomic NFAT-responsive enhancer elements (NFRE) (7Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The first evidence for the existence of NFAT was derived from analysis of antigen-responsive enhancer elements in the cytokine IL-2 gene promoter in lymphocytes (8Durand D.B. Shaw J.-P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). A growing body of data now suggests that NFAT is expressed more widely but the picture is far from complete. To date, NFAT expression or function has been described in several types of non-lymphoid cells, including mast (9Weiss D.H. Hural J. Tara D. Timmerman L.A. Henkel G. Brown M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), endothelial (10Cockerill G.W. Bert A.G. Ryan G.R. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 2689-2698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neuronal cells (11Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the mRNAs for the known NFAT isoforms are expressed in distinct tissue-specific patterns (12Hoey T. Sun Y.-L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, the precise non-lymphoid cell types that express NFAT isoforms in vivo are largely unknown. For instance, it remains unclear whether NFAT is expressed to some degree in all cells, or if its expression in non-lymphoid tissues is restricted to certain subpopulations of cells within tissues. The presentation of foreign antigen on lymphocytes provides the best understood physiological inducer of NFAT-mediated transcription. The existence of NFAT in non-immune cells suggests that it can be directed to regulate gene expression by other physiologic stimuli. Physiological agonists for receptors that activate PLC signaling, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors, provide obvious candidates for this function (11Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Boss V. Talpade D.J. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10429-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The extent to which such stimuli can trigger NFAT-mediated transcription in non-lymphoid cells that express endogenous NFAT isoforms needs to be determined. Additionally, it is not known if NFAT transactivation properties in non-lymphoid cells differs from that in the better understood lymphocyte context. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) respond to a diverse group of extracellular signals to progress through phenotypic modulation, a process that occurs in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis (14Jackson C.L. Schwartz S.M. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 713-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Changes in gene expression patterns underlie this transition, which serves to regulate processes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, VSMC growth, and migration. Cultured VSMC serve as a useful system to understand the molecular and cellular consequences of VSMC activation, and are helpful in elucidating the genes, gene expression control pathways, and the extracellular signals associated with VSMC activation. We speculated that NFAT might be expressed in cultured VSMC and may participate in facilitating the VSMC activated state in response to mitogenic signals. The experiments described herein represent the first demonstration that NFAT is expressed in VSMC and provide evidence that PDGF-BB, which activates a tyrosine kinase-linked receptor, can serve as a physiological inducer of NFAT-mediated transcription in VSMC. This response is synergized by co-stimulation of VSMC with thrombin and angiotensin II, which activate PLCβ activity by coupling through the Gαq class of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. However, these latter agonists are weaker inducers of NFAT-mediated transcription than is PDGF-BB. The following plasmids used in this study were received as gifts: the retroviral plasmid pLNCX, from A. D. Miller (Seattle, WA); plasmids pSH210 and pSH250, encoding human NFATc1 and NFATc2, from G. Crabtree (Stanford, CA); and plasmid pNFAT/luc, from R. Bram (Memphis, TN). A mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG1, clone 7A6) against NFATc1 was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). The monoclonal antibody (GH8-G1-G9) against NFATc2 was a gift from G. Crabtree. Mouse IgG1 in clarified ascites was purchased from Sigma. Secondary antibodies were bought from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The tyramide-green immunochemical reporter was purchased from NEN Life Science Products). Except where noted all cell culture media, antibiotics and molecular biology supplies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine and calf serum were obtained from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA). Luciferin and additional salts and buffers used were purchased from Sigma. The retroviral plasmids used in this study were subcloned and maintained in Escherichia coliTop10F′ (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) in 100 μg/ml ampicillin plus 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. The VSMC used in this study were derived from dissociated rat thoracic aorta (passages 10 to 25) and are maintained as a continuous primary cell line in DMEM, 4.5 μg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated calf serum with 100 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (15Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 743-751PubMed Google Scholar). Amphotropic (ATCC CRL-11554) retroviral producer cells were obtained from the American Type and Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Angiotensin II was purchased from Sigma, purified human thrombin was provided generously by S. Krishnaswamy (Dept. of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA), and PDGF-BB was purchased from Calbiochem, Inc. (San Diego, CA). pTJM9 was created by placing a new multicloning site just distal of the cytomegalovirus promoter inHindIII- and ClaI-digested pLNCX (16Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 581-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTCCATTGTGCTGGTCGACGCGTCCAGCACAATGGAT and 5′-CGATCCATTGTGCTGGACGCGTCGACCAGCACAATGGA. The cytomegalovirus promoter in pTJM9 was removed by digestion with BamHI andHindIII, and the plasmid was closed by blunt-end ligation after Klenow treatment to create pTJM12. A luciferase coding sequence (17De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) with upstream remnant was excised with PstI andSstI from the vector poLuc (18Braiser A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). After Klenow treatment, the fragment ends were ligated with non-cohesive BstXI adapters (5′-CTGGCGCG and 5′-CGCGCCAGCACA) and subsequently cloned into pTJM12 digested with BstXI. The resulting construct, pKA8, can accept promoters in the unique BamHI and HindIII (5′ to 3′) sites just proximal of the luciferase 5′ end, and transcribes luciferase off of the opposite strand as that for the viral 5′-LTR promoter. Plasmid pKA7 contains a ∼250-base pairBamHI-HindIII fragment with an NFAT enhancer triplex linked to the minimal IL-2 promoter fragment excised from pNFAT/luc (19Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was cloned into the same sites in pKA8. Plasmid pKA9 contains a ∼130-base pair BamHI-HindIII fragment for the minimal IL-2 promoter, without the NFAT enhancer, amplified from pNFAT/luc by PCR using the primers 5′-CTCGGATCCTATGTAAAACATTTTGACACC and 5′-GGCAAGCTTAGGAGTTGAGGTTACTGTGA. To create a reporter plasmid bearing a mutation in the NFAT binding site (mutations shown in bold letters), the oligonucleotides F87 (5′-GATCAGGACTGATCACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGC) and F88 (5′-GATCGCCTTCTGTATGAAACAGTGATCAGTCCT) were concatenized by brief ligation before adding BamHI-digested pKA9 to the ligation reaction. pKA10 represents a clone derived from this procedure that was identified by sequencing as having an enhancer region identical that in pKA7 except for conversion of the NFAT binding site from GGAAAA to CTGATC. Retroviruses were prepared by transient transfection of helper virus-free amphotropic producer cells (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Bing-CAK8 cells (ATCC CRL-11554) were grown from original expanded stocks without selective antibiotics for less than 30 days in growth medium (GM) consisting of DMEM, 4.5 μg/ml glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and a mixture of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. To produce infectious retroviral supernatants, the cells at 50–80% confluence in 10-cm diameter dishes were transfected with the retroviral plasmids using calcium phosphate and 25 μm chloroquine for 6–12 h before re-feeding with 25 ml of GM. Twenty-four hours after initiating the transfection, the GM was aspirated and replaced with 9 ml of fresh GM before placing the dishes in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 32 °C. Previous work has shown this lower temperature enhances retroviral titers (21Kotani H. Newton III, P.B. Zhang S. Chiang Y.L. Otto E. Weaver L. Blaese R.M. Anderson W.F. McGarrity G.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The supernatant containing retroviral particles was harvested after 24 h, and twice more at 12–18 h intervals thereafter replenishing with 9 ml of GM each time. Each collected supernatant (9 ml) was filtered through sterile 0.45-μm syringe-tip cellulose acetate disk, aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. VSMC (∼20% confluent) grown on 6 × 35-mm multiwell plates were infected with retroviruses by adding thawed retroviral supernatant (2 ml) containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene to each well and spinning the cells at 2,500 rpm for 30 min at 32 °C in a Beckman model GS-6R refrigerated centrifuge in a swinging bucket rotor before placing in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. This infection protocol was repeated twice more at 8–12 h intervals. Forty-eight hours following the last infection, the cells were treated with 400 μg/ml G418 in normal growth VSMC medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Within 7 days of selection, the surviving cells from each well were combined, expanded, and used subsequently for further study without subcloning and maintained in the absence of G418. Because cell death during selection of retrovirus-infected cultures was minimal compared with that in retrovirus-naı̈ve cells treated in parallel with 400 μg/ml G418, transduction efficiency was estimated in all cases to be nearly quantitative. Recombinant VSMC selected for reporter retroviruses were grown to confluence in 24-well plates for 3 days in growth medium lacking G418 and then for an additional 24 h in medium lacking serum before stimulation with drugs and agonists. The drugs were prepared as 10-fold concentrated stocks in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and added as aliquots directly to the cells to begin stimulation. These were performed in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for the indicated time before the cells were lysed and extracts were prepared for luciferase determinations, as described previously (22Takeuchi K. Alexander R.W. Nakamura Y. Tsujino T. Murphy T.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To prepare control cell extracts expressing defined NFAT isoforms, COS-7 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine approach with the vector pSH107c, encoding human NFATc1; or the vector pSH210, encoding human NFATc2 (23Ho S.N. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Li X. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19898-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); or pCDM8 as a sham control. Confluent VSMC or transfected COS cells were rinsed in PBS before lysis in RIPA-2 (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (90 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 TIU/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C and discarded. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using a kit purchased from Bio-Rad, and γ globulin as standard. Samples were dissolved in SDS loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C before separation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon P membranes that were blocked in 0.5% nonfat dried milk and incubated overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of either the anti-NFATc1 or anti-NFATc2 monoclonal antibodies. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection kit (Phototope-HRP, New England Biolabs, Natick, MA) using 1:20,000 horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary. VSMC (7 × 104 cells) were plated in 35-mm dishes 24 h prior to drug treatments, and changed to serum-free medium 1 h before the addition of drugs. CsA was dissolved in 2.5% ethanol in cell culture medium containing 0.1% Tween 80 to prepare a 100-fold concentrated stock solution. Ionomycin was added to the cells directly from a 100-fold stock solution. The cells received either CsA (1 μm final concentration) or its vehicle for 10 min prior to the addition of ionomycin (1 μm final concentration) or its vehicle. After 15 min, the medium was aspirated and the cells were rinsed with PBS before fixation for 10 min using cold methanol/0.3% H2O2before storing at 4 °C in PBS. Antibody staining was performed at room temperature within 1 week of these treatments. The samples were first blocked against avidin/biotin using the AVB kit (Vector Laboratories), according to directions supplied by the manufacturer. After rinsing with PBS, nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubating the cells with PBS containing 2% horse serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 22 °C. All primary antibodies were diluted in this blocking solution at a 1:250 dilution and applied to the cells for 60 min at 22 °C. Following three washes with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, the cells were incubated for 60 min with a 1:10,000 dilution of biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals, Inc., West Grove, PA). After washing as above, antibody binding was visualized using a catalyzed reporter deposition kit (T.S.A. Direct Green, NEN Life Science Products according to the manufacturers directions but with a 1:100 dilution of the streptavidin HRP conjugate. After the final rinse, the cells were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C with a Hoechst stain (H33258) in PBS, then washed three times with PBS. After coverslipping using Vectashield, all analyses and photography were performed on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with an Optronics video camera, which was in line with a Power Macintosh 7600 computer equipped with NIH Image. Confluent 10-cm plates of VSMC were washed three times with Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and treated with 1 mg/ml type-1 collagenase (178 units/ml; Worthington Biochemical, Inc., Freehold, NJ) at 37 °C. The dispersed cells were collected, washed in Ca2+/Mg2+- replete HBSS (Ca2+/Mg2+ HBSS), counted, and then resuspended to 3–4 × 106 cells/ml in HEPES-buffered DMEM (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (DMEM+BSA). Fura-2/AM (1 mm stock in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 2 μm, and the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were brought to a final volume of 40 ml in DMEM+BSA, spun at 500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a benchtop centrifuge, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+ HBSS. After counting, the cells were diluted on ice into 3-ml aliquots containing 2 × 106cells/ml. Just prior to assay, each aliquot was centrifuged briefly and the pellet resuspended gently in 1 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+ HBSS that was added to stirred cuvettes containing 2 ml of pre-warmed Ca2+/Mg2+ HBSS. Agonists were added from 100-fold concentrated stocks, and the excitation ratio (340/380 nm) was measured for emission intensity at 510 nm on a Perkin Elmer LS50 spectrometer. VSMC, or control 293 cells transfected with pSH210, were treated with drugs as described in legend to Fig. 5 before nuclei were harvested as described previously (15Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 743-751PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared by gently resuspending the nuclei in 0.5 volumes of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 20 mm KCl). An equivalent volume of high salt buffer (low salt buffer except with 0.8 m KCl) was next added dropwise with gentle mixing, and the nuclei were incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation in a Beckman TLS55 rotor at 25,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was dialyzed against 500 volumes of a buffer identical to the low salt buffer above except containing 100 mm KCl. Aliquots of the dialyzed sample were frozen at –80 °C until use. Binding assays were performed at 22 °C for 30 min in a 20-μl volume composed of nuclear extract (containing 10 μg of VSMC nuclear protein or 1 μg of 293/NFAT nuclear protein), 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 13% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The probe used in binding assays (wtNFRE) was derived from the distal NFRE in the human IL-2 gene and formed by the oligonucleotides D79 (5′-GAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT) and D80 (5′-GAACGCCTTCTGTATGAAACAGTTTTTCCTCCTT), which were end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unlabeled competitor probes used in binding assays include mutNFRE, which was formed by annealing oligonucleotides F87 and F88 (see above), and the wtNFRE composed of oligonucleotides D79 and D80. After the binding incubation period, the samples were loaded onto Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, resolved by electrophoresis, and subjected to autoradiography. Western blot analysis indicates that a protein in VSMC reacts with monoclonal antibody 7A6 (23Ho S.N. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Li X. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol.

The antibody specificity for the NFATc1 isoform is indicated by immunoreactivity in extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with a human cDNA for NFATc1, but not in extracts transfected with sham plasmid or with a plasmid encoding the NFATc2 isoform (23Ho S.N.

The heterogeneous mobility of the immunoreactive VSMC protein is typically seen in NFAT-expressing cells, and might result from either alternate exon usage or various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (24Ruff V.A.

Immunohistochemical analysis of cultured VSMC provides evidence that, in addition to NFATc1, NFATc2 is not only expressed in these cells, but has a subcellular pattern of expression distinct from that of NFATc1. In unstimulated cells, NFATc1 immunoreactivity is predominantly cytoplasmic, but occurs in a clustered pattern, consistent with vesicular localization (Fig.2 a). This basal pattern contrasts sharply with the more pronounced nuclear localization observed after a 10-min exposure to 1.0 μm ionomycin (Fig. 2 c). Treatment of the cells with 1 μmCsA before and during challenge with ionomycin prevents ionomycin-induced nuclear translocation of NFATc1 (Fig. 2 e). This calcium-dependent, CsA-sensitive nuclear transport is a characteristic property of NFAT (2Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 24Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In striking contrast, NFATc2 immunoreactivity is predominantly nuclear in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2 g), and this localization is unaffected by ionomycin treatment (Fig. 2 i) or by ionomycin treatment in the presence of CsA (Fig. 2 k). The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed in immunohistochemical control experiments, in which 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding each of the four major NFAT isoforms. Furthermore, there is no detectable staining in VSMC incubated with non-immune IgG as a negative control (data not shown). From these controls and the staining shown in VSMC, these data indicate that localization of various endogenously expressed NFAT isoforms differs in VSMC, suggesting they may be under control of different regulatory processes. In order to study control of NFAT-mediated transcription in VSMC, a retroviral-based luciferase transcriptional reporter system was developed to take advantage of the higher efficiency of retroviral gene transfer than is possible in VSMC using plasmid transfection approaches. The retroviral NFAT/luciferase reporter vector pKA7 is depicted in Fig. 3 A. This vector contains a luciferase coding sequence under the control of a minimal human IL-2 promoter with an upstream triplex of the distal IL-2 gene NFRE. These elements were derived from a plasmid NFAT-responsive reporter vector whose fidelity has been characterized extensively, by ourselves and others (13Boss V. Talpade D.J. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10429-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A neomycin resistance gene is expressed from the viral 5′-LTR promoter, and selection for cells resistant to this antibiotic ensures that all cells in the culture have been infected with a retrovirus, which is important for comparing responses among the various control reporter vectors. In preliminary experiments, we found that NFAT-luciferase reporter vectors are substantially more responsive to stimuli when the orientation of luciferase transcription is directed toward the retroviral 5′-LTR, rather than when transcription of the two promoters are driven off of the same strand (data not shown). The control reporter vectors are shown in Fig. 3 B and include a promoterless luciferase (pKA8), a luciferase driven by a minimal IL-2 promoter but lacking an NFRE (pKA9), and a minimal promoter with a NFRE possessing mutations that disrupt the NFAT-binding site within the NFRE (pKA10). The data shown in Fig. 3 C indicate that highly inducible and synergistic luciferase expression consistent with NFAT-mediated transcription occurred only in VSMC infected with retrovirus prepared from plasmid pKA7, and that no responses were observed in cells infected with any of the other reporter viruses. Stimulation for 4 h with 100 nm PMA alone yielded a response that was 28 ± 1-fold over basal (mean ± S.E., n = 3), whereas the response to 1 μm ionomycin (1.3 ± 0.2-fold; mean ± S.E., n = 3) was no different from that of vehicle. Co-stimulation of VSMC with ionomycin and PMA resulted in a synergistic response that was 86 ± 10-fold over basal (mean ± S.E., n = 3), and was c"

Homology screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library resulted in the identification of two alternative splice variants of the glycine receptor α3 subunit.

In contrast, the novel splice variant α3K lacked the coding sequence for 15 amino acids located within the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane spanning region 3 (TM3) and TM4.

As members of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, these polypeptides share topological features including a large N-terminal extracellular domain followed by four transmembrane spanning regions (TM1-TM4). While the N-terminal domain carries structural determinants essential for agonist and antagonist binding (3Sontheimer H. Becker C.-M. Pritchett D.B. Schofield P.R. Grenningloh G. Kettenmann H.

Resembling the situation in the mouse, a variety of GLRA1 mutant alleles have been shown to cause the human neurological disorder hyperekplexia or startle disease (12Shiang R. Ryan S.G. Zhu Y.-Z.

Weber R.G. Lichter P. Kioschis P. Poustka A. Becker C.-M. Genomics. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, the gene encoding the GlyR α3 subunit has to be considered a candidate gene for human and murine neurological disorders. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of two splice variants of the human α3 subunit and the correspondingGLRA3 gene which was mapped to the chromosomal region 4q33-q34. Functional expression in HEK 293 cells of GlyR α3L and GlyR α3K resulted in the formation of glycine-gated chloride channels that significantly differed in desensitization behavior. A human fetal brain library (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used for isolation of cDNA clones. After plating of ca. 9 × 106 plaque forming units, screening was performed under intermediate stringency conditions using a complex cDNA probe which covered the whole open reading frames of rat α1, α2, α3 and human α1 and α2 cDNAs. Hybridization was carried out at 52 °C in 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 7% SDS (w/v) and 100 mg/ml denaturated salmon sperm DNA for 12 h. Filters were washed two times in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 52 °C for 20 min. Of the positive clones, a randomly selected sample was further analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. To this end, human α1- and α2-specific cDNA probes were generated. The α1 probe amplified by PCR corresponded to nucleotide positions −30 to 92, while an α2-specific probe was generated by EcoRV andPvuII restriction digest of an α2 cDNA clone and covered nucleotides 1162–1262 encoding the cytoplasmic loop between TM3 and TM4. Hybridization and washing conditions were as given above, except that the temperature was 65 °C. Two of the resulting clones, p7 (3 kb) and p12 (1 kb), that hybridized to neither the α1 nor the α2 probe were characterized further. All other DNA manipulations were according to standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed on the ABI PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer. Genomic P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones were obtained by screening spotted filters of a human high density PAC-library (catalog no. 704) provided by the Resource Center of the German Human Genome Project (Berlin, Germany). The radiolabeled 3-kb insert of clone p7 was employed as screening probe at hybridization and washing conditions as given above (65 °C). Ten genomic PAC clones obtained were subjected to both, PCR characterization using exonic primers and Southern blot hybridization to cDNA probes. Four PAC clones (ZP2.1, LLNLP704H07287Q; ZP3.2, LLNLP704P0954Q1; ZP5.1, LLNLP704L4250Q; and ZP10.1, LLNLP704O21267Q) were further analyzed as they turned out to represent a complete GLRA3 contig. These clones served as templates for direct, automated DNA sequencing with appropriate cDNA primers. Regional expression of the GlyR α3 subunit was analyzed using prefabricated RNA blots of human central nervous system tissues (human brain MTN blot II;CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). Two probes covering those nucleotide positions that encode the cytoplasmic loop between TM3 and TM4 were used for isoform selective detection of both mRNA variants, α3L and α3K. Among the probes used, oligonucleotide hsa3-ish-ins (CCATATCTGAGAAACGGTAAAACTTCTCAGTGCAAAAGCTTCTGT) contains the alternatively spliced cDNA stretch of 45 bp characteristic for the GlyR α3L transcript variant. In contrast, GlyR α3K transcripts were detected employing a radiolabeled α3K-cDNA amplimer from clone p7, covering nucleotides 981 to 1187. The cDNA probe was radiolabeled by random primed incorporation (PrimeIt; Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) of [α-32P]ATP, while the oligonucleotide hsa3-ish-ins was 5′-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) using [γ-32P]ATP. Following the manufacturer instructions, overnight hybridizations were performed using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for oligonucleotide and 70 °C for cDNA probes. Subsequently, membranes were washed three times at 32 °C for 10 min, and once at 54 °C for 20 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Using intensifying screens, x-ray films were exposed at −70 °C for 20 h (blot A), 52 h (blot B), and 5.5 h (blot C) as depicted in Figs. 2, A–C. PAC clones ZP3.2 and ZP5.1 were labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP using standard nick translation protocols, and FISH was performed to normal human metaphase chromosomes separately for each PAC clone (21Lichter P. Tang C.J. Call K. Hermanson G. Evans G.A. Housman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). For FISH, 200 ng of each labeled PAC clone were combined with 10 μg of human Cot1 DNA and 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 10 μl hybridization solution. Following denaturation, the DNA was allowed to pre-anneal for 30 min at 37 °C. After hybridization at 37 °C overnight, posthybridization washes were performed to a stringency of 0.5× SSC at 60 °C. Hybridized probe was detected by anti-digoxigenin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and chromosomes were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol-dihydrochloride (DAPI). The experiments were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. Digitized images were obtained separately for DAPI and FITC with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). PCR amplimers covering exonic regions and flanking intronic sequences of theGLRA3 gene were generated from peripheral leukocyte DNA and subjected to mutational analysis by SSCP screening. Amplifications (30 cycles) were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 25–50 ng of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 50 mm each dNTP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase with an annealing temperature of 55 °C. For denaturation, 10 μl of the PCR reaction were mixed with 1.5 μl of 0.5 m NaOH, 10 mm EDTA, 1.5 ml of 50% sucrose, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and subsequently heated. Denaturated fragments were separated for 1.5–2 h on a 12% polyacrylamide gel at the temperatures of 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C. DNA was detected by silver staining (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). To generate an appropriate expression construct, the GlyR α3K open reading frame was amplified from clone p7 using the PCR primers hsa3-S1-exp (ACAGAATTCCGTATCATGGCCCACGTGA) and hsa3-A10-exp (ACAGGATCCCCCAGAGACTTAATCTTG). Restriction sites forEcoRI and BamHI (underlined nucleotide positions) were introduced into hsa3-S1-exp and hsa3-A10-exp and used for subcloning of the amplimers obtained into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector pRk5. The cDNA clone p12, corresponding to GlyR α3L, lacks the 5′ end of the open reading frame. Thus, two PCRs were required for amplification of a complete GlyR α3 open reading frame. Nucleotide positions −8 to 1186 were amplified from clone p7 using the primers hsa3-S1-Exp and hsa3-A10–1167 (CCTTTGCTTGTAGACATGGT). The sequence harboring the alternatively spliced part of the GlyR α3L cDNA was amplified employing oligonucleotides hsa3-S8–999 (TTTTCAGCACTTCTGGAG) and hsa3-A10-exp and clone p12 as template. Both amplimers were cut at a commonPvuII restriction site following nucleotide position 1006, and the fragments resulting were ligated to yield a complete GlyR α3L open reading frame. The GlyR α3L fragment obtained was subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of the expression vector pRK5. Both expression constructs, differing in the 45-bp insert of GlyR α3L, were verified by complete sequencing. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293 cells, CRL 1573; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar) with the human GlyR α3K and GlyR α3L expression constructs. Transfected cells were viewed with an inverted microscope (Axiovert 35, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and continuously perfused (1 ml min−1) at room temperature (21–25 °C) with an extracellular bath solution containing: 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. Membrane currents were obtained from cells using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) linked to an Atari STE computer controlled by HEKA software. The membrane potential was clamped at −70 mV in all experiments and agonist-induced whole-cell currents were sampled at 20 Hz. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) with a Zeitz DMZ Universal Puller (Zeitz Instruments, Augsburg, Germany) to yield tip resistance of 2–4 megohm. Pipettes were filled with a solution containing: 120 mm CsCl, 20 mmtetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Series resistances after whole-cell formation were compensated for 50–90%. Superfusion was performed with a DAD-12 (Adams and List, Westbury, NY) drug application system. Dose-response curves of agonist-induced peak currents were normalized to the maximum value and data were fitted with the sigmoidal Hill equation using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Results are expressed as means ± standard deviation. Double exponential curves were fitted to the desensitizing phase of the GlyR responses. To identify novel variants of the ligand binding GlyR subunit from human central nervous system, a fetal brain cDNA library was screened using a complex probe composed of various human and rodent α subunit cDNAs (α1–α3). From a random sample comprising 20 out of >100 hybridizing clones, transcripts of the human GlyR α1 and α2 subunit genes were excluded by Southern blot hybridization to α1 and α2 cDNA fragments. While none of the clones hybridized to the α1 fragment, 18 clones were recognized by the α2-specific probe. This is consistent with a prevalence of the α2 subunit in the human fetal central nervous system, resembling the situation in the rodent (23Malosio M.-L. Marquèze-Pouey B. Kuhse J. Betz H.

The nonhybridizing clones p7 and p12 were found to contain inserts of 3069 and 940 base pairs, respectively. As revealed by DNA sequencing, clone p12 was highly homologous to the rat GlyR α3 subunit cDNA (25Kuhse J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22317-22320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) representing a 3′ partial clone that lacked a 5′ segment of 733 nucleotides as counted from the translation start (Fig. 1). In contrast, clone p7 contained a complete open reading frame as well as large parts of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). Compared with clone p12 and the rat α3 subunit cDNA, clone p7 lacked a stretch of 45 bp corresponding to nucleotides 1072–1116 of the coding sequence (Fig.1), indicative of alternative splicing. This predicts a loss of 15 amino acids positioned within the cytoplasmic loop connecting TM3 and TM4 of the subunit polypeptide, hence referred to as GlyR α3K. Moreover, the sequences of both clones differ within the 3′-UTR starting with nucleotide position 1649. This would be compatible with the occurrence of two distinct transcripts resulting from a complex splice event where excision of the alternative sequence of 45 bp coincides with a splice event in the 3′-UTR. A search for internal homologies revealed that a 31-bp long internal repeat existed within the GlyR α3L transcript. The sequence of nucleotide positions 692–723 is identical to the reverse sequence comprising nucleotides 1642–1672, predicting a putative loop structure with a 31-bp stem length. In the GlyR α3K transcript, this motif does not exist as both variants differ starting from nucleotide position 1649. Except for the deletion present in GlyR α3K, the human GlyR α3 open reading frame was 88% identical at the nucleotide and over 98% identical at amino acid level to the rat α3 subunit. Of seven amino acid substitutions, one affects the signal peptide, five are localized within the cytoplasmic loop, and an additional substitution is in the C-terminal part. Thus, interspecies sequence divergency is highest in the cytoplasmic loop, reminiscent of other GlyR α subunit variants (2Grenningloh G. Rienitz A. Schmitt B. Methfessel C. Zensen M. Beyreuther K. Gundelfinger E.D. Betz H. Nature. 1987; 328: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar,6Derry J.M. Barnard P.J. Genomics(1991). 1991; 10: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A search for transcription regulator motifs identified a consensus sequence of the neuron-restrictive silencer element situated within the 5′-UTR, 145 bp in front of the translation start (Fig. 1). This recently described short DNA element contributes to the suppression of neuron-specific genes in non-neuronal tissues (26Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Regional distribution of the alternatively spliced transcripts GlyR α3L and GlyR α3K in adult human central nervous system was assessed by Northern blot hybridization. The probes used selectively recognized isoform-specific sequences coding for the divergent region within the cytoplasmic loop between TM3 and TM4. This led to the detection of mRNA species of 9 and 2.4 kb corresponding to the GlyR α3K and GlyR α3L transcripts, respectively (Fig.2). Both subunits were widely expressed throughout most central nervous system regions examined. A human genomic PAC library (27Ioannou P.A. Amemiya C.T. Garnes J. Kroisel P.M. Shizuya H. Chen C. Batzer M.A. de Jong P.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) was screened using the radiolabeled 3-kb insert of cDNA clone p7. Based on the cDNA sequences, ten positive PAC clones were characterized further by PCR and Southern hybridization. Four clones proved to be overlapping and were used for the determination of the GLRA3 gene structure by sequencing the exon-intron boundaries and flanking intronic sequences. The coding sequence was found to be distributed over ten exons (exons 1–9; Fig. 1 and Table I), while exon 10 was completely located in the 3′-UTR. The sequences of the exon-intron boundaries (Table I) largely match the consensus sequences determined for mammalian splice sites (28Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar). A comparison showed that the exon-intron anatomy of GLRA3 resembled those of the human and murine α1, α2, and α4 genes (8Matzenbach B. Maulet Y. Sefton L. Courtier B. Avner P. Guenet J.L. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2607-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shiang R. Ryan S.G. Zhu Y.-Z. Hahn A.F. O'Connel P. Wasmuth J.J. Nat.

Positions of exon-intron boundaries proved to be highly conserved, and gene structure homology was highest with GLRA1 sharing the same lengths for exons 1–8. The alternatively spliced stretch of 45 bp constitutes a separate novel exon, referred to as exon 8A. The putative splice site located in the 3′-UTR of the α3 transcripts was analyzed by sequencing the corresponding genomic region contained in PAC clone ZP5.1. As the genomic sequences obtained were completely identical to the 3′-UTR within clone p7, the sequence starting from nucleotide 1648 in clone p7 is thought to represent the unspliced intron 9. To exclude that the persistence of intron 9, as found in clone p7, was due to a splice artifact, the expressed sequence tags (EST) data base of the GenBankTM was searched using the 3′-UTR sequence of this clone. Indeed, two independent cDNA clones (AA283885, AA488804) were identified that contained the identical 3′-UTRs covering the exon 9/intron 9 transition sequence.Table IExon-intron boundaries of the GLRA3 geneExon no. consensusFrom ntAcceptor nagGExon sizeDonor AGgta/gagtTo ntbpE1171CAGgtgagt71E272gtagTTT128AAGgtaatt199E3200tcagGCC68ATGgtaggc267E4268atagGAT224AAGgtgagt491E5492tcagATT83GCTgtaagt574E6575ctagTTG138CAGgtaggg712E7713ttagGAA215AAAgtaagt927E8928ctagGTT144AAGgtaagt1071E8A1072acagACA45ATGgtaaat1116E91117acagGAT276AACcatgta1392E10TTT Open table in a new tab The chromosomal localization of GLRA3 was determined by FISH to normal human metaphase chromosomes using the two independent PAC clones ZP3.2 and ZP5.1 detected by an FITC-labeled antibody against digoxigenin. From each of the two experiments, at least 40 metaphase cells were analyzed microscopically and 15 metaphase cells with particularly extended chromosomes were selected for digital image analysis. The FITC images, revealing the probe signals, were overlaid with the corresponding images of DAPI-banded chromosomes. Both PAC clones mapped to the same chromosomal bands allowing the assignment ofGLRA3 to 4q33-q34 (Fig. 3). No additional signals were found in other regions of the human genome for any of the PAC clones tested. The human neurological disorder, hyperekplexia, is caused by mutations of the GLRA1 gene in a large number of cases. In the majority of cases, however, no association could be found with allelic variants of GLRA1 (12Shiang R. Ryan S.G. Zhu Y.-Z. Hahn A.F. O'Connel P. Wasmuth J.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of GLRA3 as a candidate gene of hereditary hyperekplexia. DNA samples from 14 patients previously excluded to carry GLRA1 coding mutations, were subjected to SSCP screening. In analogy to GLRA1 allelic variants, where all amino acid substitutions identified are restricted to TM2 and its flanking polypeptide segments, we focused on the corresponding exons 6, 7, and 8 (12Shiang R.

In 4 out of 14 patients, an SSCP polymorphism was identified in amplimers from exon 7. Direct sequencing revealed that this polymorphism was due to a silent C to T exchange in the wobble position of codon T292. Polymorphism frequencies did not significantly differ between a sample of normal probands and affected individuals (data not shown). The physiological properties of glycine receptor channels encoded by both α3 splice variants were analyzed by patch-clamp recording from transfected HEK 293 cells. Upon expression of the GlyR α3L and α3K cDNA constructs, superfusion with glycine elicited current responses characterized by maximal membrane currents (Imax) with mean amplitudes of 3988 ± 1169 pA and 3690 ± 737 pA, respectively (Fig.4 A, Table II). Half-maximal responses (EC50) were observed at glycine concentrations of 54 ± 12 μm (n = 7) and 64 ± 14 μm (n = 5) for GlyR α3L and GlyR α3K, respectively (Fig. 4 B, Table IIc).Table IIElectrophysiological properties of GlyR α3K and GlyR α3LGlyR α3KGlyR α3LEC5064 ± 14 μm (n = 5)54 ± 12 μm (n = 7)Hill coefficient (nH)2.5 ± 0.2 (n = 5)2.8 ± 0.3 (n = 7)Imax3690 ± 737 pA3988 ± 1169 pAτ11.2 ± 0.6 s (n = 17)4.6 ± 1.4 s (n = 24)τ215 (n = 17)22 ± 5 s (n = 24)F (I)79 ± 13%52 ± 11%F(I) is the fraction of total desensitizing current.

G protein-coupled receptors can activate Erk1/2 by Gs-, Gi-, or Gq-dependent signaling pathways, depending on the specific receptor and cell type examined. Since the calcitonin receptor can couple to all three of these G proteins, the ability of calcitonin to activate Erk1/2 was investigated. Calcitonin induced time- and concentration-dependent increases in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc-Grb2 association and Erk1/2 phosphorylation and activation in a HEK 293 cell line that stably expresses the rabbit calcitonin receptor C1a isoform. Pertussis toxin, which inactivates Gi, and calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, each partially inhibited calcitonin-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc-Grb2 association, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, neither forskolin nor H89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, had a significant effect on basal or calcitonin-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the calcitonin receptor induces Shc phosphorylation and Erk1/2 activation in HEK293 cells by parallel Gi- and PKC-dependent mechanisms. The calcitonin-induced elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ was required for Erk1/2 phosphorylation, since preventing any change in cytosolic free Ca2+ by chelating both cytosolic and extracellular Ca2+ abolished the response. However, the change in Ca2+ that is induced by calcitonin is not sufficient to account for the calcitonin-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation, since treatment with 100 nm ionomycin or 10 μm thapsigargin, each of which induced elevations of Ca2+ comparable to those induced by calcitonin, induced significantly less Erk1/2 phosphorylation than that induced by calcitonin.

The Calcitonins: Physiology and Pharmacology. Karger, Basel1989Google Scholar). High affinity CT binding has also been demonstrated in other tissues, including the central nervous system, pituitary gland, and gastrointestinal tract. Because of its marked hypocalcemic effect, CT has been widely used for treating diseases that are characterized by elevated osteoclast activity, such as hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteoporosis, and Paget's disease (1Azria M. The Calcitonins: Physiology and Pharmacology. Karger, Basel1989Google Scholar). The CT receptor (CTR) couples to multiple heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to the activation of the proximal effectors adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase Cβ (2Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Lin H.Y.

Galson D.L. Orcel P. Migliaccio S. Teti A. Goldring S.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12 (abstr.): S323Google Scholar). CT-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase Cβ appear to elicit different components of a cell's response to CT. For example, in isolated osteoclasts, cAMP-dependent mechanisms lead to reduced cell motility while protein kinase C-dependent events are apparently involved in the CT-induced retraction of the cell (6Zaidi M. Datta H.K. Moonga B.S. MacIntyre I. J. Endocrinol. 1990; 126: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Su Y. Chakraborty M. Nathanson M. Baron R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well documented activation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase Cβ following stimulation of the CTR, less progress has been made in characterizing the more distal signaling pathways elicited by CT (8Horne W.C. Shyu J.-F. Chakraborty M. Baron R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 395-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a group of serine/threonine protein kinases, including Erk1/2, JNK, and SAPK, that lie at the end of parallel protein kinase cascades. MAPKs are activated in response to the stimulation of several distinct classes of cell-surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and play important roles in integrating the effects of extracellular signals on multiple cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, and transformation (9Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 10Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Erk1/2 (also denoted as p42/44 MAPK) were the first to be identified and are the best characterized. Their activation by several GPCR ligands has recently been well documented (11van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Depending on the receptors and the cell types, several distinct signal transduction pathways leading from GPCRs to Erk1/2 have been demonstrated. The pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-coupled receptors α2A-adrenergic receptor (AR) and M2A-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activate Erk1/2 by a mechanism that involves the sequential tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc, association of phosphorylated Shc with the Grb2·mSOS complex, and activation of Ras (12Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The same pathway is used by the receptors for EGF and other growth factors. The Gq-coupled receptors α1B-AR and M1A-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor can activate Erk1/2 via a PKC-dependent but Ras-independent pathway in some cells (12Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many GPCRs couple to more than one type of heterotrimeric G protein. For example, the thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors couple to Gi, Gq, and G12/13, and the thyrotropin receptor couples to Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12/13 (21Gudermann T. Kalkbernner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22Offermanns S. Simon M.I.

Interestingly, the LPA receptor-dependent activation of Erk1/2 is virtually abolished by pertussis toxin, indicating that activation is primarily via Gi with little contribution from Gq or G12/13 (24Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PTH/PTHrP receptor also couples to at least two different types of heterotrimeric G proteins, Gs and Gq (25Abou-Samra A.-B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.-F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that the PTH/PTHrP receptor can regulate Erk1/2 activity by different pathways, with the specific mechanism and resulting effect on Erk1/2 activity depending on the cellular context (15Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3423-3429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the mechanisms by which individual receptors regulate Erk1/2 activity are highly receptor- and cell type-specific. Since the CTR is capable of coupling to Gs, Gi, and Gq, we examined the ability of CT to regulate Erk1/2 activity. We report here that calcitonin induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc-Grb2 association, and Erk1/2 activation in HEK 293 cells that stably express the rabbit osteoclast CTR C1a isoform. Additive effects of pertussis toxin and PKC inhibition suggest that both Gi-dependent and pertussis toxin-insensitive PKC-dependent mechanisms contribute to the CTR-induced activation of Erk1/2. Erk1/2 are therefore downstream effectors of the CTR which may mediate certain cellular responses to CT. Salmon calcitonin was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Antibodies against total Erk1/2 and phosphorylated Erk1/2 were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal antibody used for Shc immunoprecipitation, the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, the antibody against Grb2, and MAP kinase MBP(95–98) substrate peptide were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Fetal bovine serum, forskolin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), pertussis toxin (PTX), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and LPA were from Sigma. The MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 and calphostin C were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International (San Diego, CA). Indo-1 penta(acetoxymethyl)ester (indo-1 AM), BAPTA-AM, and thapsigargin were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Enhanced chemiluminescence solutions and nitrocellulose membranes were from Amersham and Schleicher & Schuell (Keene, NH), respectively. The pRK5 vector and pRK-βARK1ct were generous gifts from Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz. HEK 293 cell stably expressing the rabbit CTR C1a (C1a-HEK)(4) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) in 10-cm plates until 80% confluent. Cells were then incubated in DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h prior to the treatments. For transient transfection, the HEK 293 cells were plated in 6-well plates until 80–90% confluent and transfected with 0.4 μg/well of CTR C1a in the presence of either 1 μg/well empty vector pRK5 or 1 μg/well βARKct using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies). The cells were cultured in DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h prior to stimulation with CT. Cells were treated with agents as indicated in the figure legends. After treatment, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 × g to pellet insoluble material. Protein concentrations were assayed with Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). For analysis of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with Grb2, 1.5 mg of cell lysate protein were incubated with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-Shc antibody plus 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) with mild agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with ice-cold modified RIPA buffer and denatured in Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Following resolution by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were then cut at the position of the 30-kDa protein marker. The upper part of the membrane was immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (1:1000 dilution) to detect the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. The membrane was stripped and reblotted with monoclonal anti-Shc antibody (1:1000 dilution) to determine the amounts of Shc proteins. The lower part of the membrane was immunoblotted with antibody against Grb2 (1:1000 dilution) to detect the presence of co-precipitated Grb2. Total cell lysates (20 μg) were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was measured by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody (anti-phospho-MAPK) that recognizes only the activated Erk1/2 (13Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Total Erk1/2 was detected by blotting with the antibody against a phosphotyrosine-independent Erk1/2 epitope (anti-p44/42 MAPK). Membranes were incubated with the anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (1:1000) or the anti-p44/42 MAPK antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, after three washes in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:20,000). After repeated washes, bound antibody was detected by the ECL method. C1a-HEK cells were grown to 80% confluence, then the medium was replaced by DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin for 18 h. The next day, the cells were incubated with or without the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 (50 μm) for 30 min prior to the addition of 1 nmCT or 10 ng/ml EGF. After 5-min exposure to the ligands, the cells were harvested in 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, containing 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (28Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized by passing through a 27-gauge needle five times, and the homogenates centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g. The kinase assay was performed in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm ATP (specific activity 0.8 Ci/mmol). MBP(95–98) substrate peptide was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 μg of cellular extracts to the above assay buffer, allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature, and terminated by spotting the reaction mixture onto Whatman p81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by three extensive washes in 150 mm phosphoric acid. The p81 phosphocellulose paper was rinsed briefly in acetone and the radioactivity incorporated into MBP peptide was measured by scintillation counting. C1a-HEK cells were loaded with indo-1 by incubation in conditioned medium with indo-1 AM (2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and harvested by brief exposure to nominally Ca2+- and Mg2+-free buffer containing trypsin (0.05%) and EDTA (0.5 mm). Conditioned medium was added to inactivate trypsin, following which cells were sedimented and resuspended in HEPES-buffered minimum essential medium. Aliquots of cell suspension were sedimented and resuspended in 2 ml of continuously stirred Na+-HEPES buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 290 mOsmol/liter) in a fluorimetric cuvette maintained at 37 °C. In experiments investigating dependence on extracellular Ca2+, cells were suspended in nominally Ca2+-free Na+-HEPES buffer or in Ca2+-containing Na+-HEPES buffer to which EGTA (5 mm) was added. For most experiments, solutions in the cuvette contained 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, cells were loaded with BAPTA-AM (50 μm) for 30 min concomitantly with indo-1 AM. Test substances were added directly to the cuvette. [Ca2+]i was monitored using a dual wavelength fluorimeter (model RF-M2004, from Photon Technology International, London, Canada) with excitation wavelength of 355 nm and emission wavelengths of 405 and 485 nm. The system software was used to subtract background fluorescence and calculate the ratio R, which is the fluorescence intensity at 405 nm divided by the intensity at 485 nm. [Ca2+]i was determined from the relationship [Ca2+] = Kd((R − Rmin)/(Rmax −R))β, where Kd (the dissociation constant for the indo-1-Ca2+ complex) was 250 nm, Rmin andRmax were the values of R at low and saturating concentrations of Ca2+, respectively, and β was the ratio of the fluorescence at 485 nm measured at low and saturating Ca2+ concentrations (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Peak Ca2+ responses were quantified as the maximum elevation of [Ca2+]i above basal levels induced by the test substance. Plateau phases of the responses were quantified as the value of [Ca2+]i above basal levels, 150 s after addition of the test substance. Data presented are representative traces or mean ± S.E. of the number of separate samples indicated. To examine the effect of CT on Erk1/2 phosphorylation, C1a-HEK cells were treated with 1 nm CT for increasing periods of time, then lysed and analyzed for phosphorylated Erk1/2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” CT induced rapid phosphorylation of Erk1/2, which was apparent as early as 30 s, reached a maximum at 5 min, and decreased to a low level by 60 min (Fig.1 A, upper panel). Parallel samples blotted with Erk1/2 antibody (lower panel) showed no change in the amount of Erk1/2 protein. The cells express predominantly the 42-kDa Erk2 protein, and both forms are phosphorylated at levels proportional to their expression. The effect of CT on Erk1/2 phosphorylation, measured after 5 min of treatment, was concentration-dependent. A detectable increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation was induced by as little as 0.001 nm CT and the maximum response occurred at concentrations of 1 nm or higher. The maximum phosphorylation induced by CT was comparable to that induced by 10 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation reflected the activation of the enzyme, we directly measured Erk1/2 activity. C1a-HEK cells were serum-starved overnight and subsequently treated with 1 nm CT for 5 min. Erk1/2 activity was determined by measuring [γ-32P]ATP incorporation into an Erk1/2-specific substrate peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The enzymatic activity was expressed as fold increase relative to the activity of untreated cells. CT induced a 2.3-fold increase in Erk1/2 activity, while EGF (10 ng/ml) induced a 2.6-fold increase in Erk1/2 activity (Fig.2 B). The phosphorylation and activation of Erk1/2 is catalyzed by ERK kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) (9Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). To further confirm that Erk1/2 phosphorylation correlates with activity, we examined the effect of the MEK-specific inhibitor PD 98059 on Erk activity and phosphorylation. As expected, pretreatment of the cells with 50 μm PD 98059 for 30 min almost completely abolished both the phosphorylation (Fig.2 A) and activation (Fig. 2 B) of Erk1/2 induced by CT or by EGF. GPCR may regulate Erk1/2 activity via one or more of several different pathways involving Gs-, Gi-, and Gq-dependent mechanisms, depending on the receptors and the cellular context (11van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Since the CTR is capable of coupling to Gs, Gi, and Gq, we investigated which pathways are involved in CT-induced Erk1/2 activation. Although cAMP generally attenuates growth factor-induced Erk1/2 activation (16Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Webber M. Sturgill T. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 17Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), the activation of Erk1/2 by cAMP has been reported (19Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 20Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether cAMP participated in CT-induced Erk1/2 activation (Fig.3). Serum-starved C1a-HEK cells were treated with 200 μm forskolin for 25 min alone or followed by 1 nm CT for an additional 5 min. Forskolin induced only a slight increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation (lane 3) and had no apparent effect on CT-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation (lane 4). Furthermore, the protein kinase A-specific inhibitor H89 (10 μm) had little effect on CT-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation (lane 6). Taken together, these data suggest that the cAMP/PKA pathway does not contribute significantly to CT-induced Erk1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells. In HEK 293 cells, both PTX-sensitive Gi-coupled receptors and PTX-insensitive Gq-coupled receptors can activate Erk1/2 via the Shc/Grb2/Ras pathway (13Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) by which receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor activate Erk1/2 (30Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether Shc also plays a role in the mechanism of CT-induced Erk1/2 activation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2 were analyzed. C1a-HEK cells were treated with 1 nm CT for various times and lysed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shc was immunoprecipitated from 1.5 mg of cell lysates and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed for Shc phosphorylation and Grb2 association as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.4 A, 1 nm CT induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of predominantly the 52-kDa Shc, which reached a maximum level at 5–10 min and remained elevated during the time course examined for up to 120 min. The broad band below 52-kDa Shc was a nonspecific interaction of the immunoprecipitation antibody with the immunoblotting antibodies, since it was present in mock immunoprecipitations performed in the absence of cell lysate (not shown). The amount of immunoprecipitated Shc is shown in themiddle panel of Fig. 4 A. The induction of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was also concentration-dependent, with the maximum effect induced by CT concentrations ≥1 nm(Fig. 4 B). Co-precipitated Grb2 was readily detectable in the samples in which Shc was phosphorylated. As expected, EGF also induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with Grb2 (Fig. 4 B), although to a much greater extent than did CT. Since the CTR can couple to both Gi and Gq, we examined the relative roles of PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins in the CT-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. C1a-HEK cells were pretreated with 200 ng/ml PTX for 18 h prior to stimulation with 1 nm CT or 10 μm LPA. LPA was used as a positive control since it is reported to activate Erk1/2 via Gi coupling (31van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were analyzed for Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, Shc-Grb2 association, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.5 A, PTX partially inhibited CT- and LPA-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc-Grb2 association. PTX completely abolished LPA-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation but only partially inhibited the phosphorylation induced by CT (Fig. 5 B). A peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1ct) has been reported to block signaling mediated by the βγ subunits of the Gi proteins, including the activation of Erk1/2 (13Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

To demonstrate further that the CTR-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation involves Gicoupling, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with CTR-C1a and pRK5 or CTR-C1a and pRK-βARK1ct. As shown in Fig. 5 C, βARK1ct reduced the CT-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation relative to the amount seen in cells transfected with the empty pRK5 vector, indicating the involvement of βγ subunits and supporting the involvement of Gi in the CTR-Erk1/2 coupling mechanism. Since CT stimulates PKC activity in C1a-HEK cells, 2Y. Chen, J-F. Shyu, A. Santhanagopal, D. Inoue, J.-P. David, S. J. Dixon, W. C. Horne, and R. Baron, unpublished observations. we sought to determine the involvement of PKC in the process of CT-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Subconfluent C1a-HEK cells were incubated overnight with or without PTX, then treated with the PKC-specific inhibitor calphostin C for 30 min prior to the addition of 1 nm CT. The cells were harvested and analyzed for Shc phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 complex formation (Fig.6 A) and for Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). Like PTX, calphostin C only partially blocked the CT-induced Shc phosphorylation and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, while the Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by 100 nm PMA were largely inhibited by the same concentration of calphostin C. In addition, the effects of PTX and calphostin C on Shc and Erk1/2 phosphorylation were additive. The results suggest that signal transduction from CTR to Shc and Erk1/2"
https://openalex.org/W2150179403,"Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that phosphodiesterase variants encoded by thePDE4D gene are targeted to discrete subcellular structures. In quiescent FRTL-5 thyroid cells, the rolipram-sensitive phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity (cAMP-PDE) was recovered both in the soluble and particulate fractions of the homogenate. Although an immunoreactive 93-kDa PDE (PDE4D3) variant was recovered in both compartments, a 105-kDa variant with the properties of PDE4D4 was recovered mostly in the particulate fraction. The PDE4D3 form was readily solubilized with nonionic detergents. Conversely, the PDE4D4 form required buffers containing ionic detergents for extraction, suggesting that different mechanisms target these variants to insoluble structures. A 15-min stimulation with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) led to an activation of the cAMP-PDE in both compartments and was correlated with a shift in electrophoretic mobility of the PDE4D3 polypeptide. Long term incubation with TSH caused an increase of the PDE activity in the soluble fraction and the appearance of a 68-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide with the properties of PDE4D2. Immunofluorescence analysis showed, in addition to diffuse staining, a signal localized on regions adjacent to the plasma membrane on cytoskeletal structures and in a perinuclear region of quiescent cells. Long term incubation with TSH caused an increase in the immunofluorescence signal in the soluble compartment. These data demonstrate that three PDE4D splicing variants are targeted to discrete subcellular compartments and that hormones cause the activation of these isoforms in a temporally and spatially dependent manner.

With the discovery of modular binding domains in proteins, it has been established that protein-protein interactions and compartmentalization play a crucial role in the transduction of growth factor signals (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar, 2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 3Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Binding and activation of the receptors for these growth factors trigger a cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions that in turn controls association/dissociation of oligomeric structures. These macromolecular complexes direct the signals to specific cellular compartments, i.e. plasma membrane, cytoskeletal structures, or the nucleus. Disruption of these complexes by blocking protein-protein interactions causes an impairment of signaling (2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Cyclic nucleotides are small second messengers that can diffuse throughout the cell. Synthesis of cAMP occurs at the level of the plasma membrane where receptors and adenylyl cyclases are localized. Under physiological conditions, diffusion from the site of synthesis may be minimal (4Jurevicius J. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) so that compartmentalization of the different components of this transduction machinery and proximity effects may dictate the specificity of the cAMP signaling. This hypothesis is supported by ample evidence that the intracellular effector for cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA), 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; PDE, phosphodiesterase; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA buffer, radioimmune precipitation buffer. is targeted to different subcellular structures. The regulatory subunit RIIβ of PKA associates with PKA-anchoring proteins, which are proteins associated with particulate structures (5Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys.

PKA-anchoring proteins serve to anchor the holoenzyme close to its putative substrates on cellular components such as microtubules, Golgi apparatus, or membranes (8Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1723-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PKA function appears to rely on PKA-anchoring protein targeting; microinjection of a synthetic peptide that inhibits the binding of the RII subunit of PKA to PKA-anchoring proteins prevents the PKA-mediated regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy 5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid glutamate receptor-gated ion channel in hippocampal neurons (11Rosenmund C.

In addition to PKA, targeting of the phosphodiesterases (PDEs), the enzymes that degrade intracellular cAMP, may play an important role in compartmentalization of the cAMP signal and of phosphorylation. At present there is scant evidence on the mechanism and significance of subcellular localization of PDEs. Of the enzymes that specifically hydrolyze cAMP, forms that are derived from the PDE4A gene have been shown to be either membrane-bound (13Shakur Y. Wilson M. Pooley L. Lobban M. Griffiths S.L.

Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), PDEs may control local cAMP levels, the access of cAMP to the regulatory subunit of PKA, and therefore, the state of activation of PKAs. The PDE4D form has been implicated in homeostatic mechanisms regulating cAMP levels in hormone-targeted cells (18Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Swinnen J.V.

A splicing variant derived from the PDE4D gene, PDE4D3, is the most abundant form present in quiescent FRTL-5 cells; this form is a substrate for PKA and is rapidly activated by TSH through phosphorylation (18Sette C.

The expression of an additional variant, PDE4D2, is induced by an increase in intracellular cAMP, and the accumulation of this enzyme contributes to cell desensitization (22Sette C. Vicini E.

Here we have addressed the question of the subcellular localization of different forms derived from the PDE4D gene. We examined the distribution pattern of the PDE4D cAMP-PDEs in quiescent FRTL-5 cells using biochemical and immunocytochemical approaches. Furthermore, we have compared the pattern of localization after short and long term stimulation with TSH. The data generated show that TSH regulates, in a temporally and spatially dependent manner, the PDE activity expressed in these thyroid cells. Coon's modified F-12 medium, bovine insulin, human transferrin, culture-grade bovine TSH, and Crotalus atrox snake venom were purchased from Sigma. Purified bovine TSH (Lot AFP-5555B) for the stimulation of FRTL-5 cells was obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, NIH; Pansorbin cells were purchased from Calbiochem; Immobilon was from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA); [2,8-3H]cAMP (20–50 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; AG 1-X8 resin was from Bio-Rad; and ECL Western blot detection kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rolipram was provided by Schering AG. Fluorescein-conjugated antimouse IgGs and Vectashield-mounting medium were purchased from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were the purest grade available from Sigma. FRTL-5 cells were cultured in Coon's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 mg/ml), and transferrin (5 mg/ml). Cells were routinely cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For Western blot and enzymatic analyses, FRTL-5 cells were seeded in 90-mm dishes (Corning) containing the above-described Coon's F-12 medium. Five to seven days later, when 80–90% confluent, the cells were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and cultured for an additional 24 h in Coon's F-12 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and transferrin (5 mg/ml) to induce quiescence. When required by experimental protocol, the cells were stimulated with 10 nm bovine TSH in quiescence medium and incubated in a humidified incubator for the indicated period of time; at the end of the treatment cells were placed on ice, washed quickly with cold PBS, and harvested following the procedure described below. Cells were routinely harvested in an isotonic buffer that contained 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm microcystin, 50 mm benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; the homogenate obtained with an all-glass Dounce homogenizer was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction (20,000 × g supernatant). The pellet was washed twice with the same buffer and, once resuspended, was considered the particulate fraction (20,000 × g pellet). The 20,000 × g supernatant was further centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to yield a 100,000 ×g supernatant and pellet. In some experiments, the cells were harvested in either isotonic buffer with Mg2+ or in a hypotonic buffer with metal chelators (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmbenzamidine, 1 μm microcystin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or in radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin, and 0.5% SDS). PDE activity was assayed using 1 μmcAMP as substrate according to the method of Thompson et al. (27Thompson W.J. Brooker G. Appleman M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Samples were assayed at 34 °C in a final volume of 200 μl; the solution consisted of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μm[3H]cAMP (approximately 0.1 × 106cpm/tube; 30 Ci/mmol). To identify the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity, rolipram, a specific inhibitor of the cAMP-PDEs (28Schwabe U. Miyake M. Ohga Y. Daly J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 900-910PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the incubation mixture at a final concentration of 10 μm; the PDE activity measured in the presence of rolipram was subtracted from the total activity to quantitate the cAMP-PDE activity. The lactic dehydrogenase activity was assayed following the protocol of Kornberg (29Kornberg A. Colowick S.F. Kaplan N.O. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1955: 441-443Google Scholar). In brief, lactic dehydrogenase activity was derived by measuring the oxidation of DPNH at 340 nm wavelength during the reduction of pyruvate to lactate. Optical density values were determined at 30 s intervals for 3 min, and the rate of reduction was calculated. The generation of the polyclonal PDE4 antibody and of the monoclonal antibodies specific for PDE4D has been previously described (21Swinnen J.V. Tsikalas K.E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18370-18377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Iona S. Cuomo M. Bushnik T. Naro F. Sette C. Hess M. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol.

The monoclonal antibody F34-8F4 specific for the PDE4D was a generous gift from Dr. John Cheng (Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT). This antibody cross-reacted with the recombinant PDE4D variants but not with PDE4A or PDE4B proteins (data not shown). Quiescent FRTL-5 cells were stimulated with 10 nm TSH for 15 min as described previously. The cells were homogenized in isotonic buffer containing 10 mmMg2+ and centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, yielding a soluble and particulate fraction. The particulate fraction was washed twice and resuspended in an equal volume of hypotonic buffer containing 1 mm EDTA for 10 min on ice. The fraction was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was diluted to a final concentration of 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5. The sample was then loaded onto a DEAE ion exchange HPLC column (Waters 5PW ion exchange column, 7.5 × 0.75 cm) equilibrated with 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The buffer contained 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors at the same concentration used for the homogenization buffer. After washing the column with 5 volumes of the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 200–750 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5. An aliquot of each fraction was used for the PDE activity assay; the remainder was precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid solution in H2O and resuspended in 25 μl of 1 × Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The soluble fraction was subjected to DEAE ion exchange chromatography following an identical procedure. FRTL-5 cells were sparsely seeded in 8-well glass culture slides (Nunc Inc. Naperville, IL) and maintained for 3 to 4 days in regular, supplemented Coon's F-12 medium (described above). The cells were made quiescent for 24 h following the procedure already described. For TSH stimulation studies, cells were incubated with 10 nm bovine TSH in Coon's quiescence medium for either 15 min or 24 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were washed three times in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, then incubated in 3% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h as a blocking step. After blocking, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with the primary antibody or the primary antibody preabsorbed with the antigen. The following day, the cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated antimouse IgGs (1:400) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed multiple times (>5) in PBS and cover-slipped using Vectashield mounting medium. The soluble and the extracted particulate fractions were prepared as detailed above. The fractions from FRTL-5 cells were diluted in 4× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue) (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In some experiments, the soluble and solublilized particulate fractions were immunoprecipitated using fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin) according to the method of McPhee with minor modifications (33Macphee C.H. Harrison S.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6660-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Samples were immunoprecipitated by Pansorbin previously incubated with normal rabbit sera, anti-PDE4 antisera, or antisera specific for PDE4A. The bound PDE was eluted from the pellet by incubation with 1% SDS in PBS at room temperature. Eluted samples were diluted in 4× sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the membrane overnight in 10% bovine serum albumin (w/v) dissolved in TBS-T solution (0.2% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 14 mm NaCl, pH 7.6). The following day the membrane was incubated in antisera in TBS-T for 1 h at the following dilutions: K116, 1:2,000 (v/v); M3S1, 1:250 (v/v); F34-8F4, 1:1,700 (v/v). After incubation with the primary antibody, the membranes were washed extensively for 1.5 h with multiple changes of TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham) diluted 1:7500 in TBS-T. After multiple washes in TBS-T for at least 1.5 h, bound antibodies were detected using a luminescence method (ECL, Amersham) or a Bio-Rad Immunostar detection kit and recorded after exposure to XAR-5 x-ray film. Exposure time varied between 30 and 60 s. When homogenates prepared with an isotonic buffer from quiescent FRTL-5 cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation, rolipram-sensitive PDE activity was recovered in both soluble and particulate fractions (TableI). After a 20,000 × gcentrifugation, 65% of the PDE activity was recovered in the supernatant and 35% in the pellet fraction of these cells (Table I). Further centrifugation of the 20,000 × g supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h demonstrated that negligible amounts of rolipram-sensitive PDE activity is recovered in the high speed microsomal pellet, and the remaining activity is in the soluble fraction (Table I). The possibility of contamination of the 20,000 × g pellet fraction with soluble proteins was determined by assaying the soluble enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Minimal contamination (less than 5%) of the pellet fraction by lactic dehydrogenase was observed (see below); therefore, the PDE activity recovered in the pellet fraction could not be accounted for by incomplete fractionation or entrapment of soluble proteins in vesicles during homogenization. This subcellular distribution of the PDE activity was minimally affected when hypotonic homogenization buffers were used (data not shown). Since less than 5% of the PDE activity was recovered in the 100,000 × g pellet, all the following experiments were conducted on the 20,000 × gsupernatant and pellet fractions.Table IPDE activity recovered in the fractions from differential centrifugation of the extract from quiescent FRTL-5 cellsFractionPDE activityMean ± S.E.aSix observations.%(pmol/min/plate)Homogenate223.0 ± 9.6100.020,000 × g supernatant145.8 ± 6.865.420,000 × g pellet75.0 ± 4.033.6100,000 × g supernatant146.3 ± 13.465.6100,000 ×g pellet12.9 ± 1.45.8Quiescent FRTL-5 cells were homogenized in isotonic buffer with Mg2+ and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, yielding a 20,000 × g supernatant and pellet.

PDE activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is expressed as pmol/min/plate of cells. The particulate PDE activity had kinetic properties similar to those of the soluble enzyme with an apparent Km for cAMP of 1 μm. Rolipram inhibited the PDE activity of the particulate fraction with an IC50 of 0.39 ± 0.2 μm, whereas the soluble activity was inhibited with an IC50 of 0.048 ± 0.03 μm (mean ± S.E. n = 3). Differences in rolipram sensitivity between the soluble and particulate cAMP-PDEs have been previously reported (15Huston E. Pooley L. Julien P. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G.

J. 1996; 318: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previous mRNA and protein analysis from our laboratory had shown that the PDE4D3 variant is the predominant form in the soluble fraction of quiescent FRTL-5 cells (18Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the properties of the cAMP-PDEs present in the particulate fraction of these cells, the 20,000 × g pellet and supernatant were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the PDEs were detected by Western blot with nonselective polyclonal antibodies (K116) or antibodies selective for PDE4D (M3S1 and F34-8F4). An immunoreactive polypeptide of 93 ± 1.0 kDa was detected in both the soluble and particulate fractions with the three antibodies (Fig.1), and the migration of this protein was identical to that of the recombinant PDE4D3 (data not shown). Using densitometric analysis of the immunoreactive bands it was estimated that 73.6 ± 8.5% (n = 5) and 26.4 ± 8.5% (n = 5) of the PDE4D3 polypeptide was recovered in the soluble and particulate fractions, respectively. Similar results were obtained when the soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with the K116 antibody and analyzed by Western blot using the PDE4D-specific antibody M3S1 (Fig. 2). An additional immunoreactive polypeptide of 105 kDa was observed in the particulate fraction of FRTL-5. Although the monoclonal antibodies gave a stronger signal (Fig. 1), this polypeptide cross-reacted with all three antibodies and had an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the recombinant PDE4D4 (data not shown). This 105-kDa polypeptide could not be detected after extraction with Triton and immunoprecipitation of the particulate fraction of FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 2). A densitometric analysis indicated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is more than 90% particulate under these homogenization conditions. Some variability was observed in the relative abundance of PDE4D3 and PDE4D4. Although the differences in antibody affinity precludes exact quantitations, in some experiments PDE4D4 was more abundant than PDE4D3, whereas in others PDE4D3 was more prominent. No systematic studies were performed to relate PDE4D4 expression to the culture conditions.Figure 2Extraction and characterization of the particulate PDE4D expressed in FRTL-5 cells. A, particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were prepared from quiescent FRTL-5 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The particulate fraction was extracted with Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the solubilized protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the nonselective polyclonal AB K116. The soluble fraction and immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum were used as controls (Cont.). The immunoprecipitated pellets were fractionated on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with the PDE4D-selective antibody M3S1. B, quiescent FRTL-5 cells were extracted with RIPA buffer containing 0.5% SDS. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, the supernatant and pellets were diluted in sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed with the M3S1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nonselective polyclonal antibody K116 recognized an additional polypeptide of 74 kDa present mostly in the soluble fraction of FRTL-5 cells. Although this protein may correspond to a PDE4 other than PDE4D isoenzymes, its identity was not further investigated. Previous analysis of the PDE4D mRNAs expressed in FRTL-5 cells had indicated the presence of PDE4D1, PDE4D2, and PDE4D3 variants (22Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a PDE4D4 mRNA is also expressed in FRTL-5 cells, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the mRNA from quiescent FRTL-5 cells. A polymerase chain reaction product of the correct size hybridizing to a specific probe was obtained with primers specific for the 5′ end of the PDE4D4 variant (data not shown). Thus, the mRNA analysis confirmed that the PDE4D4 variant is expressed in FRTL-5 cells. The PDE4D3 polypeptide recovered in the particulate fraction was readily solubilized with Triton X-100 and chelating agents and could be immunoprecipitated with PDE4-nonselective and PDE4D-selective antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Conversely, only traces of the PDE4D4 form were recovered after solubilization with nonionic detergents (Fig. 2 A). Only when the cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing 0.5% SDS could most of the PDE4D4 be recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). However, small amounts of PDE4D4 remained in the pellet even after extraction in RIPA buffer (Fig. 2 B). It was also observed that a portion of the PDE activity recovered in the pellet could be released by treatment with EDTA i"

The reaction was investigated using synthetic X-junctions. RecG dissociates X-junctions to flayed duplex products, although DNA unwinding of the heterologous arms is limited to ≤30 base pairs.

ATPase activity is also stimulated by linear duplex DNA, although to a lesser extent than by X-DNA, but not by linear single-stranded DNA.

Junction binding and unwinding also depend critically on the concentration of free Mg2+, excess free cation dramatically inhibiting both processes. These inhibitory effects are not mediated specifically by Mg2+; e.g. both Ca2+ and hexamminecobalt(III) chloride also inhibit X-junction binding and unwinding by RecG. The relative abilities of these cations to inhibit RecG-junction binding is correlated with their respective abilities to stack X-junction DNA.

From this we conclude that RecG is unable to bind or binds very poorly to fully stacked X-junctions. General genetic recombination is a key process in biology that is required for promoting genetic diversity, repairing damaged DNA, and ensuring that chromosomes are correctly segregated at cell division. A central feature of the reaction is a reciprocal exchange of single strands between two DNA duplexes. Strand exchange creates a heteroduplex joint within which Watson-Crick base pairing serves to register homologous alignment and at the same time links the two molecules together by a Holliday junction (1West S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Further unwinding and rewinding of strands at this four-way symmetrical structure moves the junction point along the DNA. This branch migration reaction is isoenergetic (for every bond that is broken a new one is made) and should occur spontaneously. However, recent studies have shown that the rate of spontaneous movement is very slow under physiological conditions (2Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is thought to reflect the way the junction folds into a stacked X configuration in the presence of magnesium ions (5Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is clear, therefore, that this stage of the recombination reaction must be catalyzed.In Escherichia coli, two enzymes, RuvAB and RecG, have been shown to interact directly with Holliday junctions and to drive their branch migration (6West S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by RuvAB is reasonably well understood. A tetramer of RuvA binds to the junction point and holds the DNA in an open configuration that allows assembly of a hexameric ring of RuvB around each of the diametrically opposed homologous arms flanking the RuvA-junction complex (7Parsons C.A. Stasiak A. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Hargreaves D. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sharples G.J. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The two rings face each other across the junction, and in a reaction requiring hydrolysis of ATP, each ring rotates the bound DNA and draws it through the hollow core of the RuvB assembly. This novel reaction unwinds a strand from each of the unbound arms and winds them together to pass through the RuvB ring. As each arm is rotated, the net effect of this specialized helicase activity is to move the junction point along the DNA.How RecG interfaces with Holliday junctions and drives their branch migration is less clear. The 76-kDa RecG polypeptide is a DNA-dependent ATPase that binds specifically to model Holliday intermediates and, in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, catalyzes branch migration of the junction point (9Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6837-6843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Whitby M.C. Ryder L. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). RecG has a number of structural motifs that are well conserved in DNA and RNA helicases (9Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6837-6843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we have shown that RecG can unwind partial duplex DNAs, although it does so rather inefficiently (12Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Helicase activity is stimulated on branched DNA structures and targeted specifically to the junction point (12Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). From these observations, it was proposed that RecG drives the branch migration of Holliday junctions by targeting and unwinding DNA at or near the junction crossover point. The link between DNA unwinding and branch migration was further supported by a RecG mutant with an Ala to Val substitution in helicase motif III that retains the ability to target junctions but is deficient in DNA unwinding and branch migration (13Sharples G.J. Whitby M.C. Ryder L. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, Mahdi et al. (14Mahdi A.A. McGlynn P. Levett S.D. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3875-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have used various truncated and mutant forms of RecG to show that the N-terminal region of the protein is required for junction-specific binding, while the C-terminal region is critical for DNA unwinding. Since both the junction targeting and helicase activities are encoded within a single polypeptide, the mode of action of RecG is likely to differ from that of RuvAB.To gain more insights into the mechanism of branch migration, we have analyzed further features of RecG's interaction with X-junctionsin vitro. In particular, we concentrate here on how RecG targets X-junctions. Data are presented indicating that RecG binds to the center of the X-junction by recognizing principally the displacement of two strands of DNA from a common junction arm. We also show that the unwinding of X-junctions by RecG is remarkably sensitive to the level of free Mg2+. This sensitivity correlates directly with an inability of RecG to bind to the fully stacked X-junction. The possible significance of these observations is discussed in relation to how RecG might function in vivo.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have exposed two key features of the mechanism by which RecG catalyzes branch migration. First, RecG binds with a high degree of specificity to Holliday junction DNA; second, RecG is a DNA-dependent ATPase that can unwind short stretches (≤25 bp) of duplex DNA in a reaction that, like branch migration, is dependent on Mg2+ and the hydrolysis of ATP (10Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have added to this basic characterization by showing that, as expected for a protein that targets Holliday junctions, the rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by RecG is much more strongly stimulated by X-junction DNA than by linear duplex DNA. Furthermore, we have shown that DNA unwinding at Holliday junctions is limited to ≤30 bp/junction arm. This confirms that DNA unwinding at Holliday junctions and partial linear duplex substrates is similarly restricted. These data are consistent with RecG catalyzing the branch migration of Holliday junctions and other recombination intermediates by unwinding DNA at or near to the junction crossover point. Presumably, limited DNA unwinding is sufficient to promote extensive branch migration of Holliday junctions, three-strand junctions, and R-loops through regions of homology, because for every base pair that is broken a new base pair is formed, thereby preventing the newly unwound strands from snapping back together (11Whitby M.C. Ryder L. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Vincent S.D. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3302-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The main focus of this paper is the study of Holliday junction binding by RecG. A variety of enzymes have been discovered that bind with some degree of specificity to X-junction DNA. These include not only the branch-migrating proteins RuvAB and RecG, and the resolvases RuvC, RusA, CCE1, SpCCE1, T4 endonuclease VII, and T7 endonuclease I, but also binding proteins without detectable catalytic activity such as HMG1, HU, and CBP from HeLa cells (10Lloyd R.G.

Using a variety of enzyme and chemical probes to analyze protein-DNA interactions, it is clear that these proteins, at least where tested, bind to DNA at and around the junction crossover point (36Pearson C.E.

The 1,10-phenanthroline-copper footprinting of the RecG-junction complex presented here shows that RecG too binds at the junction crossover point.What precisely is RecG recognizing when it binds to X-junction DNA? Many possibilities exist, since the X-junction structure offers a whole array of potential sites for interaction that could singly or in combination provide a potent signature for its identification. These include a high affinity binding site for certain intercalators (41Guo Q. Seeman N.C. Kallenbach N.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2355-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Lu M. Guo Q.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2671-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and a range of angles subtended within or between DNA helices. In the latter case, the angles presented by a junction are dependent on presence or absence of metal ions. In the absence of metal ions, electrostatic repulsion between the four arms of the junction forces them into a 4-fold symmetrical arrangement in which each arm subtends an angle of 90° with its neighbor. In the presence of metal ions, charges are neutralized, enabling the junction to fold into a more compact structure in which the helical arms stack pairwise upon each other to form an X-shaped structure with 2-fold symmetry (5Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 46Murchie A.I.H. Clegg R.M. von Kitzing E. Diekmann S. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. Nature. 1989; 341: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This stacked X-structure presents a large angle of approximately 120° and a small angle of approximately 60° between DNA helices.T4 endonuclease VII has the ability to bind and cleave a range of DNA structures, including X-junctions, that have in common two mutually inclined helices (47Bhattacharyya A. Murchie A.I.H. von Kitzing E. Diekmann S. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1191-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This presents a strong argument for it “measuring” the angle of helical inclination for binding and catalytic activation. RecG's ability to bind and unwind a range of DNA structures in addition to X-junctions suggests that it too may recognize angles inclined between DNA helices. However, it has now been found that most, if not all, X-junction-binding proteins dramatically alter the conformation of the junction upon binding (7Parsons C.A. Stasiak A. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 39Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 48Duckett D.R.

The same appears to be true for RecG. 3S. D. Vincent and R. G. Lloyd, unpublished data. From this it can be concluded that it is not necessarily the initial conformation of the DNA that is critical for recognition but rather an intrinsic ability of that DNA to be molded into the binding site(s) of the protein in question. By analyzing RecG's ability to bind to various substrates made from the component parts of an X-junction, it is clear that the minimal structure that it will bind to is a flayed duplex molecule. Therefore, the critical feature for specific protein-DNA interaction is the displacement of two single strands from one end of a common duplex strand. Presumably, RecG contacts each of the three arms emanating from the common junction point in a flayed duplex, manipulating each arm relative to the others so that they are fitted into its binding site(s). If RecG does use this feature to recognize branched DNAs, then multiple binding sites should be available to it, the exact number depending on the DNA species; e.g. X-junctions should present four binding sites, three-strand junctions and Y-junctions should present three binding sites, and flayed duplexes should present only one binding site. The observation from band shift data that only two RecG-X-junction complexes are formed and that only one complex is formed efficiently with Y-junction and three-strand junction DNA indicates that not all binding sites can be bound simultaneously by RecG. Presumably, this is because binding at one site interferes with binding at the other sites either by direct physical interaction between the protein molecules or indirectly by RecG altering and fixing the conformation of the other sites such that they cannot be bound. If the binding sites are separated by an intervening region of DNA, then both sites can be efficiently bound within a single DNA molecule as is the case with the loop substrate (Fig. 5 C). The intervening DNA provides both physical separation of protein molecules and a degree of flexibility that could enable both binding sites to be conformationally altered to fit the RecG binding site(s).It is clear that RecG binds to flayed duplex DNA; however, it is also evident from the data presented here and elsewhere that additional substrate complexity is required to stimulate efficient DNA unwinding (see Fig. 5 D and Ref. 20McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The minimal requirement for efficient DNA unwinding appears to be a junction with at least two duplex arms like the part Y-junctions (substrates C and D, Fig. 5). Interestingly, it is the short oligonucleotide that is unwound from both substrates C and D (Fig. 5 D, lanes f andh). Unwinding of both oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides 5 and 6) occurs with approximately the same efficiency despite them having opposite polarities with respect to the junction center. This is unlike RecG's action on conventional partial duplex Matson style helicase substrates, where unwinding proceeds with a clear 3′–5′ polarity with respect to the single strand that is bound (12Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These observations together with the binding data suggest that RecG binds to a flayed duplex component of a junction in an orientation dependent fashion. It then proceeds to unwind DNA along both arms of the “flay.” “Unwinding” may be promoted by RecG attempting to anneal two strands displaced from a common junction point (15Vincent S.D. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This “reverse” helicase action would be efficient for the branch migration of recombination intermediates, because homology between the strands would clearly aid them being brought together.Observations made here and elsewhere indicate that although a particular DNA species may appear on paper to present the necessary features for specific recognition by RecG, in practice it can be a very poor substrate for binding. For example, RecG's affinity for flayed duplex molecules and loop DNAs that differ in size and/or nucleotide sequence can vary dramatically (see Fig. 5 and Ref. 20McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RecG may prefer only a subset of possible junction binding sites. This appears to be the case when RecG binds to X-0 in the absence of cations, because instead of the predicted 4-fold symmetrical pattern of protection from 1,10-phenanthroline-copper, it yields a 2-fold symmetrical pattern, suggesting that only two of the four possible binding sites on X-0 are efficiently bound by RecG. Presumably, these variations in binding affinity and binding site preference are due to differences in nucleotide sequence. Nucleotide sequence affects junction conformation, which in turn could affect how RecG “sees” the junction. In the case of the flayed duplex and loop substrates, conformational differences may be simply due to limited inter- and intrastrand base pairing of the single-stranded regions of these DNA molecules, whereas in the case of X-junctions the nucleotide sequence is known to affect the crossover isomer bias (51Miick S.M. Fee R.S. Millar D.P. Chazin W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9080-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and presumably also influences the unfolded junction conformation. Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence could influence the malleability of a junction, thereby affecting its ability to be fitted into the RecG binding site(s). This would be analogous to the effect of sequence-dependent DNA bending on CAP protein-DNA binding affinity (52Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1988; 333: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).RecG depends on Mg2+ for branch migration and DNA unwinding. However, quite low concentrations of free Mg2+inhibit X-junction unwinding. In the current study, we have shown that the inhibition of X-junction unwinding directly correlates with a reduction in junction binding by RecG. These inhibitory effects are not specifically mediated by Mg2+; e.g. both Ca2+ and hexamminecobalt(III) chloride also inhibit junction binding and unwinding by RecG. The relative abilities of these cations to mediate inhibition closely correlates with their relative abilities to stack X-junctions (5Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Møllegaard N.E. Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. Nielsen P.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1508-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the respective concentrations of cation at which inhibition is mediated are similar to those required for complete stacking of the X-junction. From this we conclude that the stacking of the X-junction mediated by cations inhibits RecG binding to the junction.RecG's apparent inability to bind to the stacked X-junction is in marked contrast to other Holliday junction binding proteins like RuvA, RuvC, and CCE1, whose binding is relatively unaffected by stacking concentrations of Mg2+ (7Parsons C.A. Stasiak A. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 50White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 53Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This may be significant for RecG's functioning in vivo. The intracellular level of free Mg2+ is estimated to be on the order of 1 mm (54Grubbs R.D. Maguire M.E. Magnesium. 1987; 6: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar). If this is true, then naked Holliday junctions would be fully stacked in vivo and RecG's ability to branch-migrate them would be severely impaired. If this situation occurs in vivo, how might RecG function? One possibility is that RecG activity could be modulated by changes in the level of intracellular free Mg2+. Alternatively, DNA-binding proteins, e.g. RecA, could hold the junction in an unstacked conformation and thereby enable RecG to bind. There may even be no need for RecG to bind to Holliday junctions at all, since branch migration could, presumably, be catalyzed adequately by RuvAB.Recently, it has become clear that RecG's function is not restricted to branch-migrating Holliday junctions. For example, RecG can branch-migrate DNA junctions at D-loops (20McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This activity appears to be important for ensuring efficient recombination in the presence of the PriA helicase (19Al-Deib A.A. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, RecG can unwind R-loops, which helps to limit their accumulation in vivo (15Vincent S.D. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Hong X. Cadwell G.W. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Fukuoh A. Iwasaki H. Ishioka K. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Clearly, these activities do not require RecG's interaction with a Holliday junction and therefore may not be as sensitive to the concentration of free Mg2+. However, this has yet to be tested. Still, it remains an intriguing possibility that, in vivo, D-loops and R-loops present more attractive targets than Holliday junctions to RecG. General genetic recombination is a key process in biology that is required for promoting genetic diversity, repairing damaged DNA, and ensuring that chromosomes are correctly segregated at cell division. A central feature of the reaction is a reciprocal exchange of single strands between two DNA duplexes. Strand exchange creates a heteroduplex joint within which Watson-Crick base pairing serves to register homologous alignment and at the same time links the two molecules together by a Holliday junction (1West S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Further unwinding and rewinding of strands at this four-way symmetrical structure moves the junction point along the DNA. This branch migration reaction is isoenergetic (for every bond that is broken a new one is made) and should occur spontaneously. However, recent studies have shown that the rate of spontaneous movement is very slow under physiological conditions (2Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is thought to reflect the way the junction folds into a stacked X configuration in the presence of magnesium ions (5Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is clear, therefore, that this stage of the recombination reaction must be catalyzed. In Escherichia coli, two enzymes, RuvAB and RecG, have been shown to interact directly with Holliday junctions and to drive their branch migration (6West S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by RuvAB is reasonably well understood. A tetramer of RuvA binds to the junction point and holds the DNA in an open configuration that allows assembly of a hexameric ring of RuvB around each of the diametrically opposed homologous arms flanking the RuvA-junction complex (7Parsons C.A. Stasiak A. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Hargreaves D. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sharples G.J. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The two rings face each other across the junction, and in a reaction requiring hydrolysis of ATP, each ring rotates the bound DNA and draws it through the hollow core of the RuvB assembly. This novel reaction unwinds a strand from each of the unbound arms and winds them together to pass through the RuvB ring. As each arm is rotated, the net effect of this specialized helicase activity is to move the junction point along the DNA. How RecG interfaces with Holliday junctions and drives their branch migration is less clear. The 76-kDa RecG polypeptide is a DNA-dependent ATPase that binds specifically to model Holliday intermediates and, in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, catalyzes branch migration of the junction point (9Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6837-6843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22"

Studies have implicated Arfs as regulators of a number of steps of vesicular membrane transport, coat protein assembly, and maintenance of the integrity of the ER and Golgi compartments (3Boman A.L.

Studies documenting the direct activation of phospholipase D (PLD) activity by Arfs and effects of PLD on an in vitro Golgi transport assay have led to the controversial conclusion that PLD(s) mediate the action of Arfs on membrane traffic (8Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). An obligate role for Arf-sensitive PLD is doubtful, however, as Arfs are essential in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Arf mutations affect the same organelles in the secretory pathway in yeast that they do in cultured mammalian cells, and yet there is no Arf sensitive PLD activity in yeast (28Rudge S.A. Cavenagh M.M. Kamath R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A. Engebrecht J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of each of the five human Arfs to complement the lethal, double ARF deletion (arf1−arf2−) in yeast highlights the evolutionary conservation of function(s) of Arfs and has prompted the use of genetic studies to define the regulatory pathway controlled by Arf proteins, specifically the essential role of Arfs in eukaryotic cell growth. Either overexpression or deletion of (both) ARF genes is lethal to yeast cells (9Stearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The two yeast Arf proteins are 96% identical, and no phenotype has been defined for the loss ofARF2. In contrast, arf1− cells grow slower than parental controls at all temperatures are weakly cold-sensitive (cs), defective in the ability to process secreted proteins, e.g. invertase, and are supersensitive to fluoride (9Stearns T.

Supersensitivity to fluoride results from an unknown mechanism, but it has proven a useful and specific indicator of loss of Arf1 function. A second copy of ARF2 complements these phenotypes associated with arf1− cells. The 5–10-fold higher level of expression of Arf1 over Arf2 is the likely explanation for the differences in phenotypes betweenarf1− and arf2− (11Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For this reason, we focused our efforts on genetic studies ofARF1, and the studies described below were conducted in anarf2− background, unless otherwise indicated. Yeast were cultured using standard conditions, as described in Sherman et al. (12). Selective plates containing fluoride were prepared according to Stearns et al. (11Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed by the PEG/LiCl method of Schiestlet al. (13Schiestl R.H. Geitz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Random mutagenesis of the open reading frame of the ARF1 gene was achieved by PCR under conditions of reduced stringency; including 50 μm dATP and 0.1 mm MnCl2, according to Leung et al. (14Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique ( Phila. ). 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). Plasmids bearing the mutated ARF1 were produced in yeast by co-transfecting the mutant PCR products and gapped plasmid, pJCY1–31 (10Kahn R.A. Clark J. Rulka C. Stearns T. Zhang C. Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Cavenagh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), to allow gap repair by homologous recombination. The strain used, RT166, was deleted for both ARF1 andARF2 and carried human Arf4 on another plasmid, under control by the GAL1 promoter. Conditional alleles of ARF1were selected after replica plating transformants onto YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) plates (to turn off expression of human Arf4) and growing cells at 16, 28, and 37 °C. Thearf1–3 mutation was introduced at the ARF1 locus by homologous recombination with replacement of thearf1::HIS3 allele. Specific mutations were introduced into plasmids using gene-specific primers encoding the desired changes with at least 18 bp of priming nucleotides in PCR reactions, as described in Kahn et al. (10Kahn R.A. Clark J. Rulka C. Stearns T. Zhang C. Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Cavenagh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All PCR amplified fragments were completely sequenced both to confirm the introduction of desired changes and to ensure no additional changes were produced. A high copy, Arf-deleted, genomic library was constructed using genomic DNA (15Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) from RT166 (arf1−arf2− pGAL1-hArf4) that was partially digested with Sau3A before size selection (3–20 kilobase pairs) and ligation into the BamHI site of YEp352, a high copy plasmid bearing the URA3-selectable marker. The six yeast genes tested for SAT activity were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using gene specific primers and cloned into the high copy (2 μ-containing, URA3-marked) plasmid, YEp352. The lengths of 5′- and 3′-UTRs amplified varied with the distance to the adjacent genes. The length of 5′ upstream, open reading frame and 3′ downstream regions amplified were: SAT1 = 427/1449/404 bp; SAT2 = 220/896/158 bp; GCS1 = 243/1058/475 bp; GLO3 = 320/1481/128 bp; SPS18 = 162/902/201 bp; and GTS1 = 301/1190/880 bp. The sat1::HIS3 and sat2::HIS3deletions were generated by the method of Baudin et al. (16Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) after PCR amplification of the HIS3 gene using primers that encode 40 bp of gene-specific sequence from each end of the open reading frames. Auxotrophic markers were then “swapped” as described in Cross (27Cross F.R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to allow the ready isolation of double and triple deletants. Each deletion allele and swapped marker was confirmed by PCR. The assay for processing of invertase was performed as described in Stearns et al. (9Stearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in medium containing a high concentration (5%) glucose to log phase before being collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended into YEPD containing 0.1% dextrose. Half of the culture was then incubated at 30 °C and the other half at 37 °C. After 3 h, cells (2 A600units) were collected, rinsed in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by agitation with glass beads in Laemmli's sample buffer before boiling for 5 min. Proteins were fractionated on 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibody used was a guinea pig anti-invertase polyclonal antiserum (the generous gift of D. Preuss), and the secondary antibody was goat anti-guinea pig IgG coupled to peroxidase. Detection of signal was accomplished with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A temperature sensitive (ts) allele of ARF1, termed arf1–3, was generated by chemical mutagenesis of plasmids bearing theARF1 gene and selection for sensitivity to growth at 37 °C. arf1–3 is a conditional loss of function mutation that is recessive to both ARF1 and ARF2.Sequencing of the open reading frame of arf1–3 revealed a single base pair mutation resulting in a mis-sense mutation, [T32I]Arf1. This residue is just downstream of the first consensus GTP binding domain, G24LDGAGK30, and immediately adjacent to Thr31, whose mutation results in a negative dominant phenotype (17Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thr32 lies in the nucleotide binding pocket of Arf1·GDP (18Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), 2.8 Å from an α-phosphate oxygen such that the introduction of the larger side chain of an isoleucine is predicted to disturb the nucleotide binding. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed only minor differences in the level of Arf1–3 versus Arf1, which were not affected by growth at the restrictive temperature. Thus, altered stability of the mutant protein does not explain the phenotype. A yeast genomic 2 μ library was screened for high-copy suppressors of arf1–3 at 37 °C. From 300,000 colonies screened, we obtained nine temperature-resistant (tr) colonies, all of which grew at near wild type rates but reverted to ts with loss of the library plasmid. Sequencing the inserts and comparison with theSaccharomyces genome data base (SGD) revealed the presence of a single, complete open reading frame present in all nine plasmids, labeled YDR524C in the SGD, and named suppressor of Arf1 ts orSAT1. 2As this appears to be the first functional description for this gene we propose the name SAT1 for YDR524C and SAT2 for YIL044C. Suppressor activity of SAT1 was confirmed with a high copy (2 μ) plasmid bearing the entire gene, obtained by PCR amplification of a 2.3-kilobase pairs genomic fragment, including the open reading frame of 1446 and 404 bp and 427 bp upstream and downstream, respectively (see Fig. 1). The same genomic fragment failed to complement arf1–3 when present on a low copy (CEN) plasmid. Suppression by SAT1 was allele-specific as the growth rates at restrictive temperatures of strains carrying other Arf alleles, including five other ts alleles and one cold sensitive (cs) allele carrying a variety of other mutations, did not improve when bearing the 2-μ plasmid (not shown). Similarly, additional copies of SAT1 were unable to complement thearf1::HIS3 gene deletion, with regard to slower growth at several temperatures or supersensitivity to fluoride (not shown). arf1–2 is ts for growth on plates containing fluoride (40 mm), and growth under these conditions was not restored by SAT1. Interestingly, the decreased Arf activity in the arf1–3 cells resulted in fluoride sensitivity, which could be suppressed with overexpression of SAT1 (Fig. 1). Thus, growth defects of arf1–3 cells resulting from the stress of either elevated temperatures or fluoride were suppressed by SAT1 at high copy (Fig. 1). In addition to thermal and fluoride sensitivities, cells carrying ARF mutations, including arf1–3, often are defective in sporulation and/or growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. Overexpression ofSAT1 was able to restore the diminished growth ofarf1–3 cells on glycerol plates to near that of wild type cells, though it was unable to restore sporulation competence. SAT1 encodes a protein 482 residues in length, with a predicted molecular mass of 54 kDa. The DNA sequence of the open reading frame of one of our genomic library inserts was identical to the SGD entry for YDR524C. BLAST analyses of Sat1 against the SGD revealed weak homology between Sat1 and a group of yeast proteins with a cysteine-rich zinc finger motif, one of which (GCS1) has been reported to possess Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity (19Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The homologies between Sat1 and the members of this group, including Gcs1, Glo3, YIL044C, Gts1, and Sps18, are limited to the N-terminal, cysteine-rich, zinc finger domain, abbreviated as C2C2 (see Fig.3). This is the region identified by Ireland et al. (20Ireland L.S. Johnston J.C. Drebot M.A. Dhillon N. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Singer R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3812-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in Gcs1, Glo3, and Sps18 and implicated in Arf GAP activity (19Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich domain of Sat1 is removed from the N terminus, by about 160 residues, with respect to the others. A similar degree of homology, again limited to the zinc finger domain, was observed in a number of proteins from other species, including α-centaurin and a mammalian Arf GAP, described by Cassel and colleagues (19Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18859-18868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We next explored the possibility that other members of the group of yeast proteins with the cysteine-rich motif possess effector activity for Arf1. Each of the five other members of this group of proteins was tested for the ability to rescue growth of arf1–3 cells at 37 °C when present on high-copy plasmids. Three of these genes,GCS1, GLO3, and YIL044C, were found to have suppressor (SAT) activity (see Fig. 1). As this is the first description of a function for YIL044C, we propose to name itSAT2. Of this group, only SPS18 andGTS1 (Fig. 1) were inactive as suppressors ofarf1–3. The fact that at least one protein (Gcs1) in this family interacts directly with Arf proteins (in the Arf GAP assay) is consistent with the notion that these are immediate downstream effectors of the essential Arf action in mitotic growth. Examination of the protein alignments, shown in Fig. 3, revealed that Gts1 lacks one and Sps18 lacks both of the histidine residues, downstream of the cysteines that are conserved in each of the proteins with SAT function. As histidine residues are often found to substitute for cysteines in various zinc finger motifs, we investigated the importance of these residues in defining a Sat motif. To test the importance of cysteine and histidine residues to SAT activity, mutants of the first and second cysteines and the two histidines were constructed in Sat1 and tested for suppressor activity. Mutation of the second cysteine in the motif ingcs1 (termed gcs1-1) to tyrosine results in a cs failure to re-enter the cell cycle phenotype, also observed with deletion of GCS1 (20Ireland L.S. Johnston J.C. Drebot M.A. Dhillon N. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Singer R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3812-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Drebot M.A. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7948-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.2, the [C186A]Sat1 or [C189Y]Sat1 mutants have lost SAT activity. Similarly, mutation of both of the histidines to residues present in Sps18 ([H214L, H220N]Sat1) also caused the loss of SAT activity. Thus, we propose a minimal consensus sequence for SAT activity to include the histidines, yielding the motif: C-X2-CX16–17-C-X2-C-X3-H-X5-H. No other proteins containing this exact motif were found in either the yeast or Swiss-Prot data bases, although 22 others were found in SGD to contain the four cysteines with this spacing. Multiple human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from distinct genes were found to contain the Sat consensus (C2C2H2) and include more extensive homology to Sat1 in the surrounding region than is present in the yeast family members. These human proteins are currently being tested for SAT activity. Because of previous work documenting the importance of cysteine/histidine containing motifs in protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, we focused initially on these residues and emphasize that we consider this a minimal SAT motif. As seen in the alignment shown in Fig. 3, other residues flanking or internal to the zinc finger motif are also conserved in this region and need to be evaluated for their importance to SAT activity. That the proposed SAT motif is not sufficient for SAT activity is evident from the finding that mutation of the two residues in Sps18 that align with the histidines in Sat1 to histidines ([L55H,N61H]Sps18) did not confer SAT activity to the mutant Sps18. A null allele of SAT1 was constructed in both haploid and diploid cells by replacement of the open reading frame ofSAT1 with the HIS3 gene, as described under “Materials and Methods.” SAT1 is not an essential gene, as haploid strains of each mating type, carrying the disrupted gene, were viable. This was confirmed by dissection of spores, in whichHIS3 + (sat1−) segregated 2:2 and all four spores were viable. Haploid strains deleted forSAT1 were found to grow at the same rates as wild type strains at 16, 28, or 37 °C and grew well on nonfermentable carbon sources, e.g. glycerol (not shown). Diploid cells homozygous for the deletion also appeared normal and sporulated as well as controls. As Arfs are essential, and Sat1 overexpression compensates for the loss of Arf function associated with arf1–3, we originally predicted that SAT1 would also be an essential gene. The ability of three other genes to complement the arf1–3allele may explain why sat1− strains are viable. Indeed, genetic redundancy in Arf effectors could have been predicted from the size of the Arf family in yeast (two genes) and mammals (six genes) and from the precedent of multiple effectors established for other small GTPases. Tests for genetic interactions among the four genes with SAT activity were performed by combining null alleles of each, in all possible combinations. Initial tests for viability and thermal sensitivities revealed a number of interactions. Strains carrying eithersat1 or sat2 deletions grew as well as parental controls at all temperatures (16, 28, and 37 °C), but deletion of either gcs1 or glo3 led to conditional thermal sensitivities (gcs1− = cs,glo3− = ts and cs) and defects in cell cycling (20Ireland L.S.

Genet. 1992; 22: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 3A. Thiebert, unpublished observations. Combinations ofgcs1− with deletions of any of the other SAT genes revealed two types of genetic interactions. Two of the combinations of double deletions,gcs1−glo3− orgcs1−sat2−, exhibited synthetic lethality. The double deletiongcs1 − sat1 − was weakly ts, in addition to the cs phenotype from thegcs1 −. Another phenotype that has been used in characterizing ARF1mutations is fluoride supersensitivity (10Kahn R.A. Clark J. Rulka C. Stearns T. Zhang C. Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Cavenagh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As noted above, overexpression of Sat1 rescued arf1–3 cells from toxicity of 30 mm fluoride. The double delete strain,sat2 − glo3 −, was also found to be supersensitive to fluoride. The triple delete strain,sat1−sat2−glo3−, was viable, though it was cs-, ts-, and fluoride-supersensitive. As first reported in Poon et al. (19Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we also found that strains carrying the gcs1 null allele were supersensitive to fluoride. Thus, loss of Gcs1 function results in the same phenotype found for loss of Arf1 function; consistent with the two proteins acting in a common pathway but not in an antagonistic fashion. That is, loss of Gcs1 and its GAP activity should result in increased Arf activity in cells, not less, and thus the fluoride supersensitivity of gcs1− cells appears incompatible with its GAP activity being biologically relevant in this context. Whereas no phenotype was ascribed to sat1− alone, these cells became much more ts when this deletion was combined with arf1–3. In contrast, the double deletion,sat1−arf1−, made cells neither more cs nor more fluoride supersensitive thanarf1− alone (not shown). We conclude thatarf1–3 retains some, though clearly diminished, Arf activity, which is compromised further with loss of Sat1. The rank order potency for high-copy suppression of ts inarf1–3 cells or arf1–3 sat1− cells was Sat1 > Glo3 > Sat2 > Gcs1. Sps18 and Gts1 were inactive in each assay. Thesat1− deletion alone had no obvious effect on the secretory pathway, as visualized by the processing of invertase during its transit of the secretory pathway, at either 30 or 37 °C (Fig. 4; WT versus sat1). In contrast, the deletion of ARF1 has previously been shown to cause a partial defect in invertase glycosylation, consistent with a defect in transit through the Golgi (Ref. 9Stearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar; Fig. 4, arf1versus WT). Cells carrying the arf1–3 allele processed invertase to the same (incomplete) level at permissive and restrictive temperatures, comparable with that ofarf1− cells (see Fig. 4; compare arf1 to arf1–3). This defect was unaffected by the introduction ofSAT1 on high copy plasmids at either temperature (arf1–3 ± SAT1). Thus, under restrictive conditions (37 °C) that result in little or no cell growth (arf1–3) or near WT growth rates (arf1–3 + SAT1), there is no discernible difference in the ability to process invertase through the Golgi. The sec18-1 strain is shown as a control that shows the ER form (core glycosylated) of invertase as SEC18 encodes the yeast homolog of the NSF protein, required for exit from the ER. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that it is Arf acting at other membrane traffic sites (e.g. endocytosis) that is required for cell growth, we consider this unlikely because the phenotypes observed previously with depletion of Arfs were most severe on the early secretory pathway and readily observed with this same invertase assay (9Stearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, we interpret these data as indicating an essential role for Arf proteins in cell growth that can be separated from its role in membrane transport and that Sat1 and related proteins are effectors of this essential Arf function. The finding of effector functions for proteins with defined GAP activity has precedent in other systems. In at least two cases (Gαq and phospholipase C-β and phosphodiesterase γ subunit and transducin) G protein effectors have strong GAP activity (24Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 25Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The situation with Ras and its GAPs is a bit confusing, at least in part because Ras GAP and Ras effectors have overlapping binding sites on the GTPase, but the expression of GAP suppresses cell transformation by Ras, and it thus can work as a negative regulator (e.g. Ref. 26Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The identification of a GAP activity is a useful biochemical tool to identify GTPase-interacting proteins, but the name implies the down-regulation of the GTPase activity, which is clearly not the physiologically relevant activity of the Arf GAP in this case. The identification of SAT activity is a step toward making this biologically important distinction. Further genetic and biochemical tests of the genes/proteins in the SAT family will likely reveal higher orders of specificity and overlapping as well as distinct signaling roles in the control of the cell cycle and secretory pathways.

In addition to wide variations in clinical phenotype, RP exhibits extensive genetic heterogeneity; more than 15 distinct genetic loci have been localized to human chromosomes, and mutations in a large number of genes have been associated with inherited retinal degeneration (2Farber D.B.

The putative RPGR gene product of 815 amino acids contains six tandem repeats that show a high degree of homology to the RCC1 protein, a GEF for Ran-GTPase (9Seki T. Hayashi N. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, proposed that the RPGR gene product functions as a GEF for Ran or a Ran-like protein in the retina or retinal pigment epithelium (6Meindl A. Dry K. Herrmann K. Manson F. Ciccodicola A. Edgar A. Carvalho M.R.S. Achatz H. Hellebrand H. Lennon A. Migliaccio C. Porter K. Zrenner E. Bird A. Jay M. Lorenz B. Wittwer B. D'Urso M. Meitinger T. Wright A. Nat.

To investigate the physiological function of the RPGR protein and to gain insights into the biochemical mechanism of retinal degeneration caused by RPGR mutations, we have cloned and characterized the full-length and variant cDNA isoforms derived from the mouse homolog of the human RPGR gene (designatedmRpgr). In addition to describing several novel features, we demonstrate that the mRpgr protein is isoprenylated and is localized primarily in the Golgi complex. Methods used for routine recombinant DNA analysis were essentially as described (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar,11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY1995Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers used for sequencing and PCR were synthesized at the Medical School Biomedical Research Core Facility or at NBI/Genovus (Plymouth, MN). A mouse brain cDNA library in pCMV.SPORT2 plasmid vector was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The probe for library screening was derived from a partial human RPGR cDNA (clone C11, spanning exons 2–6; Ref. 6Meindl A. Dry K. Herrmann K. Manson F. Ciccodicola A. Edgar A. Carvalho M.R.S. Achatz H. Hellebrand H. Lennon A. Migliaccio C. Porter K. Zrenner E. Bird A. Jay M. Lorenz B. Wittwer B. D'Urso M. Meitinger T. Wright A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) that was obtained by cloning a PCR product amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library (FB2; Ref. 12Swaroop A. Xu J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 64: 292-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) filters containing 30,000-40,000 colonies were hybridized at 42 °C with the 32P-labeled C11 probe in the presence of 37% formamide. DNA from purified positive clones was characterized initially by restriction enzyme analysis. Nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clones was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase™ (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Nested oligonucleotide primers were used to obtain the complete sequence of both strands. Analyses of the cDNA and derivative polypeptide sequences were performed with MacVector and GCG software (Oxford Molecular Group, Inc.). A YAC contig spanning the mouse Otc gene was assembled by determining the location of the first and last exons of Otcwithin each YAC-cloned DNA fragment and by placing the terminal sequences of each YAC relative to the others in the contig. The terminal sequences of each YAC were isolated by established techniques (13Arveiler B. Porteous D.J. Technique ( Phila. ). 1991; 3: 24-28Google Scholar) and oriented on the contig relative to other YACs by Southern hybridization to EcoRI-digested total yeast strain DNA. For mapping the mRpgr gene, total yeast DNA (2 μg) from fourOtc YAC strains (OT1, OT3, OT4, and OT7), an unlinked mouse YAC strain, C41D2, and the yeast host strain, AB1380 (14Coulson A. Kozono Y. Shownkeen R. Waterston R. Technique ( Phila. ). 1991; 3: 17-23Google Scholar), was digested with EcoRI. The resulting fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products) following the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization of the mRpgr cDNA to the Otc YAC DNA panel was performed according to standard procedures (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Northern blots of poly(A)+RNA from mouse tissues (MTN blots) were purchased fromClontech (Palo Alto, CA), and hybridization was performed according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The 32P-labeled cDNA probes were generated with random primers (MegaPrime™ kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quick-Clone™ cDNAs (purchased from Clontech) from adult mouse brain, testis, and kidney were used for PCR amplification with the following primer set: F3 (sense strand, in putative mRpgr exon 6), 5′-ATC TCT TGT GGA TAT TAC C-3′; B9(antisense strand, in putative exon 19), 5′-AGA ACA AAT GTG CTC GGT GAC C-3′. The thermal cycling profile was 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel and were transferred to a Hybond-N membrane. Southern blots were hybridized overnight with mRpgr-1 cDNA probe, washed at high stringency, and exposed for autoradiography. A 16-mer synthetic peptide (called GR-P1; GKSKFAENNPGKFWFK) from the amino-terminal region of the deduced human RPGR protein (6Meindl A. Dry K. Herrmann K. Manson F. Ciccodicola A. Edgar A. Carvalho M.R.S. Achatz H. Hellebrand H. Lennon A. Migliaccio C. Porter K. Zrenner E. Bird A. Jay M. Lorenz B. Wittwer B. D'Urso M. Meitinger T. Wright A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) was used to raise antisera in rabbits, and anti-RPGR antibodies were affinity purified by elution from a peptide-conjugated column (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). The sequence of the GR-P1 peptide is similar to its corresponding region in the mRpgr cDNA (14/16 identical residues; see Fig. 2). The mouse anti-α-mannosidase II monoclonal antibody (53FC3) was obtained from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA). Texas red-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2-IgG was purchased from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY), resuspended in 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Affinity-isolated goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate was obtained from Sigma. The mRpgr cDNAs cloned in pCMV.SPORT2 vector contain a SP6 promoter in the 5′-upstream region. Protein products were translated from plasmid DNA (2 μg) using the TNT-SP6 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega), as recommended by the manufacturer. For some of the experiments, in vitro translated mRpgr products were immunoprecipitated with anti-RPGR antibody (1:200 dilution) by overnight incubation at 4 °C in presence of protease inhibitors (Pharmingen). The immunoprecipitate was collected with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed successively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% and 0.05% Triton X-100. The proteins were incubated at 100 °C for 5 min with the Laemmli buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography using Amplify™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (15Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). PstI-XhoI fragments of mRpgr-1, -2, and -3 cDNAs containing the entire coding region were subcloned at the PstI-SalI site of pED vector (16Kaufman R.J. Kellems R.E. Gene Amplification in Mammalian Cells: A Comprehensive Guide. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 315-343Google Scholar) to generate pEDmR1, -2, and -3 expression constructs, respectively. The pEDmR1Δ1 and pEDmR1Δ2 constructs were generated from pEDmR1 using appropriate restriction enzymes to produce mRpgr-1 protein containing deletions of the “charged” domain (residues 537–639, see Fig. 2) and the complete carboxyl-terminal region (residues 537–746 in Fig. 2), respectively. The pEDmR3Δ3 construct was derived from pEDmR3 by deleting the complete carboxyl-terminal region (from nucleotide 1628 onward; also see Figs. 1 and 5). The pEDmR-ATG1 and pEDmR-ATG2 constructs carrying point mutations that altered either the first (Met-1) or the second (Met-39) initiation codon to valine were derived from pEDmR1Δ2, using a Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, a single amino acid substitution of cysteine 743 to glycine was introduced in pEDmR1 to generate the pEDmR1C743Gconstruct. The sense strand sequence of primers used for site-directed mutagenesis is listed below (mutated residue is underlined):ATG1 (nucleotides 6–37), 5′- GCACAGTAGTGGTCTGTGCCAAGAGGGTCGCG-3′; ATG2(nucleotides 122–152), 5′-CGCAGGCTTCGGCGTGGCGGAATCTGAGTC-3′; C743G (nucleotides 2231–2265), 5′-GGGAAAGTCCAAATCCGGTACAATTCTATAAATGC-3′. pED-ralB was generated by subcloning the AS181 cDNA for small GTP-binding protein ralB (17Hsieh C.-L. Swaroop A. Francke U. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) into the pED expression plasmid. All constructs were checked by sequencing of both the DNA strands.Figure 5Schematic representation of mRpgr expression constructs used in this study. All constructs were generated in the pED mammalian expression vector (16Kaufman R.J. Kellems R.E. Gene Amplification in Mammalian Cells: A Comprehensive Guide.

I refers to the isoprenylation site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) COS cells were grown in six-well culture plates (>50% confluent) and transfected with 8 μg of DNA from pED expression constructs using the DEAE-dextran method (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY1995Google Scholar, 15Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). At 36 h post-transfection, cells were starved in methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min and then reconstituted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml; 1,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After a 30-min incubation, labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40 in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.01% SDS) which also included 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (Pharmingen). The supernatant obtained after centrifuging the lysate at 3,000 × g for 5 min was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RPGR antibody. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by the procedure described in an earlier section. As described (18Foster R. Hu K.-Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), COS cells (grown in six-well culture plates) were cotransfected with 8 μg of DNA from the pED expression construct (as indicated) and 8 μg of pMEV plasmid (a mammalian expression construct containing the cDNA for mevalonate transporter; obtained from ATCC) using the DEAE-dextran method. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μm mevastatin for 3 h. This was followed by a 12-h incubation at 37 °C with [3H]mevalonolactone (50 μCi/ml, 33 Ci/mmol; from NEN Life Science Products) in the presence of 20 μmmevastatin. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, attached cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (200 μl) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The supernatant, collected after a 5-min centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, was subjected to immunoprecipitation with appropriate antibody. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide/2,5-diphenyloxazole and visualized by fluorography (15Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). COS cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips and transfected with DNA from expression constructs, as described in a previous section. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were processed for immunofluorescence studies (19McCaffery J.M. Farquhar M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in presence of 20% normal goat serum for 30 min. The rabbit anti-RPGR and the mouse α-mannosidase II antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200. The secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and/or Texas red anti-mouse antibodies were applied at a dilution of 1:80 and 1:50, respectively. Where indicated, brefeldin A (2.5 μg/ml) was included 1 h, or mevastatin (20 μm) 12 h, before the fixation of cells. A 437-bp fragment (C11) of the human RPGR cDNA, spanning exons 2–6 (see “Experimental Procedures”), was used to screen ≈700,000 independent clones of an amplified mouse brain cDNA library. Three positive clones, Mcgr16, Mcgr21, and Mcgr29, which resulted from this screening, contained inserts of 2, 2.6, and 2.7 kb, respectively. Sequence analysis of the three clones revealed that Mcgr29 represented the full-length transcript (designated mRpgr-1), whereas Mcgr21 and Mcgr16 (called mRpgr-2 and mRpgr-3, respectively) were derived from variant isoforms (see below). The complete nucleotide sequence of the mRpgr-1 cDNA (2,729 bp) revealed two putative in-frame initiation codons (ATG) that precede a long open reading frame. Based on transient expression studies, it appears that both ATGs (referred to as Met-1 and Met-39) are utilized yielding polypeptides of 746 (calculated molecular mass = 82 kDa) and 708 amino acids (calculated molecular mass = 78 kDa), respectively. The amino-terminal region of the two deduced mRpgr-1 protein isoforms includes six complete tandem repeats (similar to those present in the human RPGR protein, see Ref. 6Meindl A. Dry K. Herrmann K. Manson F. Ciccodicola A. Edgar A. Carvalho M.R.S. Achatz H. Hellebrand H. Lennon A. Migliaccio C. Porter K. Zrenner E. Bird A. Jay M. Lorenz B. Wittwer B. D'Urso M. Meitinger T. Wright A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), which show homology to repeats identified in RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran-GTPase (9Seki T. Hayashi N. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Secondary structure analysis demonstrates a high degree of hydrophilicity of the charged carboxyl-terminal region; nevertheless, a specific isoprenylation site is present at the carboxyl terminus (-CTIL) (20Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 21Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Seven potential N-glycosylation sites (N-X-S/T), a number of consensus sequences for S(T)-linked O-glycosylation (22Hansen J.E. Lund O. Engelbrecht J. Bohr H. Neilsen J.O. Hansen J.-E.-S. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation sites for several protein kinases can be identified in the mRpgr-1 protein(s). At the 3′-end, the nucleotide sequence contains a poly(A) tract that begins 25 bp downstream of the polyadenylation signal, AATAAA. As in the human sequence, ATTTA motifs are also present in the 3′-untranslated region of the mRpgr-1 cDNA. Comparison of the mRpgr-1 sequence with those of mRpgr-2 and mRpgr-3 revealed that the 5′- and 3′-ends of the three clones begin and end within few bp of each other (data not shown). Nevertheless, the two shorter cDNAs contain deletion(s) of internal sequence regions. Based on a comparison with the exon structure of the human RPGR cDNA (6Meindl A. Dry K. Herrmann K. Manson F. Ciccodicola A. Edgar A. Carvalho M.R.S. Achatz H. Hellebrand H. Lennon A. Migliaccio C. Porter K. Zrenner E. Bird A. Jay M. Lorenz B. Wittwer B. D'Urso M. Meitinger T. Wright A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), the internal deletions in mRpgr-2 and mRpgr-3 appear to conform to distinct exons, i.e. exons 18 and 19A in mRpgr-2, and exons 8–11 and 18 in mRpgr-3 (shown schematically in Fig.1). The mRpgr-2 cDNA has an in-frame deletion of 120 nucleotides (bp 1966–2085) and is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 706 or 668 amino acids, depending upon the initiation codon utilized. The mRpgr-3 cDNA has two deletions; the first spans 630 nucleotides from bp 913 to 1542, and the second is of 89 nucleotides from bp 1966 to 2054. Although the first deletion in mRpgr-3 does not alter the reading frame, the second deletion causes a frameshift that would result in a truncated protein of 442 or 404 amino acids. Sequence comparison revealed that the initiation codon of the reported human RPGR gene product corresponds to the second ATG codon (Met-39) in the mRpgr-1 cDNA. The deduced mouse and human RPGR proteins share a high degree of sequence homology (64% identity); however, the RCC1 homology region of the two proteins has 80% identical residues (Fig. 2). The two GTP phosphate binding motifs (23Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) in the amino-terminal region and the hydrophobic domain including the isoprenylation site at the carboxyl terminus are also conserved in the mRpgr-1 protein. However, the charged domain of the mouse protein is shorter in length by 107 amino acids and shows a relatively low sequence identity (40%) with the human protein. Because of significant divergence in the nucleotide sequence of the human and mouse cDNAs, we wished to confirm that the mouse ortholog of the human RPGR gene has indeed been identified. Hybridization of a Southern blot of mouse genomic DNA, digested with different restriction enzymes, with mRpgr cDNA detected several distinct bands (nine bands in EcoRI digest; data not shown); however, the results were consistent with a single copy gene of 50–60 kb (similar to that of human; Ref. 6Meindl A. Dry K. Herrmann K. Manson F. Ciccodicola A. Edgar A. Carvalho M.R.S. Achatz H. Hellebrand H. Lennon A. Migliaccio C. Porter K. Zrenner E. Bird A. Jay M. Lorenz B. Wittwer B. D'Urso M. Meitinger T. Wright A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Because the human RP3locus is linked to OTC at Xp21.1, it was anticipated thatmRpgr might be within the Otc-region YAC contig. Otc is located on the proximal mouse X chromosome, approximately 4 cm from the centromere. To localize themRpgr gene, the mRpgr-3 cDNA was hybridized to a Southern blot of four YACs (OT1, OT3, OT4, and OT7) from theOtc contig (Fig.3 A). The mRpgr-3 cDNA hybridized to nine EcoRI fragments (ranging from 1 to 8 kb) in three of the Otc YAC clones (OT3, OT4, and OT7) and to five fragments in another YAC (OT1) (Fig. 3 B). No signal was detected in either the host yeast strain or an unlinked mouse YAC, C41D2 (used as control). Because all mRpgr hybridization signals are present in YAC OT3, it can be inferred that the majority of the mRpgr gene is contained on this YAC. The distal limit of the mRpgr interval is defined by the chimeric breakpoint of OT7, between Otc exons 6 and 7. The location of themRpgr gene near Otc was confirmed by hybridization with a rare-cutter restriction enzyme digestion panel of YAC OT4. The hybridization pattern of the cDNA was consistent with previous mapping information and places mRpgr within 50 kb 5′ (proximal) to the Otc gene (data not shown). ThemRpgr 5′-region is spanned by YAC OT3, in agreement with the initial placement of mRpgr on the YAC contig map. To determine the pattern ofmRpgr expression and the size of full-length transcript(s), Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from mouse embryos and adult mouse tissues were hybridized with mRpgr cDNA probes (Fig.4 A). During embryonic development, a major 2.7-kb mRpgr RNA is present at all of the stages examined and can be detected as early as 7th day of gestation (seelanes 1–4). In the adult, mRpgr appears to be widely expressed with a high level of expression in the brain and testis (lanes 6 and 12). Another larger transcript of 2.8 kb can also be detected in the brain at shorter exposures (data not shown). Two mRpgr transcripts of 3 and 3.3 kb are observed in the testis RNA (see lane 12). To investigate the presence of alternatively spliced isoforms, an mRpgr primer set (F3 and B9, see “Experimental Procedures”) flanking the deletions in mRpgr-2 and -3 cDNAs was used to amplify products from the reverse transcribed cDNAs of adult mouse brain, kidney, and testis. Southern blots of amplified products were hybridized with the mRpgr-1 cDNA probe (Fig. 4 B). In mRpgr-1, the product of PCR amplification with F3 and B9 primers is 1,578 bp. Two major products of 1.6 and 1.4 kb, corresponding to the mRpgr-1 and mRpgr-2 cDNA, respectively, were detected in brain, testis, and kidney. A minor product of about 1 kb (probably corresponding to mRpgr-3) was also observed. In testis, two additional products of 1.9 and 2.2 kb were detected, confirming the presence of larger mRpgr transcripts revealed by Northern analysis. To examine the encoded protein product(s), mRpgr cDNAs were used as template for in vitro translation in a reticulocyte lysate system. Affinity-purified anti-RPGR antibodies that specifically immunoprecipitated the mRpgr protein from transfected COS cell extracts (see below) were used to immunoprecipitate mRpgr products from the translation reaction. In vitro translated products were larger than the calculated molecular mass; two bands of approximately 110 and 80 kDa were detected as mRpgr-1 products with slightly smaller size proteins with mRpgr-2, whereas translation of the mRpgr-3 cDNA produced a protein of 60–62 kDa (data not shown). The apparent higher molecular mass of the mRpgr protein(s) can be attributed either to post-translational modifications or aberrant mobility on SDS-PAGE. This prompted us to evaluate these findings in a mammalian expression system. The mRpgr expression constructs used in this study for transient transfection of COS cells are shown in Fig.5. The expression of mRpgr proteins in transfected COS cells was examined by metabolic labeling with35[S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6 A). A 110-kDa protein band was observed for mRpgr-1, whereas the two splice variants mRpgr-2 and mRpgr-3 resulted in ∼105-kDa and 60-kDa proteins, respectively (lanes 2–4). There was no detectable immunoprecipitated protein in the mock-transfected samples (seelane 1). The size of resulting mRpgr proteins in transient expression stu"

We have used another approach, one in which the vesicle transport protein cellubrevin was appended with a luminal IgG epitope to allow targeting of fluorescein-5′-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-IgG F(ab) antibodies to the recycling endosomes in living cells. FITC-F(ab) was specifically internalized by COS cells transfected with cellubrevin-Ig, which at steady state accumulated in a pericentriolar region similar to rhodamine-transferrin. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that endosome labeling by these two markers was heterogeneous. This differential distribution was not induced by the IgG tag, since endogenous Cb and Tf were also partitioned into separate endosomal populations. We used fluorescence ratio imaging of internalized FITC-F(ab) to measure the pH of cellubrevin-enriched recycling endosomes (pHCb) and FITC-transferrin to measure the pH of transferrin-enriched recycling endosomes (pHTf). In COS cells, cellubrevin endosomes (mean pHCb 6.1 ± 0.05; range, 5.2–6.6) were more acidic than transferrin endosomes (mean pHTf 6.5 ± 0.05; range, 5.6–7.2). Similar results were obtained in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Treatment with the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1caused pHTf to increase (ΔpHTf = 1.2 pH units) to a greater extent than pHCb (ΔpHCb = 0.5 pH units). Furthermore, inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase by ouabain or acetylstrophanthidin caused pHTf to decrease by 0.6 pH units but had no effect on pHCb. Based on the combination of these morphological and functional data, we suggest that the recycling endosomes are heterogeneous in their biochemical compositions, ion transport properties, and pH values.

The cycling of molecules through the endocytic pathway has been extensively studied by monitoring the trafficking of the transferrin-transferrin receptor (Tf·TfR) 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; TfR, transferrin receptor; hIgG, human immunoglobulin G; Cb, cellubrevin; Cb-Ig, cellubrevin-immunoglobulin fusion protein; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and -6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethylester; pHCb, pH of Cb-Ig-containing recycling endosomes; pHTf, pH of Tf-containing recycling endosomes; pHc, cytosolic pH; FITC, fluorescein-5′-isothiocyanate; Rh, rhodamine; TGN, trans-Golgi network; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; GalT, galactosyltransferase; UDPGT, UDP-glucuronyltransferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; TfR, transferrin receptor; hIgG, human immunoglobulin G; Cb, cellubrevin; Cb-Ig, cellubrevin-immunoglobulin fusion protein; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and -6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethylester; pHCb, pH of Cb-Ig-containing recycling endosomes; pHTf, pH of Tf-containing recycling endosomes; pHc, cytosolic pH; FITC, fluorescein-5′-isothiocyanate; Rh, rhodamine; TGN, trans-Golgi network; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; GalT, galactosyltransferase; UDPGT, UDP-glucuronyltransferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. complex (reviewed in Refs. 1Gruenberg J.

The low luminal pH (∼6.0) of the sorting endosomes promotes dissociation of Fe3+ from the bound Tf (8Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. van Renswoude J. Harford J.B. Bridges K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These tubular elements bud from the sorting endosomes and return the complex to the cell surface, where TfR can reload with Fe3+-Tf to repeat the cycle. On the recycling pathway, most of the Tf·TfR complex clusters at a distinct perinuclear location in close apposition to the microtubule organizing center. These perinuclear recycling endosomes are distinguished from sorting endosomes by their distinct intracellular location and by the lack of cargo destined for late endosomes and lysosomes (3Hopkins C.R.

Despite the consistent picture emerging from experiments investigating Tf and TfR, recent biochemical and immunomicroscopic observations have suggested that the endosomal pathway is more complex than was originally perceived. Several membrane proteins that cycle through the endosomal system have overlapping but distinct distributions, suggesting that they may not always follow the same path (for example, see Refs. 12Nunez M.T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Many components of the vesicular traffic machinery are also heterogeneously distributed among endosomes. The low molecular weight GTPases Rab4 and Rab11 are both associated with subpopulations of perinuclear recycling endosomes (15Daro E. Sluijs V.D. Galli T. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9559-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 16Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Cellubrevin (Cb), a v-SNARE protein involved in TfR recycling, is associated with many peripheral vesicles that do not contain TfR (17McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 18Galli T. Chilcote T. Mundigl O. Binz T. Niemann H. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Likewise, in neuroendocrine cells Cb is targeted to neurites that exclude the TfR (19Chilcote T.J. Galli T. Mundigl O. Edelmann L. McPherson P.S. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At present, the physiological properties and functional roles of the putative endosome subpopulations are not known. Endosomal pH measurements using dye-labeled Tf in conjunction with either cytofluorometry or cellular imaging have shown that peripheral sorting endosomes have a pH in the range of 5.9–6.4 (20Sipe D.M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), while the perinuclear recycling endosomes have a slightly higher pH of 6.4 (4Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar,22Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). As a first step to determine the physiological heterogeneity of recycling endosomes, we have devised a “targeted fluorescence” approach to observe the distribution and pH of Cb-containing recycling vesicles. Cb was chosen because it is a constituent of the recycling endosomes, but, as discussed above, previous experiments suggested that it does not always co-distribute with Tf. Therefore, measurements made with this marker could conceivably reveal physiological differences within the recycling endosomes that may have been overlooked by the Tf-based work. A fusion protein of Cb and the human IgG constant region was created to allow targeting of pH-sensitive dyes to Cb-containing recycling endosomes. We stably transfected COS-7 cells with the Cb-Ig construct and performed a series of experiments to determine (i) the cellular distribution of FITC-labeled anti-IgG F(ab) fragment added to the extracellular media of live cells, (ii) the pH of the Cb-containing recycling endosomes, and (iii) the roles of the H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase in governing Cb-containing recycling endosome pH. These results were compared with data obtained from similar experiments using Tf as the recycling endosome marker. Our results indicated that there are subpopulations of perinuclear recycling endosomes that can be visualized by confocal microscopy and are further distinguished by differences in pH and responses to ouabain and bafilomycin A1. The potential roles of the recycling endosome subpopulations are discussed. All salts, bafilomycin A1, nocodazole, ouabain, chloroquine, paraformaldehyde, hygromycin B, acetylstrophanthidin, fetal calf serum, DEAE-dextran and DABCO were purchased from Sigma. Glycerol, methanol, and acetic acid were from Fisher, and restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cb was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a rat basophilic leukemia cDNA library (courtesy of Dr. Brian Seed, Massachusetts General Hospital) with primers (5′-CGCGGGAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGTCTACAGGGGTGCCT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGGGGATCCGAGACACACCACACAAT-3′), which allowed isolation of full-length Cb sequence with 5′ HindIII and 3′BamHI restriction sites for cloning into the pCD2Bγ1 expression vector (courtesy of Dr. Brian Seed). This created an in-frame fusion of Cb to the CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG after its hinge region. The resulting Cb-Ig construct was then transferred to the pCD43/hsfi− vector via HindIII andHpaI sites for stable transfection in COS cells. pCD43/hsfi− (from Dr. Brian Seed) is a pCDM8-derived plasmid that contains CD43 in the stuffer region, confers resistance to hygromycin B, and has the SV40 origin of replication inactivated at theSfiI site. Untagged Cb was amplified similarly with an additional stop codon in the antisense primer and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Organelle markers were constructed by attaching epitope tags to marker sequences containing the organelle targeting signals. The catalytic domain of UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) was replaced with the CD4 epitope to generate CD4-UDPGT (courtesy of Dr. Brian Seed); the cytoplasmic dilysine motif of UDPGT targets this construct to the ER. The full coding sequences of galactosyltransferase (GalT) and furin have been appended with a Flag epitope tag at the COOH terminus to generate GalT-Flag and furin-Flag. GalT sequence with 5′HindIII and 3′ XhoI sites was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a human liver cDNA library with the primers 5′-CGCGGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGAGGCTTCGGGAGCCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGGCTCGAGGCTCGGTGTCCCGATGTC-3′; the ends of a mouse furin cDNA (pAGEFur, courtesy of Dr. K. Nakayama, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) were similarly modified by the primers 5′-CGCGGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGAGCTGAGATCCTGG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGGCTCGAGAGGGGCGCTCTGGTCTTT-3′. Both products were inserted via 5′ HindIII and 3′ XhoI sites into the pCDM8-C-Flag vector, which contained the Flag epitope sequence for in-frame insertion of the tag at the C terminus. COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and under 5% CO2 atmosphere. CHO TRVb1 cells stably transfected with human Tf receptor (courtesy of Dr. T. E. McGraw, Cornell University Medical School, New York, NY) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and under 5% CO2 atmosphere. To isolate stable transfectants, semiconfluent cells in six-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of Cb-Ig/hsfi− using the lipofectamine procedure (Life Technologies), transferred to 10-cm dishes the next day, and subjected to selection with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B at 48 h post-transfection. Clones were screened by indirect immunofluorescence. Organelle markers were transiently transfected with the DEAE-dextran protocol of Seed and Aruffo (25Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized in ice-cold 100% methanol for 20 s. Incubation for 15 min in 1% BSA/PBS preceded staining with the primary antibodies for 1 h and the secondary antibodies for 30 min. Washed coverslips were mounted on slides with a non-bleach reagent (KPL mounting media from Kirkegaard and Perry Labs, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) or 2.5% DABCO in 80% glycerol/PBS). A Zeiss Axiophot (Oberkochen, Germany) microscope with a × 63 objective was used for indirect immunofluorescence. For laser scanning confocal microscopy, cells were analyzed using a krypton/argon laser coupled with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 attached to a Zeiss Axioplan (Oberkochen, Germany) microscope with a Leitz Plan Apo × 63 oil/NA 1.4 objective. Separate excitation lines and emission filters were used for each fluorochrome (FITC, 488 nm (excitation) and 522DF32 (emission); Texas Red, 568 nm (excitation) and 605DF32 (emission)). Single optical sections separated by 0.54 μm were collected sequentially for each fluorochrome. Confocal images were background-subtracted, merged using the Confocal Assistant software program, and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. For quantitation, red, green, or yellow endosomes from merged 0.5-μm optical sections were counted by visual inspection of the enlarged image on a computer monitor. The following dilutions of antibodies were used: FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, 1:25 (Cappel, Durham, NC); mouse anti-CD4 (Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Raritan, NJ), 1:500; mouse anti-Flag, 1:100 (Eastman Kodak Co.); Rh-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:50 (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs); rabbit anti-Cb, 1:100 (courtesy of Dr. Reinhard Jahn, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry); FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:50 (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs). For continual uptake experiments, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 100 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab) fragment (Cappel), 100 μg/ml Rh-transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), or 100 μg/ml Texas Red transferrin (Molecular Probes), and 1% BSA. Following this, the coverslips were washed three times with 10 mm acetic acid in PBS, fixed, and mounted. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were washed twice and incubated on ice for 20 min in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA and 100 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab) fragment. Following three washes to remove unbound antibody, the cells were either fixed immediately or returned to normal growth conditions for a 4-h chase. 100 μg/ml Rh-transferrin was added to the chase media to co-localize internalized antibody with endocytic structures. Surface-bound transferrin was removed with three washes of 10 mm acetic acid in PBS before fixation and viewing. For fluorescence ratio imaging experiments, the recycling endosomes were labeled with FITC-F(ab) in DMEM containing 10% serum, chased for 2–12 h, and washed with Ringer's solution (described below). For imaging the transferrin compartment, cells were serum-starved for 30 min in DMEM with 1% BSA and then loaded with FITC-Tf (50 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) in 1% BSA/DMEM for 2–5 h. Acetylstrophanthidin or bafilomycin was added to the media after the first hour. There was a nominal chase (∼10 min) in the absence of Tf at room temperature while the coverslips were prepared for imaging. Endosomal compartments labeled with F(ab)- or Tf-FITC and cytosol labeled with 2 μm BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes) were monitored in separate experiments using digitally processed fluorescence ratio imaging. Coverslips (22 mm diameter) with dye-loaded cells were placed in an open perfusion chamber on an inverted IM35 Zeiss microscope. Fluorescence measurements from up to 16 cells were made during each experiment. A × 40 or × 60 oil immersion objective (Zeiss) and either a × 1 (cytosol) or × 6.3 field objective (organelles) was used to magnify the images before transmission to the camera. A low light level DAGE 68 SIT camera collected (through a 530-nm band pass filter) emission images of the cells during excitation at 490 and 440 ± 5 nm (Omega Optical, Brattleboro VT). Filters were changed with a Lambda 10−2 filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato CA). Separate images for each wavelength were averaged over eight frames by a digital image processor (Axon Image Lightning, Axon Instruments, Foster City CA) and subsequently converted pixel by pixel to a ratio image. Experimental parameters such as data collection rate (one ratio image every 5–60 s), changing the filter wheel and opening/closing the shutter were controlled by a 133-MHz Pentium computer (Gateway 2000) running Axon's Imaging Workbench. The ratio images were displayed in pseudocolor. Data were collected by electronically selecting regions of the image for quantitation. Cytosolic measurements were made from entire cells. For organelles, only the brightest perinuclear regions were selected. FITC fluorescence at 490 nm increases with pH, while fluorescence at 440 nm is nearly insensitive to pH. Problems due to photobleaching and dye loss were minimized by reducing the intensity (with neutral density filters), duration of illumination, and number of images collected. Ringer's solution contained 141 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mm K2HPO4, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Calibration solutions contained 70 mm KCl, 70 mm NaCl, 1 mm each K2HPO4 and KH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES or 10 mm MES, adjusted to various pH values with NaOH and KOH. HEPES was used for solutions with pH > 6.5, and MES was used for solutions with pH ≤ 6.5. An in situ calibration was performed following each experiment to convert 490-/440-nm values to pH. Calibration solutions containing a 5–10 μm concentration of the K+/H+ exchange ionophore nigericin and a 5–10 μm concentration of the Na+/H+exchange ionophore monensin were perfused over cells. By using these solutions, we made no assumptions about Na+ and K+ concentrations within cytosol or organelles and allowed the equilibration of Na+ and K+ to drive the equilibration of H+. At least four solutions at various pH values (8.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, and/or 5.0) were used per calibration. For each cell and organelle, a calibration curve was generated, the data were fit to a sigmoidal curve with Graphpad (San Diego, CA), and the resulting fit was used to convert the ratio to pH values using the equation pH = pK + log((R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R)), where R is the ratio,Rmin and Rmax are the minimum and maximum values determined from the fit, and pKis the pKa determined from the fit. Experimental data were compared using unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed). All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Our methodology for measuring the pH of recycling endosomes in living cells is outlined in Fig.1. We placed a luminal epitope tag on Cb by extending its C terminus with the monomeric constant region of human IgG heavy chain. When this fusion construct (Cb-Ig) appeared at the cell surface, the IgG epitope was exposed to the external medium and could therefore be tagged by the exogenous addition of FITC-conjugated antibodies. The bound antibody subsequently hitch-hiked on the cycling protein and at steady state resided in the intracellular location of its escort protein. Organelle pH measurements were then made in single living cells using the pH sensitivity of the fluorescein moiety and digital imaging microscopy. Measurements were made over a sustained time and under a variety of conditions without the temporal limitations of using Tf-FITC, which is present only transiently in the recycling endosomes. A stable clone of COS-7 cells expressing Cb-Ig was isolated. To confirm that the fusion construct was properly targeted to the recycling endosomes, we used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to colocalize Cb-Ig with markers for the ER, Golgi, trans-Golgi network (TGN), and endosomes. The ER, Golgi, and TGN were visualized by transient transfection with epitope-tagged constructs specifically targeted to these compartments: CD4-UDPGT (ER), galactosyltransferase-Flag (trans-Golgi), and furin-Flag (TGN) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Endosomes were labeled by a 2-h incubation in media containing 100 μg/ml Rh-Tf. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and doubly stained with antibodies against both human IgG on Cb-Ig and the epitope tag on the transfected organelle marker. Cb-Ig was found at the cell surface and in a perinuclear area (Fig. 2, B,D, F, and H), similar to that reported for unmodified Cb in CV-1, CHO, and rat brain glial cells (17McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 18Galli T. Chilcote T. Mundigl O. Binz T. Niemann H.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The distribution of Cb-Ig clearly did not coincide with the ER marker CD4-UDPGT, which was found in a branching, tubular network that extended throughout the cytoplasm but was most concentrated around the nucleus (Fig. 2 A). Cb-Ig staining also differed from the Golgi (GalT-Flag, Fig. 2 C) and TGN (furin-Flag, Fig.2 E), two well defined tubular compartments that often formed bulbous, circular, and semicircular patterns in the perinuclear region of these cells. The overlapping but clearly distinct distributions of Cb-Ig, GalT-Flag, and furin-Flag was expected, as many organelles are positioned near the cell center (26Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other markers, Rh-Tf (Fig. 2 G) labeled a distinct pericentriolar spot which co-localized with Cb-Ig. This perinuclear localization of Tf has been used to define the recycling endosomes (1Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 4Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 11Marsh E.W. Leopold P.L. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1509-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that, like native Cb, the Cb-Ig fusion construct was targeted to the recycling endosomes. We further investigated the trafficking of Cb-Ig with a series of antibody uptake studies. Untransfected (Fig. 3,A and B) and Cb-Ig-transfected (Fig. 3,C–F) COS-7 cells were incubated in medium containing Rh-Tf and FITC-conjugated anti-IgG F(ab) fragment antibodies, and the patterns of F(ab) and Tf fluorescence were compared. A monovalent F(ab) fragment was used to ensure that the added antibody did not induce cross-linking of Cb-Ig. After a 2-h incubation in the continual presence of antibodies at 37 °C, Cb-Ig-transfected cells showed clear labeling of an organelle that was similar to that observed in the fixed and stained cells (compare Fig. 3 C with Fig. 2). No fluorescence was detected in untransfected COS-7 cells (Fig.3 A), demonstrating that F(ab) antibody uptake was an epitope-mediated event and that “background” fluorescence resulting from fluid phase endocytosis of the antibody was minimal. In Cb-Ig-transfected cells, FITC-F(ab) and Rh-Tf were found together in vesicles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear recycling endosomes (Fig. 3, C and D). Some bound antibody was also present at the cell surface (Fig. 3 C). As assessed by indirect immunofluorescence and cytofluorometry, the FITC signal was attenuated when cells were preincubated with unconjugated anti-hIgG F(ab) antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C before FITC-F(ab) labeling (data not shown). These results demonstrated that, in addition to proper targeting, the fusion construct continually cycled through the endosomal system in a manner analogous to that presumed for native Cb. The recycling endosomes were also labeled with a pulse-chase protocol. A 20-min incubation on ice with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab) antibodies labeled the plasma membrane of transfected cells, whereas no fluorescent signal could be detected in untransfected cells. After a 4-h chase at 37 °C, the surface label had dissipated and was replaced by a perinuclear stain that colocalized with Rh-Tf (Fig. 3,E and F). Surface and peripheral endosome staining was not visible, presumably because the majority of FITC-labeled Cb-Ig accumulated in the recycling endosomes at steady state. Labeling of the recycling endosomes was apparent within 45 min of chase and was still visible after 24 h (data not shown). The distributions of Cb-Ig and Rh-Tf were examined in greater detail with the use of laser scanning confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). After a 3-h incubation with 100 μg/ml of Texas Red Tf, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with FITC goat anti-hIgG antibodies. Representative merged images from single optical sections are shown. In contrast to the results obtained with indirect immunofluorescence, Cb-Ig and Tf could be visualized in separate pericentriolar vesicle populations. These differences were most obvious near the bottom or top of the cell, but differences could also be visualized in the middle sections where extensive colocalization was also present (Fig. 4 A). The same result was obtained when Cb-Ig was localized by FITC-F(ab) antibody uptake (Fig. 4 B) and when endogenous Cb was visualized in untra"
https://openalex.org/W2127698679,"To date, much attention has been focused on the heavy and intermediate chains of the multisubunit cytoplasmic dynein complex; however, little is known about the localization or function of dynein light chains. In this study, we find that Tctex-1, a light chain of cytoplasmic dynein, localizes predominantly to the Golgi apparatus in interphase fibroblasts. Immunofluorescent staining reveals striking juxtanuclear staining characteristic of the Golgi apparatus as well as nuclear envelope and punctate cytoplasmic staining that often decorates microtubules. Tctex-1 colocalization with Golgi compartment markers, its distribution upon treatment with various pharmacological agents, and the cofractionation of Tctex-1-associated membranes with Golgi membranes are all consistent with a Golgi localization. The distribution of Tctex-1 in interphase cells only partially overlaps with the dynein intermediate chain and p150<sup>Glued</sup> upon immunofluorescence, but most of Tctex-1 is redistributed onto mitotic spindles along with other dynein/dynactin subunits. Using sequential immunoprecipitations, we demonstrate that there is a subset of Tctex-1 not associated with the intermediate chain at steady state; the converse also appears to be true. Distinct populations of dynein complexes are likely to exist, and such diversity may occur in part at the level of their light chain compositions."
https://openalex.org/W2062451613,"The kinetic relationship between depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and the activation of a calcium release-activated calcium current (Icrac) was investigated in the RBL-1 mast cell line. The inositol trisphosphate receptor activator, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate ((2,4,5)IP3), the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, were used to deplete stored calcium. For (2,4,5)IP3 and thapsigargin, a significant delay was observed between the initiation of calcium store depletion and the activation of Icrac. However, for ionomycin, little or no delay was observed. This may indicate that a specialized subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum functions as a regulator of calcium entry and that this compartment is relatively resistant to depletion by (2,4,5)IP3 and thapsigargin but not to depletion by ionomycin. For all three calcium-depleting agents, the rate of development of Icrac, once initiated, was relatively constant, suggesting an all-or-none mechanism. However, there were also clear experimental situations in which submaximal, graded depletion of stored calcium resulted in submaximal activation of Icrac. This complex behavior could also result from the existence of a specific subcompartment of endoplasmic reticulum regulatingIcrac. The kinetic behavior of this compartment may not be accurately reflected by the kinetics of calcium changes in the bulk of endoplasmic reticulum. These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting specialization of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores with regard to the control of capacitative calcium entry.

These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting specialization of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores with regard to the control of capacitative calcium entry. Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by (1,4,5)IP3 1The abbreviations used are: (1,4,5)IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; Icrac, calcium release-activated calcium current; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N′,N′ -tetraacetic acid. is generally accompanied by an increase in Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. In the majority of cases, this entry seems to be signaled by depletion of the intracellular stores, a process termed capacitative calcium entry (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar) or store-operated calcium entry (2Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hoth and Penner (3Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) first described an inward Ca2+current in RBL cells that seemed to underlie, or at least contribute to, this entry. This current they designatedIcrac for CalciumRelease-Activated Calcium current. Although other distinguishable currents have been described that may represent capacitative calcium entry currents in other cell types (4Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), to date, Icrac is the best characterized electrophysiological manifestation of capacitative calcium entry. Thus, its properties and modes of regulation have received considerable scrutiny by a number of laboratories. For example, Hoth and Penner (5Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) observed a variable latency for the activation ofIcrac (4–14 s) when activated by external application of ionomycin or by break-in with IP3 in the patch pipette. These investigators assumed that release of intracellular Ca2+ by these two modes was essentially instantaneous and thus concluded that the latency observed reflected the time required for steps linking intracellular Ca2+store depletion to plasma membrane channel activation. In a more recent report, Parekh et al. (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) described an all-or-none activation of Icrac by (1,4,5)IP3, as well as a dissociation of activation of Icracby IP3 from the activation of Ca2+ release. In the current studies, we have further investigated the latency for activation of Icrac utilizing IP3, the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, and ionomycin to deplete intracellular stores and have attempted to relate these latencies to observed kinetics of intracellular Ca2+ store depletion by these same reagents. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that the latency between depletion of calcium stores andIcrac activation depends on the nature of the agent used to deplete the stores. We also find that the kinetics of activation are complex, with all-or-none behavior in some but not in all instances. Our results may suggest the existence of a specialized, kinetically distinct subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum that functions as a regulator of capacitative calcium entry. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1, ATCC 1378-CRL, batch F-13352) were cultured as recommended by ATCC. Briefly, cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt, 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated) and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Ionomycin and (2,4,5)IP3 were obtained from Calbiochem. Thapsigargin was purchased from LC Laboratories. The cells were allowed to attach to cover slips, were mounted in a Teflon chamber, and were incubated with 3 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 25 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and bathed in normal external saline solution (see below) at room temperature for at least 10 min before [Ca2+]i measurements were made. The fluorescence of the fura-2 loaded cells was monitored with a photomultiplier-based system, mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a Nikon 40× (1.3 N.A.) Neofluor objective. The fluorescence light source was provided by a PTI dual excitation light source equipped with a light path. The light path chopper enabled rapid interchange between two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), and a photomultiplier tube monitored the emission fluorescence at 510 nm, selected by a barrier filter (Omega). All experiments were carried out at 24 °C. Calibration and calculation of [Ca2+]i were carried out as described previously (7Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The normal extracellular medium contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). Nominally Ca2+-free saline had the same composition, except no CaCl2 was added. The bath volume (0.4 ml) was rapidly exchanged with a gravity perfusion system. In the figures, exact times are indicated when new bath solution was introduced, without any correction for the dead time required for a new solution to reach the cell. When (2,4,5)IP3 was introduced into the cell for measurement of Ca2+ release, the patch pipette (2–4 MΩ, Corning glass, 7052) contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA (or 0.1 BAPTA), 50 μm fura-2 free acid, and 1 MgATP (pH 7.2). For measurement of Icrac, the pipette solution was (in mm): 140 Cs-Asp, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA-Cs4, and 1 MgATP (free Ca2+ ∼100 nm, pH 7.2). The bath solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 CsCl, 10 CaCl2 (or 10 MgCl2 for Ca2+ free solution), 1.13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). Ruptured-patch whole-cell voltage clamp was carried out as described previously (8Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar, 9White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The holding potential was 30 mV where little or no driving force for calcium entry exists. Icracwas measured from the current resulting from voltage ramps between −100 to +60 mV over a period of 160 ms executed every 5 s. The nonspecific current (the current before the induction ofIcrac or the current remaining when external Ca2+ has been removed) was subtracted. All voltages were corrected for a 10-mV liquid-junction potential. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Axopatch-1C amplifier and PCLAMP 6.1 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 200-μs intervals. Intracellular application of (2,4,5)IP3 or external application of thapsigargin or ionomycin induced the appearance of an inward current presumed to represent Icrac because (i) the current was strongly inwardly rectifying with a magnitude and current-voltage relationship similar to that previously described forIcrac by Hoth and Penner (3Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) (not shown) and (ii) the current was seen with strong intracellular calcium buffering (10 mm BAPTA) but was lost when external calcium was removed (not shown). Because the intracellular solutions used for Ca2+ release and Icrac generally differed in the major cationic species (Cs+ versus K+), some Ca2+ release experiments were carried out utilizing the Cs+-containing solutions from theIcrac protocol (but with BAPTA reduced to 0.1 mm). No statistically significant differences in the [Ca2+]i responses were noted. For 50 μm (2,4,5)IP3 with Cs+-containing solution, peak [Ca2+]i was 229.5 ± 19.9 nm and latency was 16.5 ± 8.1 s (n = 12); with K+-containing solution peak [Ca2+]i was 272.1 ± 19.3 and latency was 15.3 ± 1.9 s (n = 12). For 100 μm (2,4,5)IP3 with Cs+-containing solution, peak [Ca2+]i was 424.6 ± 50 nm and latency was 8.0 ± 1.2 s (n = 11); with K+-containing solution peak, [Ca2+]i was 385.2 ± 36.8 nm and latency was 10.6 ± 1.1 s (n = 12). The time course of activation of calcium release and inward calcium current (Icrac) was determined in single RBL-1 cells following the introduction of (2,4,5)IP3 into the cytoplasm via patch pipettes in the whole cell configuration. (2,4,5)IP3 was used to minimize effects of inositol phosphate metabolism (7Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cells were held at 30 mV to minimize Ca2+ entry (an approach similar to that employed by Parekhet al. (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar)). After establishment of the whole cell configuration, cytosolic Ca2+ rose after a short latency as a consequence of Ca2+ being released from the intracellular stores by (2,4,5)IP3 (Fig.1 A). This initial short latency is apparently the result of the time required for IP3 to diffuse into the cell and reach a critical concentration in the vicinity of IP3 receptors. We measuredIcrac activation in parallel experiments because the high levels of Ca2+ buffers required in the pipette inIcrac determinations (3Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) prevent observation of release of stored Ca2+. Icrac was also activated following introduction of IP3 after a significant latency following the establishment of whole cell configuration (Fig. 1 B). However, at each of four different concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 the latency forIcrac activation was greater than the latency for initiation of Ca2+ release (Fig. 1 C). We assume that the filling state of the intracellular stores is initially the same in both the Ca2+ release andIcrac protocols because (2,4,5)IP3was present in the pipette at the time of break-in, and in experiments without (2,4,5)IP3, Icrac was not activated after prolonged dialysis, and basal [Ca2+]i did not change appreciably. In the Icrac protocol, [Ca2+]i does not change because the intracellular solution contained ATP as well as sufficient added Ca2+ to keep the free [Ca2+]i in the physiological range (∼100 nm). At (2,4,5)IP3 concentrations of 100 and 50 μm, the latency forIcrac activation exceeded the latency for initiation as well as for the peak of Ca2+ release (Fig.1 C), suggesting a significant delay between Ca2+release and activation of Icrac. Both the latency for Ca2+ release and the latency forIcrac activation decreased with increasing concentration of (2,4,5)IP3, consistent with a causal relationship between store depletion and activation ofIcrac (Fig. 1 C). Intriguingly, the development time for Icrac (from the point whereIcrac starts to be activated to the point where it is fully activated) remained relatively constant regardless of the concentration of IP3. In other words, the rate of store depletion only affects the initial latency forIcrac activation, not the time course of development of Icrac, at least over this (2,4,5)IP3 concentration range. A variable delay with similar development time for Icrac at different concentrations of (1,4,5)IP3 was also reported by Parekhet al. (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The extent of intracellular release of Ca2+ was determined in parallel experiments in which the status of intracellular stores was assessed by application of the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, 5 min after breaking into the cells (by which timeIcrac had reached its plateau level, Fig.2 A). Despite differing latencies for initiation of Ca2+ release andIcrac, at all but the lowest concentration of (2,4,5)IP3 (10 μm), the magnitude, both of intracellular release of Ca2+ and ofIcrac, was relatively constant (Fig. 2,B and C). At 10 μm(2,4,5)IP3, however, both intracellular release and steady-state Icrac were clearly less than maximal (Fig. 2, B and C). In experiments with still lower concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 (5 μm for example), a proportion of cells did not respond with release or with Icrac activation. Thus, over this range of concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3,Icrac activation seems all-or-none as described previously for (1,4,5)IP3 (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, this seems to result from the fact that most concentrations of IP3, which are sufficient to induce release of Ca2+, induce an all-or-none release of Ca2+. At 10 μm(2,4,5)IP3, where release is submaximal, steady-stateIcrac activation is also submaximal (similar finding was reported for Icrac by Parekhet al. (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar)). This indicates that at least over a narrow range of IP3 concentrations, activation ofIcrac is likely a graded function of the extent of intracellular Ca2+ store depletion (see also data below with ionomycin, Fig. 4).Figure 4The relationship between Icrac activation and store depletion when the stores are depleted with ionomycin. Above, time course of Icrac activation with four concentrations of ionomycin. Each trace represents the average current from five to seven cells. Data for 1 μm thapsigargin are also included (from Fig. 3). Below, time course for Ca2+ release with ionomycin. The external solution contained no added Ca2+ and 1 EGTA with the indicated concentrations of ionomycin. Each trace represents the average response of five to seven fura-2-loaded cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the above studies, fura-2 measurement of Ca2+ release is carried out under conditions of physiological low Ca2+ buffering (0.1 mm BAPTA or 0.1 mm EGTA, see Experimental Procedures). However, Icrac is necessarily measured under conditions of high Ca2+ buffering (10 mm BAPTA) to eliminate Ca2+-activated currents and Ca2+-dependent inactivation ofIcrac (3Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). These differences in Ca2+buffering may have significant effects on the binding of (2,4,5)IP3 to IP3 receptors and on the amplification of Ca2+ release owing to the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) behavior of the IP3 receptor (10Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). These factors could lead to a slower Ca2+ release by IP3 under the conditions forIcrac measurement, thus accounting for the longer latencies we observed. To minimize these potential problems, we investigated the time course for Icracactivation following depletion of stores with thapsigargin or ionomycin. Thapsigargin is a potent inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (11Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1994; 43: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and depletes Ca2+stores by blocking Ca2+ uptake and allowing Ca2+ to passively leak out. Ionomycin is a Ca2+ionophore that depletes the stores by either directly transporting ions or functioning as an ion channel. In neither case is it expected that Ca2+ buffers would impede the rate of Ca2+store depletion; if anything, intracellular depletion of Ca2+ would likely be augmented. We found that a delay between Ca2+ release and Icracactivation still seemed to be present when the store was depleted with thapsigargin (Fig. 3) or ionomycin (Fig.4). 2For experiments measuring Ca2+release owing to ionomycin or thapsigargin, we used intact rather than dialyzed cells. This is because at low concentrations of ionomycin, when release is gradual, the rise in [Ca2+]i associated with release is difficult to detect presumably owing to constant exchange of the Ca2+-associated dye through the pipette. With maximal concentrations of ionomycin where this is less of a problem, the magnitude and extent of the response to ionomycin are comparable (compare Fig. 5 with Fig. 2). Because ionomycin and thapsigargin deplete Ca2+ stores by passive means, we presume that the rates of depletion will be similar under the different conditions, but the data in intact cells give a more accurate reflection of the extent of depletion. As was seen for (2,4,5)IP3, the delay for activation ofIcrac decreased with increasing concentration of these agents. In the case of ionomycin, the development time forIcrac was relatively constant for the three highest concentrations of ionomycin (58.5 ± 0.9, 62.6 ± 7.7, and 78.3 ± 2.4 s for 500, 50, and 5 nmionomycin, respectively), and these times are comparable with the development time when Icrac was activated with (2,4,5)IP3. For thapsigargin, the development times forIcrac were slightly longer (75.9 ± 3.1, 105.2 ± 12.0, 115.0 ± 15.3 s for 1 μm, 100 nm and 10 nm thapsigargin, respectively). Furthermore, consistent with the (2,4,5)IP3 data, the extent of Icrac activation with different concentrations of thapsigargin (Fig. 3) or ionomycin (Fig. 4) was about the same except at the lowest concentration of ionomycin (0.5 nm, Fig. 4). For IP3, thapsigargin, and ionomycin, there seems to be a significant delay between the release of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of Icrac. This could result either from an interval of time required to release and/or synthesize some signaling messenger or from the need to deplete intracellular stores below some critical level before the activation process begins. From inspection of the data in Figs. 3 and 4, it seems that for both agents release of Ca2+ is well under way prior to the activation of Icrac. However, the amount of Ca2+ needed to increase [Ca2+]i into the 100–300 nm range is potentially very small in comparison with the total Ca2+ content of intracellular stores. Thus, we attempted to determine more quantitatively the extent of depletion required to activate Icrac by estimating the Ca2+ store content at the time whenIcrac is initially activated. The latency and time course of activation of Icrac for 1 μm thapsigargin and 5 nm ionomycin are very similar (Fig. 4). In parallel experiments with intact RBL-1 cells, we added a high dose of ionomycin (5 μm) 50 s after treatment with either 1 μm thapsigargin or 5 nm ionomycin, corresponding to the time of initiation ofIcrac (see Fig. 3), to assess the Ca2+ content of the stores and compared it with that of control cells that had not been exposed to either agent. As shown in Fig. 5, at the time whenIcrac was initiated by 1 μmthapsigargin, significant release of Ca2+ had already occurred. 100 s later, when Icracactivation was maximal, a small but significant amount of stored Ca2+ remained in the cells. Thus, for thapsigargin, it seems that either a significant amount of Ca2+ must be released before the initiation of Icrac or a significant amount of time is required for steps linking Ca2+ store depletion to Icracactivation. Surprisingly, when ionomycin was used to deplete intracellular stores, a different result was obtained. 50 s after application of 5 nm ionomycin, despite the fact that a discernible elevation in [Ca2+]i had occurred, the Ca2+ content of the stores seemed to be about the same in ionomycin-treated and control cells (Fig.6). Thus, the stores are apparently only slightly depleted at 50 s with 5 nm ionomycin. This result suggests that when ionomycin is used to deplete stored Ca2+ only a very small reduction is required to initiate activation of Icrac. It also indicates that for ionomycin, the delay in activating of Icrac may not reflect a longer delay than that required to significantly reduce the Ca2+ content of intracellular Ca2+stores. At 150 s following addition of 5 nm ionomycin,Icrac was fully activated (Fig. 4). When we used the same strategy to assess the store content at this time, we found that the Ca2+ stores were depleted by about 50% (Fig. 6). This result suggests that Icrac can be fully activated with only partial depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores. The temporal relationship between the discharge of intracellular stores of Ca2+ and the activation of capacitative calcium entry is key to understanding the nature of the signaling process. However, it is difficult to determine these two parameters under similar conditions because the very high [Ca2+]i buffering required to detect Icrac prevents detection of Ca2+ release to the cytoplasm. To minimize this problem, we have relied on comparisons among three agents that cause depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by clearly distinct mechanisms: IP3 by activating a membrane receptor/ion channel; thapsigargin, which blocks the SERCA pumps that accumulate Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum; and ionomycin, which passively transports Ca2+ down its concentration gradient. Although we expect experimental conditions such as Ca2+buffering to affect release of Ca2+ by IP3, we expect this to be much less of a factor with thapsigargin and ionomycin. Nonetheless, we cannot know with absolute certainty that this is so. Ideally, one would like to be able to assess the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores in the experiments in which Icrac is measured. Recently described technologies may permit such a determination in the near future (12Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). In experiments utilizing (2,4,5)IP3 as an activator of intracellular IP3 receptors, we observed a clear distinction between the time required for detectable release of stored Ca2+ and that required for activation ofIcrac. That is, significantly shorter intervals were required for mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores than for activation of Icrac. As discussed above, because different Ca2+ buffering conditions were necessarily used for these two determinations, it is not clear whether the latency for release of Ca2+ was identical in the two experimental conditions. In fact, one might expect augmentation of the Ca2+ release process with minimal Ca2+buffering through calcium-induced calcium release. However, if that were the case, one might also expect that concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 inducing only partial depletion of stores with high concentrations of intracellular buffers might cause complete depletion with lower buffer concentrations. From the data in Fig. 2, this does not seem to be the case; 25–100 μm(2,4,5)IP3 induced maximal responses in the high and low buffer conditions (Icrac in the former, depletion in the latter), whereas 10 μm(2,4,5)IP3 induced a partial activation with both buffer conditions. Differences in Ca2+ buffering should be less of an issue for experiments utilizing thapsigargin or ionomycin. These agents deplete Ca2+ stores by distinct and passive mechanisms, such that cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering should affect the kinetics of depletion minimally if at all. From inspection of the time courses of Icrac activation and of [Ca2+]i increase in Figs. 3 and 4, it seems that Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum does indeed precede Icrac by some tens of seconds. However, the data in Fig. 6 show that for low concentrations of ionomycin at least, the level of cytoplasmic Ca2+ can be a poor indicator of the extent of depletion of Ca2+ stores. Despite a significant rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ 50 s after addition of 5 nm ionomycin, the total stored Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum was changed minimally. These results indicate that especially with low concentrations of Ca2+-depleting agents, changes in [Ca2+]i can misrepresent the extent of changes in intracellular Ca2+ stores. Thus, for this concentration of ionomycin, and in contrast to the findings with (2,4,5)IP3 and thapsigargin, there may be very little delay between the fall in Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum and the initiation of Icrac. In an earlier report, McDonald et al. (13McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported minimal latency for Icrac activation when (1,4,5)IP3 was rapidly released within Jurkat T cells by flash photolysis. What then is the meaning of the delay between Ca2+ store depletion and Icrac activation seen with (2,4,5)IP3 and thapsigargin? As discussed above, for (2,4,5)IP3, the difference may reflect differences in rates of Ca2+ discharge with the two different intracellular Ca2+ buffering systems used. But perhaps a more fundamental difference among these three modes of Ca2+ release is that only ionomycin can be assumed to release Ca2+ in a spatially nonspecific manner throughout the cell. In other words, because of its presumed mechanism of action, we expect ionomycin to release Ca2+ from all components or regions of the endoplasmic reticulum with similar facility. However, for (2,4,5)IP3 and thapsigargin, this may not be the case. (2,4,5)IP3 will cause activation of IP3receptor channels and cause discharge of Ca2+ only at the specific sites where these receptors are located. Thapsigargin will lead to depletion of stores by passive leak of Ca2+following inhibition of SERCA pumps. Virtually nothing is known about the channels mediating this presumably IP3-insensitive or basal movement of Ca2+, but such sites could also be localized in a non-homogeneous manner in specific regions of the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, the current findings may indicate that a specific subfraction of the endoplasmic reticulum regulates the Ca2+ channels underlying Icrac and that as Ca2+ is depleted from the endoplasmic reticulum through IP3 receptors, or through the leak pathway involved with thapsigargin action, this specific subcompartment is more slowly depleted than the majority of the endoplasmic reticulum. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for differential effects of thapsigargin in subcompartments of the endoplasmic reticulum. The suggestion of a specific subfraction of endoplasmic reticulum involved in the regulation of Icrac is consistent with the finding that for both ionomycin and thapsigargin, full depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum store is not required for maximal activation of Icrac. In at least one earlier report, specialization of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores with respect to regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry has been suggested (14Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the subfraction of endoplasmic reticulum coupled to capacitative calcium entry was at most 30% of the total thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The current findings indicate that the kinetics of activation ofIcrac are complex. Over certain concentration ranges with all three modes of activation, the time course ofIcrac activation is relatively constant. This may simply result from the fact that in most experimental situations, release of Ca2+ occurs more rapidly than the steps involved in signaling Icrac. This may also be suggestive of an all-or-none mechanism of activation, as proposed by Parekhet al. (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, graded activation ofIcrac was observed with 10 μm(2,4,5)IP3, as well as in an study earlier utilizing cyclopiazonic acid to deplete endoplasmic reticulum calcium (14Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As in the current study, Parekh et al. (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) concluded that a small component of the total intracellular Ca2+ stores regulatesIcrac, but this conclusion was based on findings that low concentrations of (1,4,5)IP3 seemed to activate Ca2+ release without activating Ca2+ entry. In our study, we have exclusively utilized (2,4,5)IP3, a poorly metabolizable analog of (1,4,5)IP3, to avoid possible complications of differential metabolism under different experimental conditions. With (2,4,5)IP3 as the mobilizing ligand, no dissociation between the concentrations required for release and those required for Icrac activation were observed (Fig. 2). However, it is the differential latencies observed for ionomycin, thapsigargin, and (2,4,5)IP3 that lead us to propose a specialized, quantitatively minor component of the endoplasmic reticulum as the site of control of capacitative calcium entry and Icrac. If in fact a small compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for regulation ofIcrac, it is possible that the kinetics ofIcrac activation reflect the kinetic behavior of this small pool of Ca2+ and that these kinetics are not accurately reflected by the average time course of changes in cytoplasmic and stored Ca2+ in the cell. Future work must concentrate on experimental dissection of these functionally distinguishable subcompartments of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores if we are to fully understand how the plasma membrane Ca2+ movements underlyingIcrac and capacitative calcium entry are regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1968322238,"Annexin II is a member of a multigene family of Ca2+-regulated, membrane-binding proteins implicated through biochemical and perforated cell experiments in Ca2+-triggered secretion. Within most cells annexin II resides in a tight heterotetrameric complex with a cellular protein ligand, p11, and complex formation is mediated via the N-terminal 14 residues of annexin II including the N-terminal acetyl group. To analyze at the single cell level whether the annexin II-p11 complex is involved in regulated secretion, we used membrane capacitance measurements to follow exocytotic fusion events in bovine aortic endothelial cells manipulated with respect to their annexin II-p11 complex formation. Upon guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) stimulation, the endothelial cells show a significant increase in membrane capacitance which is generally preceded by a transient rise in intracellular Ca2+ and thus indicative of the occurrence of Ca2+-regulated secretion. The GTPγS-induced capacitance increase is markedly reduced in cells loaded with a synthetic peptide, Ac1–14, which corresponds in sequence to the N-terminal 14 residues of annexin II in their correctly acetylated form and which is capable of disrupting preformed annexin II-p11 complexes. The effect of the peptide is highly specific as the nonacetylated variant, N1–14, which is incapable of disrupting annexin II-p11, does not interfere with the GTPγS-induced increase in membrane capacitance. These data show that intact annexin II-p11 complexes are indispensable for regulated exocytosis to occur in an efficient manner in endothelial cells.

These data show that intact annexin II-p11 complexes are indispensable for regulated exocytosis to occur in an efficient manner in endothelial cells. Changes in the intracellular Ca2+ levels are known to regulate a variety of cellular processes ranging from the control of cell architecture to intracellular communication, cellular differentiation, and cell death. These cellular responses are mediated through a large number of Ca2+-binding proteins which are thought to couple the Ca2+ stimulus (transient increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration) to the different biological events most likely by displaying different properties in their Ca2+-free and their Ca2+-bound conformations. Generally, the Ca2+-binding proteins are grouped according to the structure of their principal Ca2+binding motif with the two largest families known to date being the EF hand proteins and the annexins (1Celio M.R. Guidebook to the Calcium-Binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1996Google Scholar). In contrast to EF hand-type and most other Ca2+-binding proteins, annexins characteristically also display a Ca2+-dependent interaction with negatively charged phospholipids enriched in the cytosolic leaflets of cellular membranes (2Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 4Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Due to these biochemical characteristics, annexins have been implicated in mediating and/or regulating membrane related events including membrane-membrane contacts, membrane-cytoskeleton linkages, membrane organizations, and ion currents across membranes. However, experiments addressing the problem of annexin function in living cells have been very scarce, and the biological role of annexins remains enigmatic. Annexin II is a 36-kDa protein comprising two principal domains, a C-terminal protein core consisting of four homologous segments of 70 amino acids, the so-called annexin repeats, and an N-terminal region which is less structured and 30 residues in length (4Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). While the core domain harbors binding sites for Ca2+, phospholipid (the common annexin ligands) and F-actin, the N-terminal sequence contains phosphorylation sites for pp60src and protein kinase C as well as the binding site for an intracellular protein ligand of 11 kDa. This p11 protein is a member of the S100 family of EF hand-type Ca2+-binding proteins which forms obligatory dimers (1Celio M.R. Guidebook to the Calcium-Binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1996Google Scholar, 5Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). p11 binding is mediated solely through the N-terminal 14-amino acids of annexin II which form an amphiphatic α-helix with the hydrophobic side chains and the N-terminal acetyl group of the posttranslationally modified annexin II being indispensable for high affinity p11 interaction (6Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Becker T. Weber K. Johnsson N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4207-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Complex formation establishes a heterotetrameric annexin II2p112 entity, which has altered biochemical properties when compared with monomeric annexin II, e.g. the complex but not monomeric annexin II can aggregate chromaffin granules at low micromolar Ca2+concentrations (8Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Within cells the annexin II-p11 complex is found in the cortical cytoskeleton underlying the plasma membrane, on early endosomal membranes as well as associated with secretory vesicles like chromaffin granules (4Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Monomeric annexin II, on the other hand, appears to be at least partly cytosolic. Its complex formation with p11 and thus the cell cortex association is regulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation in the N-terminal domain (9Johnsson N. Van P.N. Söling H.D. Weber K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Regnouf F. Sagot I. Delouche B. Devilliers G. Cartaud J. Henry J.-P. Pradel L.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27143-27150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Sagot I. Delouche B. Dirrig S. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1217-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In line with the intracellular distribution, annexin II-p11 has been implicated in early endocytotic and late secretory events occurring at or close to the plasma membrane (4Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A role in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis has been deduced mainly from studies using digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells. Here the progressive loss of secretory responsiveness to elevated Ca2+ concentrations can be slowed down by the addition of annexin II with the annexin II-p11 complex being more efficient than monomeric annexin II (12Ali S.M. Geisow M.J. Burgoyne R.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Sarafian T. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The suggested role of annexin II in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis is in line with the morphological observation that in quick-frozen deep-etched chromaffin cells the protein appears to form physical connections between the plasma membrane and the membrane of secretory granules (14Nakata T. Sobue K. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, annexin II-p11 is probably not an obligatory and general constituent of Ca2+ regulated secretory pathways since the protein complex shows variable expression levels in different cell types with exocytotically active neuronal cells containing little annexin II and since ectopic expression of a trans-dominant annexin II-p11 mutant in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells does not affect the Ca2+-triggered dopamine release in a permeabilized cell system (15Graham M.E. Gerke V. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To analyze within living cells expressing considerable amounts of annexin II-p11 whether the complex participates in regulated exocytosis we chose bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells as a model system and used membrane capacitance tracings to follow exocytotic fusion events. We show that the cells, which contain as typical secretory granules Weibel-Palade bodies positive for von Willebrand factor, respond to a GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); BAPTA, 1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; CPAE, calf pulmonary artery endothelial; NSF,N-ethlymaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; PKC, protein kinase C; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; vWF, von Willebrand factor. stimulus by a transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ and a subsequent increase in cell surface area by 15%. Loading of the cells with a synthetic peptide comprising the N-terminal 14 residues of annexin II including the N-acetyl group (Ac1–14) significantly interferes with the GTPγS-induced membrane capacitance increase. This peptide harbors the entire p11 binding site and is capable of disrupting preformed annexin II-p11 complexes. In contrast to Ac1–14, the nonacetylated 14-mer (N1–14) does not interfere with annexin II-p11 complex formation and also has no effect on the GTPγS induced capacitance increase. The specific effect of the complex disrupting annexin II peptide indicates that annexin II-p11 participates in regulated exocytosis in endothelial cells possibly by providing physical linkages at the level of the plasma membrane. Mouse monoclonal antibodies, H28 and H21, were used for the detection of annexin II and p11, respectively (16Osborn M. Johnsson N. Wehland J. Weber K. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Von Willebrand factor was stained with a polyclonal rabbit antibody (Dako). Dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein-coupled goat anti-mouse, rhodamine-coupled goat anti-rabbit, and Texas Red-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dianova) were employed as secondary antibodies. All secondary antibodies were tested in control experiments by omitting the primary antibody and showed neglectable fluorescence signals on CPAE cells. Immunoblotting experiments employed horseradish peroxidase-coupled pig anti-mouse antibodies (Dako) as secondary antibodies. The heterotetrameric annexin II-p11 complex was purified from porcine intestinal epithelium (17Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Monomeric annexin II was expressed recombinantly in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified from the cell lysate as described previously (18Jost M. Gerke V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Peptide synthesis was carried out on an automated synthesizer (model 9050; Milligen). For N-terminal acetylation, peptides were left on the resin, and the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) group was released by treatment with dimethylformamide. Subsequently, the free N terminus was acetylated with acetic anhydride/N-ethyldiisopropylamine for 30 min. Removal of the protection group was then achieved by treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% ethanediol, 2.5% anisole. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a preparative column (Vydac 218TP 1022) using a linear acetonitrile gradient for elution. All products were characterized by mass spectrometry (MALDI compact III; Kratos Analytical) and by N-terminal sequence analysis of a nonacetylated aliquot on an automated gas-phase sequenator (Knaur model 810). The purified peptides were lyophilized, washed three times with water, and then stored at −20 °C as lyophilized aliquots. Experiments were performed on single, nonconfluent endothelial cells of an established cell line from bovine pulmonary artery (cell line CPAE, ATCC CCL-209). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, detached by exposure to 0.05% trypsin in a Ca2+- and Mg2+-free solution, reseeded on gelatin-coated coverslips, and kept in culture 2–4 days before use. CPAE cells grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed and permeabilized for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times, 5 min each, in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in a moist chamber with 20 μl of the primary antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. The monoclonal antibodies H28 and H21 were employed as undiluted hybridoma culture supernatants, whereas the polyclonal anti-von Willebrand factor antibody was diluted 1:100. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (three times, 5 min each), the cells were incubated with the respective secondary antibodies, washed again, and mounted in Moviol. Conventional microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope and Kodak Tmax 3200 film. Confocal images were taken using a Leica laser scanning microscope. Cells were voltage clamped in the whole-cell patch clamp mode by use of an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (Heka, Germany) technique. Holding potential was 0 mV. The normal bath solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 11.5 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The osmolarity of the solution, as measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor 5500, Schlag, Gladbach, Germany), was 315 mOsm. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 40 KCl, 100 potassium aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 4 Na2ATP, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Under these conditions, no K+ currents can be activated. For stimulation of exocytosis, cells were loaded after breaking the membrane seal with 100 μm GTPγS. For capacitance measurements, we used a double sine wave method to determine the electrical capacitance of the cell surface. The system was based on a TMS320C30 (Texas Instruments) floating point Digital Signal Processor board. Two sine waves of 125 and 500 Hz and 5 mV amplitude were alternatively imposed on the membrane. Current and voltage were sampled at a frequency of 17,280 Hz via a multiplexer circuit, which allows the use of identical circuits for amplifying and filtering of both signals and minimizes the instrumental phase shifts. The length of the time series was 864 data points, and consisted of 12 and 18 sine wave periods for each frequency. Membrane capacitance calculations were based on a lumped circuit composed of a parallel arrangement of the equivalent membrane capacitance (Cm) and resistance (Rm) in series with the access resistance Rs. The use of two sine waves enables the calculation of these three parameters with standard AC analysis formalism. The present version of the method allows for updating these parameters at a rate of three estimations per s. The stray capacitance of the system, as determined with a dummy resistive network, was less than 0.8 pF. For the electrodes used in these experiments (between 2 and 5 megohms) we measured access resistances between 6 and 18 megohms. These values were rather stable during cell swelling. Using a test circuit, we obtained by changing the access resistance between 3 and 35 megohms only a deviation of the measured capacitance from the circuit capacitance between 1 and 1.6%. For [Ca2+]i measurements cells on the coverslips were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM and then washed three times in the experimental chamber with Krebs solution to remove extracellular fura-2/AM. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were monitored by means of a photo multiplier-based system, consisting of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM 10), filter wheel, amplifier and controller (Luigs & Neumann, Germany), and a photo multiplier unit (Hamamatsu, Japan). Cells were illuminated alternatively at excitation wave lengths of 360 and 390 nm through a rotating filter wheel (speed between 2 and 3 revolutions/s). Auto fluorescence was measured on cell-free parts of the coverslips and was automatically subtracted from the Ca2+ signals. The apparent concentration of free Ca2+ was calculated from the fluorescence ratio Ri (360/390 nm): [Ca2+](inμM)=KeffRi−R0/R1−RiEquation 1 where Keff is the “effective binding constant,” R0 the fluorescence ratio at “low” Ca2+ (1 mm EGTA) andR1 that at high Ca2+(1 mm). Phospholipid vesicles were prepared from bovine brain extract as described previously (19Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Binding studies employing monomeric annexin II or the annexin II-p11 complex in the presence or absence of the peptides Ac1–14 and N1–14 were carried out using 0.25 mg/ml liposomes in 100 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and EGTA-buffered Ca2+ to give a final free Ca2+concentration of 250 nm. In experiments analyzing the petide effects, 5.5 pmol of annexin II-p11 were incubated with a 500-fold molar excess of the respective peptide in assay buffer for 5 min at room temperature prior to adding the liposomes. Subsequently, the mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature and liposome-bound protein was separated from the unbound fraction by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting phospholipid pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar), whereas the supernatants obtained were dried down and then dissolved in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. 10 μl of each sample were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44916) Google Scholar). Calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells were chosen to analyze the participation of annexin II-p11 in regulated exocytosis for two major reasons. 1) Within the mammalian organism cells of the endothelium show the strongest expression of annexin II and we have shown previously that CPAE cells contain significant amounts of annexin II and p11 (22Nilius B. Gerke V. Prenen J. Szücs G. Heinke G. Weber K. Droogmans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30631-30636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 2) Cultivated endothelial cells are capable of responding to an external stimulus, e.g. thrombin, by Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies, the principal storage granules of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and P-selectin (23Wagner D.D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that the CPAE cells used in this study contain vWF-positive granules with the typical morphological appearance of Weibel-Palade bodies. Moreover, treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 induces cell surface appearance of vWF as revealed by immunofluorescence staining of nonpermeabilized cells (not shown). This indicates that the cells are capable of Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of at least vWF-positive granules. To document exocytosis at the single cell level we employed membrane capacitance analyses. Cells were challenged with GTPγS, which was shown previously to induce intracellular Ca2+ rises and to effectively trigger Ca2+ regulated exocytosis in a number of different cells including Chinese hamster ovary, mast, and chromaffin cells as well as pancreatic β cells (24Coorssen J.R. Schmitt H. Almers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3787-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Oberhauser A.F. Robinson I.M. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Proks P. Eliasson L. Ämmälä C. Rorsman P. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Vallar L. Biden T.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5049-5056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 reveals that the infusion of GTPγS (100 μm) produces an increase in endothelial cell capacitance. Simultaneous measurement of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, shows that the rise in membrane capacitance is generally preceded by a Ca2+transient of approximately 250 nm as compared with the Ca2+ concentration of less than 100 nm in resting cells. This GTPγS-induced Ca2+ mobilization is observed in most but not all cells. A fraction of approximately 15% of the endothelial cells analyzed responds to the GTPγS stimulus by capacitance increase without an apparent change in the intracellular Ca2+ levels (not shown). However, in all experiments a holding potential of 0 mV was chosen, and this may reduce Ca2+ influx because of a reduced driving force. Nevertheless, our data are in line with previous studies in other cell systems, indicating that GTPγS can also trigger exocytosis without liberation of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (26Proks P. Eliasson L. Ämmälä C. Rorsman P. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,28Wollheim C.B. Ullrich S. Meda P. Vallar L. Biosci. Rep. 1987; 7: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Neher E. J. Physiol. 1988; 395: 193-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Theler J.M. Rossetto O. Montecucco C. Sadoul K. Weller U. Palmer P. Thorens B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Our data show that the surface area of CPAE cells is increased by 15–20% upon GTPγS stimulus. Given the scale of this significant membrane increase it is unlikely to have resulted from a block of endocytotic membrane uptake occurring on a background of ongoing constitutive exocytosis. Moreover, constitutive exocytosis is inhibited by GTPγS in other cells (31Miller S.G. Moore H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), arguing against a massive increase in surface area by constitutive membrane flow, even if endocytosis were inhibited under the conditions chosen. Thus, the significant increase in plasma membrane capacitance observed in GTPγS treated endothelial cells most likely results from an induction of regulated exocytosis. Annexin II has been localized to the subplasmalemmal region of different types of cells, and this localization is thought to be of crucial importance for a role of the protein in Ca2+-regulated secretion in adrenal chromaffin cells (11Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Sagot I. Delouche B. Dirrig S. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1217-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The tight association of annexin II with the cell cortex depends on its complex formation with p11 (11Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Sagot I. Delouche B. Dirrig S. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1217-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32Thiel C. Osborn M. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this is mediated through the N-terminal domain of annexin II (33Glenney J.R. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7884-7888Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Johnsson N. Vanderkerckhove J. van Damme J. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 14 residues of annexin II (AcSTVHEILCKLSLEG) including the N-acetyl group of the N-terminal serine harbor the entire p11 binding site, and synthetic peptides comprising this sequence (herein referred to as Ac1–14) bind p11 with high specificity and affinity. In contrast, peptides of the same sequence containing a nonmodified N terminus (N1–14) show a more than 1000-fold reduced affinity for p11 (6Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Becker T. Weber K. Johnsson N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4207-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on the high affinity of the Ac1–14/p11 interaction we analyzed whether the peptide in addition to competing with annexin II for p11 binding (6Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) could also disrupt preformed and lipid bound annexin II-p11 complexes and therefore could be used as a function-interfering reagent. Liposome pelleting assays were performed to elucidate whether Ac1–14 is capable of liberating p11 from liposome-bound annexin II-p11 complexes. Experiments were carried out at a Ca2+concentration of 250 nm, i.e. at a level experienced in the GTPγS-stimulated endothelial cells (see Fig. 2). Under these conditions monomeric annexin II, which was expressed recombinantly in SF9 insect cells, fails to bind to the phospholipid liposomes, whereas the annexin II-p11 complex purified from porcine intestinal epithelium effectively interacts with the phospholipids and is co-pelleted together with the liposomes by centrifugation (Fig.3). This behavior of the complex is not affected by inclusion of a 500-fold molar access of the nonacetylated peptide N1–14, i.e. the sequence encompassing the N-terminal 14 residues of annexin II with a nonmodified N-terminal end. In contrast, the same amount of the acetylated peptide Ac1–14 significantly interferes with liposome binding of annexin II-p11. Fig.3 shows that preincubation with the Ac1–14 peptide effectively disrupts the complex resulting in a liberation from the liposome bound fraction of p11 which itself is incapable of binding phospholipids (not shown). Thus, the Ac1–14 peptide but not its non-acetylated counterpart can dissociate preexisting annexin II-p11 complexes and will therefore interfere with phospholipid binding and vesicle aggregating properties displayed by the complex. Given the complex-disrupting properties of Ac1–14 and the proposed involvement of annexin II-p11 in Ca2+-triggered secretion, we analyzed the effect of the peptide on regulated exocytosis in CPAE cells. Ac1–14 or N1–14 (as a control peptide) were given together with GTPγS, and the secretory responses in the respectively loaded cells were measured by tracking membrane capacitance. Only cells responding to the GTPγS stimulus with a transient Ca2+increase were considered in this analysis. The individual cells were loaded with 1 mm peptide to achieve an approximately 1000-fold molar excess over endogenous annexin II whose concentration in CPAE cells was calculated by semiquantitative Western blots to be approximately 1 μm (22Nilius B.

Fig.4 A shows that the nonacetylated control peptide has no effect on the GTPγS-induced capacitance increase. The presence of Ac1–14, however, markedly reduces the exocytotic response. Independent tracings of a number of individually loaded cells reveal that the reduction in capacitance increase elicited by Ac1–14 is approximately 50% and that the Ac1–14 effect is highly specific, as no reduction in GTPγS-induced capacitance increase is observed in the presence of N1–14 (Fig.4 B). To analyze whether the Ac1–14 peptide is acting on a Ca2+-dependent system or on a Ca2+-independent system activated by GTPγS, we performed membrane capacitance studies on cells loaded with the Ca2+chelator BAPTA. The results show that buffering intracellular Ca2+ at a low concentration results in a strongly reduced capacitance increase upon GTPγS treatment (Fig. 4, A andB). This indicates that the Ac1–14 peptide inhibits only the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis activated by GTPγS. Based on the Ca2+-regulated phospholipid binding properties of annexin II-p11, which are displayed at Ca2+concentrations found in GTPγS-activated CPAE cells, it seems likely that the complex acts at the level of secretory vesicles and/or at the level of the plasma membrane possibly by linking vesicles to one another or to the plasma membrane. To distinguish between these possibilities we analyzed in detail the intracellular localization of annexin II in CPAE cells and compared this to"

Its toxic effects include disruption of the immune, endocrine, and reproductive systems, impairment of fetal development, carcinogenicity, and lethality in rodents. Here, we report that TCDD induces apoptosis in two cultured human leukemic lymphoblastic T cell lines. This cell death was found not to be dependent on an aryl hydrocarbon receptor and to be inhibited by the inhibitor of tyrosine kinases and caspases. Apoptosis-linked c-Jun N-terminal kinase is rapidly activated in these cells by the treatment with TCDD. A dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun N-terminal kinase prevented cell death in the treatment with TCDD. Furthermore, TCDD decreases the Bcl-2 protein level in these cell lines. These findings will help in the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying TCDD-mediated immunotoxicity. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a common environmental pollutant causing public concern.

Birnbaum L.S. Toxicology. 1995; 102: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The adverse biological effects of TCDD seen in experimental animals include immune, reproductive, and developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, wasting syndrome, chloracne, and lethality (2Huff J. Lucier G. Tritscher A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 343-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). While the immunotoxic effects of TCDD have been well characterized in the rodent model, little data are available for humans. The thymic atrophy caused by TCDD in rodents is mediated by a selective killing of immature thymocytes, although the exact mechanism remains unknown. In the rat (3McConkey D.J. Hartzeli P. Duddy S.K. Hakansson H. Orrenius S. Science. 1988; 242: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and mouse (4Rhile M.J. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P.S. Toxicology. 1996; 110: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) immature thymocytes treated with TCDD (in vitro) have been reported to die due to apoptosis, although other studies have produced contradictory results (5Silverstone A.J. Frazier D.E. Fiore N.C. Soults J.A. Gasciewz T.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 126: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the demonstration of this effect in vivo has met with only limited success. The lack of a cell culture system in which toxicity can be readily detected and shown in a regulated manner has hindered efforts to understand the intracellular and molecular events by which TCDD induces apoptosis. It has been assumed that all the biological effects of TCDD are mediated through the Ah receptor (1DeVito M.J. Birnbaum L.S. Toxicology. 1995; 102: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a ligand-activated member of the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors (6Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe N. Chujoh Y.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, not all the biological effects of TCDD can be explained using this receptor-based model. Thus while it is clear that TCDD is highly toxic to mammals, the cellular mechanisms by which TCDD exerts its toxic effects are obscure. We now describe a cell culture system derived from human T cell lymphomas that provides unique advantages for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of TCDD. The idea for this culture system came to us when we observed, during our recent studies of TCDD, that, when the human leukemic lymphoblastic T cell line L-MAT (8Morita S. Tsuchiya S. Fujie H. Itano M. Ohashi Y. Minegishi M. Imaizumi M. Endo M. Takano N. Konno T. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 102-105PubMed Google Scholar) was exposed to TCDD, the cells underwent morphological changes and eventual apoptosis. Using this cell culture system, we can now more fully investigate the role of the Ah receptor in the mechanism of TCDD-mediated apoptosis, which has hitherto been difficult with the use of human tissues. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1% streptomycin at 37 °C, in 95% air, 5% CO2. Treatment of cells with TCDD was carried out as follows. Exponentially growing cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were collected, and fresh medium was added. In this condition, cells were grown for another 4–6 h at 37 °C. Then, cells were collected and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were incubated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium either in the presence of TCDD or in an equal volume of solvent Me2SO (concentration never exceeded the 0.1% level). Cells were harvested at different time points for the apoptosis assay. Cells (1.0 × 106) were collected and suspended in 500 μl of 100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 0.5 mm EDTA, then incubated overnight at 37 °C. Soluble cytoplasmic DNA was collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C, intact chromosomal DNA remaining in the pellet. The supernatant containing soluble apoptotic DNA was pelleted using isopropanol. The pelleted DNA was resuspended in 25 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The DNA (5.0 μl) was applied to 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cells were collected (0.5 × 106 to 1.0 × 106 cells) by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, then washed once with PBS. Cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, then incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Fixation solution was removed by centrifugation and washing with PBS. Fixed cells were resuspended in 15 μl of bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33258) solution (16 μg/ml in PBS), then incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Stained cells were placed (10 μl) on a glass slide and, under a fluorescence microscope, 500 cells per slide were scored for the incidence of apoptotic changes in chromatin. Cells with two or more chromatin fragments were considered apoptotic. Electron microscopy was done essentially as described elsewhere (9Minegishi M. Minegishi N. Yanagisawa T. Tsuchiya S. Tezuka H. Kaji M. Nakamura M. Hayashi Y. Konno T. Leuk. Res. 1995; 19: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from the cells by the method of Chomczyniski and Sacchi (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). The prepared RNA (0.5–5.0 μg) was reverse-transcribed (to synthesize cDNA) by means of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences) using a random hexamer. Primer sequences were from published sources and were as follows; Ah receptor, TTGGCTTTGTTTGCGATAGCT and CTGCATGTGTCTGATGTCTTC; and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), TCCATCAGCATCTATGTGGC and TTCATCCCTATTCTTCGCTAC. PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 20.0 μl containing 0.1 volume of the RT sample, 2.0 μl of 10× Taq buffer, 500 μmof each dNTP in the presence of 1.0 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Amplification was performed by way of the following profiles. For CYP1A1 (30 cycles) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (25 cycles), 4 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C before the first cycle, 1 min for denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C for annealing, and 1 min and 30 s for primer extension at 72 °C, then finally 10 min at 72 °C after the last cycle. For the Ah receptor (35 cycles), the procedure was as for CYP1A1, except that annealing was at 60 °C, and 2 min with 5-s extensions were used for primer extension at 72 °C. The PCR products (5.0 μl) were then subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. The solid phase JNK assay was carried out by using a glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) fusion protein coupled to glutathione beads as a substrate according to a published report (11Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure JNK activity in cell lysates, 1 × 106 cells were incubated for various period of time with various stimuli and then lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fifty micrograms of cellular extract were mixed with glutathione agarose beads to which 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) were bound, then incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm vanadate, once with 100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm LiCl, and once with final wash buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4). The beads were then incubated in kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 20 μm ATP, and 3.3 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. L-MAT cells were cotransfected with pCAG plasmid expressing β-galactosidase and a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1, pcDNA3-Flag-JNK1(APF) (a gift from Dr. Roger J. Davies) (12Chen Y-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davies R.J. Tan T-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), by the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) instructions. After 48 h of transfection with expression plasmids, cells were treated with 20 nm TCDD for 4 h for the detection of apoptosis in β-galactosidase-positive cells. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed, and incubated with anti-β-galactosidase antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) at 1:500 dilution for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at 4 °C. For staining of DNA, Hoechst dye 33258 at a concentration of 16 μg/ml was added during the second antibody incubation period. After washing, cells were mounted and examined under a Leica DM LB fluorescent microscope. Cells were treated with 20 nm TCDD for different time periods, and cell extracts were prepared as described for JNK assay. Protein (100 μg) was electrophoresed in 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was immunostained with anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody, clone Bcl-2-100 (Sigma), and was developed with an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Amersham International PLC). Treatment of L-MAT cells with 20 nm TCDD in serum-free culture medium resulted in an apoptotic DNA ladder consisting of 180-base pair fragments in the agarose gel (Fig. 1 A). As a control, DNA was prepared from an equal volume of solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide)-treated cells. A DNA ladder was routinely observed within 4 h of treatment with TCDD. We extracted only the degraded DNA, not the intact chromosomal DNA, from apoptotic as well as nonapoptotic cells. This DNA extraction method simplified sample loading on to the gel. Sample loading was optimized as follows. Samples of soluble apoptotic DNA obtained from the same number of cells were dissolved in equal volumes of TE buffer, and the same volume of sample was applied to each lane. This TCDD-mediated apoptosis was not restricted to L-MAT cells; another lymphoblastic T cell line, Jurkat, also showed the characteristics of apoptosis when treated with TCDD (Fig. 1 A). Incubation of L-MAT cells with 20 nm TCDD also resulted in the appearance of morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis upon staining with the DNA-specific fluorochrome bis-benzimide (Fig. 1 B). These changes include condensation of chromatin, its compaction along the periphery of the nucleus, and segmentation of the nucleus. The early stages of the cytoplasmic and nuclear morphology typical of apoptosis were revealed by electron micrography (Fig.1 C). The time course of changes in L-MAT cell viability was measured by means of a trypan blue exclusion assay. An increase in the number of nonviable cells became apparent at 2–4 h after the addition of TCDD to the culture medium and, at 8 h, nearly 90% of the cells exhibited a loss of viability (Fig. 1 D). This apoptotic effect was observed with doses of TCDD as low as 1 nm, and a plateau of nearly 90% cell death at 8 h was observed with doses of 20 nm or more TCDD (Fig. 1 E). To examine the specificity of TCDD-mediated apoptosis, we tested other Ah receptor ligands for the induction of apoptosis in L-MAT cells. A close structural analog, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), failed to induce apoptosis at a similar concentration (Fig.2 A). Another Ah receptor ligand, β-naphthoflavone, also failed to induce apoptosis even at a 1000-fold molar excess (20 μm) in this cell line (Fig.2 A). These results demonstrate both the specificity of action of TCDD and the usefulness of this system as an in vitro model for assaying TCDD-mediated toxicity. Some of the initial evidence suggested that apoptosis is caused by an active process, and that new protein synthesis is required for apoptosis (13Oppenheim R.W. Prevette D. Tytell M. Homma S. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, it was subsequently shown that a macromolecular synthesis inhibitor failed to block apoptosis in many systems and, indeed, could even induce this process in many situations (14Martin S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 141-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether macromolecular synthesis is essential for TCDD-induced cell death, L-MAT cells were pretreated for 2 h with CHX or actinomycin D, to block new protein synthesis. Then, 2 h later, TCDD was added to the cells. Actinomycin D itself proved to be cytotoxic to L-MAT cells (data not shown). Treatment with 20 nm TCDD and CHX (10 μg/ml) failed to inhibit apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). However, CHX was found to increase the sensitivity of the cells to TCDD, although CHX alone did not have any effect on this cell line (Fig.2 B). We also confirmed that, in our hands dexamethasone-induced cell death is inhibited by CHX (data not shown). We thought it possible that CYP1A1-mediated oxygen radicals might be the major cause of the apoptosis induced by TCDD in these cell lines. To test this possibility, we checked the inducibility of CYP1A1 in L-MAT and Jurkat cells. In fact, RT-PCR revealed that CYP1A1 is not inducible in either of these two cell lines by 2 nm TCDD, although we could routinely use this concentration of TCDD to induce CYP1A1 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 A). It could be argued that the serum-free culture conditions used for the apoptosis assay had already induced CYP1A1. In an attempt to rule out this possibility, we prepared RNA from dying cells (20 nmTCDD-treated apoptotic cells), then performed RT-PCR. As expected, CYP1A1 was not induced during the apoptosis (Fig. 3 B). These results clearly indicate that CYP1A1-mediated oxygen radicals are not the cause of the apoptosis produced by TCDD. The finding that inhibition of protein synthesis failed to block the induction of apoptosis by TCDD in L-MAT cells (Fig. 2) raised the possibility that direct transcriptional activation of death gene(s) by the Ah receptor is not required for the induction of apoptosis by TCDD. Like glucocorticoid and retinoic acid receptors (15Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the Ah receptor might cause transcriptional repression of some survival genes in TCDD-mediated apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the expression level of the Ah receptor in our cell lines. In fact, using RT-PCR, we could not detect any mRNA for the Ah receptor in either the L-MAT or Jurkat cell line (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, HepG2 cells showed the presence of Ah receptor mRNA in both TCDD-treated and nontreated samples (Fig. 3 A). This result was verified by three independent experiments, with the RT-PCR standardized using different numbers of cycles (25–35 cycles) and using different amounts of mRNA (range, 0.5 to 5.0 μg). The results of RT-PCR using mRNA from dying cells were essentially the same as those described above (Fig. 3 B). Next, we tried to determine which signaling events that might mediate the apoptosis caused by TCDD in these cell lines. Besides transforming the Ah receptor, TCDD activates protein-tyrosine kinases in responsive cells (16Ma X. Mufti N.A. Babish J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 5965-5971Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Bombick D.W. Jankun J. Tullis K. Matsumura F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4128-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, genistein, a selective protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been found to block apoptosis (18Bronte V. Macino A. Zambon A. Rosato S. Mandruzzato P. Zanovello P. Collavo D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Migita K. Eguchi K. Kawabe Y. Mizokami A. Tsukada A. Nagataki S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether protein-tyrosine kinase is involved in TCDD-mediated apoptosis, we used genistein to try to block the apoptosis produced by TCDD. A range of different concentrations of genistein was used (10–50 μg/ml) in L-MAT cells and, as expected, 50 μg/ml genistein completely blocked the induction of cell death by TCDD (Figs.4 and 5). Genistein alone had no effect in these cell lines (data not shown).Figure 5Dose dependence of inhibition of TCDD-mediated apoptosis by inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinase and caspases.

Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar, 21Nicholoson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Valliancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallank K. Gareace Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yami T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether proteolytic activity of caspases might also be involved in TCDD-mediated apoptosis. In L-MAT cells, the apoptosis triggered by TCDD was strongly inhibited by the caspases inhibitor, carbobenzoxyl-l-aspartyl-α-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxy] methane (Z-Asp-CH2-DCB) (22Mashima T. Naito M. Kataoka S. Kawai S. Tsuro T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Figs. 4 and 5). We then tested other protease inhibitors: (i) the calpain inhibitor, leupeptin; (ii) the classical serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and (iii) the cysteine protease inhibitor, antipain. However, all three failed to inhibit TCDD-mediated cell death (data not shown). In neuronal (23Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar) and hematopoietic (24Verheiz M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis D.W. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar) model systems, apoptosis induced by stress was linked to the sustained activation of JNK. Therefore, JNK activity was measured upon TCDD treatment in L-MAT cells. Induction of JNK activity was observed within 30 min upon TCDD treatment in L-MAT cells (Fig. 6). The peak activity of JNK was observed 90 min after TCDD treatment, and similar results were obtained in Jurkat cells (data not shown). These results revealed that TCDD-mediated apoptotic signals strongly induced JNK activity, which coincides with cell death. To determine the role of JNK in TCDD-mediated cell death in these cells, we tested the effect of interfering with JNK function by transient expression of a dominant-negative mutant of JNK (APF) in L-MAT cells. To identify the transfected cells, cells were transfected with β-galactosidase-expressing vector, pCAG, with or without the dominant-negative mutant of JNK. The cells were stained with anti-β-galactosidase antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. For the identification of the apoptotic cells, in which the DNA was degraded, nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye 33258. In β-galactosidase-expressing cells, the dominant-negative JNK should be expressed, and normal JNK should be inhibited. Thus, the survival rate of transfected cells was determined as the percentage of apoptotic cells in β-galactosidase expressing cells in TCDD and Me2SO-treated cells. Expression of dominant-negative mutant of JNK blocked TCDD-mediated apoptosis (Fig.7), suggests a direct role of JNK signal transduction pathway in the TCDD-mediated cell death in these cell lines. We next asked whether TCDD-mediated apoptosis in these cells is associated with modulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. Using Western blot analysis, we found that Bcl-2 protein levels decreased as early as 2 h after onset of culture with TCDD and then declined further by 6 h of culture (Fig. 8). For a long time it has been thought that TCDD is not toxic to cultured cells (25Knutson J.C. Poland A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1980; 54: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26GreenLee W.F. Dold K.M. Irons R. Osborne M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1985; 79: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the data reported in this study demonstrate for the first time that TCDD does cause cell death in cultured lymphoblastic T cell lines, and that this cell death exhibits distinct apoptotic features. The classically accepted morphological features of apoptosis including nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic condensation, the formation of apoptotic bodies, membrane blebs, and loss of cell volume, were seen following TCDD treatment. These extensive cyto-architectural modifications, in conjunction with the induction of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis, established that TCDD is indeed toxic to at least these cultured cells and that the cell death mediated by TCDD is classical apoptosis. Since caspases are involved in many kinds of apoptosis in higher eukaryotes (21Nicholoson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Valliancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallank K. Gareace Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yami T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar), the inhibition of TCDD-mediated cell death by a selective caspase inhibitors also suggested that this cell death is an example of apoptosis. Possibly, the apoptosis mediated by TCDD may play an important role in the immunotoxicity of this agent. The induction of the xenobiotic metabolic enzyme, CYP1A1, by TCDDin vivo and in vitro has been well characterized in many experimental systems (27Whitlock J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 808-818Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found that induction of CYP1A1 in the mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1, produces oxygen radicals which then cause oxidative DNA damage (28Park J-Y.K. Shigenaga M.K. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2322-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In fact, oxygen radicals are involved in the apoptosis induced by many kinds of extracellular stimuli (29Korsmeyer S.J. Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Veis-Novack D.J. Linette G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, we found that CYP1A1 is not inducible in these cell lines by TCDD, and consequently we can say that CYP1A1-mediated formation of oxygen radicals is not involved in the apoptosis studied here. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that oxygen radicals are generated from other sources by TCDD in these cell lines; such oxygen radicals could be involved in this apoptosis. That the Ah receptor is not required for the TCDD-mediated induction of apoptosis in these cell lines was established by the following findings: 1) ligands other than TCDD did not cause apoptosis at doses sufficient to activate the Ah receptor (30Harris M. Piskorska-Plisczyznska J. Zacharewski T. Romkes M. Safe S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4531-4535PubMed Google Scholar, 31Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 924-938PubMed Google Scholar, 32Berghard A. Gardin K. Toftgard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21086-21090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2) CYP1A1 was not inducible in these cell lines (i.e. a functional Ah receptor is not present in these cell lines), and (3McConkey D.J. Hartzeli P. Duddy S.K. Hakansson H. Orrenius S. Science. 1988; 242: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) the mRNA for the Ah receptor was not present in either of the two cell lines tested. We stably transformed the human Ah receptor gene in both L-MAT and Jurkat cells and checked the kinetics of the TCDD-mediated apoptosis. As we expected, there were no differences between the Ah receptor-transformed and nontransformed cells with respect to the kinetics of TCDD-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). These findings are well supported by other studies. For example, in Hepa-1 cells, TCDD has been found to induce c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD mRNA (33Puga A. Nebert D.W. Carrier F. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This induction also occurred in Ah receptor-less and Ah receptor nuclear translocator mutant cell lines (c2 mutant cells and c4 mutant cells, respectively). This suggests that an Ah receptor-TCDD interaction may not be involved in some of the actions of TCDD (34Hoffer A. Chang C.Y. Puga A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ah receptor is present in all the mammalian species so far checked, but the binding affinity of TCDD for the Ah receptor differs from one species to another (35Gasiewicz T.A. Rucci G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 90-98PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the actual binding affinity does not always correlate with the TCDD-mediated toxicity in a given species (1DeVito M.J. Birnbaum L.S. Toxicology. 1995; 102: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, only two strains of mice (C57BL/6J and DBA/2) have shown a good relationship between sensitivity to TCDD (in terms of induced toxicity) and Ah receptor binding affinity (36Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that besides the TCDD-Ah receptor interaction, additional TCDD-activated signal-transduction pathway(s) may also play an important role in the toxicity of this agent. One recent report suggested that apoptotic machinery is constitutively present in virtually all cell types in mammals, and that on-going transcription is required in some cases for the activation of signal transduction pathways to occur (37Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S.R. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that, in the present lymphoblastic T cell lines, TCDD probably activates only the preexisting death pathway, new protein synthesis not being required. However, we cannot rule out the other possibility purely on the basis of the effects of CHX treatment on these cells. CHX has been proven to be an activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinases or stress-activated protein kinases, which are directly involved in stress-activated apoptosis in T cell lines (24Verheiz M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis D.W. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). The present finding that CHX did not inhibit apoptosis is in contrast to an earlier report concerning TCDD-mediated apoptosis in a rat thymocyte culture (3McConkey D.J. Hartzeli P. Duddy S.K. Hakansson H. Orrenius S. Science. 1988; 242: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the discrepancy is that we used human cultured lymphoblastic T cell lines, whereas the previous study used immature rat thymocytes. In keratinocytes, genistein, a selective inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, completely blocks the induction of CYP1A1 by TCDD (38Gardin K. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23800-23807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and induction of transforming growth factor-β2 by TCDD is also inhibited by genistein (39Lee D.C. Barlow K.D. Gaido K.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, genistein completely blocked the apoptosis mediated by TCDD in the absence of the Ah receptor. Depending on the cellular context, tyrosine kinases transmit either cell survival or cell death signals. Long term exposure of the cell to protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors can itself cause apoptosis in some systems (40McCabe M.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); however, we used genistein for a relatively short period of time. Our results suggest that, at least in the present cell lines, activation of protein-tyrosine kinase is essential for TCDD-mediated apoptosis, and perhaps for some of the other toxic effects of the TCDD, notably its immunotoxicity. The connections between TCDD signaling and the apoptosis were explored in this study. This motivated the examination of the role of the stress-response signal transduction pathway in the TCDD-mediated apoptosis in these cell lines. Stress-activated protein kinase JNK is rapidly activated in these cell lines by TCDD. The JNK pathway is well known to respond to extracellular stimuli that induce apoptosis, such as ceramide, granzyme B, interleukin-1, UV, and γ-radiation (23Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar, 24Verheiz M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis D.W. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar,41Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 42Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 43Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Latter, it has been found that JNK mediated this apoptotic process. Sustained JNK activity is up-regulated severalfold in these cell lines by TCDD. This result clearly demonstrates that TCDD treatment regulates the well characterized stress response pathway. The mechanism by which TCDD treatment triggers the sustained JNK activation remains to be elucidated. A dominant-negative mutant of JNK blocked the TCDD-mediated cell death in these cells. This further supports the notion of the role of a JNK signal transduction pathway in the TCDD-mediated apoptosis. The central role of Bcl-2 in apoptosis was well established by numerous studies (44Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 45Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modification of Bcl-2 has a major impact in apoptosis. Activation of the Bcl-2 by proteases degradation has been implicated as a mechanism by which the death signal can neutralize the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 and enhance cell death (46Cheng E.H. Y Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). We found evidence that apoptosis mediated by TCDD is preceded by down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein in these cell lines. These findings suggest that down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein is one of the factors playing an important role in the pathway of TCDD-induced apoptosis of these cells. In summary, the results of the present study will help in the understanding of the molecular mechanism by which TCDD exerts its toxic actions in humans. It is tempting to speculate that, in mammalian species, the immunotoxicity of TCDD is partly due to a direct action on signal transduction pathways (i.e. an action independent of the Ah receptor), and partly to an action that does depend on the formation of Ah receptor-TCDD complexes. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TCDD-mediated toxicity will help in assessing the risk to humans of exposure to TCDD. We thank Dr. A. Yasui for a constructive review of the manuscript."

These peptides act via seven transmembrane G-protein-linked receptors coupled to cAMP elevation, phospholipase C activation, intracellular Ca2+ release, and/or of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Here we investigated the action of these peptides on the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a. PHI and VIP inhibited proliferation at concentrations as low as 10−13m and 10−10m, respectively. In contrast, PACAP action was biphasic, with stimulation occurring at subnanomolar doses and inhibition at higher doses. Peptide actions were studied further by measuring cAMP and ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity and by assessing3H-thymidine incorporation in conjunction with a panel of signal transduction pathways inhibitors. The data obtained indicated that the PHI-inhibitory and PACAP-stimulatory activities were mediated by corresponding changes in activity of the MAP kinase pathway and independent of protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). In contrast, the inhibitory actions of VIP and PACAP were specifically blocked by antagonists of PKA. Northern blot analysis revealed gene expression for only the PACAP-preferring (PAC1) receptor. However, binding experiments using 125I-labeled PACAP27, PHI, and VIP, demonstrated the presence of PACAP-preferring sites, bivalent VIP/PACAP sites, and PHI-binding sites that did not interact with VIP. The studies demonstrate potent regulatory actions of PACAP, PHI, and VIP on neuroblastoma cell proliferation which appear to be mediated by multiple subsets of receptors which differentially couple to MAP kinase and PKA signaling pathways.

Expression of the VIP and PACAP genes results in the biosynthesis of peptide precursors, which also give rise to PHI/PHM and PACAP-related peptide (PRP), respectively (2Itoh N. Obata K. Yanaihara N.

Moreover the finding of functional VIP and PACAP receptors expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines and freshly excised tumor resections suggests that these neuropeptides may be involved in autocrine/paracrine loops (5Muller J-M.

In contrast, much less information is available concerning physiological actions of PHI and PRP (18Murthy K.S. Zhang K.M. Jin J.G. Grider J.R. Maklouf G.M. Am. J.

High affinity receptors for VIP-related peptides have been identified in numerous tissues from several species. At least three different receptors have been characterized in terms of sequence, peptide affinity profiles, tissue expression, and signaling pathways. These belong to the seven-transmembrane-spanning domain, G-protein-coupled receptor family. Two of these recognize VIP and PACAP with equal high affinity, VPAC1 and VPAC2 (22Ishihara T. Shigemoto R.

In addition, at least seven splice variants have been reported for the PACAP receptor (25Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L.

Cloned and expressed forms of these variants have been reported to differ in their ability to bind PACAP analogs and in their coupling to signaling pathways. In contrast, no splice variant has yet been described for VIP receptors. VPAC1 and VPAC2, and PAC1 receptors are commonly expressed alone or in combination in neuroblastomas (6Vertongen P. Devalck C.

The cAMP-dependent pathway mediates many of the actions of VIP and PACAP, but many recent reports indicate the involvement of nitric oxide, phospholipase C (PLC), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), and MAP kinase pathways (7Chistophe J.

In this study, we studied the ability of VIP, PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and PHI to modulate proliferation of the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a. We also determined if changes in cAMP content and MAP Kinase activity were associated with these proliferative actions, and if these actions were sensitive to specific pathway inhibitors (33Chijiwa T.

Finally, we analyzed receptor expression by Northern analysis and by radiolabeled ligand displacement. Neuro2a cells were maintained in 75 cm2 flasks (Falcon) in 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) under a 5% CO2, 95% air controlled atmosphere at 37 °C. Medium was changed every 3 days. Passages were performed after trypsinization (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA, Life Technologies, Inc.). The actions of VIP-related peptides (purchased from Sigma) on cell proliferation were initially investigated using a tetrazolium-derived (MTS) colorimetric assay (cell titer96 from Promega) as described previously (17Vertongen P. Camby I. Darro F. Kiss R. Robberecht P. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, subcultures were performed in 96-well plates seeded with 8,000 cells/well. 24 h after seeding, vehicle or peptides were added from 10× stock solutions. After 48 h of peptide treatment, the MTS proliferation assay was initiated by incubation of the cells in 100 μl of fresh medium for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by addition of 20 μl of reagent solution to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, absorbency at 490 nm was determined on a 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad). For 3H-thymidine incorporation assay, cells were seeded in 24-well plates (80,000 cells/well) in 1 ml of medium and cultured for 24 h. Medium was then replaced with fresh serum-free medium. After 1.5 h at 37 °C, cells were preincubated for an additional hour with vehicle or signal transduction inhibitors (H89 and GF109203x from Calbiochem, and PD98059 from New England Biolabs). Peptides were then added, and 1 h later, 1 μCi/well 3H-thymidine was also added. Four hours later, 3H-thymidine incorporation was determined by TCA precipitation. Cells (80,000/well) were cultured for 3 days in 24-well plates. Medium was replaced with serum-free medium with or without 1 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX). After 15 min incubation at 37 °C, peptides were added and incubated for 15 min. Cell lysis and cAMP radioimmunoassay (NEN Life Science Products) were performed as described (17Vertongen P. Camby I. Darro F. Kiss R. Robberecht P. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Neuro2a cells were cultured in eight flasks (75 cm2) and harvested at 90% confluency with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin was neutralized with the tissue culture medium (containing 8% serum), and then cells were centrifuged and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequent isolation of poly(A)-selected mRNA was carried out as described (36Waschek J.A. Richards M.L. Bravo D.T. Cancer Lett. 1995; 92: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Receptor probes and hybridization conditions were exactly as described previously (29Waschek J.A. Lelievre V. Bravo D.T. Nguyen T. Muller J-M. Peptides. 1997; 18: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because 125I-PHI is not commercially available, PHI was radioiodinated with the chloramine-T technique as described previously (37Paul S. Chou J. Kubota E. Life Sci. 1987; 41: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Iodinated peptide was separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Spectraphysics) using a 5 μm VYDAC C18 column (Interchrom, France). A gradient of acetonitrile, H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was required for elution. Fractions containing 125I PHI were evaporated under nitrogen and stored at -20 °C. Cells were seeded at 80,000/ml/well in 24-well dishes and cultured for 3 days. Fifteen min before the initiation of the binding, cells were incubated in fresh medium at 37 °C. Culture medium was removed and replaced with 270 μl of cold binding medium containing 30,000 cpm of radiotracer (125I-VIP and 125I-PACAP, 2200 Ci/mmol, from NEN Life Science Products) and 30 μl of specified concentrations of unlabeled peptides (for more details, see Ref. 13Lelièvre V. Becq-Giraudon L. Meunier A-C. Muller J-M. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Radioiodinated PHI binding experiments were performed on intact cells in suspension, using a slightly different procedure to increase the sensitivity. In brief, nonconfluent cultures were harvested by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C in a phosphate buffer (0.05 m, pH 7.4) containing 0.53 mm EDTA. Cells were counted and aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes at a concentration of 1.2 million cells per tube. Cells were then quickly centrifuged, pellets were reconstituted in the binding buffer containing 35,000 cpm of 125I-PHI and specified concentrations of the unlabeled ligands, and then cells were incubated under shaking. The incubation times were determined by time course experiments conducted at 4 °C and then fixed at 120, 150, and 210 min for VIP, PACAP, and PHI displacements, respectively. Incubation was stopped with a quick rinse with 2 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, followed by cell lysis in 0.5m NaOH solution. Extracts were transferred into 5-ml tubes, and radioactivity was counted using a γ-counter (Wallac). Cells were cultured for 24 h in 24-well plates (150,000 cells/well). After a quick rinse, cells were incubated for 12 h in the presence of culture medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were then rinsed twice with serum-free medium and incubated in this medium for 120 min. PD98059 (30 μm) or vehicle was added for another hour and then peptides for 10 min at 37 °C. The incubation was stopped by replacement of the stimulation buffer with 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmorthovanadate supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, and leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain (10 μg/ml each) (Sigma). ERK activity was determined by the Biotrack p42/p44 MAP kinase enzyme assay kit according to the recommendation of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was determined by the Bradford assay with Bio-Rad reagents and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Both MTS (Fig.1) and thymidine incorporation assay (Fig. 2) demonstrated that VIP and PHI were potent inhibitors of Neuro2a cell proliferation. The MTS assay, carried out at the end of a 2-day period of drug stimulation, indicated that maximal inhibition by VIP was reached at about 10 nm, whereas PHI action reached near maximal values at concentrations in the subnanomolar range (Fig. 1). PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 induced a biphasic response: a significant stimulation at very low concentrations (0.1 and 1 pm, respectively) and then an inhibition at the highest doses of peptides. In subsequent experiments, thymidine incorporation over a 5-h period after initiation of drug treatment was used to assess the effect of peptides on DNA synthesis. This assay produced qualitatively similar results, although the effects were generally shifted to higher concentrations (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Thymidine incorporation assays in Neuro2a cells stimulated by increasing concentrations of neuropeptides. Cells were stimulated with peptides for 5 h, and assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” A,effects of neuropeptides on 3H-thymidine incorporation in the absence of inhibitors.

The PKA inhibitor H89 (20 μm) (33Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) specifically abolished the inhibition of DNA synthesis by 10 nm and 1 μm PACAP-27 and PACAP-38, resulting in a stimulation of 3H-thymidine incorporation at all concentrations 0.1 nm and above (Fig.2, compare panel A versus panel B). This suggests that in control cultures, activation of PKA by higher concentrations of PACAP masked a positive proliferative response that could otherwise only be seen with lower concentrations of PACAP. H89 also blocked the antiproliferative action of VIP but clearly did not block the inhibitory action of PHI. Nearly identical effects on neuropeptide responses were seen when cultures were treated with another PKA inhibitor, RT-cAMP (200 μm, data not shown). In contrast to the effects of PKA inhibitors, treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (30 μm) (34Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) completely suppressed the PACAP-induced stimulation (Fig. 2 A versus2C). Paradoxically PD98059 inhibited the antiproliferative action of PHI but appeared not to affect the antiproliferative actions of VIP or high concentrations of PACAP. The blockade of PHI action by PD98059 implies that inhibitory action of this peptide required a basal level of MAP kinase activity. DNA synthesis was in fact inhibited by PD98059 in control cultures (Fig. 2 C, second column) implying that a MAP kinase pathway coupled to growth stimulation was indeed active in these cells under basal conditions. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X (10 μm) (35Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also strongly inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation in control cultures, but did not appear to interfere with the neuropeptide modulation of DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 A versus 2D). Intracellular cAMP content was specifically and dose-dependently increased by addition of PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP, either in the absence (Fig.3 A) or presence (Fig.3 B) of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (1 μm). No elevation of the cAMP levels was detected when cells were stimulated by PHI alone (Fig. 3 A). Indeed, only a slight increase in cAMP content was observed in the presence of IBMX at the highest concentrations of PHI. Changes in ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity were measured at the selected peptide concentrations shown in Fig.4. For PACAP-27, the peak of activation was reached at 1 pm, whereas peak activation by PACAP-38 was shifted to about 0.1 nm. In contrast, VIP did not modify MAP kinase activity at any concentration from 1 pmto 1 μm. PHI at 1 nm, on the other hand, significantly inhibited MAP kinase activity by about 25%. The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 reduced ERK1/2 activity in control cells (Fig. 4,second bar), indicating that some basal activity of the MAP kinase pathway existed in these cells, perhaps from active compounds in serum (medium contained 0.2% FBS, see “Materials and Methods”). Consistent with this possibility, the PHI action was more pronounced (78% inhibition) when experiments were carried out in medium containing 2% FBS (data not shown). Northern analysis indicated that the PACAP-preferring PAC1 receptor gene was expressed in Neuro2a cells, whereas neither VPAC1 nor VPAC2 receptor gene expression could be detected under these conditions (Fig. 5, lane 1). The specificity and integrity of hybridization was tested using internal positive and negative controls given by Fig. 5,lanes 2 though 4 (36Waschek J.A. Richards M.L. Bravo D.T. Cancer Lett. 1995; 92: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar): rat pancreatic tumor cell line AR4–2J (positive for PAC1), human breast tumor cell line T47D (positive for VPAC1), and mouse olfactory bulb (positive for PAC1 and VPAC2). Binding sites for VIP and PACAP in Neuro2a cells were assessed, using commercially available radiotracers, and for PHI, using chloramine T-labeled radioiodinated peptide (see “Materials and Methods”). Preliminary studies of time-course binding demonstrated that the optimized incubation times at 4 °C were 120, 150, and 210 min for 125I-labeled VIP, PACAP, and PHI, respectively. Preliminary saturation experiments and Scatchard analyses were also performed and suggested the presence of one binding site for VIP (KD, 0.35 nm; Bmax, 1450 sites/cell) and at least two different sites for PACAP: high affinity sites (KD, 2.1 pm/Bmax, 980 sites/cells) and low affinity sites (Kd, 60 nm/Bmax, 18,200 sites/cell). Increasing concentrations of different analogs (VIP, PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and PHI) displaced the binding of radioiodinated VIP (Fig.6 A). Curves were fit to the sigmoidal equation, revealing Hill values close to 1 for all the tested analogues. Moreover VIP, PACAP-27, and PACAP-38 displaced125I-VIP binding with a high affinity (VIP, IC50 1.2 ± 0.35 nm; PACAP-27, IC50 0.42 ± 0.6 nm; PACAP-38, IC50 3.6 ± 0.5 nm), whereas PHI exhibited a very low affinity (IC50 1.2 ± 0.8 mm). Data from 125I-PACAP binding displacement experiments fit well to a two-site equation, suggesting the presence of high- (IC50 about 1 pm; 77 ± 0.8% binding total) and low-affinity sites (IC50 > 1 nm; 23 ± 0.8% of the total binding) (Fig. 6 B). PACAP-38 (IC50 3.7 ± 0.4 pm/5.7 ± 1.8 nm) appeared to be more potent than PACAP-27 (IC50 20 ± 0.3 pm/52 ± 2.3 nm) to displace the radioligand binding. VIP and PHI only partially displaced the total 125I-PACAP binding (VIP, 25 ± 2.5%; PHI, 37 ± 2.0%), with an IC50 of 25 ± 0.6 and 62 ± 0.8 pm, respectively. Hill slopes from displacement curves by VIP and PHI were 1.02 ± 0.3 and 0.97 ± 0.17, respectively. Displacement curves of 125I-PHI binding by different analogues (native PHI, VIP, and PACAP isoforms) also suggested a multiple site system in Neuro2a cells. Three different PHI binding sites appeared to be present based on the capacity of these analogues to displace the binding of 125I-PHI (Fig. 6 C). Displacement by native PHI resulted in curve characterized by a Hill slope only 0.33 (IC50 0.2 ± 0.45 nm). VIP displaced only 55% of total 125I-PHI binding with IC50 51 ± 1.65 pm (Hill slope: 0.71). PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 displaced almost completely (87%) the PHI binding. Data fit to a two-site model indicated high affinity sites (IC50 PACAP27, 4.7 ± 2.1 pm; PACAP38, 40 ± 2.36; representativity: 56%) and low affinity binding sites (IC50 PACAP-27, 61 ± 5.21 nm; PACAP-38, 60 ± 6.54 nm; representativity: 44%). Finally about 13% of radioiodinated PHI was displaced only by native PHI. We demonstrate here that VIP, PHI, and PACAP potently regulate the proliferation of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. VIP and PHI inhibited proliferation, PHI being considerably more potent. PACAP, on the other hand, stimulated proliferation at low concentrations and inhibited proliferation at higher concentrations. These observations led us to hypothesize that multiple receptors were present in these cells, coupling to different growth-related signaling pathways. An analysis of proliferation and intracellular responses to peptides in the presence and absence of specific signaling pathway inhibitors, and an assessment of binding sites using radiolabeled peptides strongly supported this hypothesis. Of particular interest was the anti-proliferative action of PHI. Although PHI acts as a moderate to weak agonist on all well known forms of VIP receptors, its anti-proliferative action in the present system was more than 100-fold more potent than VIP. One explanation for this finding is that PHI acted on a unique receptor that preferred PHI to VIP. Consistent with this possibility was the fact that these peptides appeared to act by different signaling pathways. The action of VIP (but not PHI) was associated with an increase in cAMP levels and was selectively blocked by inhibitors of PKA. In contrast, PHI action was uniquely associated with ERK1/2 inhibition and was selectively blocked by a MAP kinase pathway inhibitor. Finally, binding studies using125I-PHI as a tracer indicated the presence of up to two classes of high affinity receptors that selectively bound PHI over VIP. We also found the action of PACAP to be intriguing. Very low concentrations of this peptide (up to 0.1 nm) stimulated MAP kinase activity and proliferation, whereas higher PACAP concentrations, like VIP, stimulated cAMP production and inhibited proliferation. MAP kinase and PKA pathways were very likely involved in these opposing proliferative responses. Whereas the MEK1/2 inhibitor blocked the stimulation of proliferation observed at low PACAP doses (Fig. 2 C), blockade of PKA resulted in stimulation of proliferation at all PACAP doses (Fig. 2 B). Biphasic responses to peptides in this family have been reported in other systems. For example, VIP at 50 pm stimulated c-src activity and the proliferation of cultured retinal pigmented epithelial cells, whereas higher concentrations stimulated cAMP production and inhibited proliferation (38Koh S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, biphasic action of VIP on cell growth has been reported for Lo-Vo colonic carcinoma cells (39Yu, D., Seitz, P. K., Selvanayagam, P., Rajaraman, S., Townsend, C. M., Jr., and Cooper, C. W. Endocrinology, 131, 1188–1194.Google Scholar) and T98G glioblastoma cells (17Vertongen P. Camby I. Darro F. Kiss R. Robberecht P. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Northern analysis revealed expression of only the PACAP-preferring PAC1 receptor gene, whereas binding studies suggested the presence of multiple receptors that bind these peptides. One possible explanation is that receptors arising from alternatively spliced forms of PAC1 differentially bind and respond to these peptides. Several forms have been characterized (25Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 26Journot L. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), including one displaying a 21-amino acid deletion in the amino-terminal part of the receptor believed to be important for ligand binding. A cloned form of this latter receptor has been shown to differ slightly from the original receptor with respect to the relative binding affinities for PACAP-27 versus PACAP-38 (27Pantaloni C. Brabet P. Bilanges B. Dumuis A. Houssami S. Spengler D. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22146-22151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, the ability of this variant to bind VIP, PHI, or related peptides has not been reported. We tried to detect alternative transcripts corresponding to this region of the PAC1 receptor by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (27Pantaloni C. Brabet P. Bilanges B. Dumuis A. Houssami S. Spengler D. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22146-22151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Only the original form of receptor was identified in these experiments (data not shown). Alternatively, a low level of VPAC1 receptor expression (not detectable by Northern analysis) could potentially explain some of the actions of VIP and/or PHI because the rat VPAC1 binds PHI with an affinity only 3-fold lower than VIP. However, the considerably more potent action of PHI on growth (Fig. 1) and its selective coupling to the MAP kinase pathway suggest the presence of a novel high affinity receptor that preferentially binds PHI versus VIP. Because very high affinity PHI receptors are not well described in the literature, we radioiodinated PHI to investigate the pharmacological properties of the PHI binding sites. Displacement studies were consistent with the presence of polyvalent PACAP/VIP/PHI sites (estimated to be 40% of the total) and up to two other receptors, PACAP/PHI (50%) and possibly PHI-preferring (10%), whose molecular characteristics have not been determined. The presence of a VPAC2 receptor seems unlikely because the VPAC2-selective agonist helodermin (23Lutz E.M. Sheward W.J. West J.M. Morrow J.A. Fink G. Harmar A.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) was unable to displace the binding of 125I-VIP or 125I-PACAP (data not shown). In the context of our data suggesting the existence of novel receptors, a recent report indicating that VIP family peptides interact with “clearance receptors” for the seemingly unrelated atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) family of neuropeptides is of interest (40Jin J.-G. Murty K.S. Al-Essa M. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A1159Google Scholar). These receptors were named “clearance” because early attempts to characterize these ANP binding sites did not reveal any signaling function, suggesting that they might be involved in removal of the peptide. Interestingly, ANP interaction with these single transmembrane domain receptors in smooth muscle cells triggered inhibition of MAP kinase activation and growth inhibition (41Prins B.A. Weber M.J. Hu R.M. Pedram A. Daniels M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14156-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because PHI also inhibits MAP kinase pathways and growth in Neuro2a cells, one could speculate that a “clearance-like” receptor could mediate the activity induced by PHI in Neuro2a cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated here that at least three closely related peptides of the neuropeptide VIP family regulated the proliferation of the mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. These actions appeared to occur through interaction with at least three different functional receptors that were differentially coupled, positively or negatively, to the PKA and MAP kinase signaling pathways. Moreover, the combined actions of these neuropeptides on proliferation may be relevant to the specific behavior of neuroblastoma tumor since an autocrine/paracrine action for these neuropeptides has been proposed (5Muller J-M.

To define better the functional role of this protein, we constructed a strain in which the rpmA gene, which encodes L27, was replaced by a kanamycin resistance marker. The deletion mutant grows five to six times slower than the wild-type parent and is both cold- and temperature-sensitive. This phenotype is reversed when L27 is expressed from a plasmid-borne copy of the rpmA gene. Analysis of ribosomes from the L27-lacking strain revealed deficiencies in both the assembly and activity of the 50 S ribosomal subunits. Although functional 50 S subunits are formed in the mutant, an assembly “bottleneck” was evidenced by the accumulation of a prominent 40 S precursor to the 50 S subunit which was deficient in proteins L16, L20, and L21, as well as L27. In addition, the peptidyl transferase activity of 70 S ribosomes containing mutant 50 S subunits was determined to be three to four times lower than for wild-type ribosomes. Ribosomes lacking L27 were found to be impaired in the enzymatic binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the A site, although the interaction ofN-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe with the P site was largely unperturbed. We therefore infer that L27 contributes to peptide bond formation by facilitating the proper placement of the acceptor end of the A-site tRNA at the peptidyl transferase center.

Protein L27 is one of the smallest and the most basic polypeptides in the Escherichia coli ribosome (1Chen R. Mende L. Arfsten U. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A combination of immune electron microscopy and protein-protein cross-linking results places L27 at the base of the central protuberance on the interface side of the 50 S subunit (2Lotti M. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Stöffler G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). According to in vitro studies, L27 is a late assembly protein (3Herold M. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8826-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not have an identifiable binding site on the 23 S rRNA. Chemical and UV cross-linking studies, however, demonstrated that L27 is associated closely with domain V of the 23 S rRNA (4Wower I. Wower J. Meinke M. Brimacombe R.

Direct evidence for the presence of L27 at the peptidyl transferase center was obtained through the use of derivatives of tRNAPhe containing photoreactive azidonucleotides within the 3′-terminal ACCAOH sequence (14Wower J.

A. 1989; 86: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When bound to the ribosomal A or P site and irradiated, these probes became cross-linked predominantly to protein L27 and domain V of 23 S rRNA (15Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Wower J. Wower I.K. Kirillov S.V. Rosen K.V. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The contribution of protein L27 to the peptidyl transferase center has been addressed by a number of studies. It has been found, for instance, that the omission of L27 during in vitro reconstitution of the 50 S subunit significantly reduces the peptidyl transferase activity of 70 S ribosomes (17Hampl H. Schulze H. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2284-2288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schulze H. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and that the growth of a bacterial strain that fails to express the protein is impaired greatly (19Dabbs E.R. Hasenbank R. Kastner B. Rak K.H. Wartusch B. Stöffler G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 192: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings led to the conclusion that protein L27 does not itself constitute the peptidyl transferase but that it is part of the peptidyl transferase center and is necessary for efficient peptide bond formation. To assess further the role of L27 in the bacterial ribosome, we have substituted rpmA gene, which encodes this protein, with a kanamycin resistance (Kanr) marker. The resulting strain exhibited a severe growth defect and accumulated a precursor to the 50 S particle which was deficient in several ribosomal proteins, demonstrating that L27 is important for subunit assembly in vivo. Ribosomes lacking protein L27 were also impaired in peptidyl transferase activity. Our analysis suggests that this defect is caused by the reduced affinity of aminoacyl-tRNA for the ribosomal A site. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Plasmid pEE, plasmid pMT101, and E. colistrain MS367 were gifts of Drs. K. Isono, P. Schimmel, and S. Brown, respectively.

Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. E. coli strain XL1-B was the host for the purification and maintenance of newly constructed plasmids. Liquid cultures and plates consisted of 2 × YT medium containing antibiotics as needed: 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 200 μg/ml ampicillin, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. All recombinant DNA and gene transfer procedures were performed by standard techniques (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Replacement of the rpmA gene with the kanamycin resistance marker was carried out by the method of Hamilton et al. (27Hamilton C.M. Martı́ A. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain LG90 was first transformed with pTSkan and pUCrpmA plasmids. Logarithmically growing recipients were spread on prewarmed plates containing kanamycin, ampicillin, and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated at 43 °C for 2 days. Colonies resistant to both antibiotics were then subjected to three cycles of growth at 30 °C in liquid medium with ampicillin and IPTG, but without kanamycin, to promote the resolution of cointegrates. Log phase cells from the final 30 °C culture were diluted 1,000-fold and incubated for 8 h at 43 °C in the absence of kanamycin to destroy the resolved pTS plasmid. The cells were then spread on plates containing kanamycin, ampicillin, and IPTG and incubated for 2–3 days at 43 °C. Colonies resistant to kanamycin but susceptible to chloramphenicol at both 30 and 43 °C were tested by Southern blot analysis for the replacement of the chromosomal rpmA gene by kan (see Fig. 1). Transduction with bacteriophage P1 was used to transfer thekan construct into LG90 cells lacking plasmid pUCrpmA. The resulting strain, IW312 (rec+), was mated with MS367 to create strain IW326 (rec−).Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in the studyNameGenotypeRef.Strains LG90F−, Δ(lac-proAB)21Guarante L.

Proteins were isolated from ribosomes or ribosomal particles by acetic acid extraction and fractionated by two-dimensional PAGE (28Geyl D. Böck A. Isono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To block the ribosomal P site, 10 pmol of 70 S ribosomes was incubated with 13 μg of poly(U) and 13 pmol of tRNAPhefor 10 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of TMA buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 mmMgCl2) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (TMA/SH). Ternary complexes were then prepared by adding 10 pmol of EF-Tu and 10 pmol of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe (1,400 dpm/pmol) to 40 μl of a solution containing 0.58 mm GMP-PNP, 0.5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, and 20 μg/ml pyruvate kinase in TMA/SH buffer. After 10-fold dilution, the ternary complexes were added to the tRNA-poly(U)-ribosome complexes, and the mixtures were incubated on ice. Aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals, and the amount of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe bound was measured by filter retention (29Nirenberg M. Leder P. Science. 1964; 145: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Ac[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe was bound to the P site of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes (30Semenkov Y.P. Shapkina T.G. Kirillov S.V. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 1 μm 70 S ribosomes, 0.5 μmAc[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe (1,400 dpm/pmol), and 1 mg/ml poly(U) in dithiothreitol (TMA/SH) buffer and were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After measuring the amount of tRNA bound to the ribosomes, aliquots of the complex were incubated in the presence of 0.1–1 mm puromycin for various times at 0 or 37 °C, and the initial rates of Ac[14C]Phe-puromycin formation were determined (31Leder P. Bursztyn H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 233-237Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled [2N3A76]tRNAPhe was prepared, aminoacylated, and acetylated (13Monroe R.E. Marcker K.A.

Non-aminoacylated [32P][2N3A76]tRNAPhe and Ac[14C]Phe-[32P][2N3A76]tRNAPhewere purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a C4 reverse phase column (33Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. J. Mol.

Photoreactive tRNAPhe dervatives were bound to ribosomes by incubating 0.5 μmtRNAPhe derivative with 1 μm 70 S ribosomes and 1.3 mg/ml poly(U) in TMA buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Complexes were then irradiated for 2 min at 4 °C with 300-nm UV light (14Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8114-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Labeled ribosomal components were analyzed as described (14Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8114-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Wower J. Hixson S.S.

TherpmA gene, which encodes ribosomal protein L27, was deleted from the chromosome of E. coli strain LG90 and replaced by a kanamycin resistance marker as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Southern blots demonstrated that the 6.1-kilobaseBglII fragment encompassing the rplU-rpmA operon was substituted by a 7.5-kilobase fragment that lacked theKpnI restriction site present in the rpmA gene (Fig. 1). In addition, the latter fragment hybridized with a probe for kan but notrpmA. The kan construct was used to generate mutant strains IW312 and IW326, which carry the L27 deletion in rec+ and rec− backgrounds, respectively (TableI). Two-dimensional PAGE of ribosomal proteins from LG90 and IW326 showed that the mutant ribosomes lack only protein L27 (Fig.2), and an immunoprecipitation test with anti-L27 antibodies confirmed the absence of L27 from the mutant cell extract (not shown). The growth of strains LG90, IW312 and IW326 was compared at different temperatures (TableII). The wild-type strain, LG90, grew rapidly under all conditions tested. In contrast, strains IW312 and IW326 were impaired severely; at 37 °C, small colonies appeared on solid medium only after 2–3 days, and their doubling times in liquid culture were five to six times greater than that of LG90. When strains IW312 and IW326 were streaked on agar plates and incubated at 25 °C or 43 °C for up to 2 weeks, only a trace of growth was visible at the beginning of each streak. Similarly, there was no measurable growth in liquid culture at these temperatures. Thus, deletion of therpmA gene renders the cells both cold- and heat-sensitive. However, because cells that failed to grow at 25 and 43 °C reinitiated growth upon transfer to 37 °C, the absence of L27 appears to be bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal at the two temperature extremes.Table IIGrowth characteristics of wild-type and mutant E. coli strainsStrainDoubling time at 37 °CaMeasured in 2 × YT medium by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm.Growth at 25 °CbLiquid and solid medium.Growth at 43 °CbLiquid and solid medium.minLG902020++IW31293−−IW326110−−IW326/pBR322125−−IW326/pEE45++IW326/pUC119122−−IW326/pUCrpmA61++a Measured in 2 × YT medium by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm.b Liquid and solid medium. Open table in a new tab The impaired growth of strains IW312 and IW326 was largely alleviated when plasmids carrying a functional rpmA gene were introduced into the mutant strain. The presence of plasmids pEE and pUCrpmA both led to a significant increase in cell growth rate at 37 °C and abolished cold and temperature sensitivity, whereas the corresponding parental plasmids lacking rpmA, pBR322, and pUC119, as well as a plasmid lacking the 5′-terminal half of the rpmA gene, pEEΔBK, did not (Table II). The faster growth of cells harboring pEE as opposed to pUCrpmA is attributable to the more efficient expression of L27 in the former strain as demonstrated by specific immunoprecipitation of the protein from cell extracts (not shown). The distribution of ribosomes in lysates of log phase LG90, IW326, and IW326/pEE cells was examined by sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, panel a, there is little variation in the polysome profiles of the three strains, although there is a significant difference in the ratio of 70 S monosomes to 50 S and 30 S subunits. Lysates of the wild-type strain contained a large 70 S peak with very few 50 S and 30 S particles, whereas lysates of the L27-deletion strain contained more ribosomal subunits than 70 S monosomes. In the latter case, longer centrifugation times revealed the presence of particles sedimenting at approximately 40 S in addition to the 30 S and 50 S subunits (not shown). In contrast, lysates obtained from strain IW326/pEE, in which the chromosomal deletion was complemented by a plasmid-borne copy of therpmA gene, exhibited a ratio of 70 S ribosomes to 50 S and 30 S subunits resembling that of the wild-type strain. This observation demonstrates that protein L27 is required for efficient assembly of the 50 S subunit. To characterize the 40 S particles present in lysates of strain IW326, crude ribosomes prepared in 10 mm Mg2+ were analyzed on sucrose gradients containing 0.3 mmMg2+ (Fig. 3 A, panel b). Whereas the sample isolated from the wild-type strain contained 50 S and 30 S subunits in the expected 1:1 ratio, the L27-deletion strain yielded three components sedimenting at approximately 50, 40, and 30 S. As evident from the figure, the 30 S peak was considerably more prominent than the 50 S peak. In the sample obtained from IW326/pEE, the presence of extrachromosomal copies of the rpmA gene led to a restoration of the typical 50 S to 30 S ratio of 2:1. Peak fractions from the IW326 lysate were analyzed for RNA and protein content (Figs. 3 B and 4). The 50 S fraction contained 23 S rRNA and all of the 50 S subunit proteins except L27. The 40 S fraction also contained 23 S rRNA, suggesting that it is a precursor to the large subunit. Two-dimensional PAGE analysis showed that large subunit proteins L16, L20, and L21 were missing from the 40 S particle in addition to protein L27. A pulse-chase experiment established that the 40 S particles mature to 50 S subunits and are therefore true intermediates in 50 S subunit assembly (not shown). Although the 30 S subunit fraction from the wild-type lysate contained mostly 16 S rRNA and was contaminated by only a small amount of 23 S rRNA, the corresponding fraction from the mutant lysate contained 23 S and 16 S rRNA in a 1:1 ratio (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the 30 S fraction appeared to contain another, smaller precursor to the 50 S subunit in addition to the 40 S particle. We conclude that protein L27 strongly affects the kinetics of 50 S subunit assembly in vivo as the absence of L27 leads to the accumulation of partially assembled precursor particles in addition to active 50 S subunits. This bottleneck in 50 S subunit maturation is very likely to contribute to the slow growth phenotype of the L27-deletion strains. To determine the effects of L27 deletion on ribosome function, we compared wild-type and mutant ribosomes with respect to their ability to interact with tRNA and to carry out the puromycin reaction in vitro. Both types of ribosomes were first assayed for their capacity to bind AcPhe-tRNAPhe and Phe-tRNAPhe to the ribosomal P and A sites, respectively. Approximately 60% of the ribosomes from the two strains were active in binding AcPhe-tRNAPhe to the P site, and no differences in the kinetics of binding were noted (not shown). On the other hand, the rate of enzymatic binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the A site of mutant ribosomes was slower than that to wild-type ribosomes at both 0 and 37 °C (Fig.5). In addition, when the P site was filled with AcPhe-tRNAPhe, the L27-lacking ribosomes bound only 0.6 pmol of Phe-tRNAPhe/pmol of active ribosomes, whereas wild-type particles could bind more than 0.8 pmol of Phe-tRNAPhe/pmol of active ribosomes. The peptidyl transferase activity of wild-type and L27-lacking ribosomes was assessed by monitoring the puromycin reaction at 0 and 37 °C as shown in Fig. 6. The maximum reaction velocities for wild-type ribosomes determined from the plot are 0.625 min−1 at 37 °C and 0.033 min−1at 0 °C. The corresponding values for the mutant ribosomes are 0.192 min−1 at 37 °C and 0.008 min−1 at 0 °C, or three to four times less than for the wild-type ribosomes. Because the puromycin reaction is a direct measure of peptidyl transferase activity, the difference in reaction kinetics between the two kinds of ribosomes indicates that the L27-lacking ribosomes are defective in peptidyl transferase activity as well as in 50 S subunit assembly. Our previous studies have shown that a photoreactive derivative of tRNAPhe containing 2-azidoadenosine at the 3′ or acceptor end labels both protein L27 and 23 S rRNA when bound and cross-linked from the ribosomal A and P sites (15Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Wower J. Wower I.K. Kirillov S.V. Rosen K.V. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A.

In the present work, we have used the same tRNA derivative to determine how the absence of L27 affects the way in which the 3′ end of tRNA interacts with the ribosome. [2N3A76]tRNAPheand its peptidyl analog AcPhe-[2N3A76]tRNAPhewere bound to the P site of poly(U)-programmed wild-type and mutant ribosomes. P site binding was confirmed in each case through the use of edeine, an antibiotic that specifically interferes with tRNA-ribosome interaction at the P site (34Szer W. Kurylo-Borowska Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 259: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 35Kirillov S.V. Makarov E.M. Semenkov Y.P.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Upon irradiation of the tRNA-ribosome complexes, 15–30% of the noncovalently bound tRNA became covalently linked to both types of ribosomes, although the pattern of labeling differed markedly (TableIII). In wild-type ribosomes, AcPhe-[2N3A76]tRNAPhe was cross-linked to protein L27 and two specific sequences within domain V of the 23 S rRNA as reported earlier (14Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8114-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Wower J. Wower I.K. Kirillov S.V. Rosen K.V. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In ribosomes lacking L27, however, all of the label was associated with the 23 S rRNA, although the cross-linked sequences were identical to those in wild-type ribosomes. These results indicate that the 3′ ends of the peptidyl-tRNA analog adopt a similar orientation relative to the 23 S rRNA regardless of the presence or absence of L27. A somewhat different distribution of cross-links was observed in experiments with non-aminoacylated [2N3A76]tRNAPhe; in wild-type ribosomes, the label was again associated with L27 and 23 S rRNA, whereas in mutant ribosomes, L33 was labeled in addition to 23 S rRNA. Because the labeling of L33 is primarily attributable to E site-bound [2N3A76]tRNAPhe in wild-type ribosomes (37Wower J. Scheffer P. Sylvers L.A. Wintermeyer W. Zimmermann R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the present findings suggest that the 3′ end of deacylated tRNA is not fixed to a unique site in the mutant ribosomes.Table IIICross-linking of AcPhe-[2N3A76]tRNAPhe and [2N3A76]tRNAPhe to the P site of wild-type and mutant ribosomestRNA derivativeRibosomesCross-linking to 50 S subunitaFraction of noncovalently bound tRNA that became cross-linked to ribosomes upon irradiation.Components labeled50 S-subunit protein23 S RNAbCross-links to 23 S rRNA labeled two sequences consisting of nucleotides 2500–2520 and 2570–2590.L27L33%%%%AcPhe-[2N3A76]tRNAPheLG90 (wild type)2037063IW326 (ΔL27)1500100[2N3A76]tRNAPheLG90 (wild type)2952840IW326 (ΔL27)2202278Irradiated [32P]tRNA-ribosome complexes were dissociated into subunits by centrifugation through 10–30% sucrose gradients, and covalent tRNA-50 S subunit cross-linking was estimated from radioactivity cosedimenting with the 50 S peak.

Protein L27 has been identified as a component of the peptidyl transferase center of the E. coli ribosome by numerous biochemical and genetic studies (for reviews, see Refs. 38Cooperman B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 341-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar and 39Wower J. Sylvers L.A. Rosen K.V. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Nierhaus K.H. Franceschi F. Subramanian A.R. Erdmann V.A. Wittmann-Liebold B. The Translational Apparatus. Plenum Press, New York1993: 455-464Crossref Google Scholar). We have shown, for instance, that L27 is the main protein cross-linked from 2- or 8-azidoadenosine at positions 73 and 76 of tRNAPhe at the P and A sites (14Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8114-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because the azidoadenosines give rise to very short cross-links, on the order of 3–4 Å, specific labeling of L27 by both P and A site-bound tRNAs is in accord with the expected juxtaposition of their 3′-terminal adenosines during peptidyl transfer. To characterize further the functional role of L27 in translation, we constructed a strain ofE. coli from which the L27 gene was deleted. We show here that the mutant bacteria grow five times more slowly than wild-typeE. coli and are both cold- and temperature-sensitive. The mutant phenotype is reversed upon expression of protein L27 from a plasmid, however, demonstrating that the impaired growth of the deletion strain results from the lack of protein L27. We have traced the molecular basis of growth impairment to interrelated defects in the assembly and function of the 50 S ribosomal subunit. Logarithmically growing cells of the rpmA deletion strain accumulate 40 S precursors to the 50 S subunit which lack proteins L16, L20, and L21 in addition to L27. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the 40 S particles eventually mature to 50 S subunits even in the absence of L27 and subsequently are incorporated into 70 S monosomes and polysomes. This observation shows for the first time that L27 plays a role in the assembly of E. coli ribosomes within the cell and indicates that there are significant differences between 50 S subunit assembly in vivo and in vitro. The absence of L16, L20, and L21 from the 40 S particles implies that the assembly of these proteins is dependent on L27 in vivo. By contrast, in vitro reconstitution experiments indicate that L27 is a late assembly protein and therefore not expected to influence assembly of the 50 S particles. In particular, the in vitroassembly map does not predict any assembly linkage between protein L27 and proteins L16, L20, and L21, although L27 has been cross-linked to L16 in the mature 50 S subunit (40Walleczek J. Martin T. Redl B. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Stöffler G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4099-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Walleczek J. Redl B. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Stöffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4231-4237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a neighbor of L16 according to immunoelectron microscopy studies (42Stöffler G. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function, and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer, New York1986: 28-46Google Scholar). Furthermore, although L20 promotes the incorporation of L21, neither one depends upon nor stimulates L27 binding in vitro (3Herold M. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8826-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, protein L20 is considered as a primary assembly protein with a binding site in the 5′ third of the 23 S RNA (43Zimmermann R.A. Chambliss G. Craven G.R. Davies J. Davis K. Kahan L. Nomura M. Ribosomes: Structure, Function, and Genetics. University Park Press, Baltimore1980: 135-169Google Scholar), whereas protein L27, which appears to lack an independent RNA binding site, has been cross-linked to three sites in domain V of the 23 S rRNA (4Wower I. Wower J. Meinke M. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4285-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Gulle H. Hoppe E. Osswald M. Greuer B. Brimacombe R. Stöffler G.

The presence of protein L30 in 40 S precursor particles is also unexpected because this protein does not assemble into the 50 S subunit in vitrowithout proteins L20 and L21. However, the early assembly of L27in vivo is supported by the observation that a 32 S precursor found in wild-type cells contains protein L27 along with 16 other ribosomal proteins, including L20 and L21 (44Nierhaus K.H. Bordasch K. Homann H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is of interest in this connection that protein L21 is encoded by the same operon as L27 (45Nomura M. Gourse R. Baughman G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 75-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which this operon is regulated has not been elucidated, deletion of the L27 gene does not appear to reduce the synthesis of L21. It has been found recently that a 371-amino acid protein from the large ribosomal subunit of yeast mitochondria, Rml27p, contains an amino-terminal domain of 84 residues which is homologous to E. coli L27 as well as a carboxyl-terminal domain unrelated to any other known ribosomal protein (46Mason T.L. Pan C. Sanchirico M.E. Sirum-Connolly K. Experientia ( Basel ). 1996; 52: 1148-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis revealed that this protein is essential for the structural and functional integrity of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome. Several amino acid substitutions in conserved positions of the L27-like domain led to cold- and temperature-sensitive defects in the assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and the accumulation of more slowly sedimenting particles containing large subunit rRNA. These striking parallels to the properties of L27-lacking E. coli provide further evidence that this protein contributes to the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit, a role that has apparently been conserved in the evolution of diverse genetic systems. In addition to defects in 50 S subunit assembly, we have found that the absence of protein L27 leads to the impairment of peptidyl transferase activity. This defect appears to result from a decrease in the ability of the mutant ribosomes to facilitate EF-Tu-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site. Earlier photochemical cross-linking studies have shown that the 3′-terminal adenosine of A site-bound Phe-[2N3A76]tRNAPhe is in close proximity to protein L27 (15Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our present findings suggest that L27 is not only in proximity to the 3′ end of the A site tRNA but that there is a functional interaction between them which contributes to tRNA binding. This proposal is supported by our observation that removal of L27 weakens the interaction of puromycin, an analog of the 3′ end of aminoacyl-tRNA (13Monroe R.E. Marcker K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 25: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), with the ribosomal A site. In contrast, the rate and extent of binding of a peptidyl-tRNA analog, AcPhe-tRNAPhe, to the P site were not perturbed. We conclude from the results reported here that protein L27 plays a role in mediating the proper placement of the 3′ end of A site tRNA at the peptidyl transferase center and that it may also influence the interaction of the 3′ end of deacylated tRNA with the ribosome after peptidyl transfer. These inferences are consistent with several properties of the mutant ribosomes, including the lower rate of peptidyl transfer, the reduced enzymatic binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site, and the observation that the 3′ end of deacylated tRNA can be cross-linked to L33, a protein component of the ribosomal E site. Because L27 is an unusually basic protein (1Chen R. Mende L. Arfsten U. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), its function may be to screen the negative charge of the tRNA molecules from that of the 23 S rRNA during the peptidyl transferase reaction.

Kirillov for much useful advice and discussion."

S., and Brashear, T. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16083–16092). We now report that 58K is a formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps in the modification of tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate. Comparative immunoblotting using several monoclonal antibodies made against 58K and a polyclonal antibody made against a chicken liver protein (p60) with similar properties (Hennig, D., Scales, S. J., Moreau, A., Murley, L. L., De Mey, J., and Kreis, T. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 19602–19611) demonstrated precise co-purification of protein recognized by all antibodies through multiple fractionation steps, including gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Eight peptides derived from 58K showed high sequence identity to amino acid sequences predicted by full length cDNA for p60 and porcine liver FTCD. Furthermore, purified 58K was associated with formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase activities. Based on these collective results, 58K was concluded to be a rat liver version of FTCD. Microtubules assembled from brain tubulin, but not from liver tubulin, were able to bind rat liver FTCD. Binding to brain microtubules is suspected to occur via polyglutamates that are added post-translationally to tubulin in brain, which was shown to contain very low levels of FTCD, but not to tubulin in liver, which was determined to be the richest tissue source, by far, of FTCD. The physiological significance of the microtubule binding activity of FTCD is thus called into question, but an association of FTCD with the Golgi apparatus has now been established. 58K was previously identified as a rat liver protein that binds microtubules in vitro and is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus in vivo(Bloom, G.

The physiological significance of the microtubule binding activity of FTCD is thus called into question, but an association of FTCD with the Golgi apparatus has now been established. A powerful approach for identifying factors that function in concert with microtubules (MTs) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; FTCD, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THF, tetrahydrofolate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; FTCD, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THF, tetrahydrofolate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. has been to seek proteins that bind to MTs in preparations of cytosol. This strategy was originally applied to mammalian brain cytosol, leading to the discovery of numerous MT-associated proteins (MAPs) (3Bloom G.S. Luca F.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In one such case, our laboratory discovered a novel MT-binding protein, 58K, in preparations of rat liver cytosol (1Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, 58K was localized by immunofluorescence to the Golgi apparatus in cultured hepatoma cells and was present on purified liver Golgi membranes as a peripheral membrane protein (1Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 58K was also detected by both Western blotting 2A.-M. Bashour and G. S. Bloom, unpublished results. 2A.-M. Bashour and G. S. Bloom, unpublished results. and immunofluorescence microscopy (18Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) in a wide variety of cultured mammalian cell types. As was found for hepatoma cells, immunofluorescence labeling of other cell types with anti-58K antibodies yielded bright staining of the Golgi complex.Although the localization of a MAP-like protein on Golgi membranes was initially surprising, it was not unprecedented (20Allan V.J. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2229-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and offered potential insight into the intriguing relationship between MTs and the Golgi complex in interphase cells. The Golgi complex in nondividing cells typically comprises an interconnected network of stacked cisternae (21Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Marrano A. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 140: 27-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which are located either near the nucleus (22Louvard D. Reggio H. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), or in some types of polarized epithelial cells, adjacent to the apical surface (23Ihrke G. Neufeld E.B. Meads T. Shanks M.R. Cassio D. Laurent M. Schroer T.A. Pagano R.E. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1761-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Fawcett D.W. A Textbook of Histology. 1986; (and 699, W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia): 696Google Scholar). Exposure of interphase cells to MT depolymerizing drugs, such as colcemid or nocodazole, causes the Golgi apparatus to break apart into scores of fragments that are widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (25Rogalski A.A. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 26Moskalewski S. Thyberg J. Lohmander S. Friberg U. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 95: 440-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar effects on the Golgi apparatus have been observed in cells exposed to Taxol (25Rogalski A.A. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Wehland J. Henkart M. Klausner R. Sandoval I.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4286-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a drug which stimulates MT assembly, and as a by-product, disrupts the normal organization of MTs. It is evident, therefore, that the structural integrity and normal localization of the Golgi apparatus in interphase cells depends upon the presence and normal organization of MTs. At the time that 58K was initially characterized, the dependence of the Golgi on MTs was well known, but poorly understood mechanistically. We therefore decided to investigate the hypothesis that 58K anchors Golgi membranes to MTs and helps to maintain the structural unity of the Golgi and its proper positioning within the cell (1Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).New evidence derived from biochemical, immunological, molecular biological, and enzymological studies indicates that 58K is a version of formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), a bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes two consecutive steps in the modification of tetrahydrofolate (THF) to 5,10-methenyl-THF (28Tabor H. Wyngarden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1830-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Drury E.J. Bazar L.S. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We thus refer to 58K as rat liver FTCD. MTs assembled from brain tubulin, but not from liver tubulin, were able to bind avidly to rat liver FTCD, although Western blotting of rat tissue extracts revealed that FTCD is far more abundant in liver than in all other tissues examined, including brain. Considering that FTCD is virtually liver-specific, but does not bind to liver MTs, the ability of FTCD to bind brain MTs is unlikely to be physiologically relevant. Although the hypothesis that 58K (FTCD) links Golgi membranes to MTs in vivo must now be regarded with skepticism, an unexpected association of FTCD with the Golgi apparatus has been revealed. It is noteworthy that analogous results were obtained independently in another laboratory for a chicken liver version of FTCD, and are reported in Henning et al. (2Hennig D. Scales S.J. Moreau A. Murley L.L. De Mey J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19602-19611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONBased on several criteria, 58K has been shown to be an FTCD. By immunoblotting, antibodies made against chicken (Fig. 1) or porcine (not shown) liver FTCD labeled protein that co-migrated with 58K in SDS-PAGE, and precisely co-fractionated with 58K during its purification from rat liver cytosol. In addition, several monoclonal anti-58K antibodies reacted with purified native or recombinant porcine liver FTCD (not shown). High sequence identity was observed between eight peptide fragments of 58K, and the full-length sequences of porcine and chicken liver FTCD (Fig. 2). Finally, both enzyme activities known to be associated with porcine liver FTCD, formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase (28Tabor H. Wyngarden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1830-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Drury E.J. Bazar L.S. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), were also associated with purified 58K. Until more is known about the structure of FTCD genes and flanking regions of genomic DNA, it will not be possible to judge whether the rat, chicken, and porcine proteins discussed here represent species-specific products of equivalent, as opposed to closely related, genes. Likewise, ambiguities in the amino acid sequence of rat FTCD at several positions (see Fig. 2) raise the possibility that multiple FTCD isoforms are encoded by multiple genes within a single animal species. Regardless, in light of the new evidence about rat liver 58K, its classification as an FTCD seems amply justified.Although 58K was associated with formiminotransferase activity, the measured activity was only ∼20% of that reported for recombinant porcine FTCD (30Murley L.L. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22820-22824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following considerations, individually or collectively, might account for this discrepancy. First, no effort was made to optimize recovery of the enzyme activities of 58K, which was purified by a method (see “Experimental Procedures”) that was radically different than the procedure used to purify recombinant porcine FTCD (30Murley L.L. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22820-22824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis resolved purified 58K into eight closely spaced variants that collectively were recognized by antibodies to rat 58K, chicken p60, and porcine FTCD (data not shown). The electrophoretic diversity of 58K could reflect the presence of multiple, distinct translation products, post-tranlsational modifications, or both, although no evidence that might discriminate among these possibilities is presently available. Regardless, by comparison to recombinant porcine FTCD, the purified 58K that was used for enzyme assays was very diverse in molecular terms, and by extension, perhaps in enzymatic properties as well. Finally, species-specific differences in enzymatic efficiency might explain, at least in part, the low formiminotransferase activity of rat liver 58K relative to that of recombinant porcine FTCD.Before 58K was shown to be an FTCD, studies of the protein demonstrated that it could bind MTs in vitro, was localized by immunofluorescence to the Golgi apparatus of cultured cells, and was a cytoplasmically oriented, peripheral membrane protein of isolated Golgi membranes (1Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. Bloom G.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In light of the ability of 58K to bind MTs and Golgi membranes, and the fact that a properly localized, structurally intact Golgi requires MTs to be present and normally organized (25Rogalski A.A. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 26Moskalewski S. Thyberg J. Lohmander S. Friberg U. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 95: 440-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Wehland J. Henkart M. Klausner R. Sandoval I.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4286-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we postulated that 58K anchors Golgi membranes to MTs (1Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). New evidence presented here, however, strongly suggests that 58K, now realized to be an FTCD, does not cross-link Golgi membranes to MTsin vivo.The pertinent evidence is that FTCD binds to MTs assembled from brain, but not liver tubulin (Fig. 3). Thus, FTCD is unlikely to bind MTs in the only tissue in which it is abundant, namely liver (Fig. 4). There is one obvious difference between brain and liver tubulin that might account for the preferential binding of FTCD to brain MTs. Located near the C termini of both α-tubulins and β-tubulins are glutamic acid residues to which polyglutamic acid side chains of variable length can be added post-translationally in vivo (38Wolff A. de Néchaud B.

Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In brain, approximately half of the α-tubulin (39Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and a lesser, but substantial, amount of the β-tubulin (38Wolff A. de Néchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar) are polyglutamylated. In other tissues, including liver, polyglutamylated tubulin has also been detected, but at dramatically lower levels and only on β-tubulins (38Wolff A. de Néchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar).Why might FTCD preferentially bind MTs assembled from polyglutamylated, as compared with unmodified tubulin? FTCD is a homooctomeric enzyme (37Beaudet R. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 453: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and each molecule comprises 4 binding sites for the polyglutamate moiety of THF (40Paquin J. Baugh C.M. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14925-14931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, affinity chromatography using a polyglutamate-Affi-Gel column has been used as a final enrichment step for purification of recombinant porcine liver FTCD (30Murley L.L. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22820-22824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We postulate, therefore, that the polyglutamates which are uniquely abundant on brain tubulin enable MTs assembled from brain, but not liver, tubulin to bind avidly to FTCD. The formal proof of this hypothesis ultimately must rest on MT binding studies using tubulin whose polyglutamylation state can be altered experimentally. Unfortunately, such experiments are not presently possible, because none of the enzymes responsible for post-translationally adding glutamates to tubulin or subsequently removing them are reported to have been discovered.It may seem puzzling that FTCD appears by immunofluorescence microscopy to be localized predominantly on the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles (1Bloom G.S.

One potential explanation for this apparent anomaly is that both soluble and membrane-associated pools of FTCD exist, but FTCD is far more concentrated on membranes than in the soluble phase of cytoplasm. Bearing in mind that immunofluorescence reports relative concentrations of accessible epitopes, it is possible that the majority of FTCD is soluble, but at a concentration near or below the level of detectability by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, because FTCD is a cytoplasmically oriented peripheral membrane protein that binds membranes by relatively weak ionic interactions (1Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hennig D. Scales S.J. Moreau A. Murley L.L. De Mey J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol.

An analogous situation exists for the MT motor protein, kinesin. Immunofluorescence and other in situ localization methods indicate that ∼30–90% of the cellular pool of kinesin is associated with membrane surfaces in vivo (41Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Stenoien D.A.

Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar).While emphasizing that FTCD is unlikely to bind MTs in vivo, the results shown here and in a companion study about chicken FTCD (2Hennig D. Scales S.J. Moreau A. Murley L.L. De Mey J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19602-19611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also raise the question of why FTCD is associated with the Golgi. FTCD catalyzes two consecutive reactions: transfer of a single carbon from formiminoglutamate to THF, followed by conversion of the product, 5-formimino-THF, to 5,10-methynyl-THF plus ammonia (28Tabor H. Wyngarden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1830-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several metabolically relevant purposes are served by these reactions (45Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 691, 711-692, 713Google Scholar). First, formiminoglutamate is a product of the histidine metabolism pathway, and its modification by FTCD completes the multistep conversion of histidine to glutamic acid. Next, 5,10-methynyl-THF, the end product of FTCD catalysis, can be converted directly to active coenzymes, such as 5-formyl-THF and 10-formyl-THF. Finally, 5,10-methynyl-THF also lies directly in the pathways for synthesis of several nucleotides and amino acids, as well as other compounds, including S-adenosylmethionine and formylmethionine tRNA.The two reactions catalyzed by FTCD have classically been considered to occur in vivo within the soluble phase of cytoplasm. The finding that FTCD is localized, at least in part, on the Golgi apparatus and post-Golgi vesicles (1Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hennig D. Scales S.J. Moreau A. Murley L.L. De Mey J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19602-19611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that its site of action is actually on membrane surfaces. Liver apparently contains the highest level of folates of all tissues (46Zamierowski M. Wagner C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; : 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and acquires its folates from plasma as complexes of folate binding protein and 5-methyl-THF (46Zamierowski M. Wagner C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; : 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 47Weitman S. Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Dakshinamurti K. Vitamin Receptors: Vitamins as Ligands in Cell Communities. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 259Google Scholar). Folate binding protein is a soluble, desialylated version of the membrane-associated, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored folate receptor, and like other asialoglycoproteins, is believed to enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis through coated pits (48Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). After 5-methyl-THF enters hepatocytes, it transits to the cytoplasm from the luminal space of membrane-bounded compartments, presumably late endosomes and lysosomes. Because these late endocytotic compartments are often localized very close to the Golgi complex, concentrating FTCD on the outer surface of the Golgi may enhance the rate of productive collisions between FTCD and 5-methyl-THF. An appealing feature of this model is that it does not exclude the possibility that a soluble pool of FTCD is also capable of modifying 5-methyl-THF. A powerful approach for identifying factors that function in concert with microtubules (MTs) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; FTCD, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THF, tetrahydrofolate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; FTCD, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THF, tetrahydrofolate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. has been to seek proteins that bind to MTs in preparations of cytosol. This strategy was originally applied to mammalian brain cytosol, leading to the discovery of numerous MT-associated proteins (MAPs) (3Bloom G.S. Luca F.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Various mitogens, growth factors, and transmitters of secondary messengers have been shown to mediate their effects through PKC. PKC subtypes have been grouped as (i) conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are activated by calcium, phospholipids, diacylglycerol, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA); (ii) novel (δ, ε, η, θ, and μ), which do not require calcium for activation; and (iii) atypical (ζ and λ), which are activated by phospholipids but not by calcium, diacylglycerol, or TPA (2Newton A.C.

It is likely that these isozymes have distinct and distinguishable functions (4Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 1987; 59: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it has become clear that this protein plays an important role in the process of tumor promotion (10Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, inhibition of PKC can be viewed as a rational method of blocking or inhibiting tumor promotion, and several natural product inhibitors have been identified. Examples include staurosporine (11Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto H. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, the benzophenanthridine alkaloid, chelerythrine, was described as a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC, with an IC50 value of 0.66 μm illustrated with enzyme derived from rat brain (14Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Biological responses mediated by chelerythrine, such as cytotoxic activity with L-1210 tumor cells (14Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1990; 1052: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), have been ascribed to inhibition of PKC. Additional activities mediated by chelerythrine include inhibition of alanine aminotransferase (16Walterová D. Ulrichová J. Preininger V. Šimánek V. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase (17Cohen H.G. Seifen E.E. Straub K.D. Tiefenback C. Stermitz F.R. Biochem.

Due to the structural similarity of angoline and chelerythrine, we undertook a series of studies to investigate the activity of angoline, especially in the context of affecting PKC-mediated responses. As reported herein, neither angoline nor chelerythrine were effective inhibitors of PKC. Alternate mechanisms should be taken into account when considering the biological responses mediated by these compounds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPhosphatidylserine, PDBu, histone type IIIs, ATP, pyridoxal phosphate, dithiothreitol, 1,2-diolein, Triton X-100, and staurosporine were obtained from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. S-minimal essential medium, RPMI 1640, non-essential amino acid solution (10 mm, 100×), trypsin-EDTA solution (1×), and penicillin-streptomycin, antibiotic-antimycotic solution were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Dialyzed fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Monoclonal anti-PKC (α, β, and γ) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY).Angoline and ChelerythrineAngoline was isolated from the stem of M. cordata(Willd.) R. Br. (syn. Bocconia cordata Willd.) (Papaveraceae). Briefly, the stem bark of M. cordata (600 g) was extracted with methanol (3 × 3 liters). The resultant extract (50 g) was defatted with petroleum ether (300 ml), suspended in 100 ml of H2O, and partitioned with ethyl acetate (3 × 400 ml) to afford 8 g of an ethyl acetate residue. Further purification was performed by silica gel column chromatography using CHCl3, and CHCl3 with an increasing amounts of methanol (0–25%) as eluents. Through repeated column chromatography of the subfractions, angoline (Fig. 1) (also known as 9-methoxychelerythrine) was isolated with melting point 212–215 °C (literature: 210 °C; Ref. 19Krane B.D.

Chelerythrine (Fig. 1) was obtained from various commercial sources (Sigma; LC Service Corp., Woburn, MA; Extrasynthese, Lyon, France).PKC Preparations and Analysis of ActivityThe purification of PKC-α from calf brain and the PKC assay were performed essentially as described by Da Silva et al. (23Da Silva C. Fan X. Martelly I. Castagna M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2081-2087PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh calf brain homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was concentrated using an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon Division, Beverly, MA) equipped with a XM50 membrane and subjected to passage over a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). The sample was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.3 m) in buffer A. Fractions were collected and enzyme activities were monitored by [3H]PDBu binding (24De Vries D.J. Herald C.L. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4069-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The major fractions showing binding activity were combined and concentrated, and further purification of PKC was conducted by sequential column chromatography over phenyl-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, poly-l-lysine-agarose, and hydroxyapatite. Additional samples of brain used for the preparation of cytosolic fractions (12,000 × g) bearing PKC activity were from mouse, rat, rabbit, chicken, and dog (Pel-Freez® Biologicals, Rogers, AR).PKC catalytic activity was assayed by quantifying transfer of the γ-phosphate group of [γ-32P]ATP into histone IIIs. The incubation mixture (80 μl) consisted of 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 200 μg/ml histone (type IIIs), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 500 μg/ml phosphatidylserine in 3% Triton X-100, 10 μmATP containing [γ-32P]ATP, and test compounds. After a 10-min preincubation at 30 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of enzyme solution (4 μg). After an additional incubation period of 10 min, 85 μl of the reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman P-81 cation exchange paper (Whatman Paper Ltd., Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom). The papers were washed three times with 0.2% aqueous phosphoric acid solution, air-dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Test compounds were evaluated for potential to affect basal activity (no activator added), or in the presence of PDBu (0.4 μm) or 1,2-diolein (180 μm). Results were expressed as a percentage, relative to solvent-treated controls, and dose-response relationships were obtained by evaluating serial dilutions of test compounds in duplicate.Assessment of PDBu Binding to the Regulatory Site of PKCPDBu binding assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates essentially as described by De Vries et al. (24De Vries D.J. Herald C.L. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4069-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), using calf brain homogenate or other sources of soluble PKC as receptor. Each reaction mixture (200 μl final volume) contained homogenate (25 μg of protein) as a source of PKC, bovine serum albumin (200 μg), 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and [3H]PDBu (5 nm, 20 Ci/mmol). Test substances (10 μl) were added to the reaction mixtures (in duplicate) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Unbound [3H]PDBu was removed by filtration with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, through glass fiber filter mats (Type B; Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) using a Tomtec Mach III® 96-well plate harvester (Tomtec, Orange, CT). Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting using a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta® liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Inc.). The amount of [3H]PDBu bound in the presence of nonradioactive PDBu (4 μm) was used to assess nonspecific binding. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding, and results were expressed as a percentage, relative to the solvent-treated control group. IC50 values were calculated using semi-log plots.Translocation Studies and Western Blot Analysis of PKC with Cultured HL-60 CellsHL-60 CellsHuman promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD), were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (37 °C, 100% humidity, 5% CO2 in air).Preparation and Fractionation of HL-60 CellsHL-60 cells in logarithmic phase (1 × 107 cells) were treated with test compounds for 3 or 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min), washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and homogenized (4 °C) in 1.0 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 s using a Brinkmann Polytron® PT-3000 homogenizer (Littau, Switzerland). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C), and the resulting supernatant fractions (used as a source of cytosolic PKC) were stored at −80 °C. The pellets were solubilized in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 by vortexing and incubating on ice for 2 h, and the suspensions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C) to obtain membrane/microsomal PKC. The resulting supernatant fractions were used as a source of membrane-associated particulate PKC, and stored at −80 °C. All protein contents were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method and bovine serum albumin as a standard.Western Blot Analysis of PKCEach protein fraction (50 μg) was subjected to 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes by electroblotting, and membranes were treated for 1 h with blocking buffer (1% dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (mouse anti-PKC-α, -β, and -γ monoclonal antibodies) diluted in blocking buffer (α, 1:1,000; β and γ, 1:500), washed with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer, washed for 1 h, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Assessment of TPA-induced Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC) Activity with ME 308 CellsMouse epidermal 308 cells were cultured in S-minimal essential medium containing non-essential amino acids (1×), dialyzed fetal bovine serum (5%), Ca2+ (0.05 mm), and antibiotic-antimycotics (1×) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. For determination of TPA-induced ODC activity, cells were distributed to 24-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/ml/well. After an 18-h preincubation, test materials dissolved in Me2SO were added in duplicate (5 μl, 0.5% final Me2SO concentration) before the induction of ODC activity with TPA (200 nm). After an additional incubation period of 6 h, plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80 °C until tested. ODC activity was assayed directly in the 24-well plates as described previously (25Lichti U. Gottesman M.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 113: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, frozen cells were lysed by quickly thawing the bottom of the culture plates in a warm water bath (37 °C, 2 min). A substrate and cofactor mixture (200 μl containing 2 μl ofl-[1-14C]ornithine (200 nCi, 56 mCi/mmol, 100 μCi/ml), 50 μl of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 m, pH 7.2), 16 μl of EDTA (12.5 mm), 10 μl of dithiothreitol (50 mm), 4 μl of pyridoxal phosphate (5 mm in 10 mm NaOH) and 118 μl of unlabeledl-ornithine (78 μg/ml)) were added to each well. Released [14C]CO2 was captured by paper discs, which were moistened with 30 μl of 1 n NaOH during incubation of plates at 37 °C for 1 h while shaking. The amount of radioactivity captured on NaOH-impregnated filter disks was determined by scintillation counting using a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta® liquid scintillation counter. Protein was determined by the Bio-Rad method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Results were calculated as nanomoles of [14C]CO2/h/mg of protein and expressed as a percentage in comparison with a control treated with Me2SO and TPA.DISCUSSIONSince PKC plays an important role in signal transduction and phorbol ester-promoted tumorigenesis, various inhibitors have been studied in detail. One such substance, chelerythrine, has been reported as a potent and specific inhibitor. The phosphorylation reaction mediated by PKC was reduced with an IC50 value of 0.66 μm. Inhibition was competitive with respect to phosphate acceptor (histone IIIs), and noncompetitive with respect to ATP. No substantive competition was observed with respective to [3H]PDBu binding, thus suggesting interaction does not occur at the regulatory site of PKC. Other kinases, such as protein kinase A, tyrosine protein kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin-protein kinase, were not inhibited with great efficacy, indicating specificity for PKC (14Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar).Accordingly, when we obtained angoline from a plant extract demonstrating antagonism of PDBu binding with PKC, it was suspected that this substance would function in a mode similar to chelerythrine. However, angoline was found ineffective as an inhibitor of PKC activity. Thus, as a positive control, the inhibitory potential of chelerythrine was investigated, obtaining this substance from a commercial source (Sigma). However, in repeated attempts, chelerythrine was found to be practically inactive as an inhibitor of partially purified calf brain PKC. Although the compound appeared pure and stable (HPLC analysis), additional samples were procured (LC Service Corp., Extrasynthese) and evaluated, and also found to be inactive. This lack of inhibitory activity was observed with PKC obtained from a variety of species, either in the presence or absence of activators (PDBu or diolein). In fact, to the contrary, when evaluated with cytosol fractions derived from rat or mouse brain, chelerythrine enhanced PKC activity, and, with calf brain preparations, [3H]PDBu binding was elevated. These types of activities are consistent with recent reports by Lombardini (29Lombardini J.B. Brain Res. 1995; 673: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Lombardini J.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) who demonstrated chelerythrine-stimulated phosphorylation of a ∼20-kDa protein present in the mitochondrial fraction of rat retina. Further, using intact cells, Gopalakrishna et al. (31Gopalkrishna R. Chen Z. Youlee K. Gundimeda U. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1994; 35: 615Google Scholar) noted that chelerythrine and sanguinarine could induce an initial activation of membrane translocation from the cytosol, and subsequent down-regulation of PKC. These responses parallel those of tumor promoters, such as phorbol esters, and would not be anticipated by an inhibitor of PKC. Along these lines, we evaluated angoline and chelerythrine for potential to facilitate translocation of PKC-α, -β, and -γ with cultured HL-60 cells, but no significant alterations were observed. Interestingly, however, with cultured ME 308 cell system, chelerythrine stimulated TPA-induced ODC activity at lower concentrations, whereas angoline was inactive at lower concentrations but reduced activity approximately 50% at a test concentration of 1.0 μg/ml. Polyamines play essential roles in normal cell proliferation and differentiation, but are overexpressed in various cancer cells. Since ODC is a key component that regulates intracellular polyamines, inhibitors of ODC activity are of interest. Accordingly, it should be of value to explore the mechanism by which angoline functions in this capacity.Chelerythrine is known to mediate a variety of biological responses. For example, rat liver alanine aminotransferase is inhibited by adduct formation between thiol groups of the enzyme and the iminium bond of chelerythrine (16Walterová D. Ulrichová J. Preininger V. Šimánek V. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Chelerythrine also inhibits taxol-mediated polymerization of rat brain tubulin (32Wolff J. Knipling L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13334-13339Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), histone kinase activity using partially purified PKC from the rat lacrimal gland (33Zoukhri D. Sergheraert C. Rossignol B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1045-C1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pyrogen-induced expression of tissue factor in endothelial cells, histamine release induced by aggregation of IgE-receptor on human basophils (34Herbert J.-M. Savi P. Laplace M.-C. Dumas A. Dol F. Thrombosis Res. 1993; 71: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35von Stebut E. Amon U. Herbert J.-M. Wolff H.H. Agents Actions. 1994; 41: C56-C57Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Na+,K+,2Cl−cotransporter in Ehrlich mouse ascites tumor cells (36Larsen A.K. Jensen B.S. Hoffmann E.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and invasion of metastatic human follicular thyroid cancer (37Hoelting T. Duh Q.-Y. Clark O.H. Herfarth C. Cancer Lett. 1997; 119: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have recently found that angoline and chelerythrine inhibit 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced preneoplastic lesion formation in mouse mammary gland organ culture by approximately 60% at a test concentration of 10 μm (data not shown). Based on the report of Herbert et al. (14Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar), some of these effects have been attributed to PKC inhibition. As indicated by the current report, however, chelerythrine is not a general and specific inhibitor of PKC. Accordingly, PKC-independent pathways should be considered when exploring the biological potential of chelerythrine and related compounds. For example, as noted above, interaction of the iminium bond of chelerythrine and active sites in various target molecules can play an important role in biological responses that are mediated by the compound. An interaction of this type, of course, would not be specific for or limited to PKC, and could be more broadly related to the mechanism by which chelerythrine functions.

Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Various mitogens, growth factors, and transmitters of secondary messengers have been shown to mediate their effects through PKC. PKC subtypes have been grouped as (i) conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are activated by calcium, phospholipids, diacylglycerol, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA); (ii) novel (δ, ε, η, θ, and μ), which do not require calcium for activation; and (iii) atypical (ζ and λ), which are activated by phospholipids but not by calcium, diacylglycerol, or TPA (2Newton A.C.

It is likely that these isozymes have distinct and distinguishable functions (4Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 5Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Otte A.P.

Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since PKC has been elaborated as a major intracellular phorbol ester receptor (8Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar, 9Costagna M. Biol. Cell. 1987; 59: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it has become clear that this protein plays an important role in the process of tumor promotion (10Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, inhibition of PKC can be viewed as a rational method of blocking or inhibiting tumor promotion, and several natural product inhibitors have been identified. Examples include staurosporine (11Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto H. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar), UCN-1028C (12Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). In addition, the benzophenanthridine alkaloid, chelerythrine, was described as a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC, with an IC50 value of 0.66 μm illustrated with enzyme derived from rat brain (14Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Biological responses mediated by chelerythrine, such as cytotoxic activity with L-1210 tumor cells (14Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar) and antiplatelet activity (15Ko F.-N. Chen I.-S. Wu S.-J. Lee L.-G. Haung T.-F. Teng C.-M. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2041413178,"Employing antisera against various subfractions of rat liver mitochondria (mitoplast, inner membrane, intermembrane, and matrix) as well as metabolically radiolabeled BRL-3A rat liver cells, we undertook a search for the presence of glycoproteins in this major cellular compartment for which little information in regard to glycoconjugates was available. Subsequent to [35S]methionine labeling of BRL-3A cells, a peptide:N-glycosidase-sensitive protein (45 kDa) was observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the inner membrane immunoprecipitate, which was reduced to a molecular mass of 42 kDa by this enzyme. The 45-kDa protein was readily labeled with [2-3H]mannose, and indeed the radioactivity of the inner membrane immunoprecipitate was almost exclusively present in this component. Moreover, antisera directed against mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) or F1F0-ATPase (complex V) also precipitated a 45-kDa protein from BRL-3A cell lysates as the predominant mannose-radiolabeled constituent. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase completely removed the radiolabel from this glycoprotein, and the released oligosaccharides were of the partially trimmed polymannose type (Glc1Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc). Cycloheximide as well as tunicamycin resulted in total inhibition of radiolabeling of the inner membrane glycoprotein, and moreover, pulse-chase studies employing metrizamide density gradient centrifugation demonstrated that the glycoprotein was initially present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently appeared in a mitochondrial location. Early movement of the glycoprotein to the mitochondria after synthesis in the ER was also evident from the limited processing undergone by its N-linked oligosaccharides; this stood in contrast to lysosomal glycoproteins in which we noted extensive conversion to complex oligosaccharides. Our findings suggest that the 45-kDa glycoprotein migrates from ER to mitochondria by the previously observed contact sites between the two organelles. Furthermore, the presence of this glycoprotein in at least two major mitochondrial multienzyme complexes would be consistent with a role in mitochondrial translocations.

Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), well documented information as to the presence of carbohydrate-containing proteins in other compartments of the cell has only recently emerged. Indeed, a number of reports have clearly shown that in contrast to previously held beliefs, glycosylated proteins are present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (for a review, see Ref. 2Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). On the other hand, attempts to determine if glycoconjugates are present in mitochondria have been less convincing, and the past literature in this area consists primarily of reports utilizing carbohydrate staining and lectin binding procedures (3Sottocasa G.L. Sandri G. Panfili E. de Bernard B. FEBS Lett. 1971; 17: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Sottocasa G.L. Sandri G. Panfili E. de Bernard B. Gazzoti P. Vasington F.D. Carafoli E.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1983; 31: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This void in information prompted us in the present study to make an intensive effort to determine if glycoproteins are indeed present in mitochondria and if so to elucidate their localization within the confines of this organelle as well as to define the nature of their carbohydrate units and the site of their formation. Employing rat liver mitochondrial subfractions as well as the BRL-3A buffalo rat liver cell line, we have by metabolic radiolabeling and immunochemical approaches been able to demonstrate that a major 45-kDa glycoprotein bearing N-linked polymannose carbohydrate is a component of the inner mitochondrial membrane and that it is moreover associated with at least two mitochondrial enzyme complexes. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments and studies with inhibitors indicated that this glycoprotein is synthesized in the ER and subsequently is translocated to the mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated from fasted male rats (150–200 g, CD strain, Taconic, Inc.) by an established procedure (8Schnaitman C. Erwin V.G. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 719-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar,9Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) with only slight modifications. Briefly, this involved application of the crude mitochondrial pellet, suspended (20 mg of protein/ml) in a buffer consisting of 70 mm sucrose, 220 mmmannitol, and 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, to a 34-ml continuous sucrose gradient (30–60% (w/v)) in 0.4 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Subsequent to a centrifugation at 104,000 × g for 24 h, the major mitochondrial band, located at the 49% (w/v) sucrose region on the basis of marker enzyme assays, was harvested by centrifugation after a 20-fold dilution with the sucrose-mannitol, pH 7.4, buffer. The purified mitochondria were treated with digitonin for 15 min at 0 °C by the procedure of Schnaitman and Greenawalt (10Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), to yield mitoplasts, which were collected by centrifugation and washed with buffer at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Centrifugation of the mitoplast supernatant (144,000 × g, 60 min) yielded intermembrane proteins in the soluble fraction. The mitoplasts were subsequently incubated at 0 °C for 15 min in Lubrol WX to yield inner membranes, which were obtained by centrifugation at 144,000 × g for 60 min after a 3-fold dilution with buffer. The supernatant from this centrifugation was considered to represent matrix proteins. The purity of the mitoplasts and the mitochondria from which they were prepared was ascertained by electron microscopy through the courtesy of the Electron Microscopy Core of the Joslin Diabetes Center. Lysosomes were isolated from a mitochondria-lysosome fraction by centrifugation on a discontinuous metrizamide gradient by the procedure of Wattiauxet al. (12Wattiaux R. Wattiaux-de Coninck S.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) were carried out to determine specific activities. The relative specific activities of mitoplast, ER, Golgi, and lysosome fractions for the most revealing marker enzymes were, respectively, as follows: succinic dehydrogenase (100, 4, 1, and 0); glucose 6-phosphatase (0, 100, 8, and 0); β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (1, 2, 4, and 100); and galactosyltransferase (0, 3, 100, and 0). BRL-3A cells (buffalo rat liver from ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown in Coon's modified F-12 medium (Sigma) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, while NRK-45F cells (normal rat kidney fibroblasts, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.0 g/liter of glucose, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 2.5% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). Penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml) were included in the cell cultures, which were carried out at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 on 100-mm dishes (Falcon). Radiolabeling was accomplished by incubating cells, which had reached approximately 80% confluency, on a rocker platform at 37 °C with either 0.75–0.95 mCi [35S]methionine (1,110 Ci/mmol) or 0.6–1.0 mCi of [2-3H]mannose (27 Ci/mmol), both from NEN Life Science Products, in 2 ml of methionine-free or glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, containing 4 mm sodium pyruvate and 2 mm glutamine. Subsequent to a pulse of specified duration, the medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either 2 mm methionine or 2 mm mannose plus 5 mm glucose for a chase of varying periods of time. In a few experiments, the pulse was carried out with 0.6 mCi of [6-3H]glucosamine (33 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) instead of the radiolabeled mannose. The effects of cycloheximide and tunicamycin were evaluated by including these inhibitors in the medium at concentrations of 150 and 1 μg/ml, respectively, for a 30-min incubation before the addition of the radioisotope; the inhibitors were kept in the medium during a 30-min pulse but omitted during a 3-h chase. In some incubations, 0.2 mm6-O-butanoylcastanospermine (a gift of Dr. M. Kang, Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, OH) was included in the medium during a 30-min preincubation as well as during the pulse and chase. At the end of the incubations, the plates were washed with ice-cold PBS (0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl) containing unlabeled substrate (2 mmmethionine, mannose, or glucosamine), and the cells were then harvested by centrifugation after scraping into cold PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin (10 units/ml). Subsequently, the cells were either homogenized in preparation for density gradient centrifugation or submitted to lysis. The latter procedure was carried out at 4 °C with a lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mmNaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 15 min. After harvesting from the culture plates, [3H]mannose-labeled or unlabeled BRL-3A cells were homogenized in 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose by 12 consecutive passages through a 22-gauge needle, followed by 10 passages in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The postnuclear supernatants (800 × g, 10 min) of the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 20 min to obtain a pellet, which, after suspension in 1 ml of 10 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.25 msucrose, was layered on a 10-ml 2.5–40% metrizamide gradient in 10 mm NaHEPES (26Tolleshaug H. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar) for centrifugation in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 114,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. Successive 1-ml fractions were removed from the top of the gradient, and after dilution with 6 ml of the buffered 0.25 m sucrose, their content was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 20 min. After the addition of 300 μl of the lysis buffer, the fractions from radiolabeled cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by PAGE. For enzyme assays, the centrifuged fractions from unlabeled cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 m sucrose. The density of the fractions from the metrizamide gradient was determined from their refractive index (28Rickwood D. Birnie G.D. FEBS Lett. 1975; 50: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Antisera were prepared in rabbits against rat liver mitochondrial fractions including inner membrane, intermembrane, and matrix proteins, as well as mitoplasts by a program of multiple intradermal injections (29Vaitukaitis J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) consisting initially of 700 μg of protein followed by booster doses of 250 μg of protein each. Bovine heart mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Hatefi of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (La Jolla, CA), and antibodies against this enzyme, as well as against rat liver ER and lysosomal proteins, were raised in rabbits in a similar manner. Rabbit antiserum against rat liver mitochondrial F1-ATP synthase, which is known to immunoprecipitate mitochondrial complex V (30Cretin F. Baggetto L.G. Denoroy L Godinot C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), was a gift of Dr. C. Godinot (Université Claude Bernard de Lyon I), while rabbit anti-mouse cathepsin L serum was generously made available by Dr. G. Sahagian (Tufts University). Antiserum against rat serum albumin raised in rabbits was purchased from Cappel. Antibody-coated beads were prepared by gently shaking for 2 h at room temperature 30 μl of a 1:1 suspension of PBS-washed protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) with 30 μl of antiserum or preimmune serum, followed by washing with PBS and PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of cell lysates and lysed metrizamide gradient fractions, precleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, were then added to the coated beads and shaken for 2 h at room temperature in a total volume of 400 μl of lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. After pelleting by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the beads were washed four times with 500 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, and protease inhibitors. Protein was then released from the washed beads by boiling for 5 min in PAGE sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Electrophoresis was carried out on 7–10 or 7–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels (1.5 mm thick), overlaid by a 3.5% stacking gel, in SDS according to the procedure of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Radioactive components were detected by fluorography, while protein bands were visualized by the Coomassie or silver stains. For immunological identification, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The sheets were washed with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin containing 0.05% Tween 10, and then they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 200-fold diluted normal goat serum. Subsequent to further washes with this solution, incubation of the sheets with diluted antiserum was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was then detected with125I-labeled protein A followed by autoradiography as described previously (33Mohan P.S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4328-4336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated protein was released from the protein A beads by boiling for 3 min in 25 μl of buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. The solubilized protein obtained after removal of the beads by centrifugation was then incubated in a 125-μl volume with either 0.6 units of PNGase (PNGase F, Oxford GlycoSystems) or 10 milliunits of endo H (Genzyme) for 30 and 48 h, respectively, at 37 °C in the presence of aprotinin (10 units/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), and toluene. The composition of the buffer for the PNGase digestion was 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, 6 mm EDTA, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.02m 2-mercaptoethanol, while that for the endo H treatment was 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 5.2, 0.1% SDS, and 0.02m 2-mercaptoethanol. At the end of the digestions, the samples, as well as control incubations without enzyme, were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Glycopeptides were prepared from [2-3H]mannose-labeled immunoprecipitated proteins by incubating the beads to which they were bound with Pronase (Calbiochem), as described previously (34Rabouille C. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11573-11578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endo H treatment of the glycopeptides released polymannose oligosaccharides, which, after passage of the digests through coupled columns of Dowex 50 (H+) and Dowex 1 (acetate), appeared in the effluent and water wash (35Moore S.E. H Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the resins were eluted with 2 m pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, to recover endo H-resistant peptide-linked carbohydrate units (35Moore S.E. H Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the polymannose oligosaccharides was evaluated by thin layer chromatography on plastic sheets precoated with Silica Gel 60 (0.2-mm thickness, Merck) in 1-propanol/acetic acid/water (3:3:2), and the components were visualized by fluorography as previously reported (35Moore S.E. H Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated radiolabeled protein after elution from protein A beads was adjusted to an SDS concentration of 0.05% and added to 0.15 ml of packed concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide. Subsequent to shaking for 1 h at room temperature, the supernatant was removed, and after several washes with the adsorption buffer, the bound protein was eluted sequentially with 300 mm methyl α-d-mannoside and by heating the beads at 100 °C for 5 min in PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The unbound and bound fractions were then examined by SDS-PAGE. Liquid scintillation was carried out in Monofluor (National Diagnostics) with a Beckman LS7500 instrument. Components on electrophoretic gels and thin layer chromatographic plates were detected by fluorography at −80 °C with the use of X-Omatic AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) after treatment with ENHANCE (NEN Life Science Products) or spraying with a scintillation mixture containing 2-methylnaphthalene (36Spiro M.J. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5808-5815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Components on immunoblots were visualized by autoradiography. In order to determine whether glycoproteins are present in mitochondria and to assess their site of synthesis and nature of their carbohydrate units, we chose an approach that involves immunoprecipitation of defined components after metabolic radiolabeling of cultured cells. Examination of SDS-PAGE immunoblots of antisera prepared in rabbits against rat liver mitoplast and its various subfractions (inner membrane, intermembrane, and matrix) indicated that they provided a suitable tool for such experiments, because whereas they yielded a distinctive multibanded pattern when employed against their respective fractions, they did not react with other purified rat liver membrane fractions including ER, lysosomes, and Golgi (data not shown). Conversely, antibodies directed against rat serum albumin and cathepsin L did not react with the mitochondrial components, whereas as anticipated they bound strongly to these proteins on immunoblots of ER and lysosomal fractions, respectively. After radiolabeling of the rat liver BRL-3A cell line with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitates obtained with antisera against mitochondrial subfractions were examined by SDS-PAGE with or without prior PNGase digestion to assess the possibility that glycoproteins are present (Fig. 1). Indeed, a comparison of the enzyme-treated and untreated samples indicated that the inner membrane contained a component of 45 kDa, which was reduced in mass to approximately 42 kDa, suggesting the release of N-linked carbohydrate. A similar PNGase-sensitive protein was evident in the mitoplast (Fig. 1), and after prolonged fluorography it could also be detected in the intermembrane fraction. Examination of the immunoprecipitate from antisera directed against the mitochondrial matrix did not reveal this protein or any other PNGase-sensitive component (data not shown). Since the studies with PNGase indicated that the inner membrane contains a relatively prominent glycoprotein, our subsequent studies focused on this mitochondrial subfraction. Indeed, incubation of BRL cells with [2-3H]mannose to specifically label glycoproteins withN-linked oligosaccharides indicated that the inner membrane immunoprecipitate contained a major radiolabeled component with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa, which was predictably also present in the mitoplast but only barely perceptible in the mitochondrial intermembrane compartment (Fig.2). Moreover, antisera directed against mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and ATPase (complex V) immunoprecipitated from the lysate of [2-3H]mannose-labeled BRL cells a 45-kDa protein as the major radioactive component (Fig. 3); aside from this predominant 45-kDa protein, minor radioactive bands could be revealed by prolonged fluorography. Since digestion of these immunoprecipitates with endo H completely released the radiolabel from the 45-kDa component, it can be inferred that the [2-3H]mannose is present in one or twoN-linked polymannose oligosaccharides (Fig. 3).Figure 3Electrophoretic examination of [2-3H]mannose-labeled components of mitochondrial inner membrane enzyme complexes and evaluation of the effect of endo H treatment on inner membrane glycoproteins. Following incubation of BRL-3A cells with [2-3H]mannose (1-h pulse, 3-h chase), lysates of the cells were reacted with antisera against inner membrane mitochondrial proteins (In, left panel; Inner, right panel), intermembrane proteins (It, left panel), NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) (Ub, left panel; Ubiqu,right panel), and F1-ATPase (complex V) (ATPase, right panel) as well as preimmune serum (Pr) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitates after elution from the protein A-Sepharose beads were submitted directly to SDS-PAGE (7–15% gradient, left panel) or digested with (+) or without Endo H (−) followed by PAGE (7–10% gradient, right panel). Components were detected by fluorography; the molecular mass markers are the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When BRL cells were radiolabeled with [6-3H]glucosamine, the 45-kDa radiolabeled band was also seen upon SDS-PAGE as the predominant radioactive component of the mitochondrial inner membrane immunoprecipitate (data not shown). Furthermore, when the [2-3H]mannose labeling protocol was applied to another rat cell line (NRK-45F) a major 45-kDa radioactive component was also seen upon SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitate of the inner mitochondrial membrane (data not shown). In order to confirm the subcellular locale of the 45-kDa glycoprotein observed in the immunoprecipitates of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the mitochondrial enzyme complexes examined, we employed metrizamide gradient centrifugation. By this procedure, partial resolution of lysosome, mitochondria, and ER was achieved, as determined by enzyme markers, so that the peak tubes of the organelles were well separated (Fig.4). Since antibodies directed against ER, mitochondrial inner membrane, and lysosomal proteins immunoprecipitated in each case a distinct group of components from lysates of [2-3H]mannose-labeled BRL cells (Fig. 5), the antibodies could be utilized to follow the distribution of these subcellularly localized glycoproteins on a metrizamide density gradient. Indeed, the distribution of the lysosomal, inner mitochondrial membrane, and ER immunoprecipitates along the gradient was very similar to that observed with the respective enzyme markers (cf. Fig. 4 and Fig.6, left panel). When we examined the immunoprecipitates throughout the gradient by SDS-PAGE, the glycoprotein banding pattern distinctive for each subcellular fraction was observed across its respective peak, and this is exemplified by the fluorographs from the tubes showing maximal radioactivity (Fig. 6, right panel). The occurrence of a small inner mitochondrial membrane peak overlapping with that of the lysosome most likely represents the incorporation of mitochondrial material into the latter by autophagy, as has been reported in liver cells (37Knecht E. Martinez-Ramón A. Grisolia S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1433-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Figure 6Metrizamide gradient fractionation of subcellular fractions from [2-3H]mannose-labeled BRL-3A cells.

From previous studies of the human enzymes, sequence alignments of family 20 enzymes, and analysis of the SmChb x-ray structure, we selected and mutated putative SpHex active site residues. Arg162 → His mutation increased Km40-fold and reduced Vmax 5-fold, providing the first biochemical evidence for this conserved Arg residue (Arg178 in human β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (HexA) and Arg349 in SmChb) as a substrate-binding residue in a family 20 enzyme, a finding consistent with our three-dimensional model of SpHex. Glu314 → Gln reduced Vmax296-fold, reduced Km 7-fold, and altered the pH profile, consistent with it being the catalytic acid residue as suggested by our model and other studies. Asp246 → Asn reduced Vmax 2-fold and increasedKm only 1.2-fold, suggesting that Asp246 may play a lesser role in the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme.

This enzyme may be important for the efficient degradation of polysaccharides by Streptomyces species (1Robbins P. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In humans, the importance of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase is illustrated by the fatal neurodegenerative disorders that result from its deficiency. Human β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (HexA), a heterodimer of subunits α (encoded by HEXA) and β (encoded byHEXB), is essential for the degradation of ganglioside GM2 (2Gravel R.A. Clark J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1807-1839Google Scholar). Mutations in HEXA or HEXBcause Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, respectively. Structure/function studies of HexA have been limited by the difficulty in producing levels of recombinant HexA in mammalian expression systems that are sufficient for kinetic analysis (3Brown C.A.

The classification of glycosyl hydrolases into families based on amino acid sequence similarity has greatly facilitated the identification of evolutionary and mechanistic relationships between these enzymes (5Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar, 6Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 7Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). To date, 63 glycosyl hydrolase families have been identified, 24 of which have a three-dimensional structure determined for at least one member. Family 20 contains β-N-acetylhexosaminidases and chitobiases (EC 3.2.1.52) and are thought to use an acid/base mechanism that involves a proton donor and a nucleophile (8Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Serratia marcescens chitobiase (SmChb) is the only family 20 member for which a three-dimensional structure has been determined (9Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). According to the 1.9-Å resolution crystallographic model,SmChb appears to lack the nucleophilic residue necessary for catalysis. Alternatively, Tews et al. (9Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) suggest that theN-acetyl group on the nonreducingN-acetylglucosamine residue of the chitobiose substrate may act as the nucleophile (substrate-assisted catalysis) (9Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The structure also predicts that Glu540 is the proton donor and that Arg349 is directly involved in substrate binding. Both residues are conserved among family 20 enzymes. In human HexA, mutagenesis studies of the α- and β-subunit residues homologous toSmChb Glu540, α-Glu323 and β-Glu355, respectively, have been identified as likely proton donors (10Fernandes M.J.G.

These studies on HexA provide biochemical support for Glu540 of SmChb as the proton donor in family 20 enzymes; however, there is no biochemical evidence in the literature that supports the suggestion that Arg349 ofSmChb or its homologue in other family 20 enzymes is a substrate binding residue. We have sequenced the gene encoding SpHex, classified it as a new member of family 20 glycosyl hydrolases, and constructed a three-dimensional model of the SpHex enzyme by comparative molecular modeling. In conjunction with the molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis was used to demonstrate a role for Arg162 (human HexA, α-Arg178; SmChb, Arg349) in substrate binding. Our biochemical analysis of Glu314 (human HexA, α-Glu323; SmChb, Glu540) and Asp246 (human HexA, α-Asp258; SmChb, Asp448) mutations further substantiate the role of these residues in family 20 enzymes. These studies indicate that the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes may be conserved. Finally, multiple sequence alignments of the enzymes indicate thatSpHex is significantly more related in structure to human HexA and -B than SmChb. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was used for all plasmid manipulations and fusion protein production. Plasmid DNA was purified using the Nucleobond AX purification system (Macherey-Nagel). Restriction enzymes and Klenow fragment were from New England Biolabs. Restriction enzyme digests and filling-in 3′-recessed ends of DNA were according to New England Biolabs instructions. T4 DNA ligase was from Boehringer Mannheim, and DNA ligations were performed according to their instructions. Liquid cultures of S. plicatus (American Type Culture Collection number 27800) were grown at 25 °C in International Streptomyces Project tryptone yeast extract broth (ISP medium 1) (Difco). Stocks of S. plicatus were maintained on ISP agar plates at 4 °C. Clone 36, expressingSpHex (1Robbins P. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was previously identified by screening a λ-ZAP library using 4-methylumbelliferyl (4-MU) glycosides ofN-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides as a substrate for an in plate assay (12Robbins P.W. Albright C. Benfield B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clone 36 was found to have a 5.0-kb insert and expressed a 60-kDa fusion protein (1Robbins P. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Based on this, the coding region for SpHex was predicted to be within a 1.8-kb region of the insert adjacent to the β-galactosidase gene in the vector. The 1.8-kb region, bounded by EcoRI (5′) and SmaI (3′) sites, was restriction enzyme-mapped and subcloned into pBluescript (pBS+) (Stratagene) as two smaller fragments. The subclones were sequenced at the National Centers of Excellence core sequencing facility (Toronto, Canada) by the dideoxy chain termination method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). Sequencing was done on double-stranded DNA and covered both strands. To clarify the sequence in some areas, we used sequence-specific primers to sequence single-stranded DNA produced from a 1.8-kb EcoRI/SmaI clone (psHEX-1.8). To obtain the 5′-end of the SpHex gene, genomic DNA was isolated from S. plicatus according to Nisen et al. (14Nisen P. Medford R. Mansour J. Purucker M. Skalka A. Shapiro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), except that the chloroform-extracted DNA was not dialyzed prior to use. The genomic DNA was digested with combinations of XhoI and various restriction enzymes, and fragments that hybridized to a 600-bp AscI/XhoI32P-labeled probe, complementary to the 5′-end of clone psHEX-1.8, were identified by Southern blotting (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-10.17Google Scholar). A 1.7-kbEcoRV/XhoI fragment was predicted to contain approximately 1.1 kb of sequence beyond the known 5′-end of the gene. An area of an agarose gel containing this fragment was excised, purified using a Geneclean II kit (BIO 101), ligated into pBS+ (EcoRV/XhoI), and electroporated into E. coli. The resulting colonies were screened by hybridization (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-10.17Google Scholar) using the same DNA probe as described above. Ten positive colonies were identified, one of which (ps5HEX-1.7) was used to determine the sequence of the 5′-end of the SpHex gene. A 700-bp fragment was removed from the 5′-end of the ps5HEX-1.7 insert by digestion with SmaI and EcoRV. The larger vector (4.2 kb) was purified from the 700-bp insert using a Geneclean II kit and religated to create ps5HEX-1.0. Upon sequencing 284 bp of the 5′-end of the psHEX-1.0 insert (both strands), the complete coding sequence of the SpHex gene could be determined. The predicted amino acid sequence had one open reading frame (starting at position 269 of GenBankTM accession number AF063001) and showed homology to other family 20 β-hexosaminidases in a ClustalW1.7 (16Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R.N.S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar, 17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55629) Google Scholar) multiple sequence alignment. This sequence was compared with protein sequences available in the EMBL/SWISS-PROT data base (release 34; 59,021 sequence entries) using MaxHom, a weighted dynamic multiple sequence alignment algorithm (18Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates forSmChb were obtained from the Brookhaven National Laboratory Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1qbb) and used as a template for molecular modeling. The best alignment between the amino acid sequences of SpHex, SmChb, and the 13 other known family 20 glycosyl hydrolases was obtained using ClustalW1.7. To improve the alignment, sequences that increased the frequency of insertions and deletions were sequentially removed, and the remaining sequences were realigned. This minimized the number of insertions and deletions within the SpHex sequence and maximized alignments of the secondary structural elements as visualized using the graphics program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The final sequence alignment between SpHex and SmChb was optimized manually by comparing initial models of SpHex to the x-ray structure of SmChb using O (20Mosimann S. Meleshko R. James M.N.G. Proteins. 1995; 23: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Using Homology (Insight software, BioSym Technologies, Inc.), the aligned amino acid sequence of SpHex was substituted onto the SmChb backbone atomic coordinates. Initial side chain steric clashes were relieved using a rotamer library containing the most favorable residue side chain conformations. No amino acid insertions into the SpHex model were required, and gaps were manually joined using the program O. Serious steric clashes were relieved manually. The model was placed in a primitive lattice (P1 space group) and subjected to energy minimization using a conjugate gradient target function implemented in X-PLOR (21Powell M.J.D. Math. Prog. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 22Brunger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993: 125-127Google Scholar). The cell parameters were set sufficiently large to avoid intermolecular contacts during minimization. Minimization was performed with the van der Waals and electrostatic terms turned on. The model was minimized until convergence was reached, as judged by the root mean square of the energy gradient (average derivative < 0.1 kcal/mol/Å). The overall quality of the model was assessed with the program PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), using comparison values typical for a 2.0-Å resolution x-ray structure. A construct pMAL-c2-SpHex (a gift from New England Biolabs) was made by subcloning the insert from clone 36 (BamHI/Hind III) into pMAL-c2 (XmnI/HindIII). TheBamHI site was filled in to facilitate subcloning and to allow for correct translation of the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-SpHex fusion protein. 2S. Wong-Madden, personal communication. To remove 3.2 kb of extraneous DNA, pMAL-c2-SpHex was digested withSmaI and HindIII, the HindIII site was blunt-ended, and both the larger vector (7 kb) and a 1.8-kb (SmaI/SmaI) fragment containing the coding region, were gel-purified and ligated to generate pmHEX-1.8. A plasmid with the fragment ligated in the correct orientation was chosen using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide (4-MUG) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.) as substrate for an in plate assay (12Robbins P.W. Albright C. Benfield B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA from psHEX-1.8 was isolated (24Carter P. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 1-25Google Scholar) using M13K07 (New England Biolabs) and mutations were introduced following instructions from Bio-Rad based on the procedure of Kunkel et al. (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) but using T7 polymerase (26Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated oligonucleotides (ACGT Corp., Toronto, Canada) 5′-TCGGCGGCGACCAGGCGCACTCCAC-3′, 5′-CACGAAGTCGTAGGTGACGT-3′, and 5′-GTCCCCGAGATCAACATGCCGGGCC-3′ were used to create the substitutions G1208C (Glu314 → Gln), G753A and G754T (Arg162 → His), and G1004A (Asp246 → Asn), respectively. Newly synthesized double-stranded DNA isolated and purified using the Geneclean II kit (4Cao Z. Petroulakis E. Salo T. Triggs-Raine B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14975-14982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The product (20–40%) was transformed into E. coli and colonies containing mutant plasmid constructs were identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the relevant region followed by restriction enzyme digestion (base change G1208C created a ScrFI site, G753A and G754T combined destroyed a MspI site, and G1004A destroyed a TaqI site). Fragments containing the mutation(s) were subcloned into pmHEX-1.8 (AscI/BsrGI fragment contained either G753A and G754T or G1004A; BsrGI/AgeI fragment contained G1208C) to create the various mutant pmHEX-1.8(s). The subcloned regions were sequenced to confirm that only the desired base changes had occurred. SpHex-MBP fusion protein was prepared in batches based on instructions from New England Biolabs except that fusion protein expression was induced at 25 °C, and E. coli suspensions were supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A prior to lysis. Incubation of the purified fusion protein with 2% (w/w) factor Xa protease (New England Biolabs) in 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm CaCl2 for 18–24 h at room temperature facilitated cleavage of the MBP from SpHex. The fusion protein and cleavage products were visualized using SDS-PAGE as described elsewhere (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as the standard. To determine the pH optima for mutant and wild typeSpHex, activities for each were measured using 4-MUG as a substrate in 10 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm citric acid, 0.3% bovine serum albumin ranging from pH 2.0 to 9.0. After a 45-min incubation at 25 °C, each reaction was quenched with 0.1 m glycine-carbonate buffer, pH 10. The fluorescent product, 4-MU, was measured (excitation, 364 nm; emission, 448 nm) using a Hitatchi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Kinetic data for mutant and wild type SpHex were obtained in an identical manner at the pH optimum of the wild type enzyme using 4-MUG concentrations ranging from 0.033 to 5 mm. Km and Vmax values were determined using the direct linear plot method (29Henderson P.J.F. Eisenthal R. Danson J. Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 277-313Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-SpHex-MBP fusion protein antibodies were raised at the National Biological Laboratories (Oakbank, Canada). Briefly, purified SpHex-MBP fusion protein emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously at multiple sites. Two weeks later, the antigen was emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously at multiple sites. This step was repeated 3 weeks later. Serum was collected 1 week after the final injection. To obtain a crude S. plicatus cytosolic fraction for immunoblotting experiments, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in 4 ml of TNE (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. The suspension was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer for 1 min at 4 °C and sonicated (6 times for 15 s) at 100 watts on ice using a Braun-sonic 1510 (B. Braun Melsungen AG). The lysate was centrifuged at 20000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant, considered to be the crude cytosolic fraction, was stored at −20 °C. For immunodetection, protein samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (w/v)) containing 5% milk powder and for a further 1–2 h in the same buffer containing primary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h in TBST containing 5% milk powder. After washing with TBST, the antigen-antibody complex was detected using ECL from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Originally, clone 36 was classified as a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase on the basis of its substrate specificity (1Robbins P. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In a search for enzymes related to human β-N-acetylhexosaminidase that might be useful for structure/function analysis, we determined the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme (SpHex) encoded by clone 36. This sequence did not include an initiating Met codon, indicating that a portion of the 5′-end of the gene was missing. This was not surprising, given that SpHex had to be produced as a β-galactosidase fusion to allow its expression in E. coli (1Robbins P. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the molecular masses of the recombinant and native SpHex were indistinguishable (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that only a small portion of the 5′-end of the SpHex gene was missing from the clone. An additional clone (ps5HEX-1.0) containing the 5′-end of the gene was obtained, and 284 bp of new sequence was determined. The complete coding sequence revealed a 1683-bp open reading frame, encoding 561 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the SWISS-PROT data base using MaxHom identified 12 β-N-acetylhexosaminidases and one chitobiase, all family 20 enzymes (TableI). SmChb, which has not been deposited in the SWISS-PROT data base, was retrieved from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and compared with the SpHex by pairwise alignment using MaxHom (Table I). Thus, not only didSpHex have the substrate specificity of a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, its primary amino acid sequence was most similar to those glycosyl hydrolases that are members of family 20 (chitobiases and β-N-acetylhexosaminidases) (9Tews I.

https://openalex.org/W2159203886,"Genetic instability investigations on three triplet repeat sequences (TRS) involved in human hereditary neurological diseases (CTG·CAG, CGG·CCG, and GAA·TTC) revealed a high frequency of small expansions or deletions in 3-base pair registers in Escherichia coli. The presence of G to A polymorphisms in the CTG·CAG sequences served as reporters for the size and location of these instabilities. For the other two repeat sequences, length determinations confirmed the conclusions found for CTG·CAG. These studies were conducted in strains deficient in methyl-directed mismatch repair or nucleotide excision repair in order to investigate the involvement of these postreplicative processes in the genetic instabilities of these TRS. The observation that small and large instabilities for (CTG·CAG)175 fall into distinct size classes (1–8 repeats and approximate multiples of 41 repeats, respectively) leads to the conclusion that more than one DNA instability process is involved. The slippage of the complementary strands of the TRS is probably responsible for the small deletions and expansions in methyl-directed mismatch repair-deficient and nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells. A model is proposed to explain the observed instabilities via strand misalignment, incision, or excision, followed by DNA synthesis and ligation. This slippage-repair mechanism may be responsible for the small expansions in type 1 hereditary neurological diseases involving polyglutamine expansions. Furthermore, these observations may relate to the high frequency of small deletionsversus a lower frequency of large instabilities observed in lymphoblastoid cells from myotonic dystrophy patients.

Simple repetitive sequences are known to cause misalignment-mediated DNA synthesis errors that give rise to instabilities (22Kunkel T.A.

These deletions and expansions are thought to be due to the formation of unusual DNA secondary structures that can cause frame shift (small slipped register) mutations during DNA synthesis (26Wells R.D. Sinden R.R. Davies K.E. Warren S.T. Genome Analysis. 7. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 107-138Google Scholar). Mono- and dinucleotide repeats including Z-DNA-forming sequences readily show sequence length polymorphisms, presumably due to multiple slippages in templates (22Kunkel T.A.

Much less is known about the involvement of these repair systems in the instability of TRS (10Jaworski A. Rosche W.A. Gellibolian R. Kang S. Shimizu M. Bowater R.P. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl.

The mechanism of TRS expansion that is responsible for the hereditary neurological diseases has not been fully elucidated. However, the mechanism responsible for large expansions (scores or hundreds of TRS), such as for CTG·CAG in myotonic dystrophy and CGG·CCG for the fragile X syndrome, is DNA replication errors caused by the slipped register of the DNA complementary strands along with transient formation of hairpin loops and DNA polymerase pausing with primer relocation and strand elongation (11Kang S.

Jakupciak and R. D. Wells, submitted for publication. Small expansions are also extremely important for certain types of inherited neurological diseases that involve polyglutamine expansions that are encoded by CTG·CAG repeats. Normal gene products seem to tolerate a rather wide variation in the size of a polyglutamine tract (between 10–35 glutamines without any detectable adverse effects beyond a threshold of 35–40 glutamines) in five of the eight known diseases. However, when the tracts are beyond this threshold, pathological properties are observed. For all of the eight diseases known to share this mechanism, a strong inverse correlation exists between the length of the polyglutamine tract and the age of onset of clinical symptoms; for each added glutamine residue beyond the threshold, on average, a 1.5–2-year earlier onset age is found (48Trottier Y. Zeder-Lutz G. Mandel J.-L. Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 447-453Google Scholar). Furthermore, in lymphoblastoid cell lines from myotonic dystrophy patients, two types of mutations of the expanded CTG·CAG repeat alleles were detected: frequent mutations that showed small changes in the repeat size and relatively rare mutations with large changes in the CTG·CAG repeat. We believe that the large changes in repeat size observed in this human cell line are due to replication or recombination as elucidated in simpler cells (11Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 12Kang S. Ohshima K. Jaworski A. Wells R.D. J. Mol.

However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the small instabilities has not been identified and may be rather different from that involved with the large instabilities. As part of our ongoing program to elucidate the molecular events involved in genetic instabilities as related to human neurological diseases, we have investigated small slipped register genetic instabilities. These small expansions and deletions found in E. coli were studied optimally in the absence of certain repair functions (methyl-directed mismatch repair or nucleotide excision repair), since these activities would be expected to recognize the looped structures formed in the slipped TRS conformation. All plasmids used in these experiments containing repeating (CTG·CAG)n inserts are shown in Fig. 1. The inserts may also be designated (TGC·GCA)n or (GCT·AGC)n. pRW3248 is a derivative of pUC19 NotI and was described previously (10Jaworski A. Rosche W.A. Gellibolian R. Kang S. Shimizu M. Bowater R.P. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11019-11023Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The plasmid contains (CTG)175 as the leading strand template for replication, termed orientation I. This sequence is not homogenous but contains two G to A interruptions at repeats 28 and 69. pRW3297, pRW3296, and pRW3294 are derivatives of pUC19 containing different lengths of (CTG·CAG) in orientation I and were constructed and characterized in this laboratory. 4K. Ohshima, unpublished results. pRW3297 contains (CTG·CAG)73 and G to A interruptions at repeats 28 and 59; pRW3296 contains (CTG·CAG)57 and G to A interruptions at repeats 28 and 43; pRW3294 contains (CTG·CAG)42 and a G to A interruption at repeat 28. pRW3024 is a pUC19NotI-based plasmid containing the (CGG·CCG)24insert cloned into the BamHI site, where the CGG is in the lagging strand template (14Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). pRW3808 is a derivative of pUC18NotI (49Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6568-6572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the (GAA·TTC)176 fragment inserted into the BamHI site of the vector (50Ohshima K. Montermini L. Wells R.D. Pandolfo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14588-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The plasmid was obtained by the in vivo expansion technique (11Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and the GAA strand is in the leading strand template (50Ohshima K. Montermini L. Wells R.D. Pandolfo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14588-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). pRW3832 and pRW3821 are derivatives of pSPL3 vector (51Church D.M. Stotler C.J. Rutter J.L. Murrel J.R. Trofatter J.A. Buckler J.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and contain (GAA·TTC)15 and (GAA·TTC)59, respectively. These plasmids were constructed and characterized in this laboratory.4 The following E. coli MMR mutator phenotype strains were used. KA796 (ara, thi, Δpro-lac) is a parent (wild type) of the MMR-deficient strains; NR8039 is isogenic with KA796 but is also mutH101; NR8040 is isogenic with KA796 but is also mutL101; and NR8041 is isogenic with KA796 but is also mutS101. These strains were the kind gift of Dr. R. Schaaper (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC) and were used previously (10Jaworski A. Rosche W.A. Gellibolian R. Kang S. Shimizu M. Bowater R.P. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11019-11023Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To study the influence of the NER on the frequency of mutations of (CTG·CAG)n sequences, the following E. colistrains were used. AB1157 (thr-1, ara-14, leuB6, Δ(gpt-proA)62, lacY1, tsx-33, qsr' − , glnV44(AS), galK2, λ, arc − hisG4(Oc), rfbD1, mgl-51, rpsL31(Sm R ), kdgK51, xylA5, mtl1, argE3(Oc), thi-1) is a parent (wild type) of the NER-deficient strains; E. coli AB1886 is isogenic with AB1157 exceptuvrA6; E. coli AB1885 is isogenic with AB1157 except uvrB5; E. coli AB2421 is isogenic with AB1157 except uvrA6uvrB45. Strains AB1157, AB1886, and AB1885 were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. E. coli AB2421 was a gift of Dr. E. Tang (University of Texas System Cancer Center Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, TX). For the recloning of the plasmids containing expansion and deletion products, we used E. coli HB101 (Life Technologies, Inc.): mcrB, mrr, hsdS20, (rB− , mB− ), recA13, supE44, ara14, galK2, lacY1, proA2, rplS20 (SmR), xyl5, λ − , leuB6, mtl-1. The plasmids containing various lengths of repeating (CTG·CAG) sequences were transformed into the appropriate E. coli strain and grown for a number of generations, as described (9Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli cells were transformed with plasmids, and an aliquot of this mixture was inoculated into 10 ml of LB containing ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. Incubations of the liquid cultures were continued overnight at 37 °C at a shaking rate of 250 rpm. The bacteria then were subcultured into fresh liquid media with a dilution factor of 107. The cells from each culture were harvested, and plasmids were isolated. Plasmids with deletions in the (CTG·CAG)175 insert were obtained as follows. TheE. coli parental MMR proficient strain and themutS, mutL, and mutH mutants harboring pRW3248 were grown for approximately 100 generations. Plasmids were isolated and cleaved with SacI and HindIII to release the triplet repeat-containing inserts, which were analyzed by PAGE at room temperature (data not shown). Bands corresponding to fragments with fewer than 175 triplet repeat units were purified from the gels and recloned into theSacI/HindIII-linearized pUC19 NotI. The ligated DNA was electroporated into E. coli HB101. ThisE. coli strain was chosen because it provided greater stability for the TRS-containing plasmids. Cells were then spread on ampicillin plates. In order to minimize further deletions in the inserts, single colonies were grown to early logarithmic phase (A600 ≤ 0.7) (9Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, and plasmids were isolated. These TRS instabilities were experienced in the primary MMR-proficient and -deficient strains rather than in the secondary cloning in E. coli HB101; only one of the 25 clones analyzed from the wild type cells (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III) showed any small instabilities. The number of triplet repeats and the positions of the interruptions in these clones were determined by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method and by restriction analyses. The same technique was used to analyze the repeat composition of (CTG·CAG)73 from pRW3297. pRW3294 and pRW3296 were very stable and contained only nondeleted (CTG·CAG) inserts.Table IRepeat composition of deletion products of (CTG · CAG)175 in wild type and MMR-deficient strainsCloneNumber of repeats in the insertPosition of interruption(s)Number of pure repeats between interruptionsObserved changes in repeat compositionExpansionsDeletionsabcabcWild type 1∼15028, 6940∼25 210528, 694070 310128, 694074 4,5>7028<105 645130* 741134* 840135* 939136* 1035139* 11–1432143* 1527148* 1626149*mutL 1713628, 32, 723, 394142 1813328, 7748850 198928, 7546692 20812894 216528110 2251124* 2349126* 2443132*mutS 25>13628, 68391<39 268828, 7546693 2769271105 286928106 296728108 305028125 3149271125mutH 3214028, 32, 723, 394138 33, 34>13628, 6940<39 3513328, 6839141 36, 376828107 386528110 3965291111 406128114 416028115 425828117 4349126*Forty-three clones harboring deleted inserts were isolated from the MMR-proficient strain (wild-type), as well as the mutL,mutS, and mutH strains (see “Experimental Procedures”). The number of repeats found by DNA sequencing for each of the clones is tabulated in the second column. The quality of the sequencing data enabled the precise determination of the number of repeats except for the cases otherwise designated (clones 1, 4, 5, 25, 33, and 34). However, in all cases, the locations of the interruptions, presented in the third column, were unambiguous. The fourth column lists the number of CTG units between two or more interruptions. The size and location of the expansions and deletions are shown in the fifth column, where a represents the region from the 1st to the 28th triplet repeat, b from the 29th to 69th, and c from the 70th to 175th. Expansions and deletions within these deletion products occurred within the region specified (numbers under a, b, or c) as well as in region b plus c (numbers between letters b and c) and in a to c (numbers with asterisks).

https://openalex.org/W2107647665,"Macrophage scavenger receptors are trimeric integral membrane proteins that bind a diverse array of negatively charged ligands. They have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and in host responses to microbial infections. Earlier mutational studies demonstrated that the distal segment of the collagen domain of the receptor was critically important for high affinity ligand binding activity. In this study, mutations spanning the entire collagen domain were generated and binding was assayed in transfected cells, as well as in assays employing a secreted, receptor fusion protein. Many of the distal, positively charged C-terminal residues in the type II collagen domain of the receptor, previously reported to be essential for binding at 37 °C, were found not to be critical for binding at 4 °C. Conversely, more proximally charged residues of the collagen receptor that have not been previously mutated were shown to have substantial effects on binding that were also temperature-dependent. These data suggest that scavenger receptor ligand recognition depends on more complex conformational interactions, involving charged residues throughout the entire collagen domain, than was previously recognized.

Macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit a breadth of ligand binding specificity that is unusual among cell surface endocytotic receptors. This property may facilitate macrophage participation in a wide variety of host defense and immunologic responses. Although most interest in macrophage scavenger receptors has focused on their role in the uptake and degradation of modified forms of low density lipoprotein (LDL), 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; SR, scavenger receptor(s); AcLDL, acetylated LDL; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; SR, scavenger receptor(s); AcLDL, acetylated LDL; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.

The discovery that scavenger receptors may also participate in cell adhesion further strengthens this hypothesis (8Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). An elucidation of the structural features of scavenger receptors that confer their broad but yet restricted binding specificity might, therefore, yield useful insights into a variety of macrophage-associated host defense responses. The cDNAs encoding two forms of the macrophage scavenger receptor, now termed SR class A type I and type II receptors, were initially isolated using bovine lung mRNA (9Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 10Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M.

The amino acid sequence of the type I receptor suggested that the protein could be divided into six domains (4Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J.

Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). The type II receptor differs from type I only in that it lacks the cysteine-rich C terminus, instead possessing a 6–17-residue (varying with species) C-terminal truncated tail. The type II receptor was shown to bind the ligands traditionally used to define SR function (10Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) establishing that the cysteine-rich domain could not be the major ligand binding region of the scavenger receptor. As the known ligands for the SR are all polyanionic, it was initially postulated that the SR collagen sequences might serve as the receptor binding domain, because all 24 Gly-X-Y triplets of the bovine collagen region would be predicted to be neutral, or positively charged, at physiologic pH. Recent experimental work has provided support for that initial hypothesis. Acton et al. (17Acton S. Resnick D. Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Ashkenas J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3530-3537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a scavenger receptor mutant lacking the C-terminal 16 Gly-X-Y repeats of the collagen domain of the bovine receptor was incapable of binding the defining ligand for the scavenger receptor, acetylated LDL (AcLDL). This mutation did not appear to disrupt other aspects of scavenger receptor cell biology, such as receptor synthesis, trimerization, post-translational modification, or cell surface stability. It was also demonstrated to inhibit the activity of a co-transfected wild type receptor. Similar findings were reported by Dejager et al. (18Dejager S. Mietus-Snyder M. Friera A. Pitas R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) who also showed that collagen truncation mutants could inhibit the activity of endogenous scavenger receptors, when cDNAs encoding the truncation mutants were transfected into the mouse macrophage cell line, P388D1. To identify more precisely the critical amino acids in the collagen domain, Doi et al. (19Doi T. Higashino K. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Miyazaki T. Nakamura H. Uesugi S. Imanishi T. Kawabe Y. Itakura H. Yazaki H. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2126-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) generated a series of deletion mutants as well as point mutations affecting the positively charged residues found in the last six Gly-X-Y triplets of the human collagen domain. These receptors were studied in degradation and binding assays utilizing COS cells transfected with cDNAs encoding the mutant forms of the receptors. Binding and degradation of AcLDL was analyzed in these transfected cell lines. Convincing evidence was presented to support the contention that several positively charged residues in the C terminus of the collagen domain were important for the binding and degradation of modified lipoprotein ligands. The authors (19Doi T. Higashino K. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Miyazaki T. Nakamura H. Uesugi S. Imanishi T. Kawabe Y. Itakura H. Yazaki H. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2126-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of this work concluded that Lys-337 is essential for binding and that the four “lysine cluster in the most C-terminal portion of the collagen is the ligand-binding domain of the scavenger receptor.” In this paper, we report the results of binding studies, utilizing both transfected cells and a direct receptor protein binding assay, to perform a broader mutational analysis of the collagen domain of the macrophage scavenger receptor. It is demonstrated that a scavenger receptor/human IgG fusion protein can assemble into higher weight oligomers, including the characteristic trimeric form of the native SR. These fusion proteins, after purification by affinity column chromatography, retain the ability to bind SR ligands with affinity comparable to that of the native receptor expressed on the cell surface. Whereas mutational studies of both the fusion proteins and their transmembrane analogues confirm the importance of the C-terminal collagen residues for ligand binding, they also indicate that other residues outside this region are equally critical for receptor binding. Importantly, the restoration of binding at 4 °C to several different receptor proteins with mutations in charged residues, previously thought to be critical to ligand interactions, provides strong evidence that the prevailing paradigm for SR binding interactions is incomplete. Temperature-dependent binding activity alterations, demonstrated in both proximal and distal collagen subdomain mutants, suggest that these mutations substantially alter the conformation of the receptor, rather than simply effect a loss of ionic receptor-ligand interactions. These data make it clear that the current model of SR binding, which postulates an ionic interaction between ligand and receptor, involving the distal segment of the collagen domain, cannot account for the full complexity of the binding behavior of this receptor. All cell culture incubations were at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. COS M7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. For cell degradation assays, native and mutant forms of pXRSR2 (13Bickel P.E. Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a plasmid containing the rabbit type II scavenger receptor in pCDNA-1 (Invitrogen, San Diego), were transfected into the COS cells using the DEAE-dextran method described by Aruffo and Seed (20Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The ability of the transfected cells to degrade 125I-AcLDL in the presence or absence of inhibitors was measured 72 h after transfections. All degradations were conducted at 37 °C for 5 h as described previously (13Bickel P.E. Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins used in these assays as well as for the ligand blots and binding assays were prepared by methods previously detailed (21Krieger M. Cell. 1983; 33: 413-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Iodination of the lipoproteins was accomplished by a modified iodine monochloride reaction (22Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The overall structure of the proteins used in this study are schematically depicted in Fig. 1. By using the polymerase chain reaction, a nine amino acid epitope sequence, TETSQVAPA, encoding a C-terminal epitope of the rhodopsin receptor (23Hodges R.S. Heaton R.J. Parker J.M. Molday L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11768-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated as an in-frame addition to the C terminus of the rabbit type II SR using pRABSR2 (13Bickel P.E. Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) DNA as the template. The polymerase chain reaction primers contained 5′ BamHI and 3′XbaI sites, and these sites were used to ligate the epitope sequence into wild type pRABSR2 that had been digested withBstYI and XbaI. The epitope sequence encoded a translational stop codon immediately distal to the final alanine of the epitope sequence. The epitope sequence was then transferred to the type II SR COS cell expression plasmid, pXRSR2 (13Bickel P.E. Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These two plasmids, pXRSR2 and pXRSR2-epi, were then used to generate mutant receptor cDNAs by the oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis method of Kunkel (24Kunkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were generated by creating a BamHI site in pXRSR2 immediately distal to the putative receptor transmembrane sequence via the polymerase chain reaction. This fragment was then ligated in frame to the Fc portion of a human IgG cDNA that contained a BamHI site immediately distal to the IgG sequence. This construct was generated in a CDM-8 COS cell expression derivative, pCD5speγΔC71, kindly provided by Dr. Brian Seed (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston). A similar construct was made using the epitope containing scavenger receptor sequences, whose creation is described above. To generate mutant forms of the fusion protein, mutations were first generated in pXRSR2 or pXRSR2-epi by the Kunkel method and then transferred to the human IgG-SR fusion construct by cleavage withApaLI, an enzyme with a restriction site in the coiled-coil region of the SR and a second site in the origin of replication sequence found in both pCD5speγΔ71 and pCDNA-1. All mutations were sequenced from the start of the collagen domain to its terminus using the dideoxy chain termination method and Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The rhodopsin epitope antibody, ID4 (23Hodges R.S. Heaton R.J. Parker J.M. Molday L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11768-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Frank Kowalkowski (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston). The monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibody, ASAb-1, was generated in Balb/c mice by injection of purified fusion protein. Splenic fusions and hybridoma generation were performed according to the protocols of Harlow and Lane (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 196-218Google Scholar). Following separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a Bio-Rad Mini-Transblot apparatus, using 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol as the transfer buffer. Transfers were performed at 150 mA for 2 h. After transfer, the membrane was blocked for 1 h in PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Tween, and 10% dried milk (Buffer A), washed × 2 with Buffer A minus the milk (Buffer B), and then incubated for 30 min with first antibody diluted in Buffer A. For ID4 (protein A purified from mouse ascites fluid), a dilution of 1:1000 was employed; the supernatant from hybridoma 7180–112 (ASAb-1) was used at a 1:5 dilution. The unbound first antibody was removed with 4 washes of Buffer B. A 30-min incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) in Buffer A was then performed. The membrane was then washed 4 × with Buffer B and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) according to the manufacturer's (Sigma) instructions. Ligand blots were performed according to a modification of the procedure of Daniel et al. (26Daniel T.O. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4606-4611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AcLDL was substituted for LDL, and the binding and wash buffers were substituted 50 mm NaCl for 90 mm NaCl. Rabbit anti-human LDL antibody (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA) was used at a 1:5000 dilution in conjunction with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:1000. Development with DAB was done as for the immunoblots. For quantitative ligand binding assays,125I-AcLDL was used (1 × 106 cpm per filter strip) to bind to nitrocellulose strips on which fusion proteins had been transferred. Equal amount of protein, as measured by a modified Bradford assay (Pierce), were loaded in each lane of the gel prior to transfer. All binding assays were done in triplicate. For saturation binding studies, receptor-coated plastic wells (Terasaki plates) were employed. Plates were coated initially with 0.5 μg of fusion protein, in PBS, pH 7.4, for a minimum of 4 h at 4 °C. The wells were then blocked with 0.25% BSA, 0.05% Tween, and 0.02% azide for 4 h. Wells were washed with PBS and then incubated with125I-AcLDL for 4 h at 4 °C. Competition was performed in the presence of unlabeled AcLDL (400 μg/ml) or poly(I) (100 μg/ml). After washing the wells three times with PBS, the wells were excised and counted in a gamma counter. cDNAs encoding fusion proteins were transfected into COS cells as described above. 24 h after transfection, the cells were extensively washed with PBS, and the COS cell media were replaced with a serum-free substitute (Opti-MEM from Life Technologies, Inc.). 48–72 h subsequent to this, the media were collected; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm final concentration) was added to it, and the media were then chilled to 4 °C. After chilling, the media were adjusted to 100 mmTris before binding to 0.5 g of protein A (Sigma) that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. Binding was performed on a shaking platform overnight at 4 °C. The protein A was then packed into an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech 10/10 column. By using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system, the column was then washed with 10 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by 10 ml of 10 mmTris, pH 8.0. Protein was eluted from the column in 100 mmglycine, pH 3.0, using on-line UV absorption monitoring at 280 nm. The eluate was immediately buffered with one-tenth volume of 1.0m Tris, pH 8.0, to which phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added (0.5 mm final concentration). The protein eluate was stored at −20 °C until used. Data from saturation binding studies were analyzed using a modified version of the Ligand program (RADLIG; G.A. McPherson, Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). Curve fitting was done using both a one-site and a two-site binding model. The molecular weight of apolipoprotein B (518,000 daltons) was used to estimate the molarity of AcLDL protein. The SR fusion proteins created for this study are depicted in Fig.1. These proteins were encoded by rabbit type II cDNAs from which the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain sequences had been removed. They were replaced with a signal sequence and Fc domain derived from human IgG. Wild type scavenger receptor cDNAs (for use in cell degradation studies) and fusion receptor cDNAs were also modified so as to encode a rhodopsin epitope sequence at the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 1). The epitope tag was originally designed to assay receptor expression on the surface of transfected cells. Although the epitope tag was readily detected under the denaturing conditions used for the immunoblots, its detection on intact cells was unreliable, perhaps indicating that access to this C-terminal tag is blocked when the SR is folded into its native, trimeric structure. The demonstration by Resnick et al. (27Resnick D. Chatterton J.E. Schwartz K. Slayter H. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26924-26930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that the extended C terminus of the type I scavenger receptor appears to fold into a globular domain tightly juxtaposed to the fibrous strands of the collagen domain provides some support for this hypothesis. The nine amino acid epitope sequence did serve two other purposes as follows: 1) to identify any unintended frameshift mutation that could have occurred in the mutagenesis process and that might have eluded detection by DNA sequencing; 2) to permit detection of the epitope-containing proteins by immunoblot. To ensure that the binding of ligands to the SR fusion proteins was dependent only on the presence of the SR sequences within the fusion, a truncated protein (IgGS), containing only the human IgG Fc fragment, was also generated. Mutant receptors cDNAs, corresponding to the fusion proteins, but retaining their cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, were also generated for use in cellular degradation experiments following transfection into COS cells. After DEAE-dextran transfection of COS cells with the receptor cDNAs, secreted proteins were collected in a serum-free medium and then purified by protein A column chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows an autoradiogram of the column eluate that resulted from this procedure following [35S]methionine labeling of COS cells transfected with the wild type fusion cDNA. Under reducing conditions, a single predominant band of approximate molecular mass of 95 kDa was visualized (Figs. 1 and2 B). The expected molecular weight of the fusion protein is the sum of the mass of the IgG fragments (approximately 30 kDa) plus the mass of the SR's extracellular domains. The extracellular domains of the type II SR would be expected to have a mass of 57–64 kDa (the highly homologous intact bovine type II receptor was previously shown to have a mass of between 65 and 72 kDa (28Penman M. Lux A. Freedman N.J. Rohrer L. Ekkel Y. McKinstry H. Resnick D. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23985-23993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the two SR domains removed in the fusion construct have a calculated mass of 8.3 kDa). Thus, the 95-kDa fusion protein migrated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the expected size range. The yield of fusion protein varied between 4 and 12 μg per 10-cm transfection plate, 72 h after transfection, with most transfections typically yielding 6–8 μg per plate. COS cells continued to secrete fusion proteins for at least 120 h from the time of transfection, making it possible to obtain additional protein with subsequent media collections. Minimal non-scavenger receptor protein contamination of the protein A-purified preparations was visible after [35S]methionine labeling (Fig. 1 and data not shown). A protein of approximately 50 kDa (Fig. 2) was consistently evident on Coomassie staining of electrophoresed proteins. This protein had no ligand binding activity (Fig.3 A) and was subsequently determined to be residual bovine IgG, deriving from the calf serum in which the COS cells were originally cultured. More extensive washing and depletion of calf serum of IgG before use eliminated this contaminant (see Fig. 4).Figure 3Ligand blots with fusion proteins. A, scavenger receptor fusion proteins, containing wild type collagen domains, when electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, bind AcLDL. The gel depicted in Fig.2 A was transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mmTris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 5 μg/ml of AcLDL was then incubated with the filter in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After washing the filter with Buffer A (containing only 10 mg of BSA mg/ml), the AcLDL bound to filter proteins was detected using a rabbit anti-human LDL antibody (1:5000 dilution in Buffer A) followed by binding with a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-labeled second antibody (1:1000 dilution in Buffer A). Color detection was performed using DAB according to the manufacturer's (Sigma) instructions. B, binding of AcLDL to scavenger receptor fusion proteins is competed by poly(I). A Bio-Rad Mini Transblot apparatus was used to transfer wild type and mutant fusion proteins using the methods described in Figs. 2and 3. AcLDL binding and detection of bound ligand were also performed as described in A.

Protein was detected by Coomasie staining (A andB). In the unreduced state, there appear to be four major regions of protein staining of the wild type fusion protein. The lack of discrete bands is due to variable glycosylation of the scavenger receptor portion of the fusion proteins. These four regions have approximate molecular masses, in descending order, of 400, 300, 180, and 100–130 kDa. The three higher weight proteins are multiples of the 95-kDa monomeric mass of the SR fusion protein and are presumed to be tetramers, trimers, and dimers. The band migrating between 100 and 130 kDa may represent dimers of poorly glycosylated fusion proteins or proteolytic fragments of the higher molecular weight oligomers. Neither contaminating bovine immunoglobulin nor the control human IgGS protein binds AcLDL, as seen by the lack of lipoprotein staining on ligand blots (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 7, respectively). As previously shown by Penman et al. (28Penman M. Lux A. Freedman N.J. Rohrer L. Ekkel Y. McKinstry H. Resnick D. Krieger M. J. Biol.

The putative tetrameric protein present in Fig. 3 A could represent the addition of a monomer to the trimer, via a second disulfide linkage between the cysteine residues present in the hinge region of the Fcportion of the fusion protein, or a dimer of dimers.

Calpain inhibitors inhibited the cleavage of the β3 cytoplasmic domain, indicating that calpain is required. Calpain-mediated proteolysis of fodrin was also detected, indicating that calpain is activated during endothelial cell apoptosis. A phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, inhibited endothelial cell apoptosis and cleavage β3, suggesting that protein dephosphorylation preceded integrin cleavage in the apoptosis signaling pathway. β3 cleavage was observed in cells that were viable, suggesting that it is an early event and not the consequence of post-death proteolysis. The extent of β3 cleavage correlated with a loss in the capacity of cells to reattach to matrix proteins. Loss of reattachment capacity during apoptosis was significantly retarded by a calpain inhibitor. As the β3cytoplasmic domain is required for integrin signaling and interaction with the cytoskeleton, our results suggest that cleavage in the β3 cytoplasmic domain by calpain or a calpain-like protease negatively regulates integrin-mediated adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeleton association.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 1The abbreviations used are: HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated fluorescein-dUTP nick end labeling; EGM, endothelial cell growth medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. were grown and maintained in endothelial cell growth medium (EGM, Clonetics) supplemented with an additional 8% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were used between passages 2 and 10. HUVECs were serum-starved by incubation in serum-free medium containing M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (nuclease- and protease-free; Calbiochem), and insulin, selenium, and transferrin (GMS-G; Life Technologies, Inc.). For incubation in suspension culture, cells were detached with 0.01 mNa2HPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (PBS/EDTA) and resuspended in EGM containing 0.5% methylcellulose (Sigma). Cells were plated on tissue culture dishes coated with 2% agarose (Sigma) in M199 medium to prevent attachment (17Meredith J.J. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). For reattachment experiments, cells incubated in suspension for 12 h were isolated by centrifugation, washed with PBS/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C and then re-plated on tissue culture dishes in EGM. Cells were allowed to adhere and spread for 30 min. Adherent cells were lysed directly on the dish or were detached by PBS/EDTA and quantitated by cell counts prior to lysis. Unattached cells were collected by centrifugation. Both adherent and unattached cells were solubilized in buffer as described below and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were isolated and washed twice with PBS/EDTA; for serum-starved cells, adherent cells were detached by incubation with PBS/EDTA and then recombined with the floating cells prior to lysis. Cells were lysed by incubation in 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm E64, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting either with antibody, anti-β3C, against the C-terminal region of the β3 cytoplasmic domain or with the anti-β3antibody. Reactions with antibodies were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Kodak X-Omat AR film. The immunoblots were scanned, and the uncalibrated optical density of each band was quantitated using NIH Image. Cells in suspension were isolated and incubated in PBS/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C prior to fixation in 2% formaldehyde (methanol-free; Polysciences)/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS and then extracted in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% trisodium citrate for 2 min on ice. Cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were labeled by incubation with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and fluorescein-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C. Labeled cells were washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan). To investigate the possibility that proteolysis may regulate integrin function during apoptosis, HUVECs were induced to undergo apoptosis by incubation in suspension. We and others have shown previously that endothelial cells undergo apoptosis when cultured in suspension which is characterized by DNA fragmentation and apoptotic morphology (17Meredith J.J. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar, 18Re F. Zanetti A. Sironi M. Polentarutti N. Lanfrancone L. Dejana E. Colotta F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In agreement with these previous results, cells in suspension showed characteristic apoptotic morphology (Fig. 1), and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2). Cells in suspension began to undergo apoptosis after 6 h of incubation, as demonstrated by labeling of fragmented DNA (Fig. 2 A). The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with increasing time in suspension (Fig. 2 A). Cells incubated in suspension for various lengths of time were solubilized in the presence of protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of lysates were then immunoblotted with anti-β3 antibodies. Two different antibodies were used; the antibody anti-β3 recognizes epitopes in the extracellular domain, while the antibody anti-β3C recognizes epitopes located in the C-terminal 20 residues of the cytoplasmic domain (14Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26146-26151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Expression of the extracellular domain epitopes is essentially constant over the time course (anti-β3, Fig. 2, B and C). However, expression of the cytoplasmic domain epitopes significantly decreased with increasing lengths of time in suspension (anti-β3C, Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that the C-terminal domain is lost from a population of β3 subunits as a result of suspension culture. The time course of this loss of immunoreactivity with anti-β3C paralleled the time course of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2, compare A and B), suggesting that this effect may be linked to the process of apoptosis.Figure 2Suspension culture induces apoptosis and loss of immunoreactivity with the antibody against the C-terminal domain of integrin β3 subunit. HUVECs were cultured in suspension for increasing lengths of time. A, cells were labeled by incubation with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) and fluorescein-dUTP for 1 h at 37 °C.

Since there have been reports that calpain is activated during apoptosis of T cells (5Squier M.K. Miller A.C. Malkinson A.M. Cohen J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 6Sarin A. Adams D.H. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7Sarin A. Clerici M. Blatt S.P. Hendrix C.W. Shearer G.M. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 862-872PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether calpain may be responsible for the loss in endothelial β3cytoplasmic domain immunoreactivity. HUVECs were incubated in suspension for various lengths of time in the absence or presence of the membrane-permeable calpain inhibitor E64d. 20 μm E64d was used since a higher concentration of E64d (100 μm) was toxic to cells. Cell lysates were then analyzed for reactivity with anti-β3C by Western blot. As shown in Fig.3, E64d significantly inhibited the loss of the β3 cytoplasmic domain immunoreactivity during apoptosis, indicating that calpain or a calpain-like protease is responsible for the cleavage of the β3 cytoplasmic domain. Similar to E64d, another membrane permeable calpain inhibitor, calpain inhibitor I, also inhibited cleavage of the β3cytoplasmic domain (not shown). To verify whether calpain is activated during apoptosis of endothelial cells, we examined whether fodrin, a known calpain substrate (8Martin S.J. O'Brien G.A. Nishioka W.K. McGahon A.J. Mahboubi A. Saido T.C. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6425-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 12Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is cleaved during suspension culture-induced apoptosis. Lysates from suspension-cultured endothelial cells were immunoblotted with an antibody specifically recognizing a calpain cleavage site (GMMPR) at the N terminus of the 150-kDa calpain-generated fragment of fodrin (12Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes its epitope only when fodrin is cleaved by calpain at this specific site (12Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No calpain-generated fragments of fodrin were detected in control endothelial cell lysates. After suspension culture, however, generation of the 150-kDa fodrin fragment was shown by reactivity with the calpain cleavage-specific antibody (Fig. 4). Generation of the 150-kDa fodrin fragment was maximal after 12 h; however, longer incubation in suspension resulted in a decrease in the fodrin fragment reactive with the antibody, suggesting further degradation of fodrin. In the presence of the calpain inhibitor, E64d (20 μm), there was a significant decrease in the generation of the 150-kDa fodrin fragment after 12 h of incubation and the peak of 150-kDa fragment generation was retarded to the 24-h time point. This result indicates that calpain is activated and cleaves fodrin during endothelial cell apoptosis, and, consistent with the effects of E64d on integrin cleavage (Fig. 3), suggests that intracellular calpain-like activity was only partially inhibited by E64d. To determine whether the cleavage of β3 cytoplasmic domain was a consequence of apoptosis signaling, we tested the effect of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, Na3VO4. We have shown previously that Na3VO4 blocks apoptosis of suspension-cultured HUVECs (17Meredith J.J. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in suspension for 12 h in the absence or presence of Na3VO4. In agreement with previous results, Na3VO4prevented apoptosis of suspension cultured endothelial cells as indicated by TUNEL assay (Fig.5 A). When these suspension-cultured cells were solubilized and immunoblotted with anti-β3 antibodies, we found that the β3cytoplasmic domain was protected from cleavage in the presence of Na3VO4 (Fig. 5 B). This effect was dose-dependent (data not shown) and correlated with the ability of Na3VO4 to block apoptosis (Fig.5 A). Thus, suspension culture per se is not responsible for the cleavage of β3 cytoplasmic domain. Rather, cleavage of β3 cytoplasmic domain occurs downstream of protein dephosphorylation in the apoptosis signaling pathway. To investigate whether cleavage of the integrin cytoplasmic domain is unique in suspension-culture induced apoptosis, endothelial cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by serum withdrawal. As shown in Fig.6, cells in serum-free medium became apoptotic, but at a much slower rate compared with that induced by suspension culture. Fig. 6 (D and E) shows a time-dependent reduction in the reaction of anti-β3C with the integrin from endothelial cells cultured under serum-free conditions, indicating that cleavage of the integrin cytoplasmic domain occurred during apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. Thus, cleavage of the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain is not unique for suspension-induced apoptosis, but is likely to be in the convergent signaling pathway induced by different apoptotic stimuli. We examined whether β3 modification occurs as a step in the apoptosis signaling pathway or is a result of post-death proteolysis. To address this issue, we induced endothelial cell apoptosis by incubating cells in suspension culture for 12 h, then separated the late-phase apoptotic cells from cells in earlier phases of the apoptosis pathway. Cells were separated by their ability to re-adhere to serum-coated dishes (vitronectin is known to be the integrin ligand responsible for cell adhesion to serum-coated plates; Ref. 35Fath K.R. Edgell C.-J.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 67-75PubMed Google Scholar). We found that nonadherent cells displayed the characteristic apoptotic morphology (not shown, cf. Fig. 1) while reattached cells appeared normal (Fig. 7). Lysates generated from both re-attached cells and nonadherent cells were then analyzed for immunoreactivity with the anti-β3C antibody. Equivalent amounts of lysates from adherent endothelial cells were also examined as controls. In comparison with control cells, suspension-cultured cells showed significantly less (about 60%) reactivity with the anti-β3C antibody even though these cells reattached to the matrix (Fig. 7). This indicates that cleavage of the β3 cytoplasmic domain was initiated before cells lost the capacity to reattach. As dead cells do not adhere, this result suggests that integrin cleavage is not the result of post-death proteolysis. Furthermore, the reattached apoptotic cells appeared to have a normal morphology (Fig. 7, A and B), which also suggests that cleavage of β3 is an early event and may be associated with the early phases of apoptosis signaling. Integrin β3 from non-adherent cells showed further reduction in immunoreactivity with anti-β3C compared with the cells reattached to serum-coated plates (Fig. 7, C andD). Similar results were obtained when cells were replated on collagen or fibronectin (Fig. 7 E). Thus, it appears that the majority of integrin β3 subunits are cleaved in late phase apoptotic cells that have lost their capacity to reattach and spread onto matrix proteins. The above study suggests a correlation between the loss of cell reattachment capacity and cleavage of the integrin cytoplasmic domain by calpain. To investigate whether calpain is indeed involved in regulation of cell adhesion during apoptosis, we examined the effects of E64d on cell readhesion. HUVECs were incubated in suspension for increasing lengths of time in the absence or presence of E64d, and then allowed to reattach to tissue culture plates. The percentage of reattached cells at each time point was then determined. Although the percentage of cell reattachment at each time point varied from experiment to experiment, we did observe a significant rescue of cell reattachment in the presence of E64d in each of the these paired experiments at the 6- and 12-h points (Fig.8). The paired Student's ttest of data from three experiments indicated a significant rescue of cell reattachment by E64d (p < 0.01). However, no significant inhibition by E64d was observed after 24 h of incubation in suspension (Fig. 8). Thus, our results suggest that calpain or a calpain-like protease is indeed involved in the loss of cell reattachment capacity during early phases of apoptosis. Incomplete inhibition of reattachment by E64d is consistent with a partial inhibition of calpain or calpain-like proteolytic activity by E64d (cf. Figs. 3 and 4). In this study, we have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β3 subunit is cleaved during apoptosis in HUVECs (Fig. 2). Cleavage was detected by loss of reactivity with an anti-peptide antibody, anti-β3C, which recognizes the β3 C-terminal domain. We showed previously that anti-β3C immunoreactivity was lost when the cytoplasmic domain of β3 was cleaved by calpain (14Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26146-26151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In apoptotic endothelial cells, the loss of anti-β3C immunoreactivity was inhibited by two different calpain inhibitors, E64d and calpain inhibitor I (Fig. 3). As these calpain inhibitors do not inhibit caspases (4Nicholson D.W., A., A., A., T.N. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Greau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3762) Google Scholar), caspases are unlikely to be responsible. Also, as these calpain inhibitors do not inhibit DNA fragmentation of suspension-cultured endothelial cells (data not shown), it is unlikely that their effect was due to inhibition of suspension culture-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, cleavage of fodrin by calpain was also detected in the suspension cultured endothelial cells, suggesting that calpain is activated under these conditions (Fig. 4). Thus, the loss of reactivity with anti-β3C is likely to result from proteolytic cleavage of β3 by calpain. However, since we showed only a partial inhibition of integrin and fodrin cleavage by E64d, we cannot exclude the possibility that a different protease may also be involved. Cleavage of the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain is linked to the early phase of the convergent apoptosis signaling pathway. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, cleavage of β3 was induced by two different apoptotic stimuli and was accompanied by induction of the apoptotic phenotypes (DNA fragmentation and morphological changes), suggesting that cleavage may be associated with the convergent apoptotic pathway. Second, cleavage of integrin was blocked by the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor that also blocks endothelial cell apoptosis induced by either suspension culture (Fig. 5) (17Meredith J.J. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar) or serum starvation (36Yang C. Chang J. Gorospe M. Passaniti A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 161-171PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the cleavage occurs downstream the activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in the apoptosis signaling pathway. Although it is not clear how protein phosphatases are involved, it is known that survival of anchorage-dependent cells requires signals initiated by adhesion receptors (e.g.integrins) and growth factor receptors, both of which activate protein-tyrosine kinases as early signaling mechanisms (for reviews, see Refs. 16Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar and 37Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4568) Google Scholar). Either abrogation of integrin binding to matrix proteins or growth factor withdrawal may result in changes in the balance between the protein-tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities, leading to dephosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Thus, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor is likely to function in the early phase of apoptosis pathway. Finally, the conclusion that calpain cleavage occurs in the early phase of apoptosis is supported by our finding that cleavage was initiated when cells were still able to readhere and showed apparent normal morphology (Fig. 7). Cleavage of the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain may negatively regulate integrin functions. Calpain cleavage sites in the β3 cytoplasmic domain have been identified in vitro and in platelets; these sites flank the two NXXY motifs (14Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26146-26151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The NXXY motif is highly conserved among different integrin β subunits, including β1 and β5 which are also found in endothelial cells. We have evidence that the β1 cytoplasmic domain is also a calpain substrate. 2X. Du, unpublished data. The NXXY motifs in β1 and β3 are required for the localization of integrins to focal adhesion sites, integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase and also required for regulating ligand binding affinity (26O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Truncation of the β3cytoplasmic domain that removes C-terminal sequences containing the NXXY motif abolishes formation of the integrin-focal adhesion complex, abrogates integrin-mediated cell spreading, and inhibits integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (27Ylanne J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7892-7898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the cleavage of integrin β subunits, in concert with the cleavage of other focal adhesion proteins, leads to disruption of integrin-mediated adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeleton organization. In support of this viewpoint, we have observed a correlation between the extent of integrin cleavage and the ability of apoptotic cells to reattach (Fig. 7). In addition, we found that calpain inhibitor E64d significantly retarded the loss of cell reattachment (Fig. 8). Integrin-mediated signaling activates intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which are required for proliferation and survival of anchorage-dependent cells (41Lipfert L.

Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar, 18Re F. Zanetti A. Sironi M. Polentarutti N. Lanfrancone L. Dejana E. Colotta F. J.

Thus, it is also possible that intracellular disruption of integrin survival signals by calpain cleavage, if occurring to adherent anchorage-dependent cells, serves as a feedback signaling mechanism that induces or accelerates apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that the suspension cultured cells will re-adhere and spread when ∼40% of β3 is cleaved, but lose the capacity to re-adhere when ∼70% of the integrin is cleaved (Fig. 7). This is very similar to results from studies of patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a genetic deficiency in the integrin αIIbβ3. Platelets obtained from heterozygotes (50% αIIbβ3 expression) showed no significant deficiency in adhesion while platelets expressing less than 30% of functional integrin were abnormal (46George J.N. Caen J.P. Nurden A.T. Blood. 1990; 75: 1383-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that cell reattachment may require only a fraction of the total integrins expressed. However, the finding that cells with ∼40% of integrin cleaved are still able to reattach does not suggest that the cleavage of a small percentage of integrin will not affect integrin function. Rather, it is possible that cleavage of a small population of integrins, if localized to existing integrin-focal adhesion sites of adherent cells, would abolish integrin signaling and cytoskeleton association in those specific focal adhesion sites, and thus promote cell rounding and detachment. Cleavage of integrin in existing focal adhesion sites of adherent cells is likely since calpain is colocalized in focal adhesion sites (47Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and cleaves several focal adhesion proteins (9Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H.

Chem. 1985; 260: 1060-1066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One approach to further determine the roles of calpain cleavage of integrins during apoptosis is to inhibit calpain cleavage of integrin. Experiments using calpain inhibitors, however, are complicated by the fact that calpain cleaves several intracellular proteins and plays multiple roles in cell survival and growth. Calpain inhibitors inhibit the cleavage and clearance of p53, which is pro-apoptotic, and thus induce apoptosis and growth arrest (48Mellgren R.L. Lu Q. Zhang W. Lakkis M. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15568-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 49Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We also have found that high levels of E64d and calpain inhibitor I are toxic. In addition, calpain inhibitors may have nonspecific effects such as inhibition of proteasome activity by calpain inhibitor I (50Shinohara K. Tomioka M. Nakano H. Tone S. Ito H. Kawashima S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Multiple roles of calpain in cells explain previous contradictory results that calpain inhibitors both inhibit and induce apoptosis in different experiments (5Squier M.K. Miller A.C. Malkinson A.M.

Thus, further elucidation of the roles of cleavage of integrin in the apoptosis pathway awaits the development of new tools to specifically inhibit integrin cleavage without affecting the other cellular roles of calpain.

In addition, the characterization of adenylyl cyclase by mutagenic techniques and the identification of the binding site for P-site inhibitors have led to modeling studies that describe the ATP-binding site. Despite these advances, the catalytic mechanism of adenylyl cyclase remains uncertain, especially with respect to the role that magnesium ions may play in this process. We have identified four mutant mammalian adenylyl cyclases defective in their metal dependence, allowing us to further characterize the function of metal ions in the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. The wild-type adenylyl cyclase shows a biphasic Mg2+ dose-response curve in which the high-affinity component displays cooperativity (Hill coefficient of 1.4). Two mutations (C441R and Y442H) reduce the affinity of the adenylyl cyclase for Mg2+ dramatically without affecting the binding of MgATP, suggesting that there is a metal requirement in addition to the ATP-bound Mg2+. The results of this study thus demonstrate multiple metal requirements of adenylyl cyclase and support the existence of a Mg2+ ion essential for catalysis and distinct from the ATP-bound ion. We propose that adenylyl cyclase employs a catalytic mechanism analogous to that of DNA polymerase, in which two key magnesium ions facilitate the nucleophilic attack of the 3′-hydroxyl group and the subsequent elimination of pyrophosphate.

Intracellular levels of cAMP are primarily regulated at the level of its synthesis by adenylyl cyclase. cAMP, in turn, regulates a wide variety of cellular processes such as protein phosphorylation levels, gene expression, and ion channel conductance. Currently, nine isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase have been identified by molecular cloning techniques (reviewed in Refs. 1Cooper D.M.F. Adv. Second Messengers Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-221PubMed Google Scholar, 2Taussig R. Zimmermann G. Adv.

This motif is then repeated with a second transmembrane region (M2) and a large cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus (C2). Sequence comparison has revealed that each cytoplasmic loop contains subdomains (denoted C1a and C2a) that are highly conserved among all adenylyl cyclase isoforms and that also display great homology to each other. The C1a and C2a domains can be expressed separately, and catalytic activity is reconstituted when they are mixed in vitro, although each domain by itself shows no activity (4Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G.

Many of the structural motifs of adenylyl cyclase responsible for catalytic activity and for the recognition of regulatory molecules are presently being uncovered. A region in the C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase (residues 956–982), for example, has been implicated in the binding of the G protein 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; Gsα, the α subunit of the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); ATPαS, adenosine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; Gsα, the α subunit of the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); ATPαS, adenosine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate). βγ subunits (6Chen J.

Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), whereas another region in the C1 domain of type I adenylyl cyclase (residues 495–522) appears to be involved in the regulation by calmodulin (7Wu Z.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The binding sites for forskolin and Gsα, the two common activators of adenylyl cyclase, have recently been characterized by a combination of mutagenic techniques (9Yan S.Z. Huang Z.H. Rao V.D.

Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of adenylyl cyclase also provided the basis for modeling the ATP-binding site of adenylyl cyclase (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 13Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar); however, these structures do not include the MgATP substrate, and several questions remain about the precise catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. The structure of adenylyl cyclase was observed to be remarkably similar to that of DNA polymerase (14Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nature. 1997; 388: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), despite low sequence homologies. This similarity is not surprising because both enzymes catalyze analogous chemical reactions, involving the in-line attack of a ribose 3′-hydroxyl on the α-phosphate of a nucleotide triphosphate, resulting in the release of a pyrophosphate group. DNA polymerase employs two key catalytic aspartate residues that bind two essential magnesium ions (15Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 16Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 17Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). One Mg2+ion is associated with the nucleotide triphosphate, whereas the second one coordinates the 3′-hydroxyl, thus facilitating the nucleophilic attack. The positions of these aspartate residues are spatially conserved in the structure of adenylyl cyclase, where they were shown to bind to at least one Mg2+ ion (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), suggesting that the catalytic mechanism employed by both enzymes is also conserved. Modeling studies on the active site of adenylyl cyclase have predicted a single ATP-bound magnesium ion (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 13Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and suggest that the 3′-hydroxyl is deprotonated by an acidic residue. Although the crystal structure of adenylyl cyclase shows only a single Mg2+ ion (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), an alternative model in which a second Mg2+ ion promotes this deprotonation was acknowledged. Thus, the exact role and number of metal ions in the adenylyl cyclase-catalyzed reaction remain to be elucidated. We have employed a genetic selection system for the identification of mutant adenylyl cyclases defective in their regulatory properties (10Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6968-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This system relies on the expression of mammalian adenylyl cyclase in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and makes use of the requirement of cAMP for growth in yeast (18Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this manner, we identified four mutant mammalian adenylyl cyclases displaying specific defects in their metal dependence. These mutations occur in highly conserved residues that are located in proximity to each other and to the two aspartate residues that coordinate magnesium. Characterization of the metal dependence of these mutants has shown that two of the mutations (C441R and Y442H) cause severe catalytic defects when assayed in the presence of magnesium, without compromising the ability of adenylyl cyclase to bind MgATP. Our data provide evidence for the existence of multiple magnesium-binding sites and strongly support a two-metal mechanism in which one metal ion is complexed with ATP, whereas the second plays a primarily catalytic role. Such a mechanism is remarkably similar to that identified for DNA polymerase, and we propose that this catalytic mechanism may be shared by a diverse family of enzymes involved in phosphoryl transfer reactions.

The procedure for the culture of Sf9 cells and the amplification of recombinant baculovirus have been outlined by Summers and Smith (21Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar). Generation of recombinant baculovirus encoding both the wild-type and mutant type V adenylyl cyclases was performed using the BAC-to-BAC system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (10Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6968-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sf9 membranes containing individual adenylyl cyclase isoforms were prepared as described (22Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Gsα was synthesized in bacteria and purified as described by Lee et al. (23Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by staining with Amido Black (24Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). The α subunits were activated by incubation with GTPγS as described previously (25Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured using the procedure of Smigel (26Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed for 10 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 μg of membrane protein. The concentration of free metal ions was calculated with WinMaxC software that accounts for the buffering effects of 500 μm ATP and 400 μm EDTA in the reaction mixture. Wild-type and mutant type V adenylyl cyclase proteins were purified from Sf9 membranes using published procedures (22Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted as described (27Taussig R. Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using a primary rabbit antibody specific for type V/VI adenylyl cyclase (28Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6968-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prizm program to determine EC50 values and Hill coefficients of the dose-response curves. We have previously reported the development of a yeast genetic selection system for the identification of mutant adenylyl cyclases defective in their regulatory properties (10Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6968-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the system relies on the expression of mammalian type V adenylyl cyclase in a strain of yeast with a deletion in the essential CYR1 gene locus that encodes the yeast adenylyl cyclase (18Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); this strain is non-viable unless cAMP is added to the growth medium. Alternatively, the yeast cells are able to grow when the exogenously expressed mammalian adenylyl cyclase is activated by either forskolin or Gsα. Forskolin and Gsα activate type V adenylyl cyclase synergistically in vitro, and the simultaneous activation of the exogenous adenylyl cyclase in yeast by both activators results in a synergistic increase in intracellular cAMP levels. However, despite these high levels of cAMP, the yeast cells fail to grow, presumably due to toxic effects of cAMP at high concentrations. We have previously reported how this growth phenotype was used to identify mutant adenylyl cyclases defective in their regulation by Gsα (10Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6968-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have employed the yeast selection system to identify adenylyl cyclase mutants with defects in their catalytic activity. This involved expressing a library of randomly mutagenized adenylyl cyclase constructs in the CYR1-deleted yeast strain and selecting for transformants that grow in the presence of both forskolin and Gsα, but that have little or no growth in the presence of either activator alone (data not shown). 21.2 × 105 yeast transformants were obtained following transformation of yeast with a library of randomly mutated adenylyl cyclases (library complexity = 4 × 105). 52 colonies were isolated for their ability to grow in the presence of simultaneous forskolin and Gsαactivation. We reasoned that the mutations in some of these constructs may result in reduced catalytic activities while retaining sufficient activity in the presence of synergistic activation by Gsα and forskolin to support growth. To determine whether the biochemical properties of the mutants could account for the altered growth phenotypes of the yeast, we introduced the mutant constructs into recombinant baculovirus and overexpressed them in Sf9 cells; membranes from these cells were then used as a source of adenylyl cyclase for biochemical studies. Initial characterization involved measuring the activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes in response to various activators in the presence or absence of Mn2+. For wild-type type V adenylyl cyclase, the addition of Mn2+ to adenylyl cyclase resulted in an enhanced basal and forskolin-stimulated catalytic activity, in agreement with previously published studies (29Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with little or no effect on the Gsα-stimulated enzymatic activity (Fig.1 A). Four mutants (F423L, R434S, C441R, and Y442H) were identified that have common defects in their catalytic activity, displaying low activities in the presence of Mg2+, while showing normal activities when Mn2+was added (behavior exemplified by the C441R mutant) (Fig.1 B). This suggests that these mutants are not catalytically compromised, but instead display specific defects in their metal dependence. Recent advances in the structural characterization of adenylyl cyclase have suggested different roles for metal ions in the catalytic mechanism of adenylyl cyclase. The determination of the crystal structure of the catalytic core of adenylyl cyclase has led to models predicting a single Mg2+ ion present in the MgATP substrate complex (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 13Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These structural data, however, did not elucidate how the 3′-hydroxyl is deprotonated, and the possibility that a second Mg2+ ion could assume this role was not excluded (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The structure of the adenylyl cyclase catalytic core was shown to be highly similar to that of the DNA polymerase palm domain (14Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nature. 1997; 388: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase employs two magnesium ions as part of its catalytic mechanism; one is associated with the β- and γ-phosphates of the incoming nucleotide triphosphate, whereas the other coordinates to and activates the attacking ribose 3′-hydroxyl of the terminal nucleotide (reviewed by Steitz (17Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar)). The homology of the structures of adenylyl cyclase and DNA polymerase and the similarities in the chemical reactions they catalyze have led to the prediction that these enzymes share the same catalytic mechanism. To elucidate the role of metal ions in the catalytic mechanism of adenylyl cyclase, we characterized the metal dependence of the wild-type and mutant enzymes by measuring enzymatic activity at varying levels of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the forskolin-stimulated wild-type adenylyl cyclase displayed a biphasic dose-response curve with a high-affinity component (EC50∼ 400 μm) and a low-affinity component that only became apparent at non-physiological concentrations of free Mg2+(>10 mm). In contrast, we only observed a single magnesium component for the Gsα-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (EC50 ∼ 300 μm), and concentrations of Mg2+ above 2 mm actually inhibited this activity (data not shown). All four adenylyl cyclase mutants displayed a rightward shift in their Mg2+ dose-response curves (Fig. 2, A andB), indicating a reduced affinity for the metal ion. The mutants can be grouped according to the severity of this shift, with the F423L and R434S mutants (group I) showing more moderate effects (10–20-fold increase in the EC50 for Mg2+) (Fig. 2 A and Table I) and the C441R and Y442H mutants (group II) displaying more severe shifts (∼100-fold increase in the EC50 for Mg2+) (Fig. 2 B and Table I) in their Mg2+ dependence. All mutants displayed dramatically reduced activities when the dose-response curve was repeated in the presence of Gsα(data not shown), consistent with the observed inhibition of Gsα-stimulated activity at the high concentrations of Mg2+ required to observe forskolin-stimulated activity.Table IProperties of the wild-type and mutant adenylyl cyclaseMutantRelative expressionaExpression levels of active type V adenylyl cyclase mutants in Sf9 membrane preparations were determined by Western blotting and are reported as the percent of the wild-type expression level. As previously described (10), relative expression levels were calculated by determining the activity of the membrane preparations and dividing this value by the specific activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes.

Each plot comprised 10 points ranging from 0 to 2000 μmATPαS, and Ki values were determined as described elsewhere (33Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 100-111Google Scholar). Data are representative of at least three experiments.e WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab Next, we measured the activity of the wild-type and mutant adenylyl cyclases at varying concentrations of Mn2+ (Fig. 2,C and D) to evaluate the strong Mn2+dependence of these mutants. In this case, the wild-type enzyme displayed a dose-response curve with an EC50 of 40 μm, and manganese inhibited at lower concentrations (>1 mm) than magnesium. The group I mutants with moderate Mg2+ defects (F423L and R434S) showed a Mn2+dependence that was almost identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2 C), with EC50 values that did not differ substantially from the wild-type value (Table I). The group II mutants (C441R and Y442H) showed an increase in the EC50 for Mn2+ (10-fold) (Table I), which paralleled the reduction in their affinity for Mg2+, although the latter effect was more severe (100-fold increase in Mg2+ EC50 versus 10-fold shift in Mn2+ EC50). Taken together, these data suggest that the disrupted metal-binding site(s) of these mutants are better able to accommodate manganese than magnesium. The dose-response curves we observed in Fig. 2 could be due to the formation of the metal-ATP substrate during the titration with magnesium or manganese. However, the Mg2+ dependence of the wild-type adenylyl cyclase did not appear to be determined solely by the formation of MgATP because the EC50 of the Mg2+ dose-response curve (400 μm) was significantly higher than the Kd of ATP for Mg2+ (64 μm). In addition, we observed little or no catalytic activity at concentrations of Mg2+sufficient to produce substrate (MgATP) at up to three times theKm value of adenylyl cyclase for MgATP (80 μm) (Table I). These results are consistent with previous reports documenting that Mg2+ concentrations in excess of ATP are required for catalytic activity in cyc −cells of S49 murine lymphoma (30Somkuti S.G. Hildebrandt J.D. Herberg J.T. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6387-6393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Closer examination of the high-affinity component revealed non-hyperbolic behavior, with a Hill coefficient of 1.4, indicating multiple Mg2+ sites (at least two) that display cooperative binding. Our data on the wild-type enzyme therefore suggest a role for a second Mg2+ ion in the catalytic mechanism of adenylyl cyclase in addition to the one present in the MgATP substrate complex. If adenylyl cyclase utilizes only a single magnesium ion, present in the MgATP substrate complex, reducing the affinity of adenylyl cyclase for this Mg2+ should also lower the enzyme's affinity for MgATP. To evaluate this prediction, we measured theKm of the wild-type and mutant adenylyl cyclases for MgATP. As depicted in Table I, the mutants can once again be placed into two groups based on the severity of the shift in theirKm values. In this case, however, the severity of the shift in the Km for MgATP was opposite from that seen in the EC50 for Mg2+. The group I mutants (F423L and R434S) displayed moderate increases both in the EC50 for Mg2+ and in the Kmfor MgATP, whereas the group II mutants (C441R and Y442H) displayed a dramatic increase in the EC50 for Mg2+, but showed only a minor increase in their Km for MgATP. In contrast, none of the mutants displayed significant changes in theirKm for MnATP (Table I), consistent with the small effect these mutations have on enzymatic activity in the presence of Mn2+. To confirm that the changes in Km correspond to defects in the binding of MgATP, we measured the Kiof these cyclase mutants for the competitive inhibitor ATPαS in the presence of Mg2+. We found that the group I mutants (F423L and R434S) showed a large increase in the Ki for ATPαS, whereas the group II mutants (C441R and Y442H) displayed only a moderate reduction in their affinity for ATPαS, paralleling the changes in Km values for MgATP (Table I). Because the Ki values for the inhibitor are primarily dependent on the binding affinity of the enzyme for this compound, these data indicate that the binding of MgATP to the group II mutants is relatively unaffected, whereas the group I mutants have a reduced affinity for MgATP. The large increase in the Km for MgATP and theKi for ATPαS of F423L and R434S suggests that the Mg2+ defect of these mutants may be primarily reducing the affinity of adenylyl cyclase for MgATP, and we did indeed observe normal activities when the MgATP concentrations were raised to 3 mm (data not shown). This interpretation also explains the normal activity of the mutants in the presence of Mn2+because the Km for MnATP is not affected by the mutations (Table I). The dramatic reduction in the affinity of the C441R and Y442H mutants for Mg2+, however, does not appear to reduce the affinity of adenylyl cyclase for MgATP, suggesting that this defect affects the binding of a Mg2+ ion that is essential for catalysis, but not bound to ATP. It is possible that this additional metal requirement is due to an allosteric effect, but the similarities between adenylyl cyclase and DNA polymerase suggest that the second Mg2+ ion fulfills the same function as the ion coordinating the attacking 3′-hydroxyl in DNA polymerase. We next examined the position of the mutated residues in the structure of adenylyl cyclase. All four mutations occur in the C1a cytoplasmic domain of adenylyl cyclase that is highly conserved among all isoforms of adenylyl cyclase as well as the catalytic domains of guanylyl cyclase. Sequence comparison of the nine isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase and the Drosophila rutabaga gene product showed that the four mutated residues are absolutely conserved among these enzymes. Interestingly, the group II mutants are immediately adjacent to Asp-440, which is equivalent to one of two key catalytic Asp residues that bind Mg2+ in DNA polymerase (14Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nature. 1997; 388: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The function of these Asp residues appears to be at least partially conserved in adenylyl cyclase because Asp-440 and Asp-396 were also shown to coordinate to Mg2+ in the adenylyl cyclase crystal structure (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of adenylyl cyclase demonstrates that all four mutated residues, as well as the two Mg2+-binding aspartate residues (Asp-440 and Asp-396), occur in the same region of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3). ATP and the Mg2+ ion coordinating to the 3′-hydroxyl are not part of the crystal structure and are depicted in their approximate positions based on the binding sites for pyrophosphate and the P-site inhibitor 2′-deoxy-3′-adenosine monophosphate (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Asp-440 is located at the top of a β-turn formed by the β2 and β3 strands, whereas Cys-441 and Tyr-442 are immediately adjacent on the β3 strand. It seems likely that mutations in these residues will result in conformational changes of the β-turn, thus disrupting the orientation of Asp-440 and consequently reducing the affinity of the metal-binding pocket for Mg2+. Phe-423 and Arg-434 are more distant from these aspartate residues and are buried beneath the adenylyl cyclase active site. Arg-434 forms part of the β2 strand, whereas Phe-423 is located on the preceding α2 helix. The side chains of these residues lie in close proximity to that of Tyr-442, which points away form the catalytic site. The direct mutagenesis of either catalytic Asp residue in type I adenylyl cyclase was shown to result in inactive enzymes (13Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 31Tang W.J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and thus does not elucidate the function of these residues in catalysis. Our functional data, however, suggest that the group II mutations (C441R and Y442H) reduce the affinity of adenylyl cyclase for metal ions by disrupting the orientation of Asp-440, confirming the essential role that this residue plays in binding Mg2+. The group I mutants (F423L and R434S), on the other hand, are more distant from the catalytic Asp residues and may affect the Mg2+-binding pocket via more global conformational changes. The Mg2+defect of these mutants is primarily reflected in a reduced affinity for MgATP, and thus, it seems likely that the mutations may be reducing the affinity of the aspartic acid residues for the ATP-bound Mg2+. The residue equivalent to Arg-434 was previously targeted for mutagenesis in type I adenylyl cyclase (R348A in type I adenylyl cyclase) (31Tang W.J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast to our data, the mutant shows normal activity and displays no change in the Km for MgATP, indicating that different amino acid substitutions at this position can lead to very different phenotypes. These mutagenic studies (31Tang W.J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) also targeted Glu-518 and Arg-484 (Glu-432 and Arg-398 numbering in type I adenylyl cyclase), producing mutants that also display a strong manganese dependence. The recent availability of detailed structural information reveals that these residues are in close contact to Asp-396 (type V numbering), indicating that the effect of these mutations may be due to a disruption of the orientation of this aspartate residue. These mutants display similar phenotypes to the two groups we describe, with the E518A mutant displaying a shift in theKm for MgATP and the R484A mutant showing an enhanced manganese dependence without changes in Km. These results therefore support the role of Asp-396 in coordinating metal ions, as proposed by the crystallographic analysis of adenylyl cyclase (12Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The characterization of DNA polymerase by mutagenic techniques has also focused on residues adjacent to the key catalytic aspartic acid (Asp-1004 in DNA polymerase α) equivalent to Asp-440 in type V adenylyl cyclase. Mutating either residue adjacent to Asp-1004 in human DNA polymerase α (32Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11028-11040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) results in a phenotype remarkably similar to that observed for the C441R and Y442H mutants. In both cases, the mutant enzymes display low activity in the presence of Mg2+, but normal activity in the presence of Mn2+. In addition, the mutations in DNA polymerase α do not alter the Km of the enzyme for the MgdNTPs, indicating that the binding of nucleotides remains relatively unaffected. Mutations of the catalytic aspartate residue (D1004A) results in a non-functional DNA polymerase α, emphasizing the crucial role of this residue in catalysis and paralleling the effects of this mutation in adenylyl cyclase (31Tang W.J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These striking similarities are likely the result of a shared catalytic mechanism between adenylyl cyclase and DNA polymerase. Our data on the metal dependence of the wild-type and mutant adenylyl cyclases suggest a two-metal catalytic mechanism similar to that of DNA polymerase (Fig. 4). According to this model, the enzyme utilizes two Mg2+ ions, one associated with the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP (denoted site B in Fig. 4) and one catalytic Mg2+ ion primarily associated with the enzyme (denoted site A). In analogy to DNA polymerase, we predict that the Mg2+ at site A will coordinate to the 3′-hydroxyl of ATP, promoting the nucleophilic attack of this group on the α-phosphate, whereas the Mg2+ ion at site B assists in the leaving of the pyrophosphate group and may also facilitate the cleavage of the bond between the α- and β-phosphates by its electron-withdrawing effect. Both metal ions are also responsible for stabilizing the negative charge associated with the pentavalent transition state of this chemical reaction. We propose that this model describes a highly conserved catalytic mechanism for a diverse group of enzymes, including DNA and RNA polymerases as well as guanylyl and adenylyl cyclases, that catalyze analogous phosphoryl transfer reactions.

Our results suggest that TFIIE engages in communication with both transcription factors and promoter DNA via the TFIIEβ subunit. In eukaryotes productive transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) 1The abbreviations used are: Pol II, RNA polymerase II; CTD, C-terminal domain; PIC, preinitiation complex; TBP, TATA-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; Kr, Krüppel; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BR-HL, basic region-helix-loop; BR-HLH, basic region-helix-loop-helix. plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression in response to various developmental and environmental signals. Initiation by Pol II requires five general transcription factors (TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH) that act through core promoter elements and is regulated by tissue- and/or gene-specific factors that act through distal control elements (for reviews, see Refs. 1Roeder R.G.

Recent studies of preinitiation complex (PIC) formation have indicated the existence of the following alternative pathways: one involving the stepwise assembly of multiple general transcription factors, and one involving preassembly of a Pol II holoenzyme containing several general transcription factors and various coactivators (for reviews, see Refs. 6Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 7Björklund S. Kim Y.-J. Trends Biochem.

A. 1997; 94: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis of the PIC assembly pathway using isolated factors has revealed that this process begins with the binding of TBP (the TATA-binding protein) component of TFIID to the TATA box. This is then followed by the sequential interactions of TFIIB, a complex containing Pol II and TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH. TFIIH, which is recruited through direct interaction with TFIIE, may stabilize and activate the PIC through its enzymatic activities, resulting in open complex formation. In addition to their key roles in PIC formation and initiation, TFIIE and TFIIH play important roles in the transition from initiation to elongation (promoter clearance) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, and 5Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Human TFIIE consists of 57-kDa (α) and 34-kDa (β) subunits and forms an α2β2 heterotetramer with a molecular mass of 180 kDa (9Ohkuma Y. Sumimoto H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9163-9167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Peterson M.G. Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R. Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Human TFIIH consists of 9 subunits, and surprisingly, some of these subunits have been implicated in nucleotide excision repair and cell cycle regulation (for a review, see Ref. 11Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This multisubunit general transcription factor is quite unique in that it contains the following three ATP-dependent catalytic activities: a kinase activity that phosphorylates the CTD (C-terminal domain) of the largest subunit of Pol II, a DNA-dependent ATPase, and a DNA helicase. Importantly, TFIIE plays essential roles in the regulation of these TFIIH activities; the CTD kinase and ATPase are positively regulated by TFIIE whereas the DNA helicase activity is negatively regulated (12Lu H. Zawel L. Fisher L. Egly J.-M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 13Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansali A. Huang J.-C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 14Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This coordinated regulation, as well as multiple interactions of TFIIE and TFIIH with other transcription factors (reviewed in Ref.5Ohkuma Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), probably provides a basis for the control of the two distinct steps of transcription. Human TFIIEα, which is a highly acidic (pI 4.5) protein of 439 amino acids, possesses several putative structural motifs and characteristic sequences (10Peterson M.G. Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R. Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16Ohkuma Y. Sumimoto H. Hoffmann A. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that the N-terminal half of TFIIEα, which contains all the evolutionarily conserved structural motifs, is essential for basal transcription, whereas the C-terminal half is dispensable (15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A putative leucine zipper motif and a similar hydrophobic repeat domain, which are separated by a putative zinc finger motif, are important for heterodimerization with the TFIIEβ subunit. Furthermore, TFIIH binds to the C-terminal acidic region of TFIIEα. This interaction may be important for recruiting TFIIH into the PIC and for the modulation of the two functions of this factor in transcription initiation and in the transition from initiation to elongation. Human TFIIEβ, which is a highly basic (pI 9.5) protein of 291 amino acids, also possesses several conserved structural motifs and characteristic sequences (10Peterson M.G. Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R. Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Sumimoto H. Ohkuma Y. Sinn E. Kato H. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking studies revealed that TFIIEβ binds to promoter DNA in the region between positions −14 and −2 from the transcription initiation site (+1), a property that distinguishes it from TFIIEα which cannot be cross-linked with DNA (19Robert F. Forget D. Li J. Greenblatt J. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8517-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional crystallography of the highly related yeast TFIIE with Pol II has confirmed these observations by showing that TFIIE interacts with the active center of Pol II relative to the transcription initiation site (20Leuther K.K. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Other recent studies have demonstrated that the introduction of short mismatched heteroduplex DNA regions around the initiation site (minimally from positions −4 to +2) in topologically relaxed templates abolishes the requirement for TFIIE, TFIIH, and β-γ ATP hydrolysis (21Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Holstege F.C.P. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Holstege F.C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Importantly, changes in the short mismatched region create differential requirements for TFIIE and TFIIH with, most notably, a continued requirement for TFIIE but lack of a requirement for the function of TFIIH being observed (23Holstege F.C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These results indicate two possibilities as follows: first, that TFIIE and TFIIH play a role around the transcription initiation site during open complex formation, and second, that TFIIE has a unique function, possibly in promoter melting, distinct from its role with TFIIH. To elucidate further mechanisms of TFIIE function, and especially that of TFIIEβ, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of TFIIEβ. We tested the ability of these mutants to support both basal and activated transcription and to associate with other general transcription factors and transcriptional regulatory factors, and we examined their effects on CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH as well as their dominant negative effects on basal transcription. In so doing, we have succeeded in identifying a central core that is important for the mediation of TFIIE function and which contains the C-terminal basic regions essential for binding both to general transcription factors and to single-stranded (ss) DNA. In addition, we provided a new clue to approach that TFIIE is not only recruiting TFIIH into the PIC and functioning as a bridge between Pol II and TFIIH for its CTD phosphorylation but also playing an unidentified important role during transcription initiation and in the transition from initiation to elongation. For basal transcription assays, the plasmid pML(C2AT)Δ-50 containing the adenovirus type 2 major late promoter was used as a template (24Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To study transcriptional activation, the plasmid pG5HM(C2AT) was used as the test template (25Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), with the plasmid pML(C2AT)Δ-53Sh as the base-line control (26Van Dyke M.W. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pG5HM(C2AT) contains five GAL4-binding sites and the core promoter as described previously (15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two templates pML(C2AT)Δ-50 and pG5HM(C2AT) give 390-nucleotide transcripts, and pML(C2AT)Δ-53Sh gives a 290-nucleotide transcript. The isolated plasmid p2EB contains the complete open reading frame of human TFIIEβ (TFIIEβ cDNA) cloned into pBluescript II SK(−) phagemid (Stratagene) (17Sumimoto H. Ohkuma Y. Sinn E. Kato H. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This was first digested with XbaI andClaI, and the 1.7-kilobase pair cDNA fragment was subcloned into the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector (Promega) to create aBamHI site at the 3′-end of TFIIEβ cDNA. The oligonucleotide 5′-CCCTTCTCACTCAGCCATATGGACCCAAGCCTGTTG-3′ was then used to create an NdeI site at the first methionine codon of TFIIEβ cDNA and to disrupt a BamHI site located just after the first methionine by site-directed mutagenesis (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Finally, the NdeI-BamHI fragment of this cDNA clone (p2EBT) was subcloned into the 6HisT-pET11d vector to construct the histidine (His)-tagged TFIIEβ (6His-TFIIEβ) expression plasmid. To set up the coexpression system of the two TFIIF subunits for the purpose of preparation of transcriptionally active recombinant TFIIF, the human TFIIFβ (RAP30) expression plasmid (in pET11d) (29Wang B.Q. Kostrub C.F. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was digested with XbaI and EcoRI, and both ends of this fragment containing TFIIFβ cDNA were converted to blunt ends, whereas the expression plasmid of human TFIIFα (RAP74) with six His tags at the C terminus (in pET23d) (30Wang B.Q. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 5: 476-485Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was digested withXbaI, and the XbaI sites were converted to blunt ends, and the resulting fragment was treated with calf intestine phosphatase. Then, the TFIIFβ cDNA fragment was subcloned into the XbaI sites (blunt) of the TFIIFα expression plasmid to place both cDNAs tandemly and the 6His-TFIIF expression plasmid was constructed. The plasmid pBSKR containing cDNA encoding theDrosophila developmental gene product Krüppel (Kr) was kindly provided by F. Sauer and H. Jäckle (31Rosenberg U.B. Schröder C. Preiss A. Kienlin A. Côté S. Riede I. Jäckle H. Nature. 1986; 319: 336-339Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 32Sauer F. Jäckle H. Nature. 1991; 353: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To create anNdeI site at the first methionine codon, two oligonucleotides Kr1 (5′-CAGCCTCATATGTCCATATCAATGCTTC-3′) and Kr2 (5′-CATGGAACGGTCTAGATGAACGTC-3′) were used for polymerase chain reaction. This 82-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NdeI and XbaI, and theNdeI-XbaI fragment was then subcloned with theXbaI-EcoRI fragment of Kr cDNA into theNdeI and EcoRI sites of the HA (influenza hemagglutinin epitope sequence)-pET11d vector to construct the HA-tagged Kr (full length) expression plasmid (Fig. 7 A). The HA-pET11d vector was constructed by inserting theNcoI-NdeI fragment of HA(S)-pGEM-7 2A. Hoffmann and R. G. Roeder, unpublished data. into theNcoI and NdeI sites of 6HisT-pET11d. GST fusion constructs were made in pGEX-2TL(+), a pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) derivative in which the polylinker was expanded to contain the multicloning sitesNcoI-NdeI-XhoI-HindIII-AflII-BglII-BamHI-SmaI-EcoRI (33Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18194-18202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of TFIIEβ were constructed using plasmid p2EBT containing the wild type TFIIEβ cDNA and the described procedure of oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). A restriction site was designed in each oligonucleotide to select for properly mutated plasmids as described elsewhere (28Horikoshi M. Yamamoto T. Ohkuma Y. Weil P.A. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1990; 61: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the mutants were then checked by sequencing. The NdeI-BamHI fragments of all mutants were subcloned into 6HisT-pET11d to create a His tag at the N terminus. N-terminal and internal deletions were constructed by deleting the indicated amino acid residues and C-terminal deletions by creating termination codons at the residues shown in Fig. 1. (Because of the large number of oligonucleotides used, we have refrained from describing their exact sequences, but this information will be provided on request.) Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (34Studier W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). For purification, soluble bacterial lysates were used (17Sumimoto H. Ohkuma Y. Sinn E. Kato H. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were purified on an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) by eluting with 100 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.9). The large scale preparation of TFIIEβ was as described before (15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and resulted in >95% purity as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. All the deletion mutants of TFIIEβ were miniscale preparations. Lysates (1 ml) representing 50–100 ml of culture were directly resuspended in Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol) containing 500 mm NaCl (BB500) and 100 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin samples were washed twice with 1 ml of BB500, twice with 1 ml of buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 500 mm KCl (BD500), and twice with 500 μl of BD500 containing 20 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.9). Bound proteins were eluted twice with 300 μl of BD500 containing 100 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.9). Typical preparations were >75% pure. Recombinant TFIIF was also expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS. More than 90% of both TFIIFα (RAP74) and TFIIFβ (RAP30) subunits became soluble in bacterial lysate when they were coexpressed, and 6His-TFIIF was purified through Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column just as 6His-TFIIEβ. Purified TFIIF was >95% purity, contained both subunits stoichiometrically, and was fully active in transcription. 3Y. Ohkuma, S. Yamamoto, F. Hanaoka, and Y. Ohkuma, unpublished data. HA-tagged and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Bacteria from 50 to 100 ml of culture was harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of BB500, and sonicated. Soluble lysates were separated from insoluble debris by ultracentrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. General transcription factors (TFIIF and TFIIH) were purified either from HeLa nuclear extracts or from cytoplasmic S100 fractions as described previously (15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Pol II was highly purified from HeLa nuclear pellets by DE52, A25, P11, and high performance liquid chromatography-DEAE 5PW chromatography as described elsewhere (35Sumimoto H. Ohkuma Y. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9158-9162Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription was carried out as described (9Ohkuma Y. Sumimoto H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9163-9167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To observe transcriptional activation, 20 ng of TFIID containing flag-tagged TBP (25Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was used instead of 20 ng of TBP. As activators, 40 ng of either GAL4-VP16 (36Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) containing the C-terminal acidic activation domain of VP16 (residues 413–490) fused to GAL4-(1–94) (residues 1–94) or GAL4-CTF1 (37Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the C-terminal proline-rich activation domain of CTF1 (residues 399–499) fused to GAL4-(1–94) was used. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C with Fuji RX-U x-ray film. The incorporation of [α-32P]CTP into transcripts was quantified using the Fuji BAS2500 Bio-Imaging analyzer. Two hundred micrograms (100 μl) of purified 6His-TFIIEβ (>99% pure) was mixed with the same volume (100 μl) of complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco) and injected into each rabbit. Two weeks after the first injection, a second injection was carried out with 100 μg (100 μl) of purified TFIIEβ in 100 μl of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Difco). A third injection was carried out 2 weeks later using the same procedures as described for the second injection. Blood was collected 8 days after the third injection. The generated antibody recognized all of the TFIIEβ deletion mutants used in this study.3 Polyclonal antisera against TFIIEα (0.01 μl) and 5 μl (packed volume) of protein G-agarose (Pierce) were incubated in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 0.5% EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 100 mm KCl (BC100) and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The protein G-agarose beads were precipitated and washed with 500 μl of washing buffer I (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), twice with 500 μl of buffer C containing 1m KCl (BC1000), and twice with 500 μl of BC100. Various TFIIEβ mutant proteins (200 ng) were incubated with TFIIEα (300 ng) for 1 h at room temperature, and bound proteins were coimmunoprecipitated after incubation with anti-TFIIEα-protein G beads in a 500-μl reaction volume for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of washing buffer I, once with 500 μl of BC100, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). Coimmunoprecipitated TFIIEβ mutants were detected by Western blotting with anti-TFIIEβ polyclonal antiserum (1:3000 dilution) after transfer to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) as described previously (15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubation of the immunoblots with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. PBD-1 film (Kodak) or RX-U film (Fuji Film) was used to record the chemiluminescence. GST fusion proteins were used for protein interaction assays. Each tester protein (200 ng) was incubated with lysates containing 500 ng of GST proteins together with 5 μl (packed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 500-μl reaction volume of BC100 with 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The glutathione-Sepharose resin was washed twice with 500 μl of buffer C containing 200 mm KCl (BC200), once with 500 μl of BC100, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pulled down tester proteins were detected by Western blotting as described in the coimmunoprecipitation assay. Four hundred nanograms of His-tagged TFIIEβ deletion mutants were incubated with 5 μl (packed volume) of ssDNA-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 500-μl reaction volume of BC100 with 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The ssDNA-agarose resin was washed twice with 500 μl of buffer C containing 250 mm KCl (BC250), once with 500 μl of BC100, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). Bound mutants were detected by Western blotting with anti-TFIIEβ antisera (1:3000 dilution) as described above. Assays were carried out essentially as described (14Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with all general transcription factors in the presence of Pol II and a DNA fragment containing the adenovirus type 2 major late promoter sequences from −39 to +29, except that 16 ng of bacterially expressed recombinant TFIIF was used instead of 30 ng of high performance liquid chromatography heparin-purified TFIIF from HeLa nuclear extract. Phosphorylation reactions were done at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by addition of 75 μl of phosphorylation stop solution (10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% SDS). Phosphorylated proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, analyzed by SDS-PAGE (5.5% acrylamide), and detected by autoradiography performed at −80 °C with Fuji RX-U x-ray film. Human TFIIEβ is the small subunit of TFIIE and consists of 291 amino acid residues (10Peterson M.G. Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R.

As judged from the predicted open reading frame of TFIIEβ cDNA, it possesses several putative structural motifs and characteristic sequences: a serine-rich sequence (residues 26–71), a region similar to the Pol II binding region of RAP30 (TFIIFβ) (residues 79–111), a leucine repeat motif (residues 145–193), a region similar to the bacterial sigma factor subdomain 3 (residues 163–193), a basic region-helix-loop-helix motif (residues 197–238), and a region with basic region-helix-loop sequence (residues 258–291). Except for the leucine repeat, these regions are different from the putative motifs and sequences observed in TFIIEα (15Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

Based on these sequences, a systematic series of N-terminal, C-terminal, and internal deletion mutants were constructed (shown in Fig.1, A and B). Vectors encoding hexahistidine-tagged mutant and wild type TFIIEβ proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified through nickel affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A and 3 A). All mutants were highly soluble in the bacterial cell extracts and were easily purified, although some (Δ224–291, Δ96–119, and Δ117–153) were poorly expressed (Fig. 2 A, lane 11; Fig.3 A, lanes 7 and 8, respectively).Figure 3Basal transcription activities of purified internal deletion mutants of TFIIEβ.

However, the mechanisms regulating p53 subcellular localization remain unclear. In this report, we analyzed the possible existence of cis-acting sequences involved in intracellular trafficking of the p53 protein. To study p53 trafficking, the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the wild-type or mutated p53 proteins for fast and sensitive analysis of protein localization in human MCF-7 breast cancer, RKO colon cancer, and SAOS-2 sarcoma cells. The wild-type p53/GFP fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, or both compartments in a subset of the cells. Mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that a single amino acid mutation of Lys-305 (mt p53) caused cytoplasmic sequestration of the p53 protein in the MCF-7 and RKO cells, whereas the fusion protein was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of SAOS-2 cells. In SAOS-2 cells, the mutant p53 was a less efficient inducer of p21/CIP1/WAF1 expression. Cytoplasmic sequestration of the mt p53 was dependent upon the C-terminal region (residues 326–355) of the protein. These results indicated the involvement of cis-acting sequences in the regulation of p53 subcellular localization.

In response to DNA damage, p53 expression is induced and it then translocates to the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional activator (6Fritsch M. Haessier C. Brandner G.

Mutation of the p53 gene is among the most common genetic disorders in human cancers, including those of breast, colon, lung, and liver origin (16Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C.

Although mutations disrupt the function of p53, it has been shown in cultured cells that cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p53 protein could impair its function (18Knippschild U. Oren M. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1755-1765PubMed Google Scholar). Certain p53 mutations result in cytoplasmic sequestration of the mutant protein (19Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An analysis of p53 in human breast cancers indicated that besides mutational inactivation, 37% of the breast cancer cells showed cytoplasmic localization of wild-type p53, suggesting an alternative mechanism of inhibiting p53 function via nuclear exclusion (20Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p53 has also been reported in neuroblastoma (21Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and colon carcinoma cells (22Bosari S. Viale G. Roncalli M. Graziani D. Borsani G. Lee A.K.C. Coggi G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 790-798PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that subcellular distribution of the p53 protein in untransformed Balb/c 3T3 and NIH 3T3 cells is tightly regulated during the cell cycle (23Shaulsky G. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1707-1711PubMed Google Scholar). Although the regulating mechanism remains unclear, these data indicate that the regulation of subcellular localization of p53 is an important mechanism in controlling p53 function. To execute transcriptional activation, p53 must enter the cell nucleus. In p53, three potential nuclear localization signals (NLSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS(s), nuclear localization signal(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CSD, cytoplasmic sequestration domain. reside in the C terminus of the protein (Ref. 24Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 A). The major one, NLSI (PQPKKKP), when fused to cytoplasmic proteins, is able to direct the fusion protein to the nucleus (25Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is by no means a guarantee that p53 will enter the nucleus even with an intact NLS (26Slingerland J.M. Jenkins J.R. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,27Martinez E. Givel F. Wahli W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This suggests that other factors could influence or regulate the subcellular localization of p53. Several studies have suggested ways in which p53 might be sequestered in the cytoplasm. It has been reported that conformational changes may play a major role in p53 subcellular localization (28Zerrahn J. Deppert W. Weidemann D. Patschinsky T. Richards F. Milner J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1371-1381PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that short-lived proteins may be involved in anchorage of p53 in the cytoplasm of rat embryo fibroblasts (18Knippschild U. Oren M. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1755-1765PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma cells, cytoplasmically sequestered wild-type p53 was not detected by an antibody specific for the C terminus, suggesting the C-terminal domain of sequestered p53 is masked (29Ostermeyer A.G. Runko E. Winkfield B. Ahn B. Moll U.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15190-15194Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our previous data have shown that co-expression of bcl-2 and c-myccan totally inhibit p53 functions by cytoplasmic sequestration in murine erythroleukemia cells (30Ryan J.J. Prochownik E. Gottlieb C.A. Apel I.J. Merino R. Nuñez G. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5878-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It was speculated that Myc induces or activates a factor which cooperates with the membrane protein Bcl-2 to modulate the transport pathway responsible for the entry of p53 into the nucleus (31Nuñez G. Clarke M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 399-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that a cis-domain of p53 could be involved in its compartmentalization within the cell. To address this issue, we developed a system to study p53 subcellular localization by fusing p53 to the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP)(32Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5537) Google Scholar). Mutation analysis revealed that two domains, other than the NLS, interact to regulate p53 subcellular trafficking. Amino acid, Lys-305, is required for nuclear import of full-length p53, and this lysine interacts with a “cytoplasmic sequestration domain” located in the C terminus of p53. Three human tumor cell lines were used in this study. The MCF-7 breast cancer and RKO colon cancer cell lines express wild-type p53, whereas the SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line lacks p53. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Full-length and truncated p53 were amplified by PCR using pC53-SN (kindly provided by A. Levine, Princeton University) as the template (33Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). The PCR fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the jellyfish GFP expression plasmid pK7-GFP (kindly provided by I. G. Macara, University of Virginia) (34Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For the functional assay of induction of p21 expression, wild-type and Lys-305 mutated p53 genes were inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Internal deletion and point mutation were conducted by the PCR SOEing technique (35Horton R. Cai Z. Ho S. Pease L. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-531PubMed Google Scholar). Three PCR reactions and four primers are needed for each mutation. Two of the primers defined the boundaries of the PCR product for insertion to the expression vector, pK7-GFP. The other two primers are complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation. For the point mutation of Lys-305 of p53 to Ala, for example, the first PCR reaction amplified the upstream fragment using the 5′ boundary primer (5′-AATTAAGATCCATGGAGGAGCCGCAG-3′) and one of the mutant primers (5′-CCCCCAGGGAGCACTGCACGAGCACTGCCCAAC-3′) reading from 3′ to 5′. The second PCR reaction amplified the downstream fragment using the other mutant primer (5′-GTTGGGCAGTGCTCGTGCAGTGCTCCCTGGGGG-3′) reading from 5′ to 3′ and the 3′ boundary primer. These upstream and downstream PCR products, which overlap at the mutation region, were mixed together and used as templates in the last PCR reaction with 5′ and 3′ boundary primers. The end PCR product with desired mutation was gel-purified and digested with BamHI and EcoRI before ligation to pK7-GFP. All constructs generated in this way were sequenced to ensure no mutation occurred except the designed mutation. MCF-7, RKO, and SAOS-2 cells were grown on glass coverslips in six-well plates (35-mm diameter) to ∼80% confluence and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. For each transfection, 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE were mixed in 1 ml of Opti-MEMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and overlaid onto the cells. Following 4-h incubation at 37 °C, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added to the transfection mixture. At 48 h following the start of transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and rinsed with water. After a brief air drying, cells were mounted using 50% glycerol in PBS and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter to detect expression of GFP fusion proteins. Fluorescent photomicrography was performed using Nikon photomicrographic equipment model H-III, and images were taken by a constant exposure time on a Kodak slide film. Subcellular distribution of the p53/GFP fusion was determined by the relative intensity of GFP in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of each individual cell. SAOS-2 cells were used for the analysis of induction of p21 expression by wild-type or mutated p53. A plasmid, pRc/CMV-p53R175H (kindly provided by J. Y. Lin, University of Michigan), was used as a negative control for p21 induction. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed by the addition of 180 μl of cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin. Following constant agitation for 30 min at 4 °C, cells were scraped from the plate and passed several times through a 25-gauge needle to disperse large cell aggregates. Total cell lysate was obtained after centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and the protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent on the basis of the Bradford method. Eighty micrograms of protein was separated by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond PVDF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with the anti-p21 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the anti-p53 PAb1801 antibody (Oncogene). The specific proteins were detected by the ECL protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and RKO colon cancer cells were used here to study p53 subcellular localization, because these two cell lines contain wild-type p53 and can tolerate the exogenous expression of p53 (36Casey G.

When transfected with plasmids with p53 fused to the C terminus of GFP, both MCF-7 and RKO cells demonstrated three types of staining. In most cells, the p53 was located in only the nucleus or in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of a cell (Fig. 1 B,a and b). In a small population of cells, the p53 was located only in the cytoplasm. A series of N-terminal deletions of p53 were made by PCR until the deletion reached the NLSI (Fig. 1 A). This maintains an intact NLSI so that the truncated protein should enter the nucleus unless the deleted sequences are functionally involved in nuclear import of p53. All the truncated p53 fragments were fused to the C terminus of GFP and transfected into MCF-7 and RKO cells. Because the results were similar between MCF-7 and RKO cells, only data obtained with MCF-7 cells are presented. The subcellular localization of the truncated p53, as determined by GFP fluorescence, are divided into three groups as nuclear (N), cytoplasmic (C), and both nuclear and cytoplasmic (N+C) localizations. The percentage of each localization was determined from a total of 400–500 fluorescent cells observed in several fields of a slide. The average data from at least two independent experiments are summarized in TableI. The truncated p53 was seen primarily in the nucleus until amino acid residues 301–305 (PGSTK) were deleted, which resulted in cytoplasmic fluorescence in ∼85% of the cells (Table I; Fig. 1 B, c and d). To check if there are specific amino acids associated with this cytoplasmic sequestration, mutations of single or double amino acids (from residues 300 to 305) were made in a full-length p53/GFP fusion protein. The single mutation of Pro-301 or double mutations of Pro-300 and Pro-301 to Ala did not change the localization of p53 in cell nucleus. The same phenomenon was observed when single substitution of Ser-303 or Thr-304 with Ala or double substitutions of Ser-303 and Thr-304 with Ala were made (data not shown). The mutation of Lys-305 to Ala, however, resulted in cytoplasmic sequestration of p53. Similarly, nuclear exclusion of p53 was observed when Lys-305 was replaced by Arg, Asn, Glu, or Thr (Table I; Fig. 1 B, e). These results suggest that Lys-305 has a specific function in mediating nuclear localization of p53.Table ISubcellular localization of mutated p53 proteins in MCF-7 cellsMutations of p53LocalizationaSubcellular localization are catalogued into nuclear (N), a combination of nuclear and cytoplasmic (N + C), and cytoplasmic (C) accumulation.

Open table in a new tab It has been shown that human p53 is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase at Ser-315, the residue just adjacent to NLSI (40Bischoff J.R. Friedmam P.N. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4766-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 41Stürzbecher H.-W. Brain R. Addison C. Rudge K. Remm M. Grimaldi M. Keenan E. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to correlate p34cdc2 phosphorylation with p53 nuclear transport, we have mutated Ser-315 to Ala in p53. The result indicated that Ser-315 mutation does not affect the p53 localization in MCF-7 cells (Table I), suggesting p34cdc2 phosphorylation is not necessary for the nuclear import of p53. With respect to the possible effect of p34cdc2 phosphorylation on cytoplasmic sequestration of Lys-305 mutated p53, a simultaneous mutation of Lys-305 and Ser-315 was made. The result showed that there is no difference between the subcellular localization of only Lys-305 mutated and both Lys-305 and Ser-315 mutated p53 (Table I). This indicated that p34cdc2 phosphorylation is not involved in cytoplasmic sequestration of Lys-305 mutated p53. Postulating a possible interaction of Lys-305 with the C terminus of p53, we performed a series of deletions of the C terminus of Lys-305 mutated p53 (p53K305N) distal to the major NLS (Fig. 1 A). It was found that p53K305NΔ356–393 was still located in the cytoplasm, whereas p53K305NΔ351–393 lost the ability to be sequestered in the cytoplasm and was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of a cell (Table I; Fig. 1 B,f and g), suggesting a region could be involved in cytoplasmic sequestration of Lys-305 mutated p53. To further define this region, several constructs were made by deleting various amino acids from residues 326 to 350 of p53K305N (Fig. 1 A). The data indicated that any deletion between amino acids 326–350 abrogated the complete cytoplasmic sequestration of p53K305N (Table I; Fig.1 B, h). These results revealed that a domain extending from amino acids 326 to 355 is necessary for cytoplasmic sequestration of Lys-305 mutated p53. Because Lys-305 mutated p53 predominantly remained in the cytoplasm, its transactivation ability should be abolished. To test this hypothesis, immunoblotting was performed to determine the p21 induction by wild-type or Lys-305 mutated p53 in SAOS-2 cells. The SAOS-2 cell line was chosen, because unlike MCF-7 and RKO cells, it possesses no endogenous p53, which may induce p21 expression during the transfection procedure. Using GFP fusion, it was found that the cellular localization of p53 in SAOS-2 cells was similar to that in MCF-7 and RKO cells (Fig.2 A). However, the subcellular distribution of the Lys-305 mutated p53 was somewhat different in SAOS-2 cells from that in MCF-7 or RKO cells. In contrast to the latter cells in which the mutant was located only in the cytoplasm in the vast majority of the cells, the mutated p53 was located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the SAOS-2 cells with 50% of them having stronger fluorescence in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B), suggesting Lys-305 mutation of p53 also had cytoplasmic sequestration effect in SAOS-2 cells. Although this effect in SAOS-2 cells is not as much as it is in MCF-7 and RKO cells, immunoblotting indicated that Lys-305 mutated p53 resulted in a significant loss of its transactivation activity manifested by the reduced induction of p21 expression (Fig.3). After normalized to the amount of p53 from the immunoblots of three individual experiments, the p21 induction by Lys-305 mutated p53 was 3-fold less than that of wild-type p53. A negative control with Arg-175 mutation of p53, which loses the ability for DNA binding, showed that no p21 induction was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effects of wild-type and Lys-305 mutated p53 on p21/CIP1/WAF1 induction. Immunoblots display p21 expression in SAOS-2 cells without transfection (lane 1) or transfected with vector alone (pcDNA3; lane 2), wild-type p53 (lane 3), Lys-305 mutated p53 (p53K305N; lane 4), and pRc/CMV-p53R175H (lane 5). The difference of p21 induction by wild-type and Lys-305 mutated p53 was normalized to the amount of p53 protein detected on the same blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is of particular importance to point out that p53Δ326–393 showed a high percentage (85%) of nuclear localization, whereas p53K305NΔ326–393 was mainly located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Table I). This indicated that the Lys-305 mutation alone can negatively affect the nuclear import of p53. By cooperating with the C-terminal sequestration domain identified above, the Lys-305 mutation caused the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53. In the present study, a single amino acid, Lys-305, which can dramatically affect the cellular localization of p53, was identified. Even more interesting, it was found that this lysine interacts with a cytoplasmic sequestration domain (CSD) expanding from amino acids 326 to 355 at the C terminus of p53. This CSD has no effect unless Lys-305 is mutated. Lys-305 is not located within any of the five conserved domains of the p53 protein (42Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. May P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Lys-305 is conserved throughout a variety of species from human to Xenopus (42Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. May P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar,43Soussi T. May P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 623-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In view of this striking evolutionary conservation, Lys-305 is probably a functionally significant amino acid of p53 and is most likely involved in the regulation of p53 cellular localization as evidenced from this report. The p53 protein binds to DNA and transcriptionally activates target genes. Structurally, p53 can be divided into an N-terminal transactivation domain (residues 1–43), a central specific DNA-binding domain (residues 102–292), and C-terminal multifunctional domains including nuclear localization, tetramerization, and nonspecific DNA-binding domains. Obviously, regulation of p53 subcellular localization and DNA binding are two major ways in which the cell can control p53 function. Regulation of sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 is involved in the C-terminal region. It has been shown that the last 30 amino acid residues of p53 are the negative regulatory domains for DNA-binding. However, casein kinase II phosphorylation of amino acid 392 and protein kinase C phosphorylation of sites within the PAb421 epitope (residues 371–380) could activate specific DNA-binding ability of p53 (44Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 45Takenaka I. Morin F. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5405-5411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The fundamental aspect of p53 is its structural flexibility, which governs the biological activity. This structural or protein conformational determination of p53 function could be modified by post-translational modification (46Meek D.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of C-terminal domains in regulating the DNA-binding ability of the central core domain indicates a domain-domain interaction or conformation-directed regulation of p53 function. Based on these observations, it is logical to hypothesize that p53 localization is also regulated, although the mechanism is still unclear. To date, the only functional motifs found to be directly involved in p53 subcellular localization are nuclear localization signals at the C terminus of p53. NLSI, especially, is the key player for nuclear import of p53 (24Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The nuclear protein import receptor, importin α, would bind to p53 at the NLSI locus. Thereafter, importin β interacts with importin α and mediates docking of the complex at the nuclear pore and then translocates to the nucleus involving GTP hydrolysis by Ran (47Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 48Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, the p53 NLSI needs to be accessible to importin α in order for nuclear transport to occur. It has been shown that the NLS can function at a variety of positions within a protein. However, its activity could be masked in some locations (49Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting the function of the NLS is dependent on the protein context within which it is located. Accordingly, Lys-305 could be an amino acid in a position to help binding of importin α to NLSI of p53, because its mutation negatively affects the p53 nuclear import. Structurally, Lys-305 may also influence the position of the CSD (residues 326–355). Without the presence of Lys-305, the CSD can crucially mask the NLSI function of p53. Another potential role for the CSD is its involvement in interactions with cytoplasmic anchoring proteins. In support of this hypothesis, a study has shown that protein synthesis is required to anchor a mutant p53 protein (a temperature-sensitive protein with a point mutation) for nuclear transport (19Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the Lys-305 mutation could somehow open the CSD for binding of anchoring proteins. This binding could block the interaction of importin α with NLSI and subsequently hold p53 in the cytoplasm. It is also possible that Lys-305 and the CSD form a “pocket” in the p53 protein into which the anchoring protein is unable to specifically fit unless Lys-305 is functionally modified or mutated. Coincidentally, the CSD identified in this study also contains the p53 oligomerization domain (50Stürzbecher H.-W. Maimets T. Chumakov P. Brain R. Addison C. Simanis V. Rudge K. Philp R. Grimaldi M. Court W. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 795-801PubMed Google Scholar, 51Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Because of the opposite effects resulting from the CSD (nonfunctional p53 with cytoplasmic sequestration) and tetramerization domain (functional p53 for specific DNA binding), it is likely that this domain possesses two different functions. The crystal structure reveals that the oligomerization domain consists of a β strand (residues 326–333) and an α helix (residues 335–354). The β strand and the α helix form a V-shaped structure, which associates with a second structure across an antiparallel β sheet and a helix-helix interface to form a dimer. The tetramer is formed through the interaction between distinct helix-helix interface of two dimers (52Clore G.M. Omichinski J.G. Sakaguchi K. Zambrano N. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 53Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). It is possible that some other cellular proteins could interact with p53 in a similar manner. In our case, for example, the oligomerization domain could turn into a CSD by binding to another cellular protein when Lys-305 is mutated. Studies are in progress to address these hypotheses.

https://openalex.org/W2017608945,"Strongly inwardly rectifying potassium channels of the Kir 2 subfamily (IRK1, IRK2, and IRK3) are involved in maintenance and modulation of cell excitability in brain and heart. Electrophysiological studies of channels expressed in heterologous systems have suggested that the pore-conducting pathway contains four subunits. However, inferences from electrophysiological studies have not been tested on native channels and do not address the possibility of nonconducting auxiliary subunits. Here, we investigate the subunit stoichiometry of endogenous inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir 2.2 (IRK2) from rat brain. Using chemical cross-linking, immunoprecipitiation, and velocity sedimentation, we report physical evidence demonstrating the tetrameric organization of the native channel. Kir 2.2 was sequentially cross-linked to produce bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding in size to monomer, dimer, trimer, and three forms of tetramer. Fully cross-linked channel was present as a single band of tetrameric size. Immunoprecipitation of biotinylated membranes revealed a single band corresponding to Kir 2.2, suggesting that the channel is composed of a single type of subunit. Hydrodynamic properties of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonic acid-solubilized channel were used to calculate the molecular mass of the channel. Velocity sedimentation in H2O or D2O gave a sharp peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 17.3 S. Gel filtration yielded a Stokes radius of 5.92 nm. These data indicate a multisubunit protein with a molecular mass of 193 kDa, calculated to contain 3.98 subunits. Together, these results demonstrate that Kir 2.2 channels are formed by the homotetrameric association of Kir 2.2 subunits and do not contain tightly associated auxiliary subunits. These studies suggest that Kir 2.2 channels differ in structure from related heterooctomeric ATP-sensitive K channels and heterotetrameric G-protein-regulated inward rectifier K channels."

Our results indicate that GD3 synthase and b-series gangliosides are not necessary for the neuronal differentiation of uncommitted precursor cells. Gangliosides are a diverse series of sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids present on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of most vertebrate cells (1van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5341-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are particularly abundant in the central nervous system. The structural diversity of the ganglioside oligosaccharide chains is determined by biosynthetic glycosyltransferases residing in the Golgi apparatus. Ceramide is modified sequentially by glycosyltransferases to produce the simple ganglioside GM3 1The nomenclature for gangliosides follows the system of Svennerholm (37Svennerholm L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 145-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abbreviations used are: GM3, II3 NeuAc-LacCer; GM2, II3NeuAc-GgOse3 Cer; GD3, II3 (NeuAc)2-LacCer; ES, embryonic stem; neo, neomycin resistance cassette; hygro, hygromycin resistance cassette; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAP, growth-associated protein; MAP, microtubule-associated protein. (Fig.1), a key structure in the regulation of the biosynthetic pathway. GM3 ganglioside can be modified by GM2 synthase to produce GM2 and the a-series gangliosides. Alternatively, by the action of GD3 synthase (CMP-sialic acid: GM3 α-2,8-sialyltransferase; EC 2.4.99.8), GM3 can be converted to the disialoganglioside GD3, diverting the pathway to the synthesis of b-series gangliosides. The ganglioside composition of cells and tissues reflects the relative expression of these two biosynthetic glycosyltransferases (2Percy A.K. Gottfries J. Vilbergsson G. Mansson J.E. Svennerholm L.

In particular, GD3 synthase and its biosynthetic products, the b-series gangliosides, have been implicated as possibly having significant roles in development because of their unique expression pattern during neuronal differentiation (3Yu R.K.

To determine directly if b-series gangliosides are essential for neuronal differentiation, we disrupted both copies of the GD3 synthase gene (GD3S) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells are normal, undifferentiated cells that can form all tissues of a mouse when injected into a blastocyst (14Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 71-112Google Scholar). ES cells also possess the ability to differentiate into many cell types, including neurons, in culture and provide a well established system that recapitulates the differentiation pathway from undifferentiated cells to fully differentiated neurons (15Keller G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 16Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Huettner J.E. Gottlieb D.I. Dev.

We report that ES cells with both GD3 synthase alleles disrupted undergo neuronal differentiation in the absence of b-series gangliosides. To disrupt the both alleles of GD3 synthase gene in mouse ES cells, we prepared two targeting vectors with a 13-kb genomic segment isolated from a 129/sv mouse strain library (Stratagene). Within the genomic segment was an exon encoding 486 base pairs (162 amino acids) of the 3′-end of the protein coding sequence of GD3 synthase. The entire protein coding sequence of mouse GD3 synthase is 1,023 base pairs (341 amino acids). The neomycin resistance cassette (neo) (20Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) and hygromycin B resistance cassette (hygro) (21van Deursen J. Wieringa B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3815-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were inserted into the BamHI site of the exon of GD3 synthase gene to create the GD3S-neo targeting vector andGD3S-hygro targeting vector (Fig.2). The herpes thymidine kinase gene flanked the GD3S homology region in the targeting vectors. The GD3S-neo targeting vector (50 μg) was linearized and introduced into the J1 ES (22Lee K.-F. Li E. Huber J. Landis S.C. Sharpe A.H. Chao M.V. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 737-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) cells by electroporation (Bio-Rad gene pulser, 400 V and 25 microfarads). Targeted clones were screened by Southern blotting after simultaneous positive-negative selection with G418 (350 μg/ml) and ganciclovir (5 μm). One of the correctly targeted clones was retargeted with the GD3S-hygro vector as above except the ES cells were selected with 75 μg/ml hygromycin B. Neuronal differentiation of ES cells was performed by using the 4-day/4-day protocol (16Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Huettner J.E. Gottlieb D.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) with some modifications (Fig.3). Undifferentiated J1 ES cells were maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Genome systems) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.), 15% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Life Technologies, Inc.). Rapidly growing, undifferentiated ES cells were trypsinized with a balanced salt solution containing 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA. A portion of the cell suspension was transferred to a bacterial Petri dish with 10 ml of culture medium without β-mercaptoethanol and leukemia inhibitory factor. Under these conditions, ES cells do not attach to the dishes and readily form floating aggregates termed embryoid bodies (14Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 71-112Google Scholar). Embryoid bodies were cultured for 4 days. Then 50 μm retinoic acid (all-trans form; Sigma) was added to the medium, and the embryoid bodies were cultured for an additional 4 days. After the 8-day induction period, embryoid bodies were transferred to gelatinized tissue culture plates to allow cell attachment and neuronal outgrowth. The Golgi-rich fraction, obtained from differentiated ES cells according to the method of Sandberg et al. (23Sandberg P.O. Marzella L. Glaumann H. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 130: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was used for GD3 synthase assay (24Kasahara K. Guo L. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GM3 ganglioside, dissolved in ethanol, was dried in a Speed-Vac and then resuspended in reaction buffer (100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 0.4% Triton X–100, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid) by sonication for 1 min. An aliquot of Golgi fraction was incubated with 125 nCi of [14C]CMP-sialic acid (21 μmfinal concentration) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or the absence of exogenous GM3 ganglioside in reaction buffer (20 μl total volume) to control for transfer to endogenous acceptors. The final concentration of exogenous GM3 ganglioside was 0.6 mm. An aliquot of reaction mixture was spotted on flexible TLC plates (Silica Gel IB2-F, J. T. Baker). The plate was developed with water for 15 min to separate the lipid-bound radioactivity, which remains at the origin, from free [14C]CMP-sialic acid. The lipid-bound radioactivity was quantitated on a Fuji BAS-2500 PhosphorImager with MacBAS version 2.52 software. The GD3S cDNA was prepared by ligating a 950-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment, encompassing the 5′-end, obtained from a mouse brain cDNA library, to aBamHI-PstI fragment encompassing the 3′-end, obtained from the last exon of the GD3S gene. To remove the sialyl motif S, the GD3S cDNA was truncated at the 3′-end by digestion with BamHI endonuclease. Both cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen) and were transfected into COS-1 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and GD3 synthase activity was determined as above except that total cell extracts were used. Neuronally differentiated ES cells were incubated with [14C]galactose (2 μCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with lowered glucose (450 mg/liter) and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized, and harvested by centrifugation. Labeled glycosphingolipids were extracted as described by Harel and Futerman (25Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were resuspended with chloroform and methanol (2:1) and separated by TLC using chloroform, methanol, and 0.2% aqueous CaCl2(60:40:9) as the developing solvent. Labeled glycosphingolipids were detected using a Fuji BAS-2500 PhosphorImager with MacBAS version 2.52 software. Ganglioside standards were developed on the same TLC plates and visualized with orcinol ferric-chloride solution (Bial's Reagent, Sigma). The identity of labeled glycolipids was assigned by comigration with standards. At day 5, cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were made permeable with 95% ethanol, 5% acetic acid at −20 °C for 30 min. After washing in PBS, the cells were incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 10% normal horse serum) for 30 min. After washing in PBS, primary antibodies were added, and cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Anti-neurofilament-160 kDa (NF-M) antibody was diluted to 1:5,000, anti-growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) antibody was diluted to 1:200, anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) antibody was diluted to 1:250. All primary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Secondary biotinylated antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories). The antibody-peroxidase complex was visualized with the substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol-N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine monohydrochloride. To disrupt both alleles of the mouse GD3S gene, we prepared two targeting vectors for use in consecutive rounds of gene targeting; the vectors were identical except that one contained a neomycin resistance cassette, and the other contained a hygromycin B resistance cassette (Fig. 2 A). The targeting vectors were designed to disrupt the catalytic domain of the enzyme by introduction of a premature termination codon before sialyl motif S. The sialyl motif S is highly conserved among sialyltransferases and is thought to comprise part of the catalytic domain (26Tsuji S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 27Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-96014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Removal of the sialyl motif S from the GD3S cDNA rendered the enzyme catalytically inactive as determined by expression in COS-1 cells (data not shown). After the first round of gene targeting with theGD3S-neo targeting vector, 12 out of 24 G418-resistant colonies exhibited the 5.7-kb HindIII fragment characteristic of the neo-targeted GD3S allele together with the 4.5-kb fragment characteristic of the wild-type allele. One of these GD3S(+/−) ES cell lines was used as a parent cell for the next round of gene targeting with the GD3S-hygro vector. After hygromycin B selection, we identified 4 out of 12 colonies containing the 6.8-kb HindIII fragment characteristic of the hygro-targeted allele together with the 5.7-kb neo-targeted fragment (Fig. 2 B) demonstrating that both alleles of the GD3 synthase gene were disrupted. Wild-type and GD3S (−/−) ES cells were induced with retinoic acid to differentiate along a neuronal pathway by the procedure shown in Fig. 3 A. After expansion of undifferentiated ES cells on feeder layers, the cells were transferred into bacterial Petri dishes to prevent cell attachment and to allow the formation of embryoid bodies (14Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 71-112Google Scholar). We did not observe any difference in the ability of wild-type and GD3S(−/−) ES cells to form embryoid bodies (Fig. 3 B, day −2). After an additional 4-day incubation with retinoic acid, embryoid bodies were transferred to gelatinized tissue culture dishes to allow attachment (day 0). As has been described, a neurite outgrowth from the embryoid body appeared, indicating neuronal differentiation of the cultures (Fig.3 B, day +5) (16Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Huettner J.E. Gottlieb D.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). We measured GD3 synthase enzyme activity from differentiated wild-type and GD3S(−/−) cells. The GD3S(−/−) clones had a 96.4 ± 2.7% reduction in activity compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 2 C). To assess the gangliosides synthesized by the differentiated ES cells, cultures were incubated with [14C]galactose, and the labeled glycolipids were separated by TLC (Fig. 3, C and D). Both a- (GM3, GM1, GD1a) and b-series (GD3, GD1b and GT1b) gangliosides were synthesized by the wild-type ES cells. By contrast, theGD3S(−/−) cells contained the a-series gangliosides but no detectable b-series gangliosides, consistent with their lack of GD3 synthase activity. To confirm the neuronal differentiation of wild-type andGD3S(−/−) ES cell cultures, cells were characterized immunohistochemically with antibodies that detect neuron-specific proteins, NF-M (28Peng I.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Both cultures were positive for the axon-specific cytoskeletal proteins NF-M and GAP-43 (Fig. 4, A–D). The long neurites emerging from embryoid bodies of both the wild-type andGD3S(−/−) stained strongly for GAP-43 and NF-M. The presence of the dendrite-specific marker, MAP-2, was also determined. In both wild-type and GD3S(−/−) cultures the short, tapered neurites around the embryoid bodies were MAP-2-positive (Fig.4, E and F). Some neuronal cell bodies around embryoid bodies were also MAP-2-positive in their cytoplasm (arrows). The observation that GD3 and other b-series gangliosides are exquisitely regulated during development of the nervous system led to the view that they may be important during neuronal differentiation (3Yu R.K. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,8Rosner H. al-Aqtum M. Rahmann H. Neurochem. Int. 1992; 20: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Irvine R.A. Seyfried T.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 109: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). GD3 is the major ganglioside of the embryonic nervous system and is expressed initially on rapidly proliferating neuroprogenitor cells (7Bouvier J.D. Seyfried T.N. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Goldman J.E. Hirano M. Yu R.K. Seyfried T.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1984; 7: 179-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Rosner H. Al-Aqtum M. Henke-Fahle S. Brain Res. 1985; 350: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At later stages in development, GD3 ganglioside expression falls drastically while an increase in the synthesis of complex b-series gangliosides occurs. Studies of cultured neurons have shown major changes in ganglioside synthesis coupled to changes in neuronal morphogenesis (31Hirschberg K. Zisling R. van Echten-Deckert G. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14876-14882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In particular during axonogenesis, the synthesis of complex gangliosides increases together with the decreased synthesis of GD3 ganglioside. An increase in the ratio of a- to b-series gangliosides occurs during the period of rapid axon growth. Finally, during the neural differentiation of embryonic carcinoma P19 cells, the expression GD3 synthase is specifically induced (32Osanai T. Watanabe Y. Sanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Support for the concept that GD3 synthase and b-series gangliosides may be involved in neuronal differentiation comes from experiments showing neuritogenic effects in neuronal cell lines upon ganglioside introduction. The exogenous b-series ganglioside GQ1b, when added at nanomolar concentrations, caused differentiation of neuroblastoma cells (10Tsuji S. Nakajima J. Sasaki T. Nagai Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 97: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ectopic GD3 synthase cDNA expression in neuroblastoma cells resulted in increased expression of b-series gangliosides together with neurite outgrowth and cellular differentiation (11Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Liu H. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Manipulation of GD3 levels in neuroblastoma cells with a transfectedO-acetylesterase gene from influenza C virus also induced morphological changes (12Ariga T. Blaine G.M. Yoshino H. Dawson G. Kanda T. Zeng G.C. Kasama T. Kushi Y. Yu R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11500-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although these studies show that GD3 synthase and b-series gangliosides induce differentiation in neuroblastoma cells, they do not address the question of whether b-series gangliosides are required for the differentiation of embryonic precursor cells into neurons. To investigate this issue we used uncommitted, pluripotent ES cells that, under the appropriate stimulus, can differentiate into functional neurons. We inactivated both alleles of the GD3 synthase gene in mouse ES cells by targeted gene disruption. These double-targeted cells had a profound deficiency of GD3 synthase activity and did not produce b-series gangliosides. Despite this deficiency, ES cells were able to differentiate morphologically into neuronal cells and extend immunohistochemically identified axons and dendrites in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells. Our results indicate that GD3 synthase and b-series gangliosides are not required for these aspects of neuronal differentiation by uncommitted embryonic precursor cells. However, these gangliosides may have important roles in other nervous system functions such as in cell-cell recognition events (5Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Schnaar R.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that these functions may be evaluated in the context of the whole organism such as in mice with a disrupted GD3 synthase gene without consequences on neuronal differentiation. Evidence is emerging that large classes of complex gangliosides may be expendable for neuronal differentiation and central nervous system development. Mice deficient in GM2 synthase, lacking a-series and most complex gangliosides, develop a functional nervous system with apparently only subtle abnormalities (34Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10662-10667Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis did not impair growth or morphogenesis of cultured postimplantation embryos (35Brigande J.V. Platt F.M. Seyfried T.N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The present studies indicate that b-series gangliosides are not essential for neuronal differentiation of uncommitted precursor cells. In a limited differentiation assay, drug-induced depletion of most cellular gangliosides in neuroblastoma cells did not alter neurite formation (36Li R. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1349-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The unexpected absence of severe consequences for neuronal differentiation after elimination of gangliosides could indicate that the diversity of ganglioside structures affords some functional redundancy. It is also possible that gangliosides may not be essential for neuronal development and differentiation. The total elimination of ganglioside structures during neuronal development may be needed to settle this issue.

Plant β-amylases are similar to each other in terms of their physicochemical properties, i.e. molecular mass (50–60 kDa), optimum pH, amino acid sequence, and their subunit structure (with the exception of the homotetramer sweet potato β-amylase) (10French D.

The catalytic efficiency of the recombinant enzyme, however, was lower than that of the native enzyme.The crystal structure of native soybean β-amylase complexed with α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) 1The abbreviations used are: CD, cyclodextrin; r.m.s., root mean square; ME, 2-mercaptoethanol. 1The abbreviations used are: CD, cyclodextrin; r.m.s., root mean square; ME, 2-mercaptoethanol.was solved at 2.0 Å (12Mikami B.

The structural analysis of the soybean maltose-β-amylase complex indicated that Glu186 and Glu380 play important roles in the enzymatic reaction as general acid and base catalysts, respectively (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This finding is supported by the results of site-directed mutagenesis (17Totsuka A.

( Tokyo ). 1989; 105: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the structures of α-CD·β-amylase and maltose·β-amylase complexes revealed that a flexible loop plays a key role in the reaction.CDs and maltose competitively inhibit the activity of β-amylase by binding to the active cleft (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Nomura K. Mikami B. Morita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). α-CD binds to soybean β-amylase of an open loop form (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas two maltose molecules tandem bind within the active cleft of the enzyme in a closed loop form (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These maltose binding sites are located on both sides of the catalytic residues and are postulated to be substrate binding sites, subsites 1 and 2 and subsites 3 and 4 (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The structure of the α-CD·β-amylase complex showed that only one glucose residue in the α-CD binds near subsite 4, where the binding force essentially involves hydrophobic interactions (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The exact position of this glucose residue is shifted about one-half residue to the side of the reducing end, suggesting the flexibility of subsite 4 against altered positions of glucose residue (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This flexibility of subsite 4 may elucidate the mechanism of single chain attack of β-amylase on the polymeric substrate (11Thoma J.A. Spradlin J.E. Dygert S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 115-189Google Scholar, 21Suganuma T. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. Morita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 44: 1111-1117Google Scholar). β-CD is the cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of seven glucoses, while α-CD has six glucoses in the ring. The diameter of cavity in β-CD is about 1.2 times as long as that in α-CD, and the bond angle and two torsion angles in the glycosidic links differ slightly between the two CDs (22Saenger W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 136-139Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since theKi value of β-CD (1–2 mm) is roughly 3 times that of α-CD (0.3–0.5 mm) (23Thoma J.A. Koshland D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 3329-3333Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Marshall J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Nitta Y. Kunikata T. Watanabe T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1983; 93: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it should be clarified whether the glucose residue involved in the binding of α-CD still remains or whether the least favored interactions occur between β-CD and the enzyme.In this study, the cDNA sequence of soybean β-amylase was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The crystal structure of the recombinant β-amylase complexed with β-CD was analyzed at 2.07 Å to elucidate the flexibility of the substrate binding site.DISCUSSIONIn general, the expression level of a foreign protein in E. coli depends on the kind of promoter, the stabilities of mRNA and the protein product, the culture conditions, and other such factors (42Utsumi S. Kinsella J.E. Adv. Food Nutr. Res.36. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 89-208Google Scholar). To obtain a high level expression of recombinant soybean β-amylase, various experimental conditions were studied. The results indicated that the induction temperature and period were the most important factors for high level expression of soybean β-amylase. The system established here provided a recombinant enzyme having properties nearly identical to those of the native enzyme. Although our expression system was similar to that reported by Totsuka et al. (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), both the purified recombinant enzyme in this study and the native enzyme exhibited 3 times higher specific activity than that of the recombinant enzyme reported by these previous authors. As for the reasons why their recombinant enzyme had a much lower specific activity than the native enzyme, they proposed the following three factors: (i) the requirement of a molecular chaperon for correct folding; (ii) the requirement of N-terminal acetylation for activity; and (iii) the microheterogeneity of the native enzyme from soybean seed (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Comparing our recombinant enzyme with the native enzyme, we found no significant difference in catalytic characteristics or protein structures, indicating that soybean β-amylase does not require N-terminal acetylation and molecular chaperons other than those ofE. coli for its activity and folding. The cDNA used in this study differs in two positions from that reported by Totsukaet al. (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Gly202 and Arg399 in the cDNA from cv. Wasesuzunari were substituted with arginine and lysine, respectively, in the cDNA from cv. Bonminori. Gly202 and Arg399 are conserved in all other plant β-amylases sequenced so far (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The latter residue was found to be arginine in the protein sequence of soybean β-amylase (43Ji E.S. Mikami B. Kim J.P. Morita Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 3065-3067PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of β-amylase complexed with β-CD shows that Gly202 is about 10 Å from the catalytic residues near the molecular surface, and the substitution of Gly202 for arginine should cause steric hindrance with Tyr238 and Asn239. On the other hand, the atoms of N-η1 and N-η2 in Arg399 (about 20 Å from the active center) form direct hydrogen bonds with O atom in Asn10 (2.9 Å), O atom in Met441 (2.9 Å), and O atom in Lys44 (2.8 Å), and N-ε atoms form water-mediated hydrogen bonds with O-δ1 in Asp490. The substitution of Arg399 for lysine may distort the protein structure due to a breakdown of the hydrogen network. The two substitutions mentioned above were probably the reason for the higher expression level and specific activity of the recombinant enzyme in the system constructed here relative to those reported by Totsuka et al. (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The substitution at position 202 may have been particularly critical in this regard.We have determined the structure of β-CD·β-amylase complex and compared it with that of α-CD complex (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in order to investigate interactions between β-amylase and its substrates. Our results indicated no significant differences between the two protein structures. Two CD molecules bind to the enzyme with very similar interactions mainly at glucose residues 3 and 4, and the residue 4 was the most readily superimposed. The fact that β-CD has one more glucose residue than α-CD affects the increase of the φ angle between glucose residues 4 and 5. We suggest that the interactions at the glucose residues 3 and 4 are not so much rigid but rather work to hold a substrate in the successive reaction because glucose residue 4 in the α- and β-CDs is positioned about one-half residue from subsite 4 in the direction of the reducing end.Generally, amylases cleave substrates by a pathway in which they randomly encounter a substrate chain (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, β-amylase and animal α-amylase degrade polymeric substrates to products sequentially after complexing with the substrates in addition to degrading them randomly. This is commonly called a multiple attack (11Thoma J.A. Spradlin J.E. Dygert S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 115-189Google Scholar,44Bailey J.M. French J. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45French D. Nature. 1961; 190: 445-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and allows β-amylase to react efficiently. Here, we suggest that the binding site of CDs plays an important role in the action of the enzyme to retain the cleaved polymeric substrate (Fig.6). This would explain the mechanism of this intriguing reaction of β-amylase as follows; after a polymeric substrate, such as amylose, binds to each subsite of the enzyme from the nonreducing end, the flexible loop immediately closes. In this binding, the terminal maltose unit of the substrate (glucose residues 1 and 2) reverses by torsion in α-1,4-glycosidic linkage (step 1). The bound substrate is hydrolyzed by the two catalytic residues of Glu186 and Glu380 in β-amylase (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction produces β-anomeric maltose and a new substrate that is destined to be cleaved in the next step. The flexible loop then opens, resulting in the exposure of the active site to solvent and the departure of the produced β-maltose (step 2). For the next step, shift of the substrate occupying subsites 3 and 4 is required because the terminal maltose unit of the substrate has to reverse before binding to the subsites 1 and 2. The cleaved substrate is released from the subsites and held on the surface of the enzyme for the successive reaction. Furthermore, occupation of the CD-binding site by cleaved substrate fixes the flexible loop in an open conformation (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which would make it easy to take the substrate in subsites 1 and 2. After all, the holding of the cleaved substrate at the CD binding site leads to a single chain attack (the slipping mechanism) (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (step 3), whereas the release of the cleaved substrate into solvent leads to a multichain attack. The flexible binding of glucose around subsite 4 by hydrophobic interactions enables the slipping mechanism (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Leu383, which forms an inclusion complex, is one of the residues that contribute to the slipping mechanism (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Totsukaet al. (18Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Probably, Leu383 plays an important role in the single chain attack mechanism as well as in the binding of polymeric substrate, because the residue seems to block the cleaved substrate from release into the solvent (see Fig. 6). In addition, the side chain of His300 interacts with the glucose residue on subsite 4 or the residue 4 in CDs via hydrogen bonds. Since the extent of multiple attack can be varied by changing the pH (21Suganuma T. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. Morita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 44: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 46French D. Knapp D.W.

Attempts to reveal the detailed mechanism of β-amylase using x-ray structure analysis and enzymatic kinetics with the mutant enzymes obtained from the present system are currently in progress. β-Amylase (α-1,4-glucan maltohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.2) catalyzes the removal of β-anomeric maltose from the nonreducing ends of starch and glycogen. This enzyme is distributed in higher plants and in some microorganisms. The cDNAs from five kinds of plants (soybean (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J.

Plant β-amylases are similar to each other in terms of their physicochemical properties, i.e. molecular mass (50–60 kDa), optimum pH, amino acid sequence, and their subunit structure (with the exception of the homotetramer sweet potato β-amylase) (10French D.

The produced 7-fold mutant was more stable than the wild-type recombinant enzyme by 11.6 °C (14Yoshigi N. Okada Y. Maeda H. Sahara H. Tamaki T. J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of the recombinant enzyme, however, was lower than that of the native enzyme. The crystal structure of native soybean β-amylase complexed with α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) 1The abbreviations used are: CD, cyclodextrin; r.m.s., root mean square; ME, 2-mercaptoethanol. 1The abbreviations used are: CD, cyclodextrin; r.m.s., root mean square; ME, 2-mercaptoethanol.was solved at 2.0 Å (12Mikami B.

The structural analysis of the soybean maltose-β-amylase complex indicated that Glu186 and Glu380 play important roles in the enzymatic reaction as general acid and base catalysts, respectively (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This finding is supported by the results of site-directed mutagenesis (17Totsuka A.

( Tokyo ). 1989; 105: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the structures of α-CD·β-amylase and maltose·β-amylase complexes revealed that a flexible loop plays a key role in the reaction. CDs and maltose competitively inhibit the activity of β-amylase by binding to the active cleft (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Nomura K. Mikami B. Morita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). α-CD binds to soybean β-amylase of an open loop form (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas two maltose molecules tandem bind within the active cleft of the enzyme in a closed loop form (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These maltose binding sites are located on both sides of the catalytic residues and are postulated to be substrate binding sites, subsites 1 and 2 and subsites 3 and 4 (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The structure of the α-CD·β-amylase complex showed that only one glucose residue in the α-CD binds near subsite 4, where the binding force essentially involves hydrophobic interactions (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The exact position of this glucose residue is shifted about one-half residue to the side of the reducing end, suggesting the flexibility of subsite 4 against altered positions of glucose residue (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This flexibility of subsite 4 may elucidate the mechanism of single chain attack of β-amylase on the polymeric substrate (11Thoma J.A. Spradlin J.E. Dygert S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 115-189Google Scholar, 21Suganuma T. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. Morita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 44: 1111-1117Google Scholar). β-CD is the cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of seven glucoses, while α-CD has six glucoses in the ring. The diameter of cavity in β-CD is about 1.2 times as long as that in α-CD, and the bond angle and two torsion angles in the glycosidic links differ slightly between the two CDs (22Saenger W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 136-139Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since theKi value of β-CD (1–2 mm) is roughly 3 times that of α-CD (0.3–0.5 mm) (23Thoma J.A. Koshland D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 3329-3333Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Marshall J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Nitta Y. Kunikata T. Watanabe T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1983; 93: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it should be clarified whether the glucose residue involved in the binding of α-CD still remains or whether the least favored interactions occur between β-CD and the enzyme. In this study, the cDNA sequence of soybean β-amylase was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The crystal structure of the recombinant β-amylase complexed with β-CD was analyzed at 2.07 Å to elucidate the flexibility of the substrate binding site. DISCUSSIONIn general, the expression level of a foreign protein in E. coli depends on the kind of promoter, the stabilities of mRNA and the protein product, the culture conditions, and other such factors (42Utsumi S. Kinsella J.E. Adv. Food Nutr. Res.36. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 89-208Google Scholar). To obtain a high level expression of recombinant soybean β-amylase, various experimental conditions were studied. The results indicated that the induction temperature and period were the most important factors for high level expression of soybean β-amylase. The system established here provided a recombinant enzyme having properties nearly identical to those of the native enzyme. Although our expression system was similar to that reported by Totsuka et al. (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), both the purified recombinant enzyme in this study and the native enzyme exhibited 3 times higher specific activity than that of the recombinant enzyme reported by these previous authors. As for the reasons why their recombinant enzyme had a much lower specific activity than the native enzyme, they proposed the following three factors: (i) the requirement of a molecular chaperon for correct folding; (ii) the requirement of N-terminal acetylation for activity; and (iii) the microheterogeneity of the native enzyme from soybean seed (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Comparing our recombinant enzyme with the native enzyme, we found no significant difference in catalytic characteristics or protein structures, indicating that soybean β-amylase does not require N-terminal acetylation and molecular chaperons other than those ofE. coli for its activity and folding. The cDNA used in this study differs in two positions from that reported by Totsukaet al. (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Gly202 and Arg399 in the cDNA from cv. Wasesuzunari were substituted with arginine and lysine, respectively, in the cDNA from cv. Bonminori. Gly202 and Arg399 are conserved in all other plant β-amylases sequenced so far (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The latter residue was found to be arginine in the protein sequence of soybean β-amylase (43Ji E.S. Mikami B. Kim J.P. Morita Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 3065-3067PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of β-amylase complexed with β-CD shows that Gly202 is about 10 Å from the catalytic residues near the molecular surface, and the substitution of Gly202 for arginine should cause steric hindrance with Tyr238 and Asn239. On the other hand, the atoms of N-η1 and N-η2 in Arg399 (about 20 Å from the active center) form direct hydrogen bonds with O atom in Asn10 (2.9 Å), O atom in Met441 (2.9 Å), and O atom in Lys44 (2.8 Å), and N-ε atoms form water-mediated hydrogen bonds with O-δ1 in Asp490. The substitution of Arg399 for lysine may distort the protein structure due to a breakdown of the hydrogen network. The two substitutions mentioned above were probably the reason for the higher expression level and specific activity of the recombinant enzyme in the system constructed here relative to those reported by Totsuka et al. (1Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The substitution at position 202 may have been particularly critical in this regard.We have determined the structure of β-CD·β-amylase complex and compared it with that of α-CD complex (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in order to investigate interactions between β-amylase and its substrates. Our results indicated no significant differences between the two protein structures. Two CD molecules bind to the enzyme with very similar interactions mainly at glucose residues 3 and 4, and the residue 4 was the most readily superimposed. The fact that β-CD has one more glucose residue than α-CD affects the increase of the φ angle between glucose residues 4 and 5. We suggest that the interactions at the glucose residues 3 and 4 are not so much rigid but rather work to hold a substrate in the successive reaction because glucose residue 4 in the α- and β-CDs is positioned about one-half residue from subsite 4 in the direction of the reducing end.Generally, amylases cleave substrates by a pathway in which they randomly encounter a substrate chain (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, β-amylase and animal α-amylase degrade polymeric substrates to products sequentially after complexing with the substrates in addition to degrading them randomly. This is commonly called a multiple attack (11Thoma J.A. Spradlin J.E. Dygert S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 5. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 115-189Google Scholar,44Bailey J.M. French J. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45French D. Nature. 1961; 190: 445-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and allows β-amylase to react efficiently. Here, we suggest that the binding site of CDs plays an important role in the action of the enzyme to retain the cleaved polymeric substrate (Fig.6). This would explain the mechanism of this intriguing reaction of β-amylase as follows; after a polymeric substrate, such as amylose, binds to each subsite of the enzyme from the nonreducing end, the flexible loop immediately closes. In this binding, the terminal maltose unit of the substrate (glucose residues 1 and 2) reverses by torsion in α-1,4-glycosidic linkage (step 1). The bound substrate is hydrolyzed by the two catalytic residues of Glu186 and Glu380 in β-amylase (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction produces β-anomeric maltose and a new substrate that is destined to be cleaved in the next step. The flexible loop then opens, resulting in the exposure of the active site to solvent and the departure of the produced β-maltose (step 2). For the next step, shift of the substrate occupying subsites 3 and 4 is required because the terminal maltose unit of the substrate has to reverse before binding to the subsites 1 and 2. The cleaved substrate is released from the subsites and held on the surface of the enzyme for the successive reaction. Furthermore, occupation of the CD-binding site by cleaved substrate fixes the flexible loop in an open conformation (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which would make it easy to take the substrate in subsites 1 and 2. After all, the holding of the cleaved substrate at the CD binding site leads to a single chain attack (the slipping mechanism) (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (step 3), whereas the release of the cleaved substrate into solvent leads to a multichain attack. The flexible binding of glucose around subsite 4 by hydrophobic interactions enables the slipping mechanism (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Leu383, which forms an inclusion complex, is one of the residues that contribute to the slipping mechanism (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Totsukaet al. (18Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggested by site-directed mutagenesis that Leu383 may work to bind polymeric substrate as a winder (18Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Probably, Leu383 plays an important role in the single chain attack mechanism as well as in the binding of polymeric substrate, because the residue seems to block the cleaved substrate from release into the solvent (see Fig. 6). In addition, the side chain of His300 interacts with the glucose residue on subsite 4 or the residue 4 in CDs via hydrogen bonds. Since the extent of multiple attack can be varied by changing the pH (21Suganuma T. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. Morita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 44: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 46French D. Knapp D.W.

J. 1957; 67: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the residue may also play a key role in the multiple attack. Attempts to reveal the detailed mechanism of β-amylase using x-ray structure analysis and enzymatic kinetics with the mutant enzymes obtained from the present system are currently in progress.

After all, the holding of the cleaved substrate at the CD binding site leads to a single chain attack (the slipping mechanism) (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (step 3), whereas the release of the cleaved substrate into solvent leads to a multichain attack. The flexible binding of glucose around subsite 4 by hydrophobic interactions enables the slipping mechanism (16Mikami B. Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 47779-47787Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Leu383, which forms an inclusion complex, is one of the residues that contribute to the slipping mechanism (12Mikami B. Hehre E.J. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Totsukaet al. (18Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggested by site-directed mutagenesis that Leu383 may work to bind polymeric substrate as a winder (18Totsuka A. Fukazawa C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Probably, Leu383 plays an important role in the single chain attack mechanism as well as in the binding of polymeric substrate, because the residue seems to block the cleaved substrate from release into the solvent (see Fig. 6). In addition, the side chain of His300 interacts with the glucose residue on subsite 4 or the residue 4 in CDs via hydrogen bonds. Since the extent of multiple attack can be varied by changing the pH (21Suganuma T. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. Morita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 44: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 46French D. Knapp D.W.

J. 1957; 67: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the residue may also play a key role in the multiple attack. Attempts to reveal the detailed mechanism of β-amylase using x-ray structure analysis and enzymatic kinetics with the mutant enzymes obtained from the present system are currently in progress.

https://openalex.org/W2160266617,"A protein of 60 kDa (p60) has been identified using a quantitative in vitro vesicle-microtubule binding assay. Purified p60 induces co-sedimentation with microtubules of trans-Golgi network-derived vesicles isolated from polarized, perforated Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Sequencing of the cDNA coding for this protein revealed that it is the chicken homologue of formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), a liver-specific enzyme involved in the histidine degradation pathway. Purified p60 from chicken liver has formiminotransferase activity, confirming that it is FTCD or an isoform of this enzyme. Isoforms of FTCD were identified in chicken hepatoma and HeLa cells, and immunolocalize to the region of the Golgi complex and vesicular structures in its vicinity. Furthermore, 58K, a previously identified microtubule-binding Golgi protein from rat liver (Bloom, G. S., and Brashear, T. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16083–16092), is identical to FTCD. Both proteins co-purify with microtubules and co-localize with membranes of the Golgi complex. The capacity of FTCD to bind both to microtubules and Golgi-derived membranes may suggest that this protein, or one of its isoforms, might have in addition to its enzymatic activity, a second physiological function in mediating interaction of Golgi-derived membranes with microtubules.

Interphase microtubules and their associated motor proteins direct intracellular movements of essentially all cytoplasmic membrane-bounded organelles, and they are thus also responsible for the correct spatial arrangement of these organelles in a cell (1Goodson H.V. Valetti C. Kreis T.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Transport of trans-Golgi network derived vesicles (TGVs) 1The abbrevations used are: TGV, trans-Golgi network-derived vesicle; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CLIP, cytoplasmic linker protein; FTCD, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MBP, microtubule-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, piperazine-N′,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 2D, two-dimensional. in polarized epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to the apical and basolateral membrane occurs in two classes of vesicles and depends on microtubule-based motor proteins (2Lafont F. Burkhardt J.K. Simons K. Nature. 1994; 372: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast to the kinesin-dependent transport of basolaterally targeted vesicles, the delivery of apically destined vesicles to the plasma membrane requires kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein. The directionality of these motors correlates well with the topology of microtubules in polarized MDCK cells, arranged mainly apico-basolaterally, with their minus ends near the cell apex and their plus ends toward the basal cytoplasm (3Bacallao B. Antony C. Dotti C. Karsenti E. Stelzer E.H.K. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2817-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, motor protein independent binding of TGVs to microtubules occurs in vitro and depends on two different protein activities, suggesting that these interactions of apical and basolateral TGVs require specific proteins (4van der Sluijs P. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 545-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data reflect the complex mechanisms of the exocytic transport machinery between the trans-Golgi network and the cell surface in epithelial cells (5Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accessory factors have been identified which can improve the efficiencies of cytoplasmic dynein- and kinesin-dependent movements (6Schroer T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 321-328Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Sheetz M.P. Yu H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 329-334Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Of these, the dynactin complex is clearly the best characterized (8Allan V. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 630-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, a new family of proteins mediating interaction of membranous organelles with microtubules has been discovered using a number of different in vitro assays. These cytoplasmic linker proteins (CLIPs) appear to be involved in the initial docking of membranes to microtubules preceding the motor-dependent movement (9Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 178-183Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have used the previously established in vitromicrotubule-binding assay (4van der Sluijs P. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 545-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for further characterizing the specific interaction of MDCK TGVs with microtubules at the molecular level and have identified a 60-kDa chicken liver microtubule-binding protein (MBP). Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA coding for p60 revealed that it is the chicken homologue of formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD) (10Murley L.L. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22820-22824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a liver-specific enzyme, and 58K, a rat liver enzyme described in the accompanying paper (56Bashour A.-M. Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19612-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2In the accompanying paper (56Bashour A.-M. Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19612-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), Bashour and Bloom report that 58K, a microtubule-binding protein, is a FTCD. FTCD was originally identified and characterized in pig liver (11Tabor H. Wyngarden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1830-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is involved in the histidine degradation pathway. A potential dual physiological function of FTCD, or one of its isoforms, will be discussed. MDCK II cells (12Bennett M.K. Wandinger-Ness A. Simons K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and HeLa spinner cells (9Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 178-183Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously. Adherent HeLa cells were grown in minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 5% fetal calf serum, and 1% nonessential amino acids. DU249 chicken hepatoma cells (13Langlois A.J. Lapis K. Ishizaki R. Beard J.W. Bolognesi D.P. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 1457-1464PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% FCS. All cell cultures were grown with 5% CO2 in a humidified 37 °C incubator. Media and reagents for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, FRG or Cergy, France) unless stated otherwise. Immunofluorescence was essentially performed as described previously (14Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). DU249 chicken hepatoma cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed three times in PHE10M (60 mm K-PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mmEGTA, 2 mm MgOAc, pH 6.9) at 37 °C, prior to fixation for 20 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, FRG) in PHE10M, pH 7.5. They were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS with or without 0.05% SDS for 4 min at room temperature. HeLa cells were fixed and extracted for 4 min at −20 °C in methanol. The following secondary antibodies were used: Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit (Sigma) and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch Co., West Grove, PA) for the DU249 cells; and rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse for HeLa cells (15Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DU249 cells were visualized with a multimode videomicroscope including a modified Zeiss Axiovert 135. Images were recorded with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics CH250), controlled by an Apple Macintosh Quadra 950. Image processing was achieved using Adobe Photoshop software, and photographs were printed on a Kodak ColorEase PS printer. Visualization of HeLa cells was done with a Zeiss inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert TV10) and a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics CH250), controlled by an Apple Macintosh 840a. Images of HeLa cells were processed using IPLab Spectrum V2.3 software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA) and printed on a Slidewriter IS200 (Focus Graphics, Foster City, CA). The following antibodies were used: mAbs against rat liver 58K (anti-58K-2, -4, -7, -9, and -12) (16Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mAb SUK4 against kinesin (17Ingold A.L. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), mAb 100/3 against γ-Adaptin (18Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), maD against β-COP (19Pepperkok R. Scheel J. Horstmann H. Hauri H.-P. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), mAb 2D6 (20Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17597-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against porcine FTCD (from Dr. MacKenzie, McGill University, Montréal, who also generously provided us with purified recombinant FTCD). Antibodies against synthetic peptides of chicken p60 (“LVEC,” aa 4–17; “KKVQ,” aa 217–228; “IIEY,” aa 321–333; “KLPK,” aa 424–438; and “KQGS,” aa 526–541) were raised in rabbits or rats essentially as described earlier (14Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For immunization peptides were either synthesized on an 8-branched polylysine core (21Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) or coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier. Peptide antibodies were affinity-purified on the corresponding peptides coupled to BSA on CNBr-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia LKB GmbH, Freiburg, FRG). 1 mg of peptide was incubated with 1 mg of BSA and 8 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (Sigma) in a final volume of 1 ml (in H2O) for 1 h at room tempeature on a rotating wheel. After dialysis against 0.2 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl pH 8.5, the peptide/BSA solution was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads, and antibodies were affinity purified. Polyclonal antibodies were also raised in rabbits against the p60 band from chicken liver excised from preparative 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel piece was washed with PBS, homogenized, and emulsified in an equal volume of complete (first immunization) or incomplete (first/second boosts) Freund's adjuvant (Life Technologies, Inc.), or diluted in PBS (for further boosts). Sera (no. 148) were affinity-purified on immunoblots with purified chicken liver or recombinant p60 (15Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were also raised in rabbits against purified bacterially expressed poly-his-tagged full-length p60 (no. N1) or a 153-aa N-terminal fragment of p60 (no. 568) according to the same immunization protocol and affinity purified as indicated above (14Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). All these antibodies raised against p60 reacted with the antigen by immunoblotting. The in vitrobinding assay was performed as described (4van der Sluijs P. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 545-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that [35S]methionine-labeled, flotation-purified vesicles were used (obtained from ∼0.25–0.5 × 106 pulse-labeled, filter-grown MDCK II cells). The amount of radioactivity in the supernatant and pellet fractions was quantified by liquid scintillation counting, using Ready Safe scintillation mixture (Beckman Instruments GmbH, München, FRG). The percentage of binding was calculated using the formula Rp /(Rp + Rs), where Rp andRs denote the amount of radioactivity in the pellet and supernatant, respectively. The total recovery of radioactivity (Rp + Rs) was in the range of 80–90% of the total input radioactivity. Tubulin was prepared from bovine brain and polymerized with taxol (referred to as “microtubules” in this work) as described previsously (15Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Microtubules were stored in liquid nitrogen for up to 6 months. Pulse-labeling of filter-grown MDCK II cells was performed according to previously described procedures (12Bennett M.K. Wandinger-Ness A. Simons K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MDCK II cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask were seeded in 20 ml of growth medium onto one 100-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size, premounted polycarbonate filter (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown for 3 days in a special holder in a Petri dish containing 140 ml of growth medium. For pulse-labeling, cells were rinsed twice with PBS containing 0.9 mmCaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2(PBS+). The basal side of the filter was then placed onto 2 ml of “pulse-labeling medium” (methionine-free minimal Eagle's medium containing 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.2% BSA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) containing 500 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, FRG) on Parafilm in a humid chamber and covered with 2.5 ml of the same medium lacking radioactivity. Labeling was stopped after 90 min by washing and incubating the cells for 2 h at 20 °C in “20 °C medium” (methionine-free minimal Eagle's medium containing 0.35 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.2% BSA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 150 μg/ml unlabeled methionine (10-fold excess) and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. TGVs were then isolated and purified on discontinuous equilibrium density gradients as described (22Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This flotation-purified vesicle fraction was then either used immediately as the “TGVs” in the in vitroorganelle-microtubule binding assays or frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cytosol from HeLa spinner and MDCK II cells was prepared as described (4van der Sluijs P. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 545-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For heat treatment, cytosol was incubated for 3 min at 95 °C, cooled on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. To cleave cytoplasmic dynein, HeLa cytosol was treated with UV light in the presence of vanadate and ATP (23Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Scheel J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18141-18148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cytosol was immunodepleted of kinesin by incubation with Sepharose beads carrying the mAb SUK4. Immunodepletion of CLIP-170 from HeLa cytosol was performed with mAb 2D6 as described previously (25Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Livers (∼70 g) from four freshly sacrificed chickens were minced on ice with scalpels and homogenized with a Polytron tissue grinder (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland) three times, 20 s each, with 20-s intervals in 1.1 volume of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm K-HEPES, 0.3 m sucrose, pH 7.0) supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml chymotrypsin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A; Sigma, Deisenhofen, FRG). All subsequent steps were performed at 0–4 °C unless otherwise specified. A post-nuclear supernatant, prepared by centrifugation of the homogenate at 17,000 × g for 15 min, was filtered through glass wool by suction and recentrifuged at 180,000 × g for 90 min to obtain a liver cytosol fraction (yield ∼50 ml at ∼30 mg protein/ml). This cytosol fraction was diluted 3-fold to a final concentration of 10 mm K-HEPES, 0.1 m sucrose, pH 6.8, and incubated for 30–40 min with 0.5 volume of S-Sepharose cation-exchange beads (Pharmacia LKB GmbH, Freiburg, FRG) preequilibrated in 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 6.8. The beads were sedimented at 1000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was further clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to pH 8.0 by addition of 0.01 volume of 1 m Tris and loaded onto an EMD-DEAE anion-exchange column (Merck, Darmstadt, FRG) containing 1 volume of packed beads preequilibrated with buffer A (10 mmTris-Hepes, 6.5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0). Fractions of 2.5 ml eluted from the column with an increasing salt gradient of buffer B (1m KCl in buffer A) on a FPLC system (Pharmacia LKB GmbH, Freiburg, FRG) were analyzed in vitro in the organelle-microtubule binding assay. The fractions containing the peak of activity (from ∼400 to 450 mm KCl) were pooled and dialyzed against PB buffer (0.1 m PIPES-KOH, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 6.9). To these pooled and dialyzed EMD-DEAE fractions (∼1 mg/ml) microtubules were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Taxol (20 μm) was present in this and all subsequent steps. After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, this solution was centrifuged at 25 °C at 46,000 × g for 30 min through a 0.3 volume cushion of 30% sucrose in PB buffer containing Taxol. The pellet was resuspended in 1/12 the original volume of PB buffer containing 0.8m KCl and Taxol, incubated for 15 min at 25 °C, and spun as above without a cushion. The supernatant containing p60 was dialyzed against PB buffer, aliquots (at ∼0.5 mg/ml) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Taking into account all volume changes during the purification of p60, the equivalent volume of the final p60 fraction was about one-fourth that of the initial cytosol. Preparation of p60 from turkey liver was carried out according to the same protocol. Approximately 1 nmol (∼85 μg) of purified chicken liver p60 was run on preparative 6–12% SDS-PAGE. Trypsin digestion of the Coomassie Blue-stained p60 band and sequencing of the resulting purified tryptic peptides were performed as described (26Gausepohl H. Trosin M. Frank R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Salnikow J. Erdmann V.A. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer Verlag, Berlin1986: 149-160Crossref Google Scholar, 27Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Six degenerate oligonucleotide hybridization probes with a length of 23 bases were synthesized from the following peptide sequences: NFSEGCN(K) (amino acids 10–17, oligonucleotides 1a, b); FILEEEH(K) (amino acids 292–299, oligonucleotides 2a, b); and VQAGQED(K) (amino acids 326–333, oligonucleotide 3). The sequences of the oligonucleotides were: 1a, 5′-AA(CT)TT(CT)TC(ACGT)GA(AG)GG(ACGT)TG(CT)AA(CT)AA-3′; 1b, 5′-AA(CT)TT(CT)AG(CT)GA(AG)GG(ACGT)TG(CT)AA(CT)AA-3′; 2a, 5′-TT(CT)AT(ACT)CT(ACGT)GA(AG)GA(AG)GA(AG)CA(CT)AA-3′; 2b, 5′-TT(CT)AT(ACT)TT(AG)GA(AG)GA(AG)GA(AG)CA(CT)AA-3′; and 3, 5′-GT(ACGT)CA(AG)GC(ACGT)GG(ACGT)CA(AG)GA(AG)GA(CT)AA-3′. All nucleotides in parentheses were included at that position. Oligonucleotides 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3 were 512, 256, 384, 192, and 1024-fold degenerates, respectively. Approximately 1,400,000 phage plaques of an oligo(dT)-primed chicken liver cDNA library made in the lambda ZAPII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were analyzed in the first round of screening. Briefly, oligonucleotides 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b were 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, FRG). Plating of phages and preparation of duplicate nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, FRG) were performed using standard techniques (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After baking for 2 h at 80 °C, nitrocellulose filters were washed four times, 15 min each, in 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, 1.5 h in 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, then in 6× SSC for 10 min at room temperature to remove bacterial debris. Prehybridization was done overnight at 42 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 0.5% SDS. Hybridization was carried out for 24 h at 39 °C in 6× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA supplemented with a mixture of 32P-kinase-labeled oligonucleotides 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b at 1.1 × 106 cpm/ml. Filters were washed four times, 15 min each, at room temperature in filter wash buffer (6× SSC, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate), followed by three successive washes for 30 min each at 40, 44, and 48 °C, then 15 min at 50 °C, before being exposed wet against x-ray film (X-Omat AR films, Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2 days at −70 °C. Filters were re-wetted in 6× SSC, washed for 30 min at 54 °C in filter wash buffer, and reexposed for 1.5 days at −70 °C. 21 positive phage plaques were identified in the first screening, which were verified and further isolated in second and third rounds of screening. These screening cycles were performed as described above, except that triplicate nitrocellulose filters were prepared and hybridized separately with 32P-kinase-labeled oligonucleotides 1a + b, 2a + b, and 3 at 40 °C for 19 h at 1 × 106 cpm/ml. Filters were washed as described for the first screening, except that the washing procedure was stopped at 48 °C for filters hybridized with oligonucleotides 2a + b, at 50 °C with oligonucleotides 1a + b and at 54 °C with oligonucleotide 3. 11 clones remained which hybridized with all three oligonucleotides. Clones obtained from the λZAPII library were excised as Bluescript KS plasmids with helper phage according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA isolation from transformed bacteria, and restriction map analyses of the clones were carried out using standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Boehringer (Mannheim, FRG), unless stated otherwise. Clones were also analyzed by dideoxy sequencing of their 5′- and 3′-terminal ends, using plasmid DNA purified on Qiagen columns (Diagen GmbH, Düsseldorf, FRG). Sequencing was performed with α-35S-labeled dATP (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, FRG) and a T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia LKB GmbH, Freiburg, FRG). Of the 11 clones analyzed, clone 9 was selected for further characterization, since it had the correct size expected for the cDNA of a 60-kDa protein and contained the putative ATG initiation codon. Other clones were identical, smaller, or extended clone 9 to the 3′ end. Unidirectional deletion clones of clone 9 were made, using a nested deletion kit (Pharmacia LKB GmbH) with exonuclease III (Freiburg, FRG) and sequenced as described above. The sequence of the opposite strand of clone 9 was determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing with fluorescent synthetic oligonucleotides as primers and the EMBL sequencing device. Using these two strategies, overlapping identical sequences on both strands were obtained for the entire cDNA. Sequence data were compiled and analyzed using the University of Wisconsin GCG programs (Madison, WI) (29Devereux J. Haebeli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Molecular weight, amino acid composition, and secondary structure prediction of p60 were established using the GCG programs PEPTIDESORT and PEPTIDE-STRUCTURE (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). FASTA (30Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Potential sites for post-translational modifications were identified by searching the PROSITE data library (32Bairoch A. EMBL Biocomputing Technical Document 4. European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany1989Google Scholar) with the program SCRUTINEER (33Sibbald P.R. Argos P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of p60 with itself, the so far characterized MBPs and porcine FTCD was performed using the Interactive Sensitive Sequence Comparison program ISSC (34Rechid R. Vingron M. Argos P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 107-1013PubMed Google Scholar). The window length for these comparisons ranged from 5 to 35, in steps of 2, at a stringency of 40. The different Bluescript templates were linearized at convenient 3′-restriction sites and RNAs were produced by in vitro transcription using anin vitro transcription kit with T3 polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translation of the RNAs was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) with [35S]methionine for 60 min at 30 °C (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The reaction mixture of [35S]methionine-labeled p60,in vitro translated from clone 9, was clarified at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Briefly, the supernatant was diluted 1:20 with TNT buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated with 0.01 volume of anti-p60 in the presence of hemoglobin (0.5 mg/ml final concentration). After 12–16 h, 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (a 50% v/v slurry in TNT; Pharmacia LKB GmbH, Freiburg, FRG) was added for 2 h. All incubations were at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were then washed 3 × 10 min in TNT buffer, and rinsed once in water. Protein bound to the beads was solubilized in 50 μl of gel sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For total cell extract and cytosol preparation, confluent chicken hepatoma (DU249) and adherent HeLa cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then once with ice-cold homogenization buffer Kpi (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.3; 20% glycerol; 0.02% TX-100; 35 mm2-mercaptoethanol; 1 mm benzamidine; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), as used for the purification of recombinant FTCD (10Murley L.L. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22820-22824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Cells were scraped in Kpi (1.5 ml per 100-mm Petri dish) and sedimented at 300 × g for 2 min. The pellet of cells from 10 Petri dishes was resuspended in 500 μl of Kpi. DU249 cells were Dounce-homogenized, 8–10 times; HeLa cells were broken by four cycles of dounce homogenization (20 strokes) followed by 20 passages through a 22-gauge needle. Aliquots of this total cell extract were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C or incubated with 1 volume of 95 °C preheated 2× gel sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The rest of the homogenate was spun at 17,000 × g for 15 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris, and the post-nuclear supernatant was further clarified at 180,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction. Aliquots of this cytosol were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cytosol from rat liver was prepared as described above for chicken liver, except that the homogenization buffer was PB containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. A sample for SDS-PAGE of total cell extract of chicken or rat liver was taken immediately after h"
https://openalex.org/W1989569836,"The determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding to its binding proteins (IGFBPs) are poorly characterized in terms of important residues in the IGFBP molecule. We have previously used tyrosine iodination to implicate Tyr-60 in the IGF-binding site of bovine IGFBP-2 (Hobba, G. D., Forbes, B. E., Parkinson, E. J., Francis, G. L., and Wallace, J. C. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 30529–30536). In this report, we show that the mutagenic replacement of Tyr-60 with either Ala or Phe reduced the affinity of bIGFBP-2 for IGF-I (4.0- and 8.4-fold, respectively) and for IGF-II (3.5- and 4.0-fold, respectively). Although adjacent residues Val-59, Thr-61, Pro-62, and Arg-63 are well conserved in IGFBP family members, Ala substitution for these residues did not reduce the IGF affinity of bIGFBP-2. Kinetic analysis of the bIGFBP-2 mutants on IGF biosensor chips in the BIAcore instrument revealed that Tyr-60 → Phe bIGFBP-2 bound to the IGF-I surface 3.0-fold more slowly than bIGFBP-2 and was released 2.6-fold more rapidly than bIGFBP-2. We therefore propose that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-60 participates in a hydrogen bond that is important for the initial complex formation with IGF-I and the stabilization of this complex. In contrast, Tyr-60 → Ala bIGFBP-2 associated with the IGF-I surface 5.0-fold more rapidly than bIGFBP-2 but exhibited an 18.4-fold more rapid release from this surface compared with bIGFBP-2. Thus both the aromatic nature and the hydrogen bonding potential of the tyrosyl side chain of Tyr-60 are important structural determinants of the IGF-binding site of bIGFBP-2. The determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding to its binding proteins (IGFBPs) are poorly characterized in terms of important residues in the IGFBP molecule.

King G. Flier J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The biological activities of the IGFs are mediated mainly through the type 1 IGF receptor which is found on the surface of most cell types (1Leroith D. King G. Flier J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Ballard F.J. Walton P.W. Dunshea F.R. Francis G.L. Tomas F.M. Baxter R.C. Gluckman P.D. Rosenfeld R.G. The Insulin-like Growth Factors and Their Regulatory Proteins. Excerpta Medical, New York1994: 131-138Google Scholar). In turn, the bioavailability of the IGFs is regulated by a family of IGF-specific binding proteins (IGFBPs). The IGFBP family consists of six high affinity IGFBPs (IGFBP-1 to 6) (reviewed in Refs. 3Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar and 4Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly an additional four proteins that can associate with IGFs with lower affinity (5Oh Y Nagalla S.R. Yamanaka Y. Kim H.-S. Wilson E. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 30322-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 6Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2645-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conserved gene structures and the high degree of sequence identity between the high affinity IGFBPs suggest that these proteins possess three domains and a common IGF binding motif (3Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Baxter R.C. Horm. Res. ( Basel ). 1994; 42: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The sequences of two of these putative domains, the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains, are highly conserved. Where the IGFBP family members differ is in the middle domain and in the possession of phosphorylation and glycosylation sites or sites of association with other biomolecules such as heparin or the integrin receptor (3Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the molecular level, the IGFs have been well characterized. High resolution NMR structures of both IGF-I (8Sato A. Nishimura S. Ohkubo T. Kyogoku Y. Koyama S. Kobayashi M. Yasuda T. Kobayashi Y.

However, insight into the overall structure of the IGFBPs has been restricted to multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction (19Landale E.C. Strong D.D. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the growing number of IGFBP mutagenic studies described to date has focused on aspects of IGFBP biology such as heparin binding (20Arai T. Clarke J. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Nam T.

In terms of the IGF-binding site, both the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains of IGFBPs are believed to participate. This is suggested by the observations that N-terminal cysteine-rich domains of IGFBP-1 (26Huhtala M.L. Koistinen R. Palomaki P. Partanen P. Bohn H. Seppala M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hossenlopp P. Lassarre C. Segova B. Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-Like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 329-336Google Scholar) all possess residual IGF binding affinity. Yet, the specific residues of IGFBPs that are directly involved in IGF binding have not been identified. The rationale for this study is based on our observation that Tyr-60 was protected from iodination in the IGF·bIGFBP-2 complex (32Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E. Parkinson E.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30529-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when Tyr-60 was iodinated, it caused a reduction in the binding affinity of bIGFBP-2 for the IGF ligand. However, the residues Val-59, Thr-61, Pro-62, and Arg-63 could also conceivably play a role in IGF binding that is disrupted when Tyr-60 is iodinated. These latter residues are highly conserved across the whole IGFBP family, whereas all of the described IGFBP-1 sequences from various species possess an alanyl rather than tyrosyl residue at the position corresponding to Tyr-60 in bIGFBP-2, as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, in order to determine which residues in the Tyr-60 region of bIGFBP-2 do influence IGF binding, alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been performed across residues 59 and 63 inclusive. Tyr-60 has also been substituted with Phe to distinguish between the hydrogen bonding properties and the hydrophobic and aromatic properties of the tyrosyl side chain with respect to IGF binding. In this report, the IGF binding characteristics of Val-59 → Ala, Tyr-60 → Ala, Tyr-60 → Phe, Thr-61 → Ala, Pro-62 → Ala, and Arg-63 → Ala bIGFBP-2 have been compared with bIGFBP-2 by Western ligand blot, solution binding assays, and in BIAcore experiments with immobilized IGFs. Mutagenic replacement of Tyr-60 with either Ala or Phe reduced the affinity of bIGFBP-2 for IGF-I (4.0- and 8.4-fold, respectively) and for IGF-II (3.5-fold and 4.0-fold respectively). In contrast, Ala substitution for adjacent residues Val-59, Thr-61, Pro-62, and Arg-63 did not greatly affect the IGF affinity of bIGFBP-2. Recombinant bIGFBP-2 was transiently expressed in the COS-1 (ATCC:CRL 1650) monkey kidney cell line and purified from medium conditioned by the transfected cells as described previously (33Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Receptor grade IGF-I and IGF-II were the kind gifts of GroPep Pty. Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). Radiolabeled 125I-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-II peptides were prepared to a specific activity of approximately 3 kBq/mol as described previously (34Francis G.L. Upton F.M. Ballard F.J. McNeil K.A. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Carrier-free Na125I was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Sydney, Australia). Reverse-phase HPLC columns were purchased from Brownlee Lab (Santa Clara, CA) and Amrad (Sydney, Australia). Pre-siliconized tubes (Sorenson BioScience, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) were used for the collection of fractions during chromatography. All HPLC was carried out using Waters 510 solvent pumps, a Waters 490 4-channel absorbance detector (Millipore-Waters, Lane Cove, New South Wales), and a Perkin-Elmer LS4 fluorescence spectrometer (Scoresby, Victoria, Australia). The Waters Maxima software package was used to control solvent gradients and for data collection. HPLC-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Merck (Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia) and trifluoroacetic acid from Sigma-Aldrich (Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia). All other reagents were analytical grade. Nitrocellulose filters were purchased from Schleicher & Schüll (Dassel, Germany). BIAcore reagents and supplies including CM5 sensor chips, HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), amine coupling reagents,N-ethyl-N′-[(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide,N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine were kindly provided by Pharmacia & Upjohn AB, Preclinical Research, Stockholm, Sweden, or were purchased from Amrad, Melbourne, Australia. A 344-base pair PstI-SmaI fragment of the bIGFBP-2 pXMT2 based expression vector pGF8 (33Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that encompassed the Tyr-60 region was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the phagemid vector Bluescript pBKS(−) (Stratagene). Mutagenesis was carried out by the Kunkel method (35Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) with the MutaGeneTM Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis Version 2 kit (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, New South Wales, Australia). Six mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bresatec Ltd., Thebarton, South Australia, Australia. A summary of the mutagenic oligonucleotide sequences and the resulting amino acid sequence changes in bIGFBP-2 are shown in Fig. 2. For screening purposes, the mismatch oligonucleotides also disrupted the 5′-GTAC-3′ RsaI endonuclease site between the codons GTG and TAC of Val-59 and Tyr-60. Therefore, positive clones were identified by diagnostic RsaI digestion followed by polymerase chain reaction DNA sequencing (36Gyllensten U.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 700-708PubMed Google Scholar) using the sequencing primers 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′ and 5′-CACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′ which were complementary to flanking sequences at the insertion site of pBKS(−). Finally, pGF8 variants harboring the Tyr-60 region mutants were regenerated by subcloning the mutagenizedPstI-SmaI fragments into the parent vector pGF8. The expression vector integrity and correct base changes were confirmed by RsaI restriction analysis and dye terminator DNA sequencing (PRISM, Applied Biosystems, Victoria, Australia) using the primer 5′-CTCGCCGTTGTCTGCAACCTGCTCCGGG-3′. bIGFBP-2 mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells and purified as described previously (33Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lyophilized samples of approximately 10 μg of each bIGFBP-2 mutant were submitted for electrospray mass spectrometry. The analysis was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer SCI-EX API-300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer at the Australian Research Council electrospray mass spectrometry unit, Adelaide. Peptide concentrations were accurately quantified by both reverse-phase HPLC as described (32Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E. Parkinson E.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol.

The samples were either stained with silver (39Tunon P. Johansson K.E. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 9: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) or transferred onto nitrocellulose filters for Western ligand blotting (40Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The level of 125I-IGF-II binding to the bIGFBP samples on the filter was visualized and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-348W1 Peltier Type Temperature Controller set to 20 °C. bIGFBP-2 samples were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml with 10 mm sodium phosphate, 60 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and placed in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 190 nm with a step resolution of 0.2 nm and a scanning speed of 20 nm/min. The response time was set to 1 s and the bandwidth was 0.5 nm. Each spectrum is the average of five accumulated scans. The relative IGF binding affinities of the bIGFBP-2 mutants were determined at equilibrium by charcoal binding assay, essentially as described previously (41Szabo L. Mottershead D.G. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The assay buffer pH was 7.4 and the IGFBP/IGF-tracer incubation period was 24 h at room temperature. Each bIGFBP-2 concentration was assayed in triplicate, and the total analysis was performed twice. In assays containing 125I-IGF-I, approximately 7,000 cpm/tube were used, and the nonspecific binding was 6% of the total radioactivity added. Similarly, 10,000 cpm/tube of125I-IGF-II were used with a nonspecific binding of 8% of the total radioactivity added. The experimental data were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response model with variable slope using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc., San Diego). All BIAcore analyses were carried out with IGF as the immobilized ligand. Covalent attachment of either IGF-I or IGF-II to the CM5 biosensor chip was achieved by the amine coupling method (42Löfås S. Johnsson B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 21: 1526-1528Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, IGF (12.5 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7) was injected onto the activated CM5 surface at 5 μl/min with HBS (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) as the running buffer. Residual binding sites were quenched with ethanolamine. The multichannel capability of the BIAcore 2000 was used to generate channels with either IGF-I or IGF-II surfaces (prepared to final resonance values of approximately 60 to 120 RU above the resonance value of the activated but underivatized chip) as well as a reference surface to which no IGF was bound. In a kinetic study, bIGFBP-2 and bIGFBP-2 mutants (5–100 nm in HBS, n = 6 per bIGFBP-2 species) were injected for 5 min at a flow rate of 40 μl/min with HBS as the running buffer. The dissociation phase, initiated by switching from the stream of the bIGFBP-2 sample to HBS, was carried out over a period of 10 min. The IGF surfaces were regenerated by a 90-s injection of 0.1 mHCl. Due to the large number of bIGFBP-2 samples and the extended length of the experiment, samples were injected in random order, and the experiment was carried out twice on two different chips rather than with duplicate samples on a single chip. The apparent analyte association and dissociation rates were derived by fitting the experimental data to either a one-site (IGF-I) or two-site (IGF-II) association model and a two-site dissociation model with the BIAevaluation software (version 2.1) supplied with the instrument. The Tyr-60 region bIGFBP-2 mutant constructs were sequenced in the expression plasmid pGF8, and the expected DNA sequences were obtained. Transient expression of bIGFBP-2 mutants in transfected COS-1 cells yielded approximately 400 μg of each purified protein from 0.5 liters of conditioned medium. All of the bIGFBP-2 mutants migrated as single bands of the same size as wild-type bIGFBP-2 when run on nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 a). A minor band corresponding to bIGFBP-2 dimer was also evident in the SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3, a and b). When analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, the observed mass of each mutant with the exception of Tyr-60 → Ala corresponded with the sequence-predicted mass to within 3 mass units. Tyr-60 → Ala bIGFBP-2 possessed a mass that was 18 mass units greater than expected, possibly due to methionine oxidation. Electrospray mass spectrometry also indicated that in each of the bIGFBP-2 and bIGFBP-2 mutant samples there was a small but consistent contamination (approximately 5%) with a species that was 355 mass units greater than the predicted mass. When the N-terminal sequence of the minor contaminant of wild-type bIGFBP-2 was determined, the larger species was identified as a mis-processed form of bIGFBP-2. The N terminus of the contaminant was Gly-Ala-Arg-Ala, corresponding to the last four residues of the leader peptide prior to the normal cleavage site (43Bourner M.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Siegel N.R. Krivi G.G. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) of mature bIGFBP-2. The secondary structure composition of the bIGFBP-2 mutants were compared with wild-type bIGFBP-2 using CD spectroscopy. An overlay of the far UV spectra of Val-59 → Ala, Tyr-60 → Ala, Tyr-60 → Phe bIGFBP-2, and wild-type bIGFBP-2 (Fig.4) shows that the spectra of these engineered bIGFBP-2 analogs were essentially the same as wild-type bIGFBP-2. Any slight deviation from the CD spectra of bIGFBP-2 could be explained by minor differences in protein concentration. The CD spectra of Thr-61 → Ala, Pro-62 → Ala, and Arg-63 → Ala bIGFBP-2 were also very similar to wild-type bIGFBP-2 (not shown; these spectra were omitted for clarity). The 125I-IGF-II binding by the bIGFBP-2 mutants was analyzed by Western ligand blot (Fig.3 b). Val-59 → Ala, Tyr-60 → Ala, and Tyr-60 → Phe bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 3 b, lanes 2, 3 and 4) showed reduced 125I-IGF-II binding compared with wild-type bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 3 b, lane 1). An estimate of the relative binding of each bIGFBP-2 mutant was provided by direct comparison of the band intensities from the ligand blot and the silver-stained gel. After the bound 125I-IGF-II radioactivity corresponding to each bIGFBP-2 species was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig.3 b) and corrected for the amount of peptide present on the silver-stained gel (Fig. 3 a), it was estimated that Val-59 → Ala, Tyr-60 → Ala, and Tyr-60 → Phe bIGFBP-2 retained approximately 40, 9, and 15% of the 125I-IGF-II bound by bIGFBP-2 respectively. In contrast, Thr-61 → Ala, Pro-62 → Ala, and Arg-63 → Ala bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 3 b, lanes 5–7) all bound125I-IGF-II to a similar extent to bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 3 b, lane 1). The IGF binding abilities of the bIGFBP-2 mutants were characterized in solution binding assays (Fig.5, TableI). Alanine substitution for Val-59, Thr-61, Pro-62, and Arg-63 of bIGFBP-2 did not significantly alter the half-maximal binding concentration (EC50) of bIGFBP-2 for either 125I-IGF-I (Fig. 5 a) or125I-IGF-II (Fig. 5 b). In contrast both Ala and Phe substitution for Tyr-60 of bIGFBP-2 resulted in a significant increase in the EC50 for both 125I-IGF-I (Tyr-60 → Ala = 3.4-fold and Tyr-60 → Phe = 4.7-fold) and125I-IGF-II (Tyr-60 → Ala = 2.2-fold and Tyr-60 → Phe = 3.3-fold). The maximal 125I-IGF binding of the bIGFBP-2 mutants was similar to wild-type bIGFBP-2 with 60% of added IGF tracer for 125I-IGF-I and 47% of added IGF tracer for125I-IGF-II. An exception was 125I-IGF-II tracer binding to Tyr-60 → Phe bIGFBP-2, where the maximal binding was 37%, a reduction by 15 with respect to wild-type bIGFBP-2 (Table I).Table ISummary of IGF binding parameters derived from solution binding assaysMaximum boundaThe maximum level of 125I-IGF binding attained in the assay is expressed as a percentage of total 125I-IGF added.Relative maximal bindingEC50bThe concentration of bIGFBP-2 peptide required to bind 50% of the maximum 125I-IGF binding level attained in the assay.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic analyses of the association and dissociation of bIGFBP-2 and the bIGFBP-2 mutants with immobilized IGF-I and IGF-II were carried out in the BIAcore. Fig.6, a and b, shows a representative subset of the sensorgram data (for qualitative comparison) that was used to generate the kinetic constants summarized in Table II. The interactions between all of the bIGFBP-2 peptides and both IGF-I and IGF-II were difficult to resolve to a single binding site model. In the case of IGF-I interactions, a single apparent association constant and two apparent dissociation constants produced the best fit of the sensorgram data. In contrast, two apparent association and two apparent dissociation constants were necessary for modeling bIGFBP-2 interactions on the IGF-II biosensor surface. The absolute values of the apparent kinetic constants for the IGFBP/IGF interactions (kon,koff, and KD, Table II) varied by up to 25% of the mean value between the two biosensor chips used in this study. However, the ranking of the bIGFBP-2 mutants relative to bIGFBP-2 (i.e. the fold differences inkon, koff, andKD, Table II) were the same on both biosensor chips used in this study.Table IISummary of kinetic parameters derived from the interaction of bIGFBP-2 peptides on IGF biosensor surfacesIGF-I (60 RU)kon × 105 (1/Ms)Relativekonkoff1 × 10−3(1/s)koff2 × 10−5 (1/s)Relativekoff2KDaIGF-I biosensor data: KD =koff2/kon.

https://openalex.org/W2067561398,"To investigate the biochemical properties of individual domains of eukaryotic topoisomerase (topo) II, two truncation mutants of Drosophila topo II were generated, ND406 and core domain. Both mutants lack the ATPase domain, corresponding to the N-terminal 406 amino acid residues inDrosophila protein. The core domain also lacks 240 amino acid residues of the hydrophilic C-terminal region. The mutant proteins have lost DNA strand passage activity while retaining the ability to cleave the DNA and the sequence preference in protein/DNA interaction. The cleavage experiments carried out in the presence of several topo II poisons suggest that the core domain is the key target for these drugs. We have used glass-fiber filter binding assay and CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation to monitor the formation of a salt-stable, protein-clamp complex. Both truncation mutant proteins can form a clamp complex in the presence of an antitumor agent, ICRF-159, suggesting that the drug targets the core domain of the enzyme and promotes the intradimeric closure at the N-terminal interface of the core domain. Furthermore, the salt stability of the closed protein clamp induced by ICRF-159 depends on the presence and closure of the N-terminal ATPase domain.

DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that catalyze changes in the topology of DNA via a mechanism involving the transient breakage and rejoining of phosphodiester bonds in the DNA backbone (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cozzarelli N.R.

Their biological functions include the removal of DNA supercoils generated during various cellular processes, such as DNA replication and transcription, decatenation of the intertwined DNA duplexes for the segregation of chromosomes, and regulating the cellular level of DNA supercoiling. DNA topoisomerases can be divided into three subfamilies, types IA, IB, and II, on the basis of sequence homology and mechanism of action. Type II enzymes (topo II) 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; gyrB, DNA gyrase B protein; gyrA, DNA gyrase A protein; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; gyrB, DNA gyrase B protein; gyrA, DNA gyrase A protein; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate.catalyze the ATP-dependent passage of a DNA segment through a transient double-strand break in another segment. In such a reaction, the enzyme-mediated reversible cleavage is generated by the transesterification reactions between a pair of active site tyrosines and two DNA phosphodiester bonds staggered 4 base pairs apart. Eukaryotic topo II has a dimer structure, whereas bacterial topo IIs, including gyrase and topo IV, are A2B2heterotetramers. However, the N-terminal and the central part of eukaryotic topo II are homologous to the bacterial gyrB and gyrA subunits, respectively. Recent biochemical and structural studies have provided further understandings on the mechanism of topo II-catalyzed reaction (Refs.8Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Berger J.M.

The reaction starts with the enzyme binding to a segment (G-segment) of DNA and generating a double strand break to serve as a protein-mediated DNA gate. The ATPase domain of the enzyme, which is located at the N-terminal part of each subunit, can dimerize and close the N-terminal protein clamp (N-gate) upon the binding of ATP. This closure can capture another DNA segment (T-segment) and trigger a cascade of conformational changes in the enzyme-DNA complex, which results in the passage of T-segment through the double-strand DNA break in the G-segment, the resealing of the DNA gate, and the exit of transported T-segment through the C-terminal protein clamp (C-gate). Results from the mapping of proteolytic cleavage sites revealed at least three domains within each subunit of eukaryotic topo II (Refs.13Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6093-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; outlined in Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain is homologous to the N-terminal half of gyrB subunit, which possesses the ATPase activity (16Gellert M. Fisher L.M. O′Dea M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 83: 7152-7156Google Scholar, 17Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6110-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The core domain includes the regions homologous to the C-terminal one-third of the gyrB subunit (B′) and N-terminal two-thirds of the gyrA subunit (A′). This part of the gyrA subunit contains the active site tyrosine and is involved in breaking and rejoining the DNA backbone (reviewed in Ref. 5Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the core domain of yeast topo II has been solved, showing a heart-shaped profile and two dimer contacts at the B′-B′ and A′-A′ interfaces (10Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic C-terminal domain of eukaryotic topo II is less conserved between different species and has been shown to be dispensable for the biochemical activities of topo II (18Adachi N. Miyaike M. Kato S. Kanamaru R. Koyama H. Kikuchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Caron P.R. Watt P. Wang J.C. Mol. Cell.

Some of the antibiotics and antitumor drugs target the different conformations of the topo II-DNA complex during the catalytic cycle. Topo II poisons, such as amsacrine, etoposide, and quinolones, can stimulate the topo II-mediated DNA cleavage by either inhibiting the rate of DNA religation or enhancing the forward rate of cleavage (Ref.22Corbett A.H.

Other drugs such as bisdioxopiperazine derivatives (including ICRF-159 and ICRF-193), aclarubicin, fostriecin, and merbarone, belong to topo II inhibitors that do not stabilize topo II/DNA cleavable complex but instead inhibit the overall catalytic activities (25Drake F.H.

Although the mechanisms of these structurally disparate drugs are unclear, recent studies on ICRF-193 have indicated that it targets topo II in yeast cells (29Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar) and traps the enzyme in a closed clamp conformation (30Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To further investigate the biochemical properties of individual domains of eukaryotic topo II, two truncation mutants of Drosophilatopo II were generated, ND406 and core domain (Fig. 1). Both mutants lack the ATPase domain, corresponding to the N-terminal 406-amino acid residues in Drosophila protein. The core domain also lacks 240 amino acid residues of the hydrophilic C-terminal region. Our studies have shown that in the presence of ICRF-159, both mutants could trap circular DNA in a topological link, suggesting that the drug targets the core domain of the enzyme and promotes the intradimeric closure at the N-terminal interface in this protein. Both ND406 and core constructs share the same 5′-end deletion point. We used polymerase chain reaction to remove the first 1477 base pairs from thetop2 cDNA. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: 1) 5′ GCA GGA TCC ATG TCA ACT AAG ACG GGC GGT CGC AAG 3′, 2) 5′ TGT AAT GAA CTC CTC GAG 3′. Primer 1 contains a BamHI site (underlined) and the first three codons of yeast topo II (italicized), followed by nucleotides 1478–1495 of Drosophila top2 cDNA. Primer 2 contains nucleotides 1910–1927 of the Drosophila top2 cDNA with an XhoI site (underlined) at its 3′-end. The PCR fragment, after cleavage with BamHI and XhoI, was cloned into yeast expression vector YEp24-PGAL1 containing either a full-length top2 cDNA (31Wyckoff E. Hsieh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or Δ240t, a construct previously generated to encode a truncated topo II mutant lacking C-terminal 240 amino acids (20Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21328-21334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two constructs were used for the expression of ND406 and core domain protein. Drosophila topo II was overexpressed in yeast BCY123 (pep4 −, prb1 −,bar1 −, lys2::GAL1-GAL4, ura3 −; a generous gift from Dr. Janet Lindsley, University of Utah). The expression of Drosophila top2 constructs were induced in YEP medium containing 2% galactose. An 8-liter culture of yeast cells overproducing Drosophila topo II was harvested and lysed as described in Ref. 20Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21328-21334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The cleared lysate was sequentially purified by chromatography on Bio-Rex70 (Bio-Rad), Poros HQ, and HE column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) as described previously for the full-length protein (32Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The chromatography profile of ND406 protein was same as the wild-type protein. The peak fractions were eluted at 1.0 m NaCl from HQ column and 0.4 m NaCl from HE column. The core mutant did not bind to the HQ column. Thus, the flow-through of the HQ column was directly loaded onto the HE column, and the peak fractions were eluted at 0.4 m NaCl. The purified proteins were dialyzed against the storage buffer containing 15 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 50% glycerol for 16 h. A mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) was included throughout the purification process. DNA cleavage was performed as described by Lee and Hsieh (33Lee M.P. Hsieh T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5027-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A 20-μl reaction mixture contains 0.3 μg (0.05 pmol) of pCaSpeRhs83 supercoiled DNA, 1.5 pmol of topo II protein, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. 1 mm ATP and 5 μm of VM26 or amonafide were included in some of the reactions. Reactions were started by incubating at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of SDS to 0.5% followed by the addition of EDTA to 10 mm and proteinase K to 100 μg/ml. This mixture was further incubated at 45 °C for 15 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.9% agarose gel. The uniquely end-labeled DNA containing the intergenic region of heat shock gene HSP70 was used to map the topo II cleavage sites as described earlier (34Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA 6/122, a derivative of pBR322 with an insertion of 1.7 kb SalI fragment from the intergenic region of Drosophila heat shock gene HSP70, was used to prepare the uniquely end-labeled linear DNA. 6/122 was linearized by HindIII, radiolabeled at its 5′-ends, and treated with EcoRI to remove one of the end labels. 0.5 nm of labeled DNA substrate and 75 nm topo II proteins were included in this cleavage assay and carried out in a condition identical to that of the plasmid cleavage. Topo II-mediated binding of DNA to GF/C glass-fiber filters (35Thomas Jr., C.A. Saigo K. McLeod E. Ito J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was done as described by Roca and Wang (8Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled DNA substrate used in the filter binding assays was generated by nick translation of nicked pHC 624 (36Boros I. Posfai G. Venetianer P. Gene. 1984; 30: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) carried out in the presence of either [α-32P]TTP (0.5 Ci/mmol) or [8-3H]dCTP (2.5 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 14 °C, followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 3 h at 25 °C. The mixture was then phenol extracted and run through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove the unincorporated nucleotides. The tritium-labeled DNA sample was linearized by the restriction enzymeEcoRI. 25 μl of reaction mixture contained an equal molar mixture of linear and circular form of labeled DNA (0.05 pmol), 3 pmol of topo II protein in a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml BSA. ICRF-159 and ATP were included in some of the reaction mixtures. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of a chilled solution of 5 m NaCl to give a final concentration of 1 m or 4 m. 50 μl of the mixture was then filtered through a GF/C glass fiber filter and washed four times with 40 μl of a solution containing the reaction buffer plus either 1 m or 4 m NaCl. To quantify the filter-retained DNA by scintillation counting, the filter was dried at room temperature and then put in 10 ml of Safety-Solve counting mixture (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) and counted by an LS 6500 multipurpose liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments Inc., CA). For the analysis by gel electrophoresis, the filter was eluted three times with 50 μl of a solution containing 10 mm Tris, 1% SDS and 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.). The samples from high salt wash and SDS elution were then analyzed by 1.6% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Topo II strand passage activities were tested by the unknotting of P4 knotted DNA, supercoiled relaxation, and catenation and decatenation assays as described in Ref. 37Hsieh T.-s. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation was done as described in Ref.32Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol.

In order to study the functions of the core domain of eukaryotic topoisomerase II, we constructed two truncation mutants of Drosophila topoisomerase II (Fig.1). The truncation end points were determined on the basis of our previous analysis of the domain structure using protease cleavage and linker insertion mutagenesis. Two major trypsin cleavage sites were determined to be located at residues 406 and 1200 (Fig. 1 A) (14Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mutant lacking the N-terminal 406 amino acids of the full-length topo II is termed ND406 (Fig. 1 B). The fragment containing amino acid 407–1207 is termed the core domain (Fig. 1 C). In addition to the same N-terminal deletion as ND406, the core fragment lacks 240 amino acids at the C terminus, which has previously been determined to be not essential for the in vitro topo II activities (20Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21328-21334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ND406, core domain, and wild-type topo II were overexpressed in yeast cells and purified to over 90% in homogeneity based on the analysis of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel stained with Coomassie Blue dye (Fig. 2). An immunoblot of a similar gel using antibody against Drosophila topo II shows a single band at 170, 120, and 92 kDa, consistent with the sizes of full-length, ND406, and core topo II, respectively (data not shown). Additionally, a Western blot using antibody against yeast topo II was quantified to show that the endogenous yeast topo II was present in an amount less than 0.5% of the purified full-length and core protein and less than 2% of the protein in the purified ND406 samples (data not shown). Consistent with the fact that the strand passage activity of eukaryotic is ATP-dependent, both of our truncation mutants that lack the ATPase domain show no activity in the supercoil relaxation, unknotting, and decatenation assay (data not shown). In contrast, deletion of the ATPase domain and the C-terminal tail of topo II does not affect its DNA breakage and rejoining activity. Fig.3 illustrates the cleavage of pCaSpeRhs 83 plasmid DNA by wild-type and mutant topo II in the presence of two topo II targeting antitumor drugs, amonafide and teniposide VM26. These topo II poisons, though with distinct structures and abilities to intercalate DNA, have been shown to inhibit topo II activities by promoting the double-strand DNA cleavage (38Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hsiang Y.H. Jiang J.B. Liu L.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 371-376PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of drugs, ND406 and core fragment at the same protein/DNA ratio generate comparable double strand DNA cleavage as wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3,lanes 1–3). The DNA cleavage activity is assayed by the amount of linear DNA generated in the reaction. The presence of 5 μm VM26 or 5 μm amonafide significantly stimulates the DNA cleavage by both wild-type and mutant topo II (Fig.3, lanes 4–9). In addition, we have tested the effect of two other topo II poisons, amsacrine and menadione, in DNA cleavage reactions and obtained similar results (data not shown). These data suggest that the key target for the above drugs resides in the core domain of topo II. For the wild-type enzyme, the cleavage of double strand DNA is also stimulated by the presence of ATP either in the absence of drugs or in their presence (compare Fig. 3, lanes 1, 4, and 7 with lanes 10, 13, and16, respectively). In contrast with the wild-type enzyme, neither of the truncation mutants shows any ATP stimulation. This is as expected because the mutant proteins lack the ATP binding and hydrolysis domain. The DNA cleavage by topo II exhibits a moderate sequence specificity and provides a convenient assay to determine the sequence preference in the topo II/DNA interactions (40Riou J.F. Multon E. Vilarem M.J. Larsen C.J. Riou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Udvardy A. Schedl P. Sander M. Hsieh T.-s. Cell. 1985; 40: 933-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42Yang L. Rowe T.C. Nelson E.M. Liu L.F. Cell. 1985; 41: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have used a unique end-labeled, linear DNA substrate to map the DNA cleavage sites for wild-type and mutant proteins (Fig.4). The DNA substrate used here contains several clusters of strong topo II cleavage sites (marked as T1–T6, in the order of increasing cleavage) in the intergenic region of a heat shock gene HSP70. Tight topo II binding sites are located in these strong cleavage sites based on nuclease footprinting data (34Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of any cofactors, nearly identical DNA cleavage patterns were observed for all three proteins except for the presence of a minor cleavage band by core protein between T5 and T6 (Fig. 4, lane 3, asterisk). The presence of VM26 and amonafide greatly stimulates the cleavage by wild-type and mutant proteins to a similar extent (Fig.4, lanes 4–6). Interestingly, the addition of an intercalative topo II poison, amonafide, generate a different cleavage pattern, as evidenced by the appearance of two additional strong cleavage bands (Fig. 4, a and b). Similar to the data obtained from plasmid DNA cleavage, only the cleavage by the wild-type protein is stimulated by the presence of ATP (Fig. 4, comparelanes 10–18 to lanes 1–9). This is especially evident when we compare the amount of uncleaved DNA substrate left in each reaction. The above experiment therefore demonstrates that not only is the core domain of topo II the main target for topo II drugs but it also contains the essential element for the sequence preference in protein/DNA interaction. Neither the N-terminal ATPase domain nor the hydrophilic C terminus plays an important role in protein/drug or protein/DNA interaction for the in vitro topo II cleavage reaction. Besides the topo II poisons, which function by promoting the cleavable complex between the double strand DNA and topo II, there are a number of topo II-targeting drugs that do not promote the topo II-mediated DNA cleavage. An antitumor agent, bisdioxopiperazine, has been shown to inhibit the topo II activities while compromising the effect of VM26 on DNA cleavage (27Tanabe K. Ikegami Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4903-4908PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ishida R. Iwai M. Hara A. Andoh T. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 2735-2740PubMed Google Scholar). A member of this drug family, ICRF-193, can inhibit yeast topo II activities by trapping the enzyme in the form of a closed clamp (30Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To further investigate the interaction between eukaryotic topo II and this family of drugs, we have used the glass-fiber filter binding assay to test the trapping of circular versus linear DNA by the topo II proteins in the presence of ICRF-159 (Fig.5). A mixture of radiolabeled negatively supercoiled DNA and its linear form was used in these assays (Fig. 5,lane 19). In the absence of ICRF-159, there is a trace amount of both circular and linear form of DNA being trapped (Fig. 5,lanes 2, 4, and 6). For all three proteins, the addition of ICRF-159 greatly stimulates the retention of the circular but not the linear DNA on the glass-fiber filter either in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5, lanes 14, 16, and 18) or in its absence (lanes 8, 10, and 12). Although ATP is not required for the retention of circular DNA on the glass-fiber filter, its presence allows the full-length topo II to relax the supercoiled circular DNA. Both the monomeric and dimeric form of supercoiled circles are relaxed under such conditions (Fig. 5,lanes 13 and 14). The relaxed dimeric circle runs faster than its supercoiled form and apparently comigrates with the linear DNA under such electrophoresis conditions. Therefore, we have used two-dimensional agarose electrophoresis to further analyze the filter-retained DNA sample identical to that run in Fig. 5, lane 14, and confirmed that the major DNA content in this sample was relaxed monomeric and dimeric circle (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the full-length topo II can form an ICRF-159 induced clamp complex regardless of the presence of ATP. The closure of this protein clamp results in a salt-resistant capture of the DNA that is specific to the circular form. The surprising result in this experiment is the formation of a clamp complex with the truncated proteins. The presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP, can promote the closure of the N-gate in gyrB domain, resulting in the formation of a salt-resistant clamp complex (8Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 32Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the truncated proteins have their N-gate domain deleted, the clamp has to come from other protein/protein interface in the topo II molecule. The formation of a different protein clamp is also supported by the result that in the presence of ICRF-159, the full-length topo II can trap a circular DNA even without ATP. In this case, N-gate closure can not be responsible for the formation of clamp complex because its closure requires the binding of a nucleotide cofactor. Because the clamp complex formed by the truncated protein might be distinct from that formed by the wild-type topo II in the presence of AMPPNP, we have extended this observation and tested the retention of circular and linear DNA on the glass-fiber filter at different drug concentrations. A filter binding assay with differentially labeled DNA substrate was developed to facilitate the quantification of the DNA retained on the filter. A mixture of 32P-labeled circular DNA and3H-labeled linear DNA was used in these experiments. After being washed with 1 m NaCl solution, the filters were processed for liquid scintillation counting. Fig.6 shows the results of such experiments. In the absence of ICRF-159, the trapping of circular DNA is about 5%, as indicated by the fraction of filter-retainable 32P counts (Fig. 6, solid columns). At ICRF-159 concentrations as low as 40 μm, significant trapping of circular DNA was observed for both wild-type and core fragment (Fig. 6,hatched columns). The presence of 1 mm ATP at this drug concentration further increases the trapping of circular DNA by wild-type protein to nearly 40% (Fig. 6,dotted column, set 2). When ICRF-159 was added to a concentration of 1 mm, a similar degree of trapping was achieved for both proteins, regardless of the presence of ATP (Fig. 6,dotted columns). Under all conditions tested, the retention of linear DNA on the glass-fiber filter was comparable, if not less, to the control without drug (Fig. 6, open columns). These results further demonstrate that bisdioxopiperazine is capable of trapping circular DNA by interacting with the core domain of topo II. In addition, when the drug concentration is below saturation, ATP can promote the clamp complex formation between circular DNA and full-length topo II, whereas it has no significant effect on the core domain. The result of clamp complex formation by truncated proteins suggests the involvement of different intradimeric protein-protein interfaces other than that at the N-terminal ATPase domain. To examine the possible difference in biochemical properties between these two types of clamp complex, we have set out to test the salt stability of the ICRF-dependent complex between topo II and circular DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2069413283,"Abstract The binding isotherms of the divalent metal cations, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+, to the synthetic γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing neuroactive peptides, conantokin-G (con-G) and conantokin-T (con-T), have been determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) at 25 °C and pH 6.5. We have previously shown by potentiometric measurements that con-G contains 2–3 equivalent Ca2+ sites with an average K d value of 2800 μm. With Mg2+ as the ligand, two separate exothermic sites are obtained by ITC, one of K d = 46 μmand another of K d = 311 μm. Much tighter binding of Zn2+ is observed for these latter two sites (K d values = 0.2 μm and 1.1 μm), and a third considerably weaker binding site is observed, characterized by a K d value of 286 μm and an endothermic enthalpy of binding. con-T possesses a single exothermic tight binding site for Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+, with K dvalues of 428 μm, 10.2 μm, and 0.5 μm, respectively. Again, in the case of con-T, a weak (K d = 410 μm) endothermic binding site is observed for Zn2+. The binding of these cations to con-G and con-T result in an increase in the α-helical content of the peptides. However, this helix is somewhat destabilized in both cases by binding of Zn2+ to its weakest site. Since the differences observed in binding affinities of these three cations to the peptides are substantially greater than their comparative K d values to malonate, we conclude that the structure of the peptide and, most likely, the steric and geometric properties imposed on the cation site as a result of peptide folding greatly influence the strength of the interaction of cations with con-G and con-T. Further, since the Zn2+ concentrations released in the synaptic cleft during excitatory synaptic activity are sufficiently high relative to the K d of Zn2+ for con-G and con-T, this cation along with Mg2+, are most likely the most significant metal ion ligands of these peptides in neuronal cells."

Brain hexokinase (hereafter hexokinase I) is one of four isoforms found in mammalian tissue. In brain tissue and red blood cells hexokinase I participates in the regulation of glycolysis (1Katzen H.M. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In one, Glu-6-P binds to the N-terminal half as an allosteric inhibitor and Pi competes directly with Glu-6-P. In the other, Pi binds to the N-terminal half and displaces Glu-6-P from the active site (C-terminal half) by way of an indirect mechanism. In both models the binding of phosphate to the N-terminal domain regulates catalysis at the C-terminal half by way of an allosteric mechanism. Hexokinase I is a dimer in its crystalline complex with glucose and Glu-6-P (20Aleshin A.E. Zeng C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Structure. 1998; 6: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Glu-6-P and glucose bind at both the C- and N-terminal halves, and both halves adopt closed conformational states. The structure of a glucose-Pi complex of hexokinase I is also a dimer (19Aleshin A.E. Zeng C. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Gluose and Pi bind at the N-terminal half only, and the C- and N-terminal halves are in opened and closed conformational states, respectively. Pi and the 6-phosphoryl group of Glu-6-P bind to the same residues at the N-terminal half, whereas the pyranose moiety of Glu-6-P binds at a separate locus. Gly87, Ser88, Thr232, and Ser415 are at the phosphate/6-phosphoryl binding site. Asp84, Asp413, and Ser449 interact with the pyranose moiety of Glu-6-P. Contact between the N- and C-terminal halves of hexokinase I occurs only by way of a transition helix and a salt link involving Arg801 (19Aleshin A.E. Zeng C. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 20Aleshin A.E. Zeng C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Structure. 1998; 6: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Presented here are the functional properties of wild-type and mutant hexokinases (Asp84 → Ala, Gly87 → Tyr, Ser88 → Ala, Thr232 → Ala, Asp413 → Ala, Ser415 → Ala, Ser449 → Ala and Arg801 → Ala). Gly87 → Tyr and Thr232 → Ala separately abolish Pi relief of inhibition caused by the product analog 1,5-anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate (1,5-AnG-6-P). Hence the site for Pi binding identified by crystallographic investigations is most likely the Pi regulatory site of hexokinase I. Kinetic data from the wild-type enzyme infer the presence of high and low affinity inhibitory sites for 1,5-AnG-6-P. Asp84 → Ala, Gly87 → Tyr, and Thr232 → Ala eliminate inhibition due to the low affinity site with no effect on the high affinity site. Glu-6-P interactions at the N-terminal half then are correlated with the low affinity binding site observed in kinetics. Finally, mutation of Arg801reduces Pi relief of product inhibition and inhibition associated with the low affinity site. Arg801 evidently plays a role in the transmission of the allosteric signal from the N-terminal half to the active site of hexokinase I. A full-length cDNA of human brain hexokinase, cloned into an expression vector pET-11a (from Novagen) to produce pET-11a-HKI, was available from a previous study (21Liu F. Dong Q. Myers A.M. Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, plasmid pGEM-7Z(+), and restriction enzymes were from Promega. Bio-Gel hydroxyapatite came from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were done at the Iowa State University Nucleic Acid Facility. Escherichia coli strain ZSC13, which does not contain endogenous hexokinase, was a gift from the Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. ATP, NADP, streptomycin sulfate, glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glu-1,6-P2), 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and ampicillin were from Sigma. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase came from Boehringer Mannheim. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was from BioWorld. The hexokinase gene was mutated according to the protocols of the Promega Altered Sites IIin vitro Mutagenesis System with only slight modification. The pALTER-Ex1 vector from the mutagenesis system was modified first by inserting a small XbaI-BamHI fragment from the plasmid pGEM-7Z(+) to introduce a ClaI site. An XbaI-ClaI fragment, containing the hexokinase cDNA of pET-11a-HKI, was inserted then into the modified pALTER-Ex1 vector. The resulting construct served as the DNA template in mutagenesis work. The oligonucleotide primers used in site-directed mutations were 5′-TTC ATT GCC CTG GCT CTT GGT GG-3′ (Asp84 → Ala), 5′-C CTG GAT CTT GGT TACTCT TCC TTT CGA-3′ (Gly87 → Tyr), 5′-GAT CTT GGT GGGGCT TCC TTT CGA-3′ (Ser88 → Ala), 5′-CTG ATC ATC GGC GCT GGC ACC AAT-3′ (Thr232 → Ala), 5′-CG GTT GGT GTC GCA GGA TCT CTT TAC AA-3′ (Asp413 → Ala), 5′-GGT GTC GAC GGA GCA CTT TAC AAG ACG-3′ (Ser415 → Ala), 5′-GAG AGT GGC GCAGGC AAG GGG GCT-3′ (Ser449 → Ala), and 5′-CTG CTC CAG GTCGCT GCT ATC CTC CAG-3′ (Arg801 → Ala), where the altered codons are in bold type. For mutations, Asp84→ Ala, Gly87 → Tyr, Ser88 → Ala, Thr232 → Ala, Asp413 → Ala, Ser415 → Ala, and Ser449 → Ala, theXbaI-NcoI fragment carrying the gene for the mutated N-terminal half of hexokinase was ligated to the 7-kbXbaI-NcoI fragment of pET-11a-HKI to reconstruct the expression vector pET-11a-HKI. For the mutation Arg801→ Ala, the XbaI-ClaI fragment carrying the whole gene of mutated hexokinase was ligated to the 5.5-kbXbaI-ClaI fragment of pET-11a-HKI to reconstruct the expression vector pET-11a-HKI. The wholeXbaI-NcoI fragment carrying the mutated gene for the N-terminal domain or the XbaI-ClaI fragment carrying the mutated whole gene of hexokinase was sequenced to confirm the presence of only the desired mutation. Wild-type and mutant forms of hexokinase I were produced by growing pET-11a-HKI-transformed E. coli strain ZSC13. The pET-11a-HKI-transformed E. coli was grown overnight in LB medium plus 40 μg/ml ampicillin and then added to a 100-fold volume of M9 medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown in a fermentor (with stirring of 200 rpm and a filtered air flow of 5 p.s.i.) or in flasks (with shaking at 220 rpm) at 37 °C to early log phase (A600 = 0.4), after which IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to induce the T7 RNA polymerase gene. The culture was grown for an additional 20–24 h at 22 °C. The wild-type and mutant forms of hexokinase were purified by using streptomycin sulfate precipitation, DEAE-anion exchange column chromatography, hydroxyapatite column chromatography, and DEAE-5PW Spherogel TSK-G HPLC chromatography as described elsewhere (17Zeng C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentrations of wild-type and mutant hexokinases were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The barium salt of 1,5-AnG-6-P was prepared as described elsewhere (24Ferrari R.A. Mandelstam P. Crane R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 80: 372-377Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A precisely weighed amount of the barium salt of 1,5-AnG-6-P was dissolved in distilled water by adding HCl. Barium ion was removed by precipitation with excess 1 mNa2SO4 followed by centrifugation. Hexokinase activity was determined by the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrometric assay as described elsewhere (21Liu F. Dong Q. Myers A.M. Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Initial rate data were analyzed by using a computer program written in MINITAB language with an α value of 2.0 (22Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentration of hexokinase used for activity assays was 1.2 ∼ 2.0 μg/ml. CD spectra were measured from 200 to 260 nm at room temperature by using a J710 CD spectrometer. The concentration of hexokinase used was 120 ∼ 200 μg/ml in 12.5 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.125 mm glucose and 0.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The purity of wild-type and mutant hexokinases is greater than 95% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). CD spectra of wild-type and mutant hexokinases were essentially identical (data not shown), indicating the absence of long range conformational changes as a consequence of mutation. Relative to the wild-type enzyme, all eight mutant hexokinases exhibited similar kcat andKm values (Table I). As hexokinase activity is determined by the oxidation of Glu-6-P, inhibition studies must employ closely related analogs (1,5-AnG-6-P and Glu-1,6-P2), which are chemically inert under the conditions of assay. The analogs putatively bind to the same inhibitory site as does Glu-6-P, albeit with slightly altered affinities. 1,5-AnG-6-P and Glu-1,6-P2 (up to concentrations of 100 and 334 μm, respectively) are linear competitive inhibitors (with respect to ATP) of the wild-type enzyme and the mutant hexokinases (data not shown). Mutations have no major effect onKi values for 1,5-AnG-6-P and Glu-1,6-P2(Table I).Table IKinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant hexokinasesHexokinase IkcatKm(Glucose)Km (ATP)Ki(1,5-AnG-6-P)Ki (G-1,6-P2)s−1μmmmμmμmWild-type63.6 ± 3.052.8 ± 1.30.68 ± 0.0437.4 ± 1.7155 ± 6Asp84 → Ala62.2 ± 1.249.6 ± 1.30.79 ± 0.0761.3 ± 1.9147 ± 5Gly87 → Tyr57.2 ± 5.538.2 ± 1.61.42 ± 0.0130.7 ± 0.996 ± 5Ser88 → Ala72.3 ± 4.348.6 ± 2.10.59 ± 0.0246.2 ± 2.9166 ± 6Thr232 → Ala70.1 ± 1.841.7 ± 1.90.81 ± 0.0683.9 ± 4.9227 ± 14Asp413 → Ala63.3 ± 1.649.1 ± 1.50.97 ± 0.0139.9 ± 1.694 ± 6Ser415 → Ala70.1 ± 3.253.4 ± 2.00.66 ± 0.1042.9 ± 1.5170 ± 11Ser449 → Ala70.3 ± 3.442.3 ± 2.00.59 ± 0.0357.1 ± 2.3208 ± 8Arg801 → Ala79.2 ± 1.547.1 ± 1.30.61 ± 0.0559.7 ± 1.5215 ± 10Reported values are the mean ± S.D. 1,5-AnG-6-P and Gluc-1,6-P2 are the competitive inhibitors of hexokinase I (versus ATP).

Crystallographic investigations employed millimolar concentrations of Glu-6-P, and under such conditions the N- and C-terminal halves of hexokinase I each bind one molecule of Glu-6-P. At concentrations of 1,5-AnG-6-P up to 100 μm, kinetic data support only one functional binding site for the product analog (Table I). At concentrations significantly above 100 μm, however, inhibition of the wild-type enzyme by 1,5-AnG-6-P is nonlinear (Fig.2). A model for linear competitive inhibition (single high affinity site) accounts poorly for the data of Fig. 2 (goodness-of-fit, 10.9%). A modified rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism (7Ellison W.R. Lueck J.D. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1864-1871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which incorporates two inhibitory sites for Glu-6-P (Scheme I), is the simplest model that can account for the data of Fig. 2. In Scheme I, A, B, Q, and P are ATP, glucose, Glu-6-P, and ADP, respectively, bound productively to the C-terminal domain, Iis 1,5-AnG-6-P bound to inhibitory sites, E is hexokinase I, and Kia, Kib,Ka, Kb, Ki, and Kii are dissociation constants. Scheme I presents equilibria between complexes which are pertinent to the conditions of kinetic investigations presented here. 1,5-AnG-6-P can interact with the free enzyme and with enzyme-ATP and enzyme-product complexes, but under conditions of saturating glucose and initial velocity protocols, these more complex schemes yield the same velocity relationship as does Scheme I. Equation 1, developed from Scheme I under conditions of saturating glucose and initial velocity protocols, is below: 1/v=(1/Vm)[1+(Ka/A)(1+I/Ki+I2/KiKii)]Equation 1 In Equation 1, v represents the velocity,Vm the maximum velocity, A the concentration of ATP, I the concentration of 1,5-AnG-6-P,Ka the dissociation constant for A from the EAB complex, Kb the dissociation constant for B from the EAB complex,Kia the dissociation constant for the EAcomplex, Ki the dissociation constant forI from the EBI complex, andKii the dissociation constant for I from the EBII complex.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Equation 1 accounts for the wild-type data with a goodness-of-fit 2.2% and was used to fit inhibition data for all mutants (TableII). However, Kiiadopted negative values for Asp84 → Ala, Gly87 → Tyr, and Thr232 → Ala, and the reduction in the goodness-of-fit value for a two-site, relative to a single-site model did not validate the determination ofKii. Hence for Asp84 → Ala, Gly87 → Tyr, and Thr232 → Ala we report the complete loss of inhibitory function associated with the low affinity site. Indeed, the relevant plots for the Asp84 → Ala mutant, for instance, are consistent with a model of linear competitive inhibition up to a concentration of 1 mm 1,5-AnG-6-P (Fig.2).Table II1,5-AnG-6-P inhibition constants for wild-type and mutant hexokinase IHexokinase IKiaKi was obtained by fitting data (plots of 1/velocity versus 1/[ATP] at 2 mmglucose with inhibitor ranging from 0 to 100 μm) to a model for linear competitive inhibition.KibKi and Kii were obtained by fitting data (plots of 1/velocity versus1/[ATP] at 2 mm glucose with inhibitor ranging from 0 to 1000 μm) to a model for nonlinear (Equation 1) or linear competitive inhibition.KiibKi and Kii were obtained by fitting data (plots of 1/velocity versus1/[ATP] at 2 mm glucose with inhibitor ranging from 0 to 1000 μm) to a model for nonlinear (Equation 1) or linear competitive inhibition.μmμmμmWild-type37.4 ± 1.754.0 ± 3.4710 ± 40Asp84 → Ala61.3 ± 1.974.6 ± 8.3—cNot supported by the data.Gly87 → Tyr30.7 ± 0.951.0 ± 5.2—cNot supported by the data.Ser88 → Ala46.2 ± 2.946.3 ± 5.91400 ± 190Thr232 → Ala83.9 ± 4.981.1 ± 5.9—cNot supported by the data.Asp413 → Ala39.9 ± 1.629.4 ± 2.53400 ± 500Ser415 → Ala42.9 ± 1.542.7 ± 5.01000 ± 90Ser449 → Ala57.1 ± 2.354.4 ± 7.51100 ± 120Arg801 → Ala59.7 ± 1.560.2 ± 5.44700 ± 1300The values shown are the mean ± S.D. 1,5-AnG-6-P is the competitive inhibitor of hexokinase I (versus ATP).a Ki was obtained by fitting data (plots of 1/velocity versus 1/[ATP] at 2 mmglucose with inhibitor ranging from 0 to 100 μm) to a model for linear competitive inhibition.b Ki and Kii were obtained by fitting data (plots of 1/velocity versus1/[ATP] at 2 mm glucose with inhibitor ranging from 0 to 1000 μm) to a model for nonlinear (Equation 1) or linear competitive inhibition.c Not supported by the data.

The Pi-induced relief of Glu-6-P inhibition was studied at two different concentrations of ATP and at several concentrations of 1,5-AnG-6-P and Pi. Mutations, Gly87 → Tyr and Thr232 → Ala, abolish the relief of Glu-6-P inhibition by Pi (Figs. 3 and4). Mutations, Asp84 → Ala, Ser88 → Ala, Ser415 → Ala, and Arg801 → Ala, reduce the effect of Pi on Glu-6-P inhibition by approximately one-half relative to the wild-type enzyme (Fig.4).Figure 4Relief of 1,5-AnG-6-P inhibition induced by Pi in wild-type and mutant hexokinases.

The concentrations of 1,5-AnG-6-P are those given in Fig. 3. Relief of 1,5-AnG-6-P inhibition (%) induced by Pi is defined as 100 × (A− B)/A where A is the slope from plot of (relative velocity of hexokinase I)−1 versus1,5-AnG-6-P concentration (as in Fig. 3) in the absence of Pi and B is the slope from plot of (relative velocity of hexokinase I)−1 versus 1,5-AnG-6-P concentration in the presence of Pi.

The hydroxyl groups of Ser88, Thr232, and Ser415hydrogen-bond to phosphate in the glucose-Pi crystalline complex and to the 6-phosphoryl group of Glu-6-P in the glucose-Glu-6-P complex (Fig. 5). In addition, a bulky side chain at Gly87 should block the binding of Pi or the phosphoryl group of Glu-6-P. Residue 87 can accommodate bulky side chains without a significant perturbation to its backbone conformation. The mutations Gly87 → Tyr, Ser88 → Ala, Thr232 → Ala and Ser415 → Ala then should either weaken or completely block the interaction between the N-terminal half and phosphoryl groups. On the other hand, mutations of Asp84, Asp413, and Ser449 to alanine should disrupt interactions between the pyranose moiety of product analogs and the N-terminal half of hexokinase I. The findings here can be reconciled easily with one of two models for regulation of hexokinase I. The models differ primarily in the location of the functional site for Glu-6-P inhibition. Either Glu-6-P binds to the active site of the C-terminal half of the enzyme and competes directly with ATP or Glu-6-P binds to the N-terminal half and inhibits catalysis through an allosteric mechanism. Product analogs interact equally well with the high affinity site of mutant hexokinases and the wild-type enzyme (Table II), a result consistent with the direct inhibition of the active site by Glu-6-P and inconsistent with the allosteric model for Glu-6-P inhibition. The presence of bound Glu-6-P at the N-terminal half in the crystal structure of the complex of hexokinase I with glucose and Glu-6-P probably stems from the high concentration of inhibitor employed in the growth of that crystal form and the effects of dimerization at elevated protein concentrations. Indeed, kinetic data here show clearly the presence of a low affinity, inhibitory site which is sensitive to mutations at the Glu-6-P pocket of the N-terminal half of hexokinase I. As Glu-6-P stabilizes dimers of hexokinase I, the additional inhibition associated with the low affinity site may be a consequence of dimerization of the enzyme in the presence of high concentrations of product analog (25Chakrabarti U. Kenkare U.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5984-5988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously reported mutations of the N-terminal half (Asp84→ Asn (26Baijal M. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Ser155 → Ala (15Arora K.K. Filburn C.R. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18259-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) involve residues that bind to the pyranose group of Glu-6-P, as observed in the glucose/Glu-6-P crystal structure. Consistent with the properties of mutants reported here, mutations of the pyranose region of the Glu-6-P binding pocket of the N-terminal half of the enzyme have little effect on catalysis or the inhibition of catalysis. Previous experiments in kinetics, however, did not employ high concentrations of inhibitor so no data are available regarding the effects of these mutations on the low affinity inhibitory site.

The mutations in the C-terminal half of hexokinase I listed above generally cause a significant loss of activity, and to compensate for low activity, enzyme concentrations in assays were increased in some instances to levels at which hexokinase I could dimerize. Hence, reported kinetic parameters (22Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Zeng C. Aleshin A.E.

Further information is necessary regarding the state of aggregation of the C-terminal half mutants of hexokinase I before structure/function correlations can be made with certainty. The results here directly confirm a functional role for the phosphate binding site observed in the glucose/Pi crystalline complex. Seven hydrogen bonds hold Pi in place at the N-terminal half of hexokinase I. The individual mutations of Ser88, Thr232, and Ser415 to alanine remove to a first approximation only one hydrogen bond, leaving the remaining six in place. Depending on the contribution of that hydrogen bond to the stability of the Pi-enzyme complex, one finds significant (up to 100%) but variable reductions in the relief of product inhibition. On the basis of modeling studies, the mutation of Gly87 to tyrosine would place the tyrosyl side chain at the Pi site, potentially disrupting all seven of its hydrogen bonds with phosphate, and indeed, Gly87 → Tyr abolishes relief of product inhibition altogether. The mutation Gly534 → Ala reportedly reduces Pi relief of product inhibition (27Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Chen G. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 700-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Upon resequencing the gene for the Gly534 mutant, however, a second site mutation was detected at position 86. Hence the kinetic parameters reported for the Gly534 → Ala mutant are those of the double mutant Gly86 → Ala/Gly534 → Ala. The observed effect on the Pi relief of product inhibition is probably a consequence of the mutation of Gly86 to alanine. One of the goals of the present study was to ascertain whether the crystalline hexokinase I dimers provide information regarding the structure-function properties of the isolated monomer in solution. Crystal structures indicate a single Pi binding site at the N-terminal domain, and on the basis of studies here, that site is indeed the functional regulatory site for Pi. Crystal structures also indicate the binding of Glu-6-P to the same site, and indeed the results here are consistent with a low affinity site for Glu-6-P at the N-terminal domain, which overlaps the functional regulatory site for Pi. The participation of Arg801 in a salt link with Asp251 and Glu252 stands as the only noncovalent interaction between the N- and C-terminal halves of hexokinase I (Fig.6). Arg801 is the best candidate on the basis of crystal structures for the transmission of conformational changes in the N-terminal half to the active site. As a 50% reduction in the Pi relief of product inhibition attends the mutation of Arg801 to alanine, Arg801 is a likely participant in the allosteric mechanism of hexokinase I regulation. Other residues, however, also must participate in parallel with Arg801 in the allosteric regulatory mechanism of hexokinase I. Otherwise the mutation of Arg801 to alanine should abolish the Pi relief of product inhibition entirely. Interestingly, the residue corresponding to position 801 in hexokinase II is also an arginine, consistent with the appearance of phosphate-linked phenomena in the chimeric enzyme consisting of C-terminal half hexokinase II and N-terminal half hexokinase I (18Tsai H.J. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results presented here regarding Arg801, the regulatory site for Pi, and a low affinity site for Glu-6-P suggest that the crystal structures (19Aleshin A.E. Zeng C. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J.

https://openalex.org/W1980199591,"Bacillus subtilis small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) is a member of the signal recognition particle RNA family. It is transcribed as a 354-nucleotide primary transcript and processed to a 271-nucleotide mature scRNA. In the precursor, the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions form a stable double-stranded structure based on their complementary sequence. This structure is similar to those of substrates for the double-stranded RNA processing enzyme, RNase III. The B. subtilis enzyme that has similar activity toEscherichia coli RNase III has been purified and is designated Bs-RNase III. Recently, B. subtilis rncS has been shown to encode Bs-RNase III (Wang, W., and Bechhofer, D. H. (1997) J. Bacteriol. 179, 7379–7385). We show here that Bs-RNase III and the purified His-tagged product of rncScleave pre-scRNA at both 5′- and 3′-sites to produce an intermediate scRNA (scRNA-275), although processing at the 3′-site is less efficient. The 5′-end of scRNA-275 was identical to that of the mature scRNA, whereas it contains four excess nucleotides at the 3′-end. Bs-RNase III cleavage yields a two-base 3′-overhang, which is consistent with the manner in which E. coli RNase III cleaves. We also show that truncation of the rncS gene affected processing, and significant amounts of an intermediate scRNA (scRNA-275) were found to accumulate in the rncS-truncated mutant. It is concluded that Bs-RNase III is an enzyme that processes pre-scRNA. Bacillus subtilis small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) is a member of the signal recognition particle RNA family.

Eukaryotic SRP RNAs consist of four functional domains (domains I–IV). SRP RNA homologues have been identified in eubacteria, includingEscherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis (4.5S RNA for E. coli and small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) for B. subtilis) (3Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vivo, eubacterial SRP RNA binds to Ffh protein, which is homologous to eukaryotic SRP54 protein, an SRP subunit that binds to signal sequences (3Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D. Strub K. Zopf D.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1394-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like mammalian SRP, theE. coli 4.5S RNA-Ffh complex binds specifically to signal sequences (6Luirink J. High S. Wood H. Giner A. Tollervey D. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1992; 359: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), whereas B. subtilis Ffh can bind signal sequences by itself (7Bunai K. Takamatsu H. Horinaka T. Oguro A. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, proteins homologous to the α-subunit of mammalian SRP receptor (SRα) have been identified inE. coli (FtsY) and B. subtilis (Srb) (8Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S.

On the other hand, E. coli 4.5S RNA and B. subtilis scRNA are involved in mRNA translation on ribosomes. In addition, 4.5S RNA and scRNA also bind to protein synthesis elongation factor G, and they may be involved in elongation factor G recycling (14Shibata T. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura K. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13162-13168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure of B. subtilis scRNA is strikingly similar to that of eukaryotic SRP RNA, although it lacks domain III (3Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D. Strub K. Zopf D. Wilhelm H. Walter P. Science. 1990; 250: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Struck J.C.R. Vogel D.W. Ulbrich N. Erdmann V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is transcribed as a 354-nucleotide (nt) primary transcript and then processed to a 271-nt mature scRNA (15Struck J.C.R. Hartmann R.K. Toschka H.Y. Erdmann V.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This maturation requires processing at both 5′- and 3′-sites. Moreover, 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of scRNA precursor (pre-scRNA) constitute a stable stem structure based on complementary sequences encompassing the processing sites. Therefore, both processing sites should be located within a double-stranded stem structure. Ribonuclease III (RNase III) of E. coli is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific ribonuclease, and it processes several RNAs, including rRNA precursor, T7 early gene transcripts, and λ PL transcript (16Dunn J.J.

Control of mRNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 70-116Google Scholar), suggesting that processing by RNase III is biologically important. In eukaryotic cells, ribonucleases with RNase III-like activity are Rnt1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and PacIp of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (22Elela S.A. Igel H. Ares Jr., M.

Panganiban and Whitely (24Panganiban A.T. Whiteley H.R. Cell. 1983; 33: 907-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) discovered an enzymatic activity inB. subtilis that is similar to E. coli RNase III, and they called it Bs-RNase III. Purified Bs-RNase III cleaves B. subtilis rRNA precursor and early transcripts of B. subtilis bacteriophage SP82 (24Panganiban A.T. Whiteley H.R.

We found that the srb gene is the last gene in a three-gene operon, the first gene of which encodes rncS, the product of which shares 36% amino acid identity with E. coli RNaseIII. Oguro et al. (13Oguro A. Kakeshita H. Takamatsu H. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Gene. 1996; 172: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) cloned the rncS gene, and Wang and Bechhofer demonstrated that this gene codes for Bs-RNaseIII (26Wang W. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7379-7385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence in an operon of a gene (rncS) coding for a double-stranded RNA processing enzyme and a gene coding for a component of the B. subtilis SRP receptor (srb), suggesting that Bs-RNaseIII might be involved in scRNA processing. In this study, we examined the function of Bs-RNase III in pre-scRNA processing. The results demonstrated that Bs-RNase III is an essential endonucleotic agent that processes at both 5′- and 3′-sites. Additionally, purified His-tagged RncS protein can process pre-scRNA, and the cleavage sites are identical to those of Bs-RNase III. Moreover, unprocessed pre-scRNA accumulated in a B. subtilisstrain containing a truncated rncS gene. We constructed the E. coliplasmid pTUE962 expressing B. subtilis RncS tagged with hexahistidine at its C terminus (RncS-His6) as follows. The B. subtilis rncS gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GGTTACCATGGCAAAACACTCAC-3′ and 5′-ACATAGATCTAATAAGACGGCATAC-3′. These primers were designed to generate NcoI and BglII (underlined) sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the PCR product. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BglII and then ligated into the NcoI and BglII sites of pQE60 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). To prepare the scRNA precursor in vitro, a 396-nt fragment encoding the scRNA precursor was amplified by PCR using 5′-TATACTTAAGCTTGCATCG-3′ and 5′-GTTTCGGATCCAAAAGCTC-3′ (Fig. 1). These primers were designed to generate HindIII and BamHI sites (underlined) at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the PCR product, which was purified, digested with HindIII andBamHI, and then ligated into the HindIII andBamHI sites of pSP64 (Promega, Madison, WI). The constructed plasmid was designated pTUE961. The construction of plasmid pJFD4, which was used for in vitro transcription of SP82 mRNA, has been described by Mitra and Bechhofer (27Mitra S. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31450-31456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pJFD4 and pTUE961 were linearized by digestion with XbaI and BamHI, respectively. The transcription reaction mixture consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9); 6 mm MgCl2; 10 mm NaCl; 0.5 mm each ATP, GTP, UTP; 2.5 μm CTP; 70 units of RNase inhibitor (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan); 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK); 1 pmol of the linearized DNA fragment; and 35 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. RNAs were precipitated by ethanol and then dissolved in sterile and deionized water. Bs-RNase III was purified as described previously (27Mitra S. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31450-31456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S30 cell extract, which was prepared from protease-deficient strain GP208, was precipitated by ammonium sulfate (65% saturation). The pellet was dissolved and was fractionated by phenyl-Sepharose and poly(I)·poly(C) agarose steps. Bs-RNase III fraction was purified based upon its processing activity toward B. subtilis SP82 phage mRNA A site. RncS-His6 was expressed in E. coli M15 harboring pREP4 (Qiagen Inc.) incubated with shaking for 5 h at 37 °C in 150 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested and suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After freezing and thawing the suspension, 0.5 volume of glass beads was added, and the mixture was vigorously vortex-mixed for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (supernatant A) was separated from the glass beads by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of Buffer A (0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 m urea) and centrifuged again at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant (supernatant B) was decanted. Supernatants A and B were mixed to produce supernatant C. Thereafter, 300 μl of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen Inc.) equilibrated with Buffer A was added to supernatant C and gently mixed for 1 h. The resin was washed three times with 10 ml of Buffer B (same composition as Buffer A except that the pH was adjusted to 6.3), and then the protein bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose was eluted with 500 μl of Buffer B containing 0.2m imidazole. The eluate was sequentially dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 50% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 6, 4, 2, and then 0 m urea. RncS-His6 was over 95% pure. The purified Bs-RNase III and RncS-His6 have 2.66 × 104 units/mg and 2.29 × 103 units/mg specific activity, respectively. One unit is defined as the amount of activity required to cleave 50% of 1 pmol of transcribed pre-scRNA in 2.5 min at 37 °C under standard assay conditions. Cleavage of pre-scRNA was as described by Mitra and Bechhofer (27Mitra S. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31450-31456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture (60 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.04 pmol of labeled RNA, and 0.04 units of purified enzyme was incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding phenol/CH3Cl, and then the aqueous phase was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The recovered samples were separated by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea-6% polyacrylamide gel, which was then dried, exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and visualized by autoradiography. The construction of strains BG217 and BG218 is described by Wang and Bechhofer (26Wang W. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7379-7385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a disrupted rncS gene, a 600-base pair HindIII fragment located within therncS coding sequence was cloned into the HindIII site of E. coli plasmid pDH88 (28Henner D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (plasmid pBSR18). The control was a full-length rncS coding sequence amplified by PCR that contained XbaI and BglII sites at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. This sequence was cloned into theXbaI-BglII sites of pDH88 (plasmid pBSR17). Plasmid pBSR18 and pBSR17 were used to transform B. subtilisBD170 (trpC2 thr-5) to yield the chloramphenicol-resistant strain BG218 (rncSΔ1) and BG217 (rncS +), respectively. As a result, BG218 expresses C-terminal truncated RncS (1–237 amino acids) lacking 29 amino acids and having an extra 9 amino acids derived from vector. Total RNAs of B. subtilis BG217 and BG218 were extracted as described by Ambuloset al. (29Ambulos Jr., N.P. Duvall E.J. Lovett P.S. Gene. 1987; 51: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Primers psc-1 (5′-AACCTCGAGAAGGGATTCG-3′) and psc-2 (5′-AACTCACCTAATATTAGG-3′) were used to map the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the cleavage sites in pre-scRNA (Fig. 1). Pre-scRNA was synthesized in vitro as described above except transcription proceeded in the presence of 0.5 mm of nonradiolabeled CTP instead of [α-32P]CTP. The primers psc-1 and psc-2 were labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo, Inc., Osaka, Japan) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham International). Pre-scRNA (40 μg) cleavedin vitro, or total B. subtilis RNA (100 μg) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide primers (1 × 105 cpm) at 35 °C overnight. After hybridization, samples were precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each dNTP, 1 mm DTT). 40 units of Rous-associated virus 2 reverse transcriptase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The samples were resolved by 8 m urea-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The psc-1 primer was also used for DNA sequencing. Total RNAs of B. subtilisBG217 and BG218 were resolved by 8 m urea-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a GeneScreen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was then hybridized with 5′-end-labeled psc-1. A 192-base pairEcoRI-BamHI fragment of pTUBE961, including the 3′-portion of the B. subtilis scRNA, was isolated and inserted into pBluescript II SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) between the EcoRI-BamHI sites. T3 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP were used to synthesize a radioactive probe encompassing the 3′-portion of the scRNA gene and to which it is complementary. Total RNAs of BG217 and BG218 (10 μg each) and 2 × 105 cpm of the 32P-labeled probe were hybridized at 45 °C overnight, and then the mixture was digested with RNase A (1 unit) and RNase T1 (200 units) at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were resolved by 8 murea-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Plasmid pTUE961 contained a 382-nt fragment of PCR-amplified scRNA gene (Fig.1). The BamHI-digest from pTUE961 was used as a template for in vitro transcription by SP6 RNA polymerase. The putative secondary structure of the in vitro transcript is shown in Fig. 2. The arrows in Fig. 2 indicate sites 5′ and 3′ processing site by Bs-RNase III. These processing sites exist beside the tetrad loops and yield a two-base 5′-overhang. To prepare pre-scRNA as the substrate(s) for Bs-RNase III, plasmid pTUE961 was linearized withBamHI, and transcripts were obtained by a reaction of SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of α-32P-labeled CTP. As a result, two major transcripts, S1 and S2, were obtained (Fig.3 lanes 1 and 7). Compared with a DNA molecular marker, the lengths of S1 and S2 were estimated to be 389 and 366 nt, respectively. Because the scRNA gene fragment in pTUE961 contains an endogenous ρ-independent transcriptional terminator of scRNA (Figs. 1 and 2), S1 and S2 represent products terminated at the BamHI site and at the ρ-independent terminator, respectively.Figure 3In vitro processing of pre-scRNA by Bs-RNase III and RncS-His6. Pre-scRNA was transcribed from BamHI-digested plasmid pTUE961 in the presence of [α-32P]CTP. 32P-labeled pre-scRNA was incubated with 0.04 units of purified Bs-RNase III for the following periods: lane 2, 0.5 min; lane 3, 2.5 min; lane 4, 10 min; lane 5, 30 min; lane 6, 45 min; and incubated with 0.04 units of RncS-His6for 30 min (lane 8); lanes 1 and 7, no RNase added. S1 (389 nt) and S2 (366 nt) indicatein vitro transcripts. P1 (340 nt), P2 (317 nt),and P3 (275 nt) indicate products generated by RNase III cleavage. Molecular mass was determined by comparison with the M13 mp18 sequence used as the molecular size marker. In the schematic drawing, the solid line indicates the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of pre-scRNA, the open bar indicates the scRNA mature region, and the broken line indicates the RNA region from the ρ-independent transcriptional terminator to the BamHI site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether Bs-RNase III processes pre-scRNA, 32P-labeled pre-scRNA was treated in vitro with the purified Bs-RNase III. At 0.5 min of incubation with the purified Bs-RNase III, two processed bands (Fig. 3, lane 2, P1 and P2) appeared. After a prolonged incubation, S1 and S2 were converted into P1, P2, and P3 (Fig. 3,lanes 3–6). At 45 min of incubation, 33.3% of transcripts were converted into P3 product (Fig. 3, lane 6). Compared with a DNA molecular marker, the lengths of these products were estimated to be 340, 317, and 275 nt, respectively. To exclude the possibility of the contamination of other ribonucleases in purified Bs-RNase III, we also carried out the in vitro processing assay of pre-scRNA by purified RncS-His6. S1 and S2 were processed to P1 and P2, respectively, and finally to P3 in the same manner as with Bs-RNase III (Fig. 3, lane 8). We determined the constitution of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the processed products by primer extension using primers psc-1 and psc-2, respectively (Figs. 1 and 4). Nonlabeled pre-scRNA was transcribed from BamHI-digested pTUE961in vitro. Pre-scRNA was primer-extended after an incubation with Bs-RNase III for 30 min at 37 °C. When psc-1 was used as the primer, a major band corresponding to the U residue at position 38 was detected (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). This indicates that Bs-RNase III cleaved the 5′-site of pre-scRNA at the U—U bond of positions 37–38 (Fig. 1). The 5′-end of the processed pre-scRNA was identical to that of the mature scRNA obtained in vivo (15Struck J.C.R. Hartmann R.K. Toschka H.Y. Erdmann V.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the processed product was also determined by primer extension using the primer psc-2, which anneals to a region in the 3′-flanking fragment at the positions 335–352 (Fig. 1). One distinct band appeared that was 40 nt long (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). This indicates that the 5′-end of the 3′-flanking fragment from pre-scRNA corresponds to an A residue at position 313 and that the cleavage site at the 3′-site of P3 created by Bs-RNase III is located at the C-A bond of nucleotide 312–313. This 3′-end is 4 nucleotides downstream of the 3′-end of the mature scRNA obtained in vivo (15Struck J.C.R. Hartmann R.K. Toschka H.Y. Erdmann V.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although both P1 and P2, which contain the 3′-flanking fragment, remained after a 30-min incubation (Fig. 3, lane 5), the extension products corresponding to P1 and P2 were not revealed by this assay (Fig.4 B). We suppose that they are too long (>300 nt) for detection by this gel system. Based on their length and the results of the primer extension, P1 and P2 are intermediate products that are processed at only the 5′-sites of S1 and S2, respectively. P3 is processed at both the 5′- and 3′-sites of S1 and S2. However, P3 contains four excess nucleotides at the 3′-end of mature scRNA. This 275-nt intermediate product is designated scRNA-275. We also examined primer extension with pre-scRNA which had been incubated with RncS-His6 for 30 min at 37 °C. When psc-1 and psc-2 were used as primers, we detected extension bands with the same molecular weight as those of the products of the pre-scRNA cleaved by Bs-RNase III (data not shown). To confirm that RncS protein is involved in pre-scRNA processing in vivo, we constructed the mutant strain BG218 (rncSΔ1), which expresses defective RncS lacking part of the C-terminal dsRNA binding domain (26Wang W. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7379-7385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We Northern blotted total RNAs from the control strain BG217 and the rncS mutant strain BG218. Fig.5 shows that significant amounts of pre-scRNA accumulated in strain BG218. We then defined the 5′- and 3′-ends of scRNA in the BG217 and BG218 strains. To examine the 5′-end, we performed primer extension with 5′-labeled psc-1 against total RNAs of BG217 and BG218. For BG217, one distinct band was detected at the U residue at position 38, which is the 5′-end of mature scRNA (Fig.6 A, lane 1). For BG218, the major band at position 38 was present, but an additional band was detected at the G residue at position 1, which is the 5′-end of pre-scRNA (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). We performed an RNase protection assay to define the 3′-end. One major protected band of 132-nt was detected in BG217. This band corresponded with the A residue at position 308, which is the 3′-end of mature scRNA (Fig. 6 B, lane 1). In contrast, two major protected bands of 132 and 178 nt were detected in BG218. The additional 178-nt band corresponded with the U residue at position 354, which is the 3′-end of pre-scRNA (Fig.6 B, lane 2). Furthermore, one minor band of 136 nt was detected in BG218. This band corresponded with the C residue at position 312, which is the 3′-end of scRNA-275 (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). These results show that Bs-RNase III processes pre-scRNAin vivo as it does in vitro.Figure 6Mapping the 5′- and 3′-ends of scRNA inB. subtilis BG217 and BG218.

In this study, we showed that Bs-RNase III processes pre-scRNA at both 5′- and 3′-sites. Pre-scRNA was processed to a 275-nt fragment (scRNA-275) upon incubation with Bs-RNase III or RncS-His6 in vitro. The 5′-end of the processed pre-scRNA was identical to that of mature scRNA. However, the 3′-end of processed pre-scRNA was 4 nucleotides downstream from that of mature scRNA (Fig. 1). These results suggest that pre-scRNA is processed to scRNA-275 by RNase III first, and then the four nucleotides are removed from the 3′-end of scRNA-275 by another RNase(s). The 3′-end of scRNA-275 was also detected by an RNase protection assay of the RNA preparation from the BG218 mutant strain as a minor band (Fig.6 B, small arrowhead). The staggered cleavage site of pre-scRNA by Bs-RNase III is at the internal tetrad loop (Fig. 2). Single cleavages by Bs-RNaseIII on SP82 sites A and B were also found to occur in an internal bulge sequence (27Mitra S. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31450-31456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Struck et al. (15Struck J.C.R. Hartmann R.K. Toschka H.Y. Erdmann V.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicated that 5′-end processing of pre-scRNA occurred prior to 3′-end processing in vivo. Fig.3 shows that the processed products P1 and P2 appeared first, followed by P3 as the incubation period increased. At 10 min of incubation (Fig.3, lane 5), almost all transcribed products (S1 and S2) were converted into P1, P2, and P3. However, the 5′-end-processed products, P1 and P2, did not disappear as the incubation period extended, and the amount of P3 did not significantly increase. The cleavage efficiency of the 3′-site is one-tenth that of 5′-site. This suggests that cleavage at the 3′-site determines the maturation efficiency of pre-scRNA or that another factor is necessary for efficient cleavage. We suppose that in vitro processing proceeds in the same manner asin vivo processing. Recently, B. subtilis genomic DNA was completely sequenced (30Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessiéres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3126) Google Scholar). The BLAST computation showed that only the rncSproduct had significant homology with E. coli RNase III. Furthermore, we searched the B. subtilis orf data base for the amino acid sequence NERLEFLGD, which is conserved in RNase III ofE. coli, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, andB. subtilis. The BLAST computation showed that theyitV product had a similar sequence (PERLQFIGD; underlined residues show conserved amino acids). However, the full YitV amino acid sequence did not show significant homology with RNase IIIs. These data suggest that rncS is the only gene that codes for RNase III activity in B. subtilis. In B. subtilis strain BG218, which expresses a C-terminal truncated RncS, significant amounts of pre-scRNA accumulated in this strain (Fig. 5). The truncated RncS is missing a part of the dsRNA binding domain. We think that the C-terminally truncated RncS retains catalytic activity but has a decreased ability to bind dsRNA. As a result, pre-scRNA processing efficiency is decreased in BG218. We attempted to construct a null mutant of rncS, using integration vectors in which four different regions of the rncS gene were cloned, but these efforts were unsuccessful (data not shown). This suggests that Bs-RNase III is essential for viability of B. subtilis and that processing of RNA by Bs-RNase III plays an important role in B. subtilis. We thank N. Foster for critical reading of the manuscript."

To determine whether HC influences the cell's program of gene expression, vascular endothelial cells were treated with HC for 6–42 h and analyzed by differential display. We found a 3–7-fold, time-dependent induction of a 220-base pair fragment, which demonstrated complete sequence identity with elongation factor-1δ (EF-1δ), a member of the multimeric complex regulating mRNA translation. Fibroblasts from cystathionine β-synthase −/− individuals also showed up to 3.0-fold increased levels of mRNA for EF-1α, -β, and -δ when compared with normal cells, and treatment of normal cells with the HC precursor, methionine, induced a 1.5–2.0-fold increase in EF-1α, -β, and -δ mRNA. This induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide and reflected a doubling in the rate of gene transcription in nuclear run-on analyses. In HC-treated endothelial cells, pulse-chase studies revealed a doubling in the rate of synthesis of the thiol-containing protein, annexin II, but no change in synthesis of the cysteineless protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Thus, HC induces expression of a family of acute translational response genes through a protein synthesis-dependent transcriptional mechanism. This process may mediate accelerated synthesis of free thiol-containing proteins in response to HC-induced oxidative stress.

HC is formed upon demethylation of methionine, and participates in the transsulfuration pathway in which it condenses with serine to form cystathionine. The most frequently encountered form of homocystinuria results from deficiency of the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (vitamin B6)-dependent rate-limiting enzyme, cystathionine β-synthase (2Mudd H. Skovby F. Levy H.L. Pettigrew K.D. Wilcken B. Pyeritz R.E. Andria G. Boers G.H.J. Bromberg I.L. Cerone R. Fowler B. Grobe H. Schmidt H. Schweitzer L. Am. J. Hum.

In addition, the enzymes 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase participate in the remethylation of HC, regenerating methionine in the presence of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Genetic or acquired deficiencies of these enzymes are also causes of homocyst(e)inemia (4Frosst P. Blom H.J. Milos R. Goyette P. Sheppard C.A. Matthews R.G. Boers G.H.J. Den Heijer M.

Since HC is not a dietary constituent, the sole source of HC in human tissues is methionine. Elevations in plasma homocyst(e)ine have been associated with a variety of clinical syndromes including thromboembolic vascular disease, dislocation of the ocular lens, osteoporosis, neural tube defects, and mental retardation (1Mudd H.

Recent studies suggest that imbalances in the redox state of a cell may profoundly influence its functional activity. Oxidatively modified proteins, as may form in the presence of HC (8McCully K.S.

In addition, several genes including reducing agent and tunicamycin-responsive protein (RTP), the stress protein GRP78/BiP, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), and a methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase have been found to be induced in endothelial cells exposed to high dose HC (14Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29659-29665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, the cyclin A gene appears to be transcriptionally activated following exposure to HC (15Tsai J.C. Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.

Elongation factor-1 (EF-1) is a multimeric protein that regulates the efficiency and fidelity of mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells. Expression of EF-1α, the best studied of four subunits (α, β, γ, and δ), is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In the present study, we show that HC, either supplied exogenously to endothelial cells or produced endogenously in cystathionine β-synthase-deficient fibroblasts, up-regulates the EF-1 family of genes. This occurs through a transcriptional mechanism that is protein synthesis-dependent. Furthermore, EF-1 induction by HC is associated with accelerated turnover of the thiol-containing protein, annexin II, whereas synthesis of a cysteineless protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, is unchanged. These data suggest that the cell may respond to deleterious effects of HC by induction of an acute translational response by which damaged proteins may be efficiently replenished. dl-homocysteine,l-cysteine, l-methionine, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. [α-35S]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]rUTP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Plasmids containing cDNAs encoding human EF-1α (81678) and EF-1β (78530) were from American Type Culture Collection. A 28 S rRNA probe was kindly supplied by Dr. Iris Gonzales, Department of Pathology, Hahneman University, Philadelphia, PA. Polyclonal rabbit IgG directed against human EF-1α, -β, -γ, and -δ subunits was generously provided by Dr. Wim Möller (Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-Dyctiostelium EF-1α was kindly supplied by Dr. John Condeelis (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Polyclonal goat anti-human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 IgG (395G) was purchased from American Diagnostica. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were harvested, propagated in M199, 0.3 mmdl-methionine, 20% pooled human serum (17Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11656-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normal and cystathionine β-synthase −/− human fibroblasts (NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository; GM 00751) were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium, 0.15 mml-methionine, 20% fetal bovine serum. dl-Homocysteine,l-cysteine, or l-methionine were added as 2- or 4-fold stock solutions. Fibroblasts or HUVEC from T75 flasks were washed three times with PBS, scraped into 5 ml of PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Lysates were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thaw. Following centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 10 min), supernatants were diluted 1:10 in 0.1m Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, and treated immediately with 200 μm 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent, 15 min, 21 °C). Absorbance at 412 nm was used to calculate free sulfhydryl content using a path length of 1 cm and molar extinction coefficient of 14,150. Total RNA from HUVEC treated with or without dl-homocysteine was isolated by guanidinium thiocyanate protein denaturation and phenol-chloroform extraction (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). For differential display (19Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar), RNA (0.2 μg) was reverse transcribed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.3, using degenerate primers T12MG, T12MA, and T12MC, where M is A, G, or C. The reaction mixture was heated to 65 °C (5 min), and then cooled (37 °C, 10 min) prior to incubation with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., 200 units, 37 °C, 60 min). The reaction was terminated by heating to 95 °C (5 min), and then stored at −20 °C (18 h). Reverse transcribed cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of [α-35S]dATP using 10 arbitrary forward primers (Genhunter Corp.; 5′-AGCCAGCGAA-3′, 5′-GACCGCTTGT-3′, 5′-AGGTGACCGT-3′, 5′-GGTACTCCAC-3′, 5′-GTTGCGATCC-3′, 5′-GCAATCGATG-3′, 5′-CCGAAGGAAT-3′, 5′-GGATTGTGCG-3′, 5′-CGTGGCAATA-3′, 5′-TAGCAAGTGC-3′) and three oligo(dT) reverse primers, through 40 cycles consisting of 94 °C (30 s), 40 °C (2 min), and 72 °C (30 s), and a final incubation at 72 °C (5 min). Amplified cDNAs were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (1500 constant V, 3 h). Gels were dried without fixation, and exposed to Kodak XAR film (−70 °C, 18 h). Differentially displayed bands were cut out, recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and reamplified by polymerase chain reaction. Products were isolated on 1% low melting point agarose and purified by ethanol precipitation (20Gold P. Vessels. 1992; 2: 9-16Google Scholar). Total RNA from HUVEC or fibroblasts (4–10 μg) was resolved on a 1.5% agarose denaturing formaldehyde gel, and blotted to Zetaprobe (Bio-Rad) (21). Radiolabeled probes were generated by random prime labeling and incubated with filters (18 h, 43 °C in 50% formamide or 48 °C in 25% formamide). Filters were washed four times in increasingly stringent SSC solutions from 2 to 0.1×SSC at 21 °C, dried, and autoradiographed on Kodak XAR film (−70 °C). Signals were quantified by phosphorimaging and/or laser densitometry. Differentially displayed cDNAs were subcloned directionally into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) usingEcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, and sequenced at the Rockefeller University DNA and Protein Sequencing Laboratory using T3 and T7 primers. Derived sequences were compared with GenBank and EMBL data bases. Nuclei were isolated by cell lysis in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 from normal and cystathionine β-synthase −/− fibroblasts, washed, and stored in liquid nitrogen in 50 mmTris-HCl, 40% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3 (22Greenberg M. Ziff E. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Thawed nuclear suspensions (200 μl) from either untreated cells, or cells treated with 0.3 mmmethionine or 0.3 mm cysteine (18 h), were incubated with 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, 30 min, 30 °C). 32P-Labeled RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1; v/v/v; pH 5.2) extraction and precipitation, and resuspended at equal cpm/ml in hybridization buffer (10 mm TES, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 600 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Denatured probes for EF-1α, -β, and -δ and 28 S RNA (8.3 μg) slot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters were hybridized with labeled nuclear transcripts (65 °C, 36 h). The filters were dried, autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film (24 h, −70 °C), and the signals quantified by phosphorimaging. HUVEC or fibroblasts were washed three times with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 15 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 3 mmKCl, pH 7.4) and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the supernatants (5 μg/well in 50 μl of carbonate buffer: 15 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm NaN3, pH 9.6) used to coat wells of 96-well Nunc immunosorbent plates (18 h, 4 °C). The wells were blocked with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml in PBS/0.5% Tween 20, 2.5 h, 37 °C), washed and incubated with subunit-specific rabbit immune IgG (1:500 in PBS/0.5% Tween 20, 2.5 h, 37 °C), the specificities of which were verified by Western blot (23Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M.C. Dijk J. Moller W. J. Cell. Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 in PBS/0.5% Tween 20, 2.5 h, 37 °C), washed again three times, and developed withp-nitrophenylphosphate in diethanolamine buffer (9.7% diethanolamine v/v, 3 mm NaN3, 0.01% MgCl2·6H2O, pH 9.8). Change in absorbance was evaluated over a 60-min time interval. HUVEC (80% confluent), untreated or treated with 5 mmdl-homocysteine (18 h), were washed three times with Hepes-buffered saline (HBS, 11 mm Hepes, 137 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated with methionine-free medium (4 h). Cells were then pulsed with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine per 75-cm2flask (1 h), washed three times with HBS, and chased with complete medium with or without 5 mm homocysteine. Cells were treated with protease inhibitors and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw in HBS. Supernatants (500 × g, 10 min, 500 μl) were incubated with polyclonal anti-annexin II (24Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-PAI-1 (American Diagnostica 395G) for 18 h, treated with a 200-μl packed volume of Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech 17-0618-01) pre-equilibrated in 0.75 Tris, pH 8.8 (4 °C, 3 h), and washed three times in the same buffer (25Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The beads were treated for 30 min (21 °C) with 100 μl of 5× PAGE sample buffer, and the samples electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (18 h). The gels were treated with EN3HANCE, dried, fluorographed, and analyzed by densitometric image analysis. Differential display analysis of mRNA from untreated HUVEC, and HUVEC treated with 5 mm HC for 6, 18, and 42 h was carried out. Total intracellular thiol content of HC-treated HUVEC peaked at 2.4 times base line within 4 h, and remained at greater than twice base line from 6–18 h (Fig.1). In HC-treated HUVEC, release of neither 51Cr (26Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) nor lactate dehydrogenase differed from that observed in untreated controls (8.1 ± 2.3 versus9.1 ± 1.2 units/ml, respectively, S.E., n = 4), indicating that cellular integrity was maintained. In two separate experiments, approximately 10 discrete bands appeared to be up- or down-regulated in the presence of HC, one of which (arrow) showed a time-related increase in intensity (3.6-fold at 6 h, 4.8-fold at 18 h, and 6.9-fold at 42 h) (Fig.2). Upon reamplification and Northern blot analysis of mRNA from control and HC-treated HUVEC, time-dependent expression could be confirmed only for this band (Fig. 3 C). This DNA fragment was subcloned directionally into pBluescript KS+ usingEcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. Sequence analysis revealed complete identity with bases 770–991 of the cDNA for human elongation factor-1δ (EF-1δ), a protein involved in regulation of mRNA translation (TableI).Figure 2Representative differential display of mRNA transcripts from HC-stimulated HUVEC.

To determine whether mRNAs encoding related subunits EF-1α and EF-1β were also up-regulated in the presence of HC, additional Northern hybridization analyses were carried out (Fig. 3, A and B). These studies revealed an increase in steady state mRNA for EF-1α, -β, and -δ that was evident by 6–18 h, and maximal (2–4-fold) by 42 h. Thus, exposure of endothelial cells to HC appeared to coordinately up-regulate steady state mRNA for all three EF-1 subunits. To determine the specificity and dose-response relationship of EF-1δ mRNA upon exposure to HC, HUVEC were treated with 5 μM to 5 mm HC or l-cysteine for 24 h (data not shown). Northern hybridization revealed a 1.4–3.0-fold dose-related increase in steady state mRNA levels in response to HC, but, interestingly, no significant response to l-cysteine in the same dosage range. These data indicated that the effect of HC was both specific and dose-dependent, occurring at concentrations of HC commonly seen in vascular disease (15–100 μM). To determine whether up-regulation of EF-1 subunit mRNAs was reflected at the protein level, ELISAs were carried out (27Voller A. Bidwell D. Bartlett A. Rose N.R. Friedman H. Manual of Clinical Immunology. 1976: 506-512Google Scholar) (Fig.4). After 8 h, expression of EF-1α and -β increased by 90–95%, while EF-1γ and -δ rose by 60–65%. By 24 h, expression of all four subunits had increased by 2.5–3.5 times (p < 0.001). These data suggested that all components of the EF-1 complex are coordinately regulated, and increase significantly at the protein level in response to HC. To determine whether EF-1δ and its partners, EF-1α and -β, were up-regulated under conditions where homocysteine is produced endogenously, normal human foreskin fibroblasts were compared with homocystinuric fibroblasts which lack the enzyme cystathionine β-synthase (CBS −/−). At rest, CBS −/− fibroblasts contained approximately twice as much intracellular thiol as normal fibroblasts (Fig. 1). When CBS +/+ fibroblasts were treated with 0.45 mm methionine, a homocysteine precursor, intracellular thiols doubled within 4 h, and slowly returned to base line over the next 14 h. CBS −/− fibroblasts, on the other hand, showed roughly a doubling of intracellular thiol within 4 h, followed by a continuous further increase over the ensuing 14 h. These experiments verified that CBS −/− fibroblasts were unable to clear methionine-induced intracellular thiols, whereas CBS +/+ cells did so with relative efficiency. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of normal fibroblasts with 0.45 mm methionine led to a 1.3–1.7-fold increase in steady state mRNA levels for EF-1α, -β, and -δ in Northern blot analyses (p < 0.001). Furthermore, normal fibroblasts treated with 1 mm HC showed a 1.5–2.5-fold increase in EF-1α, -β and -δ mRNA (p < 0.001). In resting homocystinuric fibroblasts, steady state levels of EF-1α, -β, and -δ mRNA were increased by 1.5–3.0-fold (p < 0.001). Supplemental methionine did not increase these levels further. These data indicated that steady state levels of EF-1α, -β, and -δ mRNA are significantly up-regulated under conditions where intracellular homocysteine is increased. In addition, protein levels of EF-1 subunits in normal and homocystinuric fibroblasts were assessed by ELISA (Fig. 4 B). Compared with CBS +/+ cells, CBS −/− fibroblasts showed a 2.5–4.5-fold increase in expression of EF-1 subunit protein (p < 0.001). To ascertain the mechanism by which EF-1 subunit mRNA was induced in response to methionine, time-course studies were undertaken (Fig.6 ). In response to methionine, both EF-1α (Fig. 6 A) and EF-1δ (Fig. 6 B) mRNA steady state levels in CBS +/+ fibroblasts peaked within 4 h and remained elevated for up to 18 h. This response was inhibited in cells pretreated with cycloheximide (100 μM, 2 h). EF-1α mRNA levels also fell in response to cycloheximide, but recovered between 4 and 18 h. These data suggest that induction of both EF-1α and EF-1δ requires protein synthesis. Identical results were obtained when 5 mm HC was substituted for methionine, suggesting that methionine may act by conversion to HC.Figure 6Time course of EF-1 subunit mRNA induction in normal fibroblasts by methionine. Normal fibroblasts were treated with 0.45 mm methionine for 1, 2, 4, and 18 h. Steady state mRNA levels for EF-1α (A) or for EF-1δ (B) were estimated by Northern blot analysis of samples from cells either pretreated (+CHX) or not pretreated (−CHX) with cycloheximide (100 μM, 2 h). mRNA levels were normalized to 28 S RNA for each sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether induction of EF-1 subunits by methionine involved regulation at the transcriptional level, nuclear run-on experiments were conducted (Fig. 7). For all three genes, the rate of transcription in CBS +/+ cells increased 1.8–2.5-fold upon addition of 0.45 mm methionine (p < 0.001). Similarly, in CBS −/− cells, transcription was increased 1.8–2.5-fold compared with CBS +/+ cells (p < 0.001), and this rate was not augmented further upon addition of methionine. In contrast, addition ofl-cysteine (0.3 mm) to the culture medium failed to significantly enhance the rate of transcription of EF-1α, -β, or -δ in either CBS +/+ or CBS −/− cells. These data suggest that increased intracellular levels of methionine or homocysteine, but not cysteine, are specifically associated with increased transcription of EF-1α, -β, and -δ mRNA. To assess the effect of HC on overall protein synthesis, incorporation of [35S]methionine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was quantified in both control and HC-treated HUVEC. By this criterion, total protein synthesis was consistently reduced over 4–40 h to 63 ± 5% (S.E., n = 10) in the presence of HC. To determine the effect of EF-1 induction on turnover of a thiol-containing protein, pulse-chase metabolic labeling was conducted (Fig.8 A). Annexin II is a calcium-regulated phospholipid-binding protein that contains 4 cysteine residues, at least 2 of which exist in the reduced state (28Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Following the initial [35S]methionine pulse, synthesis of annexin II proceeded 2.1 times as rapidly in HC-treated cells as in untreated control cells. By 16 h of chase, levels of immunoprecipitable annexin II in HC-treated cells averaged twice those observed in untreated control cells. The rate of disappearance of annexin II in HC-treated cells was 1.9 times greater than that of control cells. These data indicate that HC accelerates rates of annexin II synthesis and degradation. Because HC had no significant effect on annexin II mRNA levels at 16 h and 42 h (annexin II mRNA/GAPDH mRNA: 102% and 94% of untreated control, respectively), the observed increase in annexin II synthesis appears to reflect an enhancement in translational efficiency. In contrast, there was no significant difference in turnover of the non-thiol-containing, cysteineless protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (Fig.8 B), as immunoprecipitable levels of PAI-1 differed by less than 15% throughout a 40-h time course. Thus, although turnover of a thiol-containing protein, annexin II, was accelerated in the presence of HC, metabolism of a non-thiol protein, PAI-1, was unaltered. Protein translation plays a crucial role in processes governing cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (29Proud C.G. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1994; 19: 161-170Google Scholar, 30Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Morris D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 51: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In most eukaryotes, the two primary elongation factors, multimeric EF-1 and monomeric EF-2, are primary sites of regulation of protein translation (29Proud C.G. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1994; 19: 161-170Google Scholar). EF-1 consists of five subunits (α2βγδ), which promote GTP-driven delivery of aminoacyl tRNAs to the ribosome. The EF-1α·GDP complex is converted to active EF-1α·GTP by the nucleotide exchange activities of EF-1β and EF-1δ. The EF-1γ moiety is known to enhance the nucleotide exchange activity of EF-1β, and may also serve to anchor the complex to membrane structures. Interestingly, EF-1δ, which is homologous to EF-1β in the C-terminal nucleotide exchange region, is unique among these factors in that it contains a leucine zipper motif of unknown function. EF-1 appears to play a central role in regulation of mRNA translation, and alterations in levels of EF-1 subunit expression have been reported in a variety of settings. Over-expression of EF-1α is associated with increased translational fidelity in yeast (32Song J.M. Picologlou S. Grant C.M. Firoozan M. Tuite M.F. Liebman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4571-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and increased longevity in Drosophila (33Shepherd J.C.W. Walldorf U. Hug P. Gehring W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The functions of these kinases are still unknown although recent data suggest a role in modulating muscle activity and generating passive elasticity. An important question is what are the in vivo substrates for these enzymes. We found a thin filament-associated 30 kDa protein that acts as an in vitrosubstrate for projectin kinase from Locusta migratoria. However, we did not find activators for projectin kinase. Neither calcium, calcium with calmodulin, nor cAMP activated the in vitro activity of projectin kinase. Binding studies revealed a strong interaction between projectin and thin filaments comparable with that of the projectin-myosin interaction. That an interaction might be possible in vivo is suggested by immunological studies showing that projectin is attached to the surface of myosin filaments. Since the molecular weights indicate that the 30 kDa protein might be troponin I, which is known to play a central role in modulating cardiac contractile activity, we studied whether phosphorylation of this protein by projectin changes the calcium sensitivity of the actomyosin ATPase. We found a significant increase in the calcium sensitivity. Thus, our results indicate the existence of a novel mechanism of regulation of muscle activity by a cytoskeleton-associated kinase.

Accessory proteins closely associated with actin filaments, troponin, and tropomyosin, mediate the Ca2+ regulation of skeletal muscle contraction (reviewed in Ref. 1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence for the involvement of a myosin-linked regulatory system in vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscle during modulation of muscle contraction (2Vandenboom R. Grange R.W.

The molecular mechanism of myosin filament mediated regulation of skeletal muscle is still little understood. Phosphorylation of the myosin light chains (MLC) 1The abbreviations used are: MLC, myosin light chain; IgG, immunoglobulin G; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is supposed to play a central role in the regulation of skeletal muscle activity as in smooth muscle contraction (3Grange R.W.

A. 1990; 87: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) raises the question of whether these participate in the regulation of muscle contraction. These extraordinarily large protein kinases are classified as intracellular members of the immunoglobulin protein superfamily on the basis of their molecular structure (7Benian G.M. Kiff J.E. Neckelmann N. Moerman D.G. Waterston R.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Ayme-Southgate A. Southgate R. Saide J. Benian G.M. Pardue M.L. J.

Members of this family are the giant mammalian titin (3 MDa, reviewed in Ref. 11Keller C.S. Curr. Opin.

First indications of the possible functions of these proteins have been derived from genetic studies on the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans. Mutants of the unc-22gene encoding twitchin are characterized by a repetetive twitching of the body wall muscle and by an abnormal sarcomere structure (7Benian G.M. Kiff J.E. Neckelmann N. Moerman D.G. Waterston R.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), suggesting that twitchin-like molecules are directly involved in modulating muscle activity and are also essential for ordered sarcomere assembly. Findings that projectin is able to determine the length of myosin filaments in vitro confirm the idea that these proteins are molecular directives for myosin filament assembly (22Kölsch B. Ziegler C. Beinbrech G. Naturwissenschaften. 1995; 82: 239-241PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the function of the kinase domain is still unknown. The recent report on the x-ray crystal structure of the kinase domain of twitchin has given insight into the regulatory power of this kinase and provides evidence for an intrasteric mechanism of protein kinase regulation employing an autoregulatory sequence (23Hu S.H. Parker M.W. Lei J.Y. Wilce M.C. Benian G.M. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1994; 369: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In vitro autophosphorylation has been described for the bacterially expressed kinase of twitchin from C. elegans (24Lei J. Tang X. Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21078-21085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for other members of this family including insect projectin kinase fromDrosophila leg and flight muscle (8Ayme-Southgate A. Southgate R. Saide J. Benian G.M. Pardue M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), crustacean projectin kinase from crayfish tail muscle (25Maroto M. Vinos J. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and mollusc twitchin kinase fromAplysia (26Heierhorst J. Probst W.C. Vilim F.S. Buku A. Weiss K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21086-21093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An endogenous in vitro substrate for mollusc twitchin is the regulatory MLC (27Heierhorst J. Probst W.C. Kohanski R.A. Buku A. Weiss K.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vitro studies on the kinase catalytic core of twitchin fromC. elegans expressed in Escherichia coli, indicate that this twitchin differs in substrate specificity (24Lei J. Tang X. Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21078-21085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although synthetic MLC peptides homologous to a part of chicken smooth muscle MLC proved a useful model substrate, MLC peptides derived fromC. elegans itself were weakly phosphorylated by twitchin kinase (24Lei J. Tang X. Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21078-21085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, intact chicken smooth muscle MLC failed as a substrate (24Lei J. Tang X. Chambers T.C. Pohl J. Benian G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21078-21085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So far, in vivo substrates for twitchin and other members of the twitchin and titin-like kinases are still unknown. Projectin kinase of insects has been less well studied with respect to potential substrates, even though identification of substrates for mini-titin of different invertebrate species would provide an essential clue for understanding their functions. In this paper, we demonstrate that projectin from insect muscles is able to autophosphorylate in vitro. Moreover, we identify thin filament-associated 30-kDa protein, not a MLC, as a substrate for projectin. We show that phosphorylation affects the sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase to Ca2+. Immunoelectron microscopy studies provide evidence that projectin attaches to the surface of myosin filaments. Finally, in vitro binding studies reveal a strong interaction between projectin and thin filaments. Myofibrils were prepared from freshly dissected muscles from the grasshopperLocusta migratoria as described by Etlinger et al. (28Etlinger J.D. Zak R. Fishman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Projectin and myosin were isolated from leg and flight muscle myofibrils as described by Kölsch et al. (22Kölsch B. Ziegler C. Beinbrech G. Naturwissenschaften. 1995; 82: 239-241PubMed Google Scholar). Washed myofibrils were extracted in 20 mmNa2P4O7, 1 mmCaCl2, and 10 mmTris-H3PO4, pH 8.3, for 1 h by stirring on ice. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g. For projectin purification, the supernatant was subjected to chromatography on Mono-Q-FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently the pellet was used for myosin extraction in 40 mmNa2P4O7, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Unsoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation for 2 h at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to Mono-Q-FPLC. Equilibration buffer for projectin chromatofocussing contained 10 mmNa2P4O7, 10 mmTris-H3PO4, pH 8.3, and for myosin chromatography, it contained 40 mmNa2P4O7, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear salt gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl in equilibration buffer). All preparation steps were done at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured according to Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of protein preparations was judged by SDS-PAGE using silver and Coomassie Blue staining for protein detection. Proteins were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels with the Laemmli buffer system (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and 2–14% acrylamide gradient. Rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 0.5 mg of purified projectin in complete Freund's adjuvant. They were boosted twice at 3-week intervals with 0.25 mg of projectin in incomplete Freund′s adjuvant. Serum was collected 2 weeks after the last boost. Immunoglobulins were precipitated with 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, resuspended in PBS (1/6 of starting volume) and dialyzed against PBS. Antibodies specific for projectin were isolated by passing the dialyzed probe over a projectin affinity column and eluting the bound antibodies with 0.2 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.5. The affinity column was made by coupling projectin to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer instructions. Autophosphorylating endogenous kinases of a myofibril extract, which was also used for chromatographic purification of projectin, were detected using a modified renaturating blotting assay as described by Kato et al. (31Kato M. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The extract was mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer which contained 5.5% (w/v) SDS, 12.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mm EDTA, 156 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4 m urea, and subjected to 2–14% SDS-PAGE on mini-gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon P; Millipore, 0.45 μm pore size) membranes in 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris at 150 mA for 30 min (semidry blot). Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris, 50 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 8.3. Enzymes were renaturated in 50 mm Tris, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 12 h at 4 °C. We did not use casein in the renaturation solution and did not block the membrane after renaturation of enzymes as originally described. To determine unspecific binding of ATP to proteins on the membrane, blots were incubated with [α-32P]ATP instead of [γ-32P]ATP or heat inactivated for 1 min at 80 °C. Blot strips were incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTE, 10 μm ATP with 50 μCi [γ-32P]ATP/ml or 50 μCi [α-32P]ATP/ml for 6 h at room temperature. The following substances were added: 5 mm EGTA or 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm CaCl2 with 5 μg/ml calmodulin (Boehringer Mannheim) or 10 μg/ml cAMP (Boehringer Mannheim). Kinase reactions were terminated by washing blot strips several times in PBS and then in 1 m KOH, each time for 10 min. Blots were washed again in PBS, stained with India ink, dried, and subjected to autoradiography overnight. Longitudinal flight muscles from Phormia terrae-novae and L. migratoria were isolated from the thorax. The flight muscle from locust was stretched about 20% of resting length before fixation. The leg muscle was stretched and fixed in situ. To do this, the femur was opened and the muscles were dissected with the exception of the flexor tibiae. Femur and tibiae were fixed in the 90o position. The muscles were then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 4 °C. Muscles were cut into small pieces and postfixed for 15 min at room temperature. The fibers were washed in PBS three times for 10 min and dehydrated in 50 and 70% ethanol each for 20 min at room temperature. Fibers were placed in LR White resin overnight at 4 °C and than polymerized in resin at 55 °C for 24 h. Silver sections were mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids and blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, pH 7.4 for 30 min. Sections were exposed for 12 h to primary antibody (10 μg/ml anti-projectin antibody in blocking buffer) at 4 °C, washed with blocking buffer, exposed to the secondary antibody (10 nm gold-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:10 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed successively in PBS and distilled water and stained with uranyl acetate. Sections were examined in a Phillips EM 301 electron microscope at 80 kV. Myosin and thin filaments were disrupted from myofibrils as described by Huxley (32Huxely H.E. Sci. Am. 1965; 213: 18-27Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and adsorbed to carbon coated grids by floating the grids on drops of the filament suspension for 1 min. Grids were blocked for 15 min with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, exposed to primary antibody (1 μg/ml anti-projectin antibody diluted in blocking buffer) for 20 min, washed with blocking buffer, exposed to secondary 10 nm gold-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG (diluted 1:10 in blocking buffer), washed with PBS, and negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Control sections or filaments were exposed to nonimmune rabbit IgG. Purified projectin and crude extracts of flight muscles from Locusta were dialyzed against 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0. Purified myosin was dialyzed against 500 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0. Thin filaments were prepared as described by Kendrick-Jones et al. (33Kendrick-Jones J. Lehman W. Szent-Györgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 54: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thin filaments of the same preparation were used for binding assays and ATPase measurements. Kinase assays were performed in 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP with 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP per 30 μl assay in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and varying Ca2+ concentrations (5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm EGTA or 5 mm EGTA). Projectin was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and myosin or filaments or crude extracts to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Proteins were preincubated for 5 min, and the reactions were started with ATP. Reactions were terminated after 45 min at 30 °C by the addition of an equal volume of a 2-fold concentrated sample buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 12.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mm EDTA, 120 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 4 m urea). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and used for autoradiography (exposure overnight with intensifying screens). Purified projectin from locust flight muscles was biotinylated withd-biotinoyl-ε-aminocaproic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was separated from unbound biotin by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25. Unlabeled proteins were immobilized on polystyrene ELISA wells at an amount of 300 ng/well for saturation. After blocking with 1% (w/v) BSA, biotinylated projectin was added to each well at different concentrations in high ionic strength buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl in PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed five times with PBS, pH 7.2. After reaction with avidin-peroxidase in PBS with 0.1% (w/v) BSA and with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, detection was started with a substrate solution using H2O2and O-phenylenediamine (Sigma) as the chromogen. One molar H2SO4 was used to stop the reaction. The absorbance was measured with a micro-ELISA reader (Dynatech) at 492 nm. Thin filaments (250 μg/ml), isolated from locust flight and leg muscles as described previously (33Kendrick-Jones J. Lehman W. Szent-Györgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 54: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), were preincubated with active or with heat-inactivated (1 min at 80 °C) projectin kinase (25 μg/ml) in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm histidine, pH 7.0, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and variable calcium concentrations for 30 min at 30 °C. The free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted according to Portzehl et al. (34Portzehl H. Caldwell P.C. Ruegg J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 79: 581-591PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase reactions were started by the addition of myosin (250 μg/ml) and stopped after 10 min with an equal volume of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. ATPase activity of myosin was determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate as described previously (35Rockstein M. Herron R.E. Anal. Chem. 1951; 23: 1500-1501Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To characterize the pattern of protein phosphorylation by endogenous kinases, extracts of purified myofibrils were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and various Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 1 shows the protein composition of myofibrils. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 4). Several phosphoproteins were detected in these experiments, and projectin was labeled strongly with32P using leg and flight muscle extracts. The pattern of protein phosphorylation was not influenced by calcium, but phosphorylation of projectin decreased slightly in the presence of calcium (results not shown).Figure 4Phosphorylation pattern of a myofibrillar extract with and without projectin. Panel A shows the Coomassie Blue-stained 2–14% polyacrylamide gel of samples incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and 5 mm EGTA for 30 min as indicated on top, and panel B shows the corresponding autoradiogram. Note that the phosphorylation of two proteins (marked by arrows) of the myofibrillar extract with molecular masses in the range of 36 and 30 kDa protein was significantly enhanced in the presence of purified projectin. Positions of protein molecular weight standards are indicated on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an initial step, we tested whether locust projectin exhibits kinase activity. The kinase activity of projectin was determined with a renaturating blotting assay. Myofibrillar extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred to membranes. After renaturation of proteins, blot strips were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. Autoradiography revealed three autophosphorylating kinases in myofibrillar extracts from leg and flight muscles (Fig. 2 A). Control strips that had been incubated with [α-32P]ATP showed that the radioactive labeling was not caused by unspecific binding of ATP to proteins (Fig. 2 A). The high molecular weight band on the autoradiogram was identified as projectin by comparison with immunoblots (Fig. 3). To test the influence of several known activators of protein kinases on projectin kinase activity, blot strips were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and Ca2+, Ca2+ and calmodulin, or cAMP. Fig. 2 B shows that these kinase activators did not have a significant effect on the kinase activity of renaturated projectin.Figure 3Specifity of anti-projectin antibodies revealed by immunoblots. Proteins as indicated on topwere separated on 4–14% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels, and the semi-dry blot of the gel was exposed to antibodies against projectin (1 μg/ml). Bands were visualized with goat antibodies against rabbit IgG, which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and diaminobenzidine as chromogenic substrates. The antibody did not show cross-reactions with myosin or other myofibrillar proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then focussed our interest on substrates for projectin kinase. We purified projectin chromatographically (see Fig. 1). Projectin was incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and of a myofibrillar extract from which projectin itself was removed. Fig.4 A shows the SDS-PAGE analyses of the projectin preparations and extracts. The corresponding autoradiogram (Fig. 4 B) shows that the phosphorylation of proteins with molecular weights of approximately 36 and 30 kDa was strongly increased in the presence of projectin. From these results, we speculated that MLC might be a substrate for projectin kinase. However, we could not find phosphorylation of MLC by projectin using purified myosin (see Fig. 1) as a potential substrate in kinase assays (results not shown). In a next step we isolated thin (native actin) filaments to determine whether thin filament-associated proteins are targets for projectin kinase. The protein composition of the thin filaments was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1). The major proteins of the locust thin filaments were actin (42 kDa) and the regulatory proteins: troponin T (55 kDa), tropomyosin (38 kDa), troponin I (32 and 30 kDa), and troponin C (approximately 20 kDa) (41Szent-Györgyi A.G. Szentkiralyi E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The higher molecular mass proteins were not characterized. Immunoblots with anti-myosin antibodies as well as electron microscopy revealed that the preparation was not contaminated with myosin (results not shown). Projectin was incubated with thin filaments, [γ-32P]ATP and varying calcium concentrations. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A) and autoradiography (Fig.5 B). Fig. 5 B shows that a protein with a molecular weight of 30 kDa (arrow in Fig. 5 B) was phosphorylated in the presence of projectin. Multiple bands including a 32-kDa band are phosphorylated in the control, where thin filaments were incubated without projectin, indicating that the thin filaments contain associated kinases. A 30-kDa phosphoprotein, however, is only visible if projectin is added to a thin filament phosphorylation assay. The 30-kDa protein is not a contamination of the projectin preparation as shown in the autophosphorylation assay (Fig. 5). The 55-kDa protein that has been weakly phosphorylated in the autophosphorylation assay (Fig. 5) is possibly a degradation product of projectin. The intensity of this band is slightly enhanced in the presence of calcium, suggesting a calcium-dependent degradation of projectin by proteases (results not shown). We have not been able to identify the 30-kDa protein up to now because there are few data about the protein composition of thin filaments fromLocusta migratoria, and sequence data on locust troponin are lacking. However, for thin filaments of other invertebrates, proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa have been identified as troponin I, the inhibitory component of the troponin complex (36Ojima T. Toyoguchi T. Nishita K. Fisheries. 1995; 61: 871-875Google Scholar, 37Barbas J.A. Galceran J. Krah-Jentgens I. De La Pompa J.L. Canal I. Pongs O. Ferrus A.

Since the molecular mass of the 30 kDa protein, phosphorylated by projectin, indicated that it might be troponin I, we reasoned that phosphorylation of this protein might affect the actomyosin ATPase activity. To determine whether this is the case, we performed ATPase assays with isolated myosin and the same thin filaments we used for phosphorylation studies in the presence of active or heat-inactivated projectin at varying calcium concentrations. In Fig.6 the ATPase activity of protein preparations of flight and leg muscles is plotted against the calcium concentration. To rule out that the Ca2+-sensitivity might be influenced by steric parameters, the experiments were performed with heat-inactivated projectin kinase (80 °C for 1 min) before preincubation as control. The half-maximal ATPase activity (pCa50) was increased from 5.85 to 6.35 when thin filaments were preincubated with active projectin kinase before starting the reaction by the addition of myosin (Fig. 6 A). For proteins of leg muscles, pCa50 was increased from 5.77 to 6.22 (Fig.6 B). The ATPase activity of myosin in the absence of thin filaments was not affected by projectin (results not shown). Thus, a thin filament-associated protein must be a substrate for projectin and, in addition, is obviously able to regulate the Ca2+sensitivity. This finding increased our interest on projectin-thin filament interactions. We performed in vitro binding studies to study the projectin-thin filament interaction. Thin filaments, containing troponin and tropomyosin, or purified myosin from flight muscles were immobilized on microtiter wells and exposed to increasing projectin amounts. BSA was used as a negative control protein. The binding capacity of the polystyrene wells was 100 ng of protein/well according to the manufacturer instructions. We found t"
https://openalex.org/W2099165590,"Abstract Single cysteine substitutions were introduced into three positions of otherwise cysteineless HtrI, a phototaxis transducer found in Halobacterium salinarum that transmits signals from the photoreceptor sensory rhodopsin I (SRI) to a cytoplasmic pathway controlling the cell’s motility. Oxidative cross-linking of the monocysteine HtrI mutants in membrane suspensions resulted in dimer forms evident in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The rate of cross-linking of I64C on the cytoplasmic side of HtrI was accelerated by SRI binding in the dark and further increased by SRI photoactivation. Several residue replacements of His-166 in SRI accelerated the cross-linking rate of I64C in the dark and His-166 mutants that exhibit “inverted signaling” (mediating repellent instead of the normally attractant response to orange light) inverted the light effect on the cross-linking rate of I64C. Secondary structure prediction of HtrI indicates a coiled coil structure in the cytoplasmic region following TM2, a dimerization domain found in a diverse group of proteins. We conclude that 1) HtrI exists as a dimer both in the absence of SRI and in the SRI-HtrI complex, 2) binding of SRI in the dark increases reactivity of the two cysteines at position 64 in the dimer by increasing their proximity or mobility, 3) light activation of wild-type SRI further increases their reactivity, 4) His-166 replacements in the SRI receptor have conformational effects on the structure of HtrI at position 64, and 5) inverted signaling by His-166 mutants likely results from an inverted conformational change at this region induced by SRI photoactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2050343136,"Here, we established the inhibitory mechanism of p53 on hepatitis B viral gene expression using HepG2 cells. Our results are as follows. First, p53 down-regulated the activities of all four promoters of hepatitis B virus (HBV), suggestive of the presence of a common element mediating the p53-dependent transcriptional repression. Second, employing the 5′-deletion constructs of the pregenomic/core promoter, the liver-specific enhancer II region was localized as a target for the p53-mediated transcriptional repression. Third, in a detailed analysis of the enhancer II region, the 5′-proximal 31-base pair region was defined as a p53-repressible element. Throughout the study, p53-mediated repression was rescued upon coexpression of the X-gene product, HBx. Finally, in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the defined p53-repressible element did not bind purified p53 directly, but shifted three bands in HepG2 nuclear extract, two of which was supershifted upon addition of p53 monoclonal antibody. These results display a novel mechanism of p53-dependent transcriptional repression in which p53 negatively regulates the viral-specific DNA enhancer through protein to protein interaction with an enhancer-binding protein. At the same time, the results indicate that p53 plays a defensive role against HBV by transcriptionally repressing the HBV core promoter through liver-specific enhancer II and HBx is required to counteract this inhibitory function of p53.

Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Upon infection of the virus, the viral genome is transcribed to generate a 3.6-kb pregenomic RNA used as a template for viral replication. The pregenomic/core promoter is responsible for the synthesis of 3.6-kb pregenomic RNA, and therefore the regulation of this promoter is important in the viral life cycle (1Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The 3.6-kb RNA also serves as a template for the synthesis of polymerase and nucleocapsid core protein. In addition to the 3.6-kb RNA, three more transcripts are generated from the HBV genome. The large surface antigen is synthesized from 2.4-kb RNA, and the major and middle antigens are synthesized from 2.1-kb transcripts. The X-gene product (HBx) is synthesized from the smallest 0.9-kb RNA (1Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The transcription of these RNAs are governed by the pre-S, surface, and X promoters, respectively. The activities of these promoters are under the control of enhancer I and II. Enhancer I is located upstream from the X promoter (2Shaul Y. Rutter W.J. Laub O. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Jameel S. Siddiqui A. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). When working as an activator, p53 binds directly to a specific DNA element. However, as a repressor, p53 works through protein to protein interaction. The mechanism of transcriptional repression by p53 was suggested to be through direct association with the TATA-binding protein complex (12Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell.

E1B of adenovirus, large T antigen of SV40, E6 of human papilloma virus, BZLF1 and EBNA-5 of Epstein-Barr virus, and HBx of HBV are examples of viral transactivator that directly bind to p53 to abolish the tumor suppressor function (11Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). In the HBV case, HBx to p53 interaction was suggested to be also responsible for the apoptosis observed upon expression of HBx (17Kim H.-T. Lee H.-S. Yun Y. J. Biol.

In the case of HBV, p53 interferes with the life cycle of HBV through down-regulation of the pregenomic/core promoter as reported by us (22Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol.

We report here a novel mechanism of p53-dependent transcriptional repression in which p53 inhibits hepatitis B viral gene expression by repressing the virus-specific enhancer, not the basal promoter, and HBx rescues viral gene expression. Our finding displays that the function of p53 extends to protection against viral infection by down-regulating the virus-specific DNA enhancer, which is tissue-specific and differentiation state-specific. The expression plasmids of wild type p53, pcDNA-p53, and of two p53 mutants, R273L and G154V, have been described previously (22Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol.

In these constructs, a 3.2-kb HindIII fragment containing whole HBV DNA was linked to the CAT gene such that the expression of the CAT gene was governed by the surface, pre-S, and X gene promoters, respectively. The parental pGEMCAT vector has been described previously (22Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol.

CEP-del1 and CEP-del2 were derived from digestion of CEP-CAT withSphI or AvaI, respectively, and subsequent self-ligation. CEP-del3 and CEP-del4 were generated by PCR and subsequent ligation to the SmaI and HindIII site of pGEMCAT. The 5′ PCR primers used were CCAAATATTGCCCAAGGTCTT for CEP-del3 and AAAGACTGTTTGTTTAAAGACT for CEP-del4. 3′ primer was GGCGAAGCTTGGCAGACCAA for both CEP-del3 and CEP-del4. The underlined sequence represents the additional HindIII site introduced for subcloning. All deletion series have the same 3′ sequence as depicted in Fig. 2 A. pInr-CAT was kindly provided by Dr. Laimins (13Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). EN2-InrCAT was generated by subcloning the PCR product of enhancer II core to the SalI andNsiI site in the multi-cloning site of pInr-CAT. The primers used were TGCAGTCGACATTGCCCAAGGTCTTAC for 5′ and TGCATGCATCCCCAACTCCTCCTCCC for 3′. The underlined sequence represents an additional SalI or NsiI site introduced for the convenience of subcloning. EN2-A, EN2-B, and EN2-C were generated by subcloning the annealed oligonucleotides to the multi-cloning site of pInr-CAT at the XbaI andNsiI site. The sequences of the corresponding oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 4, except that either side of the synthetic oligonucleotides have an XbaI and NsiI hanger for the convenience of subcloning.Figure 4Fine mapping of the element mediating p53-dependent transcriptional repression in liver-specific enhancer II.

The oligonucleotides containing ENII-A, -B, or -C were synthesized and subcloned to pInr-CAT as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, HepG2 cells were transfected with 5 μg each of reporter plasmid along with 2 μg of pcDNA-p53 ± 10 μg of pcDNA-X. As a control for the effect of HBx, transfection of HBx expression plasmid only was included.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transfection and CAT assays were performed as described (22Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The liver cell line HepG2 cells were used throughout this study. Where indicated, non-liver cell lines 293 and C33A were also employed. Probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Three ng of labeled oligonucleotides were used for each reaction. The total 40 μl of reaction mixture consists of 8 μl of 5× electrophoresis mobility shift assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 125 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2), 2 μl of 40 mmspermidine, 2 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 μl of 60 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 4 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Sixty ng of purified p53 or 10 μg of HepG2 nuclear extract was employed for each reaction, and 0.1 μg of monoclonal antibodies was included when necessary. Anti-p53 monoclonal antibody Do-1 and pAb1801 and polyclonal anti-TBP antibody (SI-1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. When necessary, 104-fold cold oligonucleotides were employed as competitor. The sequences of competitor oligonucleotides were as follows: E2F, 5′-ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAA-3′; Sis-inducible element, 5′-GTGCATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTCTACA-3′; acute phase response element, 5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′. All the reaction mixtures were incubated for 45 min at room temperature and were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE as a running buffer. Human p53 baculovirus was a kind gift of Dr. Y. C. Sung. The purification was after Bargonetti et al. (20Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1083-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The preparation of HepG2 nuclear extract was basically after Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebobitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). In the previous paper (22Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we reported that tumor suppressor p53 negatively regulates the HBV life cycle through down-regulation of the 3.6-kb pregenomic/core RNA. In addition to the down-regulation of 3.6-kb RNA, we have also observed that the levels of other HBV transcripts are repressed by p53, which led us to test whether other HBV promoters are also influenced by p53. CpCAT, SpCAT, XpCAT, and S(1)pCAT, each containing a 3.2-kb full context of the viral genome in the configuration that the CAT genes are under the control of pregenomic/core, surface, pre-S, or X promoters, respectively, were employed as reporters (Fig. 1). In the transient transfection assay in HepG2 cells, the activities of all four promoters were down-regulated by the cotransfection of pcDNA-p53. The observed p53-mediated down-regulation of HBV promoters was the specific nature of wild type p53 insomuch as two p53 mutants, R273L and G154V, were found to be deficient in this activity. In addition, the coexpression of HBx resulted in the full or partial rescue of the CAT activity depending on the promoter used. The p53-mediated inhibition of CpCAT was fully rescued upon cotransfection of 5 μg of pcDNA-X, whereas the activities of SpCAT, XpCAT, and S(1)pCAT were rescued partially (Fig. 1). The HBx-mediated rescue was specific on the p53-mediated transcriptional repression, as the expression of HBx did not elevate but rather reduced the activity of all 4 promoters (Fig.1). These results suggest the possibility that the effect of p53 was mediated through a common element in the HBV genome. To identify the p53-responsive element in the HBV genome, we employed five 5′-deletion series of core promoter-CAT constructs shown in Fig.2 A. These deletion constructs were designed mainly to test the effects of liver-specific enhancers I and II, inasmuch as these two enhancers in combination are responsible for the liver-specific expression of HBV genes (6Su H. Yee J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4281-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation pattern of CEP-CAT, CEP-del1, CEP-del2, and CEP-del3 in HepG2 cells was basically identical in that the CAT activity was repressed by p53 and was rescued by the coexpression of HBx. Further deletion of enhancer II in CEP-del4 resulted in the complete loss of the effects of p53 and HBx expression in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that the liver-specific enhancer II region contains the target site for p53-mediated transcriptional repression. Next, to confirm that the enhancer II region is responsible for the p53-mediated transcriptional repression, we transferred enhancer II to the heterologous promoter, pInr-CAT (13Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and obtained ENII-Inr-CAT (Fig. 3 A). As reported by Macket al. (13Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), pInr-CAT was insensitive to p53 in HepG2 cells, whereas the activity of ENII-Inr-CAT was repressed by p53 and was recovered by the coexpression of HBx (Fig. 3 B). To further confirm that liver-specific enhancer II is the target for the p53-mediated repression, we employed non-liver cell lines 293 and C33A (Fig. 3 C). The activity of ENII-Inr-CAT was not repressed at all by p53 in these non-liver cells, indicating that the basal activity of the Inr promoter is insensitive to p53 and that the observed p53-mediated repression of enhancer II activity in HepG2 cells is a liver-specific phenomena. Again, the expression of HBx only did not elevate the activity of the reporter. From these results, we conclude that the liver-specific enhancer II is the target site for p53 to inhibit viral gene expression. For detailed mapping of the element mediating p53-dependent transcriptional repression, an 81-base pair enhancer II core sequence was divided into three domains and oligonucleotides were synthesized with a five-base pair overlap (Fig.4 A). The synthetic oligonucleotides were inserted into pInr-CAT, and ENII-A, -B, and -C were generated. In transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells, the CAT activity of ENII-A was repressed upon expression of p53 and rescued by the coexpression of HBx, whereas ENII-B and -C were insensitive to p53 (Fig. 4 B). Again, the coexpression of HBx did not elevate the reporter activities, indicating that the rescue by HBx is specific to p53-mediated repression. Therefore, the 31-base pair ENII-A region, corresponding to nucleotide positions 1637–1667, was defined as a p53-repressible element. Previously, this region was reported to be protected in footprinting experiments with liver nuclear extracts (7Wang Y. Chen P. Wu X. Sun A.-L. Wang H. Zhu Y.-A. Li Z.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lopez-Cabrera M. Letovsky J. Hu K.-Q. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the sequence of ENII-A shows no homology to the previously reported p53-responsive element (27El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogestein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar), we were interested in whether p53 binds directly to the element or not. As a first step, we tested whether p53 binds directly to the ENII-A sequence by electrophoresis mobility shift assay using purified p53 from the baculovirus expression system (Fig.5 A). The purified p53 readily shifted the previously characterized p53-binding sequence, RGC-W (28Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P.N. Prives C. Vogestein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) (5′-TCGAGTTGCCTGGACTTGCCTGGCCTTGCCTTTTC-3′), and the band was supershifted by the addition of p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 or pAb1801. However, no shifted band was observed with ENII-A as a probe, eliminating the possibility that p53 directly binds to this element (Fig. 5 A). As a second step, we tested the possibility that p53 associates with an enhancer binding protein through protein to protein interaction. Employing HepG2 nuclear extract and ENII-A as a probe, we observed three shifted bands marked as A, B, and C (Fig. 5 B,lane 2) and specifically competed (Fig. 5 B,lanes 6–11). Upon addition of the p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Fig. 5 B, lane 4), the intensity of band B and C was reduced and the newly appearing supershifted band (SS) was observed indicating that p53 is present in complexes B and C. No or weak supershifted band was detected with pAb1801 perhaps because the pAb1801-binding site is shielded when p53 is complexed to an enhancer-binding protein. Addition of anti-TBP antibody used as a control did not cause any alteration of the gel shift pattern (Fig. 5 B, lane 3). These results indicate that p53 is a part of the complex formed on an ENII-A and negatively regulates HBV gene expression via protein to protein interaction with one of the ENII-A binding proteins. Previously, we have shown that p53 negatively regulates HBV replication through down-regulation of the pregenomic/core promoter, and that HBx is required to counteract this p53-mediated inhibition (22Lee H. Lee Y.-H. Huh Y.-S. Moon H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31405-31412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this report, we have localized the liver-specific enhancer II region as the target for the p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the pregenomic/core promoter. The enhancer II region is essential for the activities of all four promoters and is regarded as liver cell- and differentiation state-specific (5Yee J.-K. Science. 1989; 246: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Su H. Yee J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Wang Y. Chen P. Wu X. Sun A.-L. Wang H. Zhu Y.-A. Li Z.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4281-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the pregenomic/core promoter, the enhancer II region stimulates basic core promoter activity more than 100-fold and works in a position- and orientation-dependent manner, and therefore was previously referred to as the core upstream regulatory sequence (CURS) (9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EN-IIA region corresponds to “box α” within CURS, which was reported to be essential for full core promoter activity (9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as CURS was shown to be essential for the transcription of 3.6-kb pregenomic RNA and the production of 42-nm virions from transiently transfected hepatoma cells (9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the observed p53-mediated repression of CURS activity through ENII-A provides the mechanism for the antagonistic role of p53 against HBV infection or propagation. At the same time, the observation suggests that the p53-mediated inhibition of HBV replication probably operates under a physiological setting. As suggested by Lowe and Ruley (29Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), upon viral infection, the levels of p53 may rise, which represents the protection mechanism of p53 from the invading viruses. Upon initial infection or in the process of fluctuation of replication observed in chronic hepatitis patients, the ratio of p53 to HBx will determine the activity of ENII-A, which is important in viral replication and transcription. For the pre-S, surface, and X promoters, enhancer II operates in a position- and orientation-independent manner (5Yee J.-K. Science. 1989; 246: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Su H. Yee J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Wang Y.

Virol. 1990; 64: 4281-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, the EN-IIA region has also been shown to be essential for the activity of enhancer II (8Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4281-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though we tested only the deletion constructs of the core promoter to map the p53-repressible element, the observed down-regulation of the other three promoter activities by p53 and the fact that the employed promoter constructs all contain the full context of the HBV genome suggests that p53 probably down-regulates the other promoters of HBV through the same ENIIA element. Previous studies of HBV promoters have shown that each promoter possesses different characteristics: Cp, initiator/TATA-like; Sp, SV40-like; Xp, initiator-like; S(1)p, TATA-like (30Chen I.-H. Huang C.-J. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3647-3657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cattaneo R. Will H. Hernaandez N. Schaller H.

Considering these various characteristics of HBV promoters, it is not likely that p53 acts on each basal promoter element to mediate the common effect. Recently, Takada et al. (34Yaginuma K. Nakamura I. Takada S. Koike K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that p53 repressed the activity of the basal X-gene promoter. However, they employed constructs containing the basal promoter only and did not test the effect through enhancer II. Taken together, by acting on the EN-IIA sequence, p53 is expected to disrupt the activity of enhancer II as well as the activity of CURS, thereby leading to the repression of all four promoters and viral replication. The ENII-A region was reported to be protected in a footprinting experiment with Rat liver nuclear extract (26Lopez-Cabrera M. Letovsky J. Hu K.-Q. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or HepG2 nuclear extract (7Wang Y. Chen P. Wu X. Sun A.-L. Wang H. Zhu Y.-A. Li Z.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein has been proposed as a binding factor for this region (26Lopez-Cabrera M. Letovsky J. Hu K.-Q. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it is probably not the case since only a trace amount of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein is present in HepG2 cells and the sequence preference and heat sensitivity are different (10Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the reports to date, p53-dependent transcriptional repression was suggested to be mediated through the protein to protein interaction with basic transcription factors such as transcription factor IID and the CAAT box-binding factor (12Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A.

Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, the sequence of enhancer II-A, a p53-repressible element, has no homology to the “TATA” or “CAAT” box sequence. Furthermore, the anti-TBP antibody did not cause any alteration of the gel shifted bands formed on ENII-A, eliminating the possibility that p53 down-regulated enhancer II activity through interaction with these basal transcription factors. In addition, Ori et al. (35Ori A. Zauberman A. Doitsh G. Paran N. Oren M. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) recently reported the p53-mediated repression of HBV enhancer I through the mechanism different from our finding. In their study, p53 bound to a defined region in the enhancer I in a sequence-specific manner and, with the help of an adjacent enhancer element, acted as a transrepressor. As far as we know, the finding in this report provides the previously unidentified mechanism in that p53 represses the activity of a enhancer-binding factor through protein to protein interaction, not the activity of a general transcription factor like transcription factor IID or CCAAT-binding factor. Throughout the study, HBx antagonized the p53-mediated inhibition of transcriptional repression. In particular, the rescue of ENII-A activity reveals that HBx rescues viral gene expression and replication by acting on this element. Since HBx is not a DNA-binding protein, HBx may work by forming a complex with p53 (36Feitelson M.A. Zhu M. Duan L.-X. London W.T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wang X.W.

Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) to antagonize the negative effect of p53. Alternatively, HBx may regulate certain signal transduction pathways (40Benn J. Schneider R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 41Su F. Schneider R.T. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the posttranslational modifications of p53. Regardless of the mechanism, these results suggest that p53 acts as a defense mechanism against HBV propagation, and that HBx is required to counteract this inhibitory function of p53 for the survival of HBV. Dysregulation of p53 function by viral oncoproteins is indispensable in tumorigenesis (43Levine A. Virology. 1990; 177: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and one of the proposed mechanisms of HBV-induced tumorigenesis is the disruption of p53 function by HBx (39Ueda H. Ullirich S.J. Gangemi D. Kapel Cc. Aa. Ngo L. Feitelson M.A. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). From the viral point of view, transformation can be thought of as a by-product of this antagonistic relationship between HBx and p53.

https://openalex.org/W2070456887,"It is now recognized that protein kinase C (PKC) plays a critical role in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) promotion of HL-60 cell differentiation. In this study, the effects of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKCα, PKCβ, PKCβI, and PKCβII on HL-60 promyelocyte cell differentiation and proliferation were examined. Cellular differentiation was determined by nonspecific esterase activity, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and CD14 surface antigen expression. Differentiation promoted by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (20 nm for 48 h) was inhibited similarly in cells treated with PKCβ antisense (30 μm) 24 h prior to or at the same time as hormone treatment (86 ± 9% inhibition; n = 4versus 82 ± 8% inhibition; n = 4 (mean ± S.E.), respectively). In contrast, cells treated with PKCβ antisense 24 h after 1,25-(OH)2D3were unaffected and fully differentiated. PKCα antisense did not block 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of HL-60 cell differentiation. Next, the ability of PKCβI- and PKCβII-specific antisense oligonucleotides to block 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation was examined. PKCβII antisense (30 μm) completely blocked CD14 expression induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, whereas PKCβI antisense had little effect. Interestingly, PKCβII antisense blocked differentiation by 87 ± 7% (n = 2, mean ± S.D.) but had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3inhibition of cellular proliferation. These results indicate that the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cell differentiation and proliferation can be dissociated by blocking PKCβII expression. It is now recognized that protein kinase C (PKC) plays a critical role in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) promotion of HL-60 cell differentiation. In this study, the effects of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKCα, PKCβ, PKCβI, and PKCβII on HL-60 promyelocyte cell differentiation and proliferation were examined. Cellular differentiation was determined by nonspecific esterase activity, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and CD14 surface antigen expression. Differentiation promoted by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (20 nm for 48 h) was inhibited similarly in cells treated with PKCβ antisense (30 μm) 24 h prior to or at the same time as hormone treatment (86 ± 9% inhibition; n = 4versus 82 ± 8% inhibition; n = 4 (mean ± S.E.), respectively). In contrast, cells treated with PKCβ antisense 24 h after 1,25-(OH)2D3were unaffected and fully differentiated. PKCα antisense did not block 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of HL-60 cell differentiation. Next, the ability of PKCβI- and PKCβII-specific antisense oligonucleotides to block 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation was examined. PKCβII antisense (30 μm) completely blocked CD14 expression induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, whereas PKCβI antisense had little effect. Interestingly, PKCβII antisense blocked differentiation by 87 ± 7% (n = 2, mean ± S.D.) but had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3inhibition of cellular proliferation. These results indicate that the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cell differentiation and proliferation can be dissociated by blocking PKCβII expression. The hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; PKC, protein kinase C. 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; PKC, protein kinase C.regulates the growth and maturation of numerous organs and cell types. 1,25-(OH)2D3 is involved in the control of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, muscle function, immunity, endocrine secretions, and neurotransmission (1Walters M.R. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 719-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is accepted that, in part, this hormone alters cell function by enhancing or repressing expression of specific genes (2Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 321-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Haussler M.R. Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Bone ( N. Y. ). 1995; 17: 33S-38SCrossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Other studies have revealed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulates cellular processes without altering gene expression (4Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1982; 3: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that nongenomic effects of the hormone occur and result in the rapid alteration of cell membrane phospholipid metabolism and intracellular calcium concentrations (5Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wali R.K. Baum C.L. Sitrin M.D. Brasitus T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotes HL-60 cell differentiation is not fully understood, a number of studies from our laboratory and others have implicated protein kinase C (PKC) as a critical component of this process (7Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5570-5575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Obeid L.M. Okazaki T. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

PKC is a family of serine-threonine protein kinases, which play major roles in regulation of many cellular processes. To date, 11 PKC isoenzymes have been characterized and classified into three groups based on their structure and activation requirements (10Hug H. Sarre F.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 11Hoffmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The classical PKCs, PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ, require calcium for activation. A second class of PKCs has been termed the novel PKCs and consist of PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, and PKCθ (11Hoffmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These novel PKCs do not have a calcium binding motif, and therefore calcium is not required for activation. The third class of PKCs are called the atypical PKCs and include PKCλ, PKCμ, and PKCζ. These PKCs differ significantly in structure to the other PKCs. Furthermore, atypical PKCs do not respond to phorbol ester activation. The importance of PKC in 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of HL-60 cells along the monocyte/macrophage pathway is now appreciated. Our laboratory reported that 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases PKC levels in HL-60 cells (7Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5570-5575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that classical inhibitors of PKC, H-7 and staturosporine, block the ability of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to promote HL-60 cell differentiation (12Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Wendt M.D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19710-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using similar PKC inhibitors, PKC activation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 has been shown to be involved in skin, heart, skeletal muscle, and renal cell gene expression and function (14O'Connell, T. D., Giacherio, D. A., Jarvis, A. K., and Simpson, R. U. Endocrinology , 136, 482–488.Google Scholar, 15van Leeuwen J.P.T.M. Birkenhager J.C. van den Bemd G.-J. Buurman C.J. Staal A. Bos M.P.

Signalling. 1992; 4: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, such chemical inhibitors are of little use in determining isoenzyme specificity for a cellular transduction mechanism. Recent studies have used overexpression and antisense techniques to provide evidence that PKCβ is, to some extent, the isoenzyme involved in 1,25-(OH)2D3promotion of HL-60 cell differentiation (18Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gamard C.J. Blode G.C. Hannun Y.A Obeid L.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 405-409PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that increased PKCβII levels by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is required to promote HL-60 cell differentiation. Interestingly, PKCβII antisense had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibition of HL-60 cell proliferation. Our report shows that increases in PKCβII levels and activation are important events in 1,25-(OH)2D3promotion of cell differentiation. Moreover, we suggest that the events leading to cellular differentiation most likely require protein phosphorylation. 1,25-(OH)2D3 was purchased from Tetrionics Inc. (Madison, WI). Vitamin D3metabolite purity and structural integrity were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography and UV spectroscopy. All other reagents were reagent grade or better. HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.5 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells used in this study were from passages 21–45. All experiments were initiated with cells in log phase growth at 2 × 105cells/ml and then allowed to equilibrate in growth medium for 24 h prior to any treatment. Cellular differentiation was assessed by nonspecific esterase activity, nitro blue tetrazolium dye reduction, and CD14 surface antigen expression (7Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5570-5575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Pan Q.

Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Center at the University of Michigan. PKCβ antisense was designed to interact with bases +4 to +18 of the PKCβ mRNA. PKCβ sense had the complementary sequence of the same region. PKCβ oligonucleotides used were: PKCβ sense, 5′-GCT GAC CCG GCT GCG-3′; PKCβ antisense, 5′-CGC AGC CGG GTC AGC-3′. PKCα antisense was designed to interact with bases +6 to +20 of the PKCα mRNA. PKCα sense had the complementary sequence over the same region. PKCα oligonucleotides used were: PKCα sense, 5′-TCG GGG GGG ACC ATG-3′; PKCα antisense, 5′-CAT GGT CCC CCC CGA-3′. PKCβI and PKCβII specific antisenses were designed to interact with bases +1942 to +1956 that exist 3′ from the splice site. PKCβI sense and PKCβII sense had the complementary sequences to its respectful antisense pair. PKCβI antisense was: 5′-GTT TTA AGC ATT TCG-3′; PKCβII antisense was: 5′-GTT GGA GGT GTC TCT-3′. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline then resuspended in lysis buffer (0.2 m Tris, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm leupeptin, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Protein content of total cell homogenates was determined by the Bradford protein assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215458) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from each condition were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were subsequently transferred to Immobilon paper (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blot was blocked with buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (10 mm Tris, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). It was then probed for 2 h with primary antibodies (PKCβ, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCα antibodies; Life Technologies Inc.), then washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated for 1.5 h with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The blot was then washed five times with Tween-TBS (10 mm Tris and 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Finally, it was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. Cell number was determined using a Coulter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) model Zf cell counter. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue dye exclusion. Differences between 1,25-(OH)2D3 treated cells and untreated cells for all assays were evaluated by unpaired Student's ttest. HL-60 cells were treated with control (0.1% ethanol) or 20 nm1,25-(OH)2D3 and PKCβ sense or antisense for 48 h. PKCβ protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). Cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the presence of PKCβ sense oligonucleotide showed similar increases in PKCβ levels as compared with cells exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3 alone. Importantly, cells treated with PKCβ antisense (lane 4) exhibited a mark inhibition in 1,25-(OH)2D3induction of PKCβ levels. PKCβ levels were decreased by 81 ± 9% (mean ± S.E.) relative to sense or oligonucleotide free cultures. The antibody used to detect PKCβ in this experiment was not specific for the splice isoenzymes βI or βII. As seen in Fig. 1, untreated (control) cells routinely exhibited minimal levels of PKCβ. Furthermore, PKCβ levels remain unchanged in uninduced (control) cells even after 48 h of PKCβ antisense treatment (n = 13, lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 1). This observation is expected, because PKCβ has a half-life of greater than 70 h. Therefore, blocking translation with PKCβ antisense would not greatly influence existing levels of PKCβ. As shown in Fig.2, PKCβ levels were increased within 24 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Furthermore, PKCβ antisense significantly blocked 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of PKCβ levels at 24 and 48 h of hormone treatment. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the PKCβ antisense oligonucleotide is able to block the induction of PKCβ levels by 1,25-(OH)2D3.Figure 2Time course of PKCβ antisense treatment on 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increases of PKCβ protein levels. HL-60 cells were treated with 20 nm1,25-(OH)2D3 for 1, 6, 24, or 48 h in the presence of 30 μm PKCβ sense or PKCβ antisense. Inlane 1, cells were treated with vehicle (Control) for 48 h. Cells were harvested at each time point, and PKCβ levels were visualized by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HL-60 cells were treated with 20 nm1,25-(OH)2D3 alone (C) or with PKCα sense, PKCα antisense, PKCβ sense, or PKCβ antisense (30 μm amount of either oligonucleotide) for 48 h. PKCβ levels were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.3 A). PKCβ levels in cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 and PKCα sense, PKCα antisense, or PKCβ sense were not significantly different from cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 alone. As expected, PKCβ antisense was able to inhibit the induction of PKCβ by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (lane 5). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 B, PKCα antisense was able to specifically block 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhancement of PKCα levels. Importantly, PKCβ antisense had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of PKCα levels. These results demonstrate that PKCβ antisense has specificity in blocking 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increases of PKCβ. Western blot analysis of PKCβI and PKCβII splice isoenzymes was performed using specific antibodies. PKCβII protein levels were detectable using these specific antibodies, whereas PKCβI levels were not detectible. This observation in HL-60 cells is similar to ones reported previously (20Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tonetti D.A. Horio M. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 739-745PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the PKCα antisense oligonucleotide at concentrations up to 60 μm had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation (data not shown). HL-60 cells were treated with 20 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 and either 30 μm PKCβ sense or 1, 10, or 30 μm PKCβ antisense for 48 h. PKCβ levels were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 A, a dose-dependent decrease in PKCβ levels was observed with increasing concentrations of PKCβ antisense. In this experiment an 85% decrease, as determined by scanning densitometry, in PKCβ levels was observed with 30 μmPKCβ antisense. Next, the effects of antisense constructs on HL-60 cell differentiation and the importance of the time of PKCβ antisense addition, relative to 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, were also examined. HL-60 cells were treated with PKCβ sense or PKCβ antisense 24 h prior to (open symbols) or at the same time (closed symbols) as 20 nm1,25-(OH)2D3. Cell differentiation was determined by nitro blue tetrazolium dye reduction (circles) and nonspecific esterase activity (squares) (Fig.4 B). HL-60 cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the absence of oligonucleotide treatment were induced to differentiate to the same extent as cells pretreated or co-treated with PKCβ sense (data not shown). Differentiation promoted by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was inhibited by 86 ± 9% in cells pretreated with PKCβ antisense (30 μm) and 82 ± 8% in cells co-treated with PKCβ antisense (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, it is likely that the action of the antisense construct is not to lower existing PKCβ levels but to block 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increases in PKCβ synthesis. However, if cells were first treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h prior to PKCβ antisense, antisense treatment was ineffective in blocking 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation (hatched circles and squares; Fig.4 B). This observation suggests that 1,25-(OH)2D3 has induced sufficient de novo synthesis of PKCβ within 24 h to render the antisense PKCβ construct impotent. Thus, these experiments reveal that a relevant and required action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in promoting HL-60 cell differentiation is to up-regulate PKCβ levels by increasing the synthesis of the enzyme. HL-60 cells were treated with vehicle, 20 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3, or 20 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 and PKCβ sense, PKCβ antisense, PKCβI sense, PKCβI antisense, PKCβII sense, or PKCβII antisense (30 μm) for 72 h, and cell differentiation was determined by CD14 surface antigen expression using flow cytometry (Fig. 5). CD14 is a cell surface marker of mature monocytes/macrophages. Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 significantly increased cell differentiation as shown by the substantial increase in CD14 expression (Fig. 5 A). PKCβ sense did not affect 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced expression of CD14, whereas PKCβ antisense completely blocked the ability of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to increase CD14 expression. This is consistent with all previous observations and again demonstrates that PKCβ is essential for 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. In Fig. 5, C and D, the potency of antisense constructs designed to hybridize specifically with PKCβI and PKCβII was examined. A complete block of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced CD14 expression was observed with the PKCβII-specific antisense oligonucleotide (Fig.5 C). In contrast, PKCβI-specific antisense failed to reverse the enhanced expression of CD14 by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 5 D). Interestingly, PKCβII antisense did not block 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibition of HL-60 cell proliferation (Fig. 6). Thus, these data show that blocking 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated increase in PKCβII decreased the induction of cell differentiation by 80% but had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3inhibition of cell proliferation. Similar results were obtained with the less specific PKCβ antisense construct (data not shown). 1,25-(OH)2D3 affects the growth and differentiation of numerous cell types (22Hosomi J. Hosoi J. Abe E.

Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) upon exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Expression of several genes including c-myc, c-fos, and PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ are regulated prior to the appearance of the mature monocytic-macrophage phenotype (7Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5570-5575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Obeid L.M. Okazaki T. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Considering the nature of these early events and the accepted importance of these gene products in cell signaling and growth, it is likely that regulation of these genes is critical for induced HL-60 cell differentiation. Recent reports revealed that the 1,25-(OH)2D3receptor (vitamin D receptor) is a substrate for PKCβ and that phosphorylation of vitamin D receptor is important for controlling osteocalcin expression (3Haussler M.R. Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Bone ( N. Y. ). 1995; 17: 33S-38SCrossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Desai R.K. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5685-5693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such studies support and extend the possible roles PKCs have in modulating 1,25-(OH)2D3's actions. Transcriptional response elements for 1,25-(OH)2D3 have also been identified. Interestingly, the response element for 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the osteocalcin gene contains a phorbol ester response element (31Bortell R. Owens T.A. Bidwell J.P. Gavazzo P. Breen E. van Wijnen A.J.

One factor that interacts with this AP-1 sequence is a heterodimer made up of c-fos and c-jun. PKC-directed phosphorylation of c-fos andc-jun regulates their AP-1 binding activity (33Bohmann D. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular nature of the interaction between the 1,25-(OH)2D3 signal transduction pathway and PKC for regulation of gene expression is still not clear. Several nuclear proteins have been shown to be phosphorylated by PKC during the course of myeloid cell differentiation (34Martell R.E. Strahler J.R. Simpson R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7511-7518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory reported that 10 nuclear proteins undergo phosphorylation state changes within 6–40 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment (34Martell R.E. Strahler J.R. Simpson R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7511-7518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified several of these proteins as nuclear matrix or DNA packaging proteins, including several histones and lamin B. Therefore, PKCs act as regulators of nuclear events and may be intimately involved in the transduction of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 signal ultimately regulating gene expression and HL-60 cell differentiation. Increasing evidence exists to indicate that PKCβ plays an important role in 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of HL-60 cell differentiation. A variant HL-60 cell line (HL-525) lacking basal levels of PKCβ is resistant to phorbol ester-induced differentiation (18Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, susceptibility to phorbol ester differentiation was restored if HL-525 cells were transfected to overexpress PKCβ. Additionally, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resistance of HL-525 cells was reversed by pretreating with 1,25-(OH)2D3, which increased PKCβ levels (18Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it was shown that a 25-mer PKCβ antisense construct different from the one used here was capable of partially blocking (averaging ≈30%) 1,25-(OH)2D3‘s induction of cell differentiation (19Gamard C.J.

Although a partial inhibition of 1,25-(OH)2D3-promoted cell differentiation was observed using their antisense construct, it had little effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibition of cell proliferation. In our study, novel 15-mer PKCβ and PKCβII antisense constructs were found to inhibit 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation by 80–90%. However, these antisense oligonucleotides had no effect on 1,25-(OH)2D3‘s ability to inhibit cell proliferation. Moreover, reduction of basal levels of PKCβ was not required for PKCβ antisense to inhibit 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation. This result suggests that blocking de novo synthesis of PKCβ is the mechanism of action for the antisense construct. We demonstrated that PKCβII is uniquely responsible for 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation. There is controversy as to whether PKCβI is expressed in HL-60 cells. In all reports, PKCβI levels in unstimulated HL-60 cells is significantly lower than PKCβII levels (19Gamard C.J. Blode G.C. Hannun Y.A Obeid L.M.

In this study, we failed to detect measurable levels of PKCβI. This finding is in agreement with several reports (20Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tonetti D.A. Horio M. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 739-745PubMed Google Scholar). However, others have shown, using different antibodies or Northern blot analysis, that 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased PKCβI protein levels or mRNA levels (19Gamard C.J. Blode G.C. Hannun Y.A Obeid L.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 405-409PubMed Google Scholar, 35Devalia D. Thomas S.B. Roberts P.J. Jones H.M. Linch D.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings reported here indicate that PKCβII specifically participates in the signal transduction mechanisms employed by 1,25-(OH)2D3 to promote HL-60 cell differentiation. Interestingly, we found a direct correlation between the quantitative lowering of PKCβII protein levels and the degree of induced differentiation. The correlation between the increased levels of PKCβ induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the extent of cellular differentiation (7Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5570-5575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Obeid L.M. Okazaki T. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that there are not spare PKCβs in these cells. Thus, we suggest that the levels of PKCβ are stoichometrically related to promotion of differentiation. This study provides clear and convincing evidence that promotion of cell differentiation and inhibition of cell proliferation are two distinct processes by 1,25-(OH)2D3 that can be disassociated by blocking the expression of a single gene, PKCβII. To date, several analogs of 1,25-(OH)2D3 have been developed that are selective at affecting calcium mobilization and promoting terminal cellular differentiation. Our study suggests that it may be possible to further separate the actions of 1,25-(OH)2D3 into its capacity to promote cellular differentiation versus its capacity to inhibit cell proliferation.
