https://openalex.org/W2763693150,"Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a cation channel located within endosomal and lysosomal membranes. Ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, its loss-of-function mutations are the direct cause of type IV mucolipidosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. Here we present the single-particle electron cryo-microscopy structure of the mouse TRPML1 channel embedded in nanodiscs. Combined with mutagenesis analysis, the TRPML1 structure reveals that phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) binds to the N terminus of the channel-distal from the pore-and the helix-turn-helix extension between segments S2 and S3 probably couples ligand binding to pore opening. The tightly packed selectivity filter contains multiple ion-binding sites, and the conserved acidic residues form the luminal Ca2+-blocking site that confers luminal pH and Ca2+ modulation on channel conductance. A luminal linker domain forms a fenestrated canopy atop the channel, providing several luminal ion passages to the pore and creating a negative electrostatic trap, with a preference for divalent cations, at the luminal entrance. The structure also reveals two equally distributed S4-S5 linker conformations in the closed channel, suggesting an S4-S5 linker-mediated PtdInsP2 gating mechanism among TRPML channels."

Here we report that cultures of expanded potential stem cells can be established from individual eight-cell blastomeres, and by direct conversion of mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Remarkably, a single expanded potential stem cell can contribute both to the embryo proper and to the trophectoderm lineages in a chimaera assay. Bona fide trophoblast stem cell lines and extra-embryonic endoderm stem cells can be directly derived from expanded potential stem cells in vitro. Molecular analyses of the epigenome and single-cell transcriptome reveal enrichment for blastomere-specific signature and a dynamic DNA methylome in expanded potential stem cells. The generation of mouse expanded potential stem cells highlights the feasibility of establishing expanded potential stem cells for other mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2762613271,"Chromatin-remodelling factors change nucleosome positioning and facilitate DNA transcription, replication, and repair. The conserved remodelling factor chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 1(Chd1) can shift nucleosomes and induce regular nucleosome spacing. Chd1 is required for the passage of RNA polymerase IIthrough nucleosomes and for cellular pluripotency. Chd1 contains the DNA-binding domains SANT and SLIDE, a bilobal motor domain that hydrolyses ATP, and a regulatory double chromodomain. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Chd1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to a nucleosome at a resolution of 4.8 Å. Chd1 detaches two turns of DNA from the histone octamer and binds between the two DNA gyres in a state poised for catalysis. The SANT and SLIDE domains contact detached DNA around superhelical location (SHL) -7 of the first DNA gyre. The ATPase motor binds the second DNA gyre at SHL +2 and is anchored to the N-terminal tail of histone H4, as seen in a recent nucleosome-Snf2 ATPase structure. Comparisons with published results reveal that the double chromodomain swings towards nucleosomal DNA at SHL +1, resulting in ATPase closure. The ATPase can then promote translocation of DNA towards the nucleosome dyad, thereby loosening the first DNA gyre and remodelling the nucleosome. Translocation may involve ratcheting of the two lobes of the ATPase, which is trapped in a pre- or post-translocation state in the absence or presence, respectively, of transition state-mimicking compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2762576593,"In several organ systems, the transitional zone between different types of epithelium is a hotspot for pre-neoplastic metaplasia and malignancy, but the cells of origin for these metaplastic epithelia and subsequent malignancies remain unknown. In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63+KRT5+KRT7+) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63+KRT5+KRT7+ basal cells in this zone are the cells of origin for multi-layered epithelium and Barrett's oesophagus."
https://openalex.org/W2761082930,"Genetic variants have been associated with myriad molecular phenotypes that provide new insight into the range of mechanisms underlying genetic traits and diseases. Identifying any particular genetic variant's cascade of effects, from molecule to individual, requires assaying multiple layers of molecular complexity. We introduce the Enhancing GTEx (eGTEx) project that extends the GTEx project to combine gene expression with additional intermediate molecular measurements on the same tissues to provide a resource for studying how genetic differences cascade through molecular phenotypes to impact human health."
https://openalex.org/W2762557409,"Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility."
https://openalex.org/W2761989433,"Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a Ca2+-releasing cation channel that mediates the calcium signalling and homeostasis of lysosomes. Mutations in TRPML1 lead to mucolipidosis type IV, a severe lysosomal storage disorder. Here we report two electron cryo-microscopy structures of full-length human TRPML1: a 3.72-Å apo structure at pH 7.0 in the closed state, and a 3.49-Å agonist-bound structure at pH 6.0 in an open state. Several aromatic and hydrophobic residues in pore helix 1, helices S5 and S6, and helix S6 of a neighbouring subunit, form a hydrophobic cavity to house the agonist, suggesting a distinct agonist-binding site from that found in TRPV1, a TRP channel from a different subfamily. The opening of TRPML1 is associated with distinct dilations of its lower gate together with a slight structural movement of pore helix 1. Our work reveals the regulatory mechanism of TRPML channels, facilitates better understanding of TRP channel activation, and provides insights into the molecular basis of mucolipidosis type IV pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2763176899,"The modulation of ion channel activity by lipids is increasingly recognized as a fundamental component of cellular signalling. The transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPML) channel family belongs to the TRP superfamily and is composed of three members: TRPML1-TRPML3. TRPMLs are the major Ca2+-permeable channels on late endosomes and lysosomes (LEL). They regulate the release of Ca2+ from organelles, which is important for various physiological processes, including organelle trafficking and fusion. Loss-of-function mutations in the MCOLN1 gene, which encodes TRPML1, cause the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV, and a gain-of-function mutation (Ala419Pro) in TRPML3 gives rise to the varitint-waddler (Va) mouse phenotype. Notably, TRPML channels are activated by the low-abundance and LEL-enriched signalling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), whereas other phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is enriched in plasma membranes, inhibit TRPMLs. Conserved basic residues at the N terminus of the channel are important for activation by PtdIns(3,5)P2 and inhibition by PtdIns(4,5)P2. However, owing to a lack of structural information, the mechanism by which TRPML channels recognize PtdIns(3,5)P2 and increase their Ca2+ conductance remains unclear. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a full-length TRPML3 channel from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å. Our structure reveals not only the molecular basis of ion conduction but also the unique architecture of TRPMLs, wherein the voltage sensor-like domain is linked to the pore via a cytosolic domain that we term the mucolipin domain. Combined with functional studies, these data suggest that the mucolipin domain is responsible for PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding and subsequent channel activation, and that it acts as a 'gating pulley' for lipid-dependent TRPML gating."

https://openalex.org/W2761580117,"Probiotics have been proposed as alternatives to pharmacological products in several medical conditions including the modulation of obesity, which is frequently associated with poor semen quality. However, effects of probiotics on male fertility have been less investigated. This study assessed the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus PB01 (DSM-14870) on sperm kinematic parameters in Normal-weight (NW) and diet-induced obese (DIO) models. NW and DIO C57BL/6NTac mice were divided into two subgroups with or without a single daily dose (1x109CFU) of L. rhamnosus for four weeks. Sperm motility and kinematics together with blood lipid profiles and reproductive hormone levels were assessed using the sperm class analyzer system. Probiotic supplementation increased serum testosterone, LH and FSH levels in both NW and DIO groups resulting in significantly (P<0.05) higher velocity (VSL, VCL and VAP) and percentages of progressively motile sperm and significantly lower percentages of immotile sperm. Other kinematic parameters (Lin, STR, ALH and BCF) were also increased in both probiotic supplemented DIO and NW groups at the 10% level of significance. Probiotic supplemented DIO mice demonstrated significantly higher percentages of progressively motile sperm versus DIO controls. This study demonstrated the potential of L. rhamnosus PB01 as a regulatory agent with positive effects on weight loss and reproductive-hormones, significantly improving sperm motility and kinematic parameters in male DIO models."
https://openalex.org/W2762183921,"Previous studies confirmed that dietary supplements of fish oil and krill oil can alleviate obesity in mice, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to discern whether oil treatment change the structure of the gut microbiota during the obesity alleviation. The ICR mice received high-fat diet (HFD) continuously for 12 weeks after two weeks of acclimatization with a standard chow diet, and the mice fed with a standard chow diet were used as the control. In the groups that received HFD with oil supplementation, the weight gains were attenuated and the liver index, total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced stepwise compared with the HFD group, and the overall structure of the gut microbiota, which was modulated in the HFD group, was shifted toward the structure found in the control group. Moreover, eighty-two altered operational taxonomic units responsive to oil treatment were identified and nineteen of them differing in one or more parameters associated with obesity. In conclusion, this study confirmed the effect of oil treatment on obesity alleviation, as well as on the microbiota structure alterations. We proposed that further researches are needed to elucidate the causal relationship between obesity alleviation and gut microbiota modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2762966603,"1,25(OH)2D3 (vitamin D) appears essential for the normal development of dopaminergic neurons. Vitamin D affects dopamine synthesis and metabolism as well as expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which is crucial for the survival of dopaminergic neurons. We investigated the role of vitamin D on GDNF and its receptors protooncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (C-Ret) and GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (GFRα1) signaling. To this end, we used a developmental vitamin D-deficient rat model and SH-SY5Y cells transfected with vitamin D receptor (VDR). The absence of vitamin D ligand in gestation reduces C-Ret expression, but not GDNF and GFRα1, in embryo forebrains. Overexpression of VDR in SH-SY5Y in the absence of ligand (mimicking in vivo developmental vitamin D deficiency) also suppressed C-Ret mRNA levels. In the presence of vitamin D, C-Ret mRNA and protein expression were increased. The chromatin immunoprecipitation results suggested that C-Ret is directly regulated by vitamin D via VDR. GDNF was also increased by vitamin D in these cells. Our small interfering RNA studies showed that knocking down VDR leads to an increase in C-Ret in the absence of ligand. Finally, we confirmed the inverse relationship between GFRα1 and C-Ret, as knocking down C-Ret led to increases in GFRα1 expression. These data extend our knowledge of the diverse and important roles played by vitamin D in dopamine physiology.-Pertile, R. A. N., Cui, X., Hammond, L., Eyles, D. W.

https://openalex.org/W2761177952,"Recurrent pregnancy loss is a frequently occurring human infertility-related disease affecting ~1% of women. It has been estimated that the cause remains unexplained in >50% cases which strongly suggests that genetic factors may contribute towards the phenotype. Concerning its molecular aetiology numerous studies have had limited success in identifying the disease's genetic causes. This might have been due to the fact that hundreds of genes are involved in each physiological step necessary for guaranteeing reproductive success in mammals. In such scenario, next generation sequencing provides a potentially interesting tool for research into recurrent pregnancy loss causative mutations. The present study involved whole-exome sequencing and an innovative bioinformatics analysis, for the first time, in 49 unrelated women affected by recurrent pregnancy loss. We identified 27 coding variants (22 genes) potentially related to the phenotype (41% of patients). The affected genes, which were enriched by potentially deleterious sequence variants, belonged to distinct molecular cascades playing key roles in implantation/pregnancy biology. Using a quantum chemical approach method we established that mutations in MMP-10 and FGA proteins led to substantial energetic modifications suggesting an impact on their functions and/or stability. The next generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches presented here represent an efficient way to find mutations, having potentially moderate/strong functional effects, associated with recurrent pregnancy loss aetiology. We consider that some of these variants (and genes) represent probable future biomarkers for recurrent pregnancy loss."
https://openalex.org/W2760979956,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 play critical roles in intestinal inflammation caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) infection, but the role of TLR2/TLR4 in regulation of proinflammatory cytokines remains unknown. In this study, through microarray analysis and qRT-PCR, we showed that TLR2/TLR4 are involved in the F. nucleatum-induced inflammatory signaling pathway in Caco-2 cells, C57BL/6 mice and human clinical specimens. In TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- mice, F. nucleatum infection resulted in increased colonization of the bacteria and production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α. In addition, the ratio of Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells in the total CD4+ T cells in TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- mice was less than that in wild-type mice, and the ratio in hybrid mice was more than that in knockout mice, which suggested that TLR2/TLR4 mediated the number of Tregs. Furthermore, it was observed that inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced in TLR2-/- mice after Treg transfer. Thus, these data indicate that TLR2/TLR4 regulate F. nucleatum-induced inflammatory cytokines through Tregs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2726944738,"Peer review is the gold standard for scientific communication, but its ability to guarantee the quality of published research remains difficult to verify. Recent modeling studies suggest that peer review is sensitive to reviewer misbehavior, and it has been claimed that referees who sabotage work they perceive as competition may severely undermine the quality of publications. Here we examine which aspects of suboptimal reviewing practices most strongly impact quality, and test different mitigating strategies that editors may employ to counter them. We find that the biggest hazard to the quality of published literature is not selfish rejection of high-quality manuscripts but indifferent acceptance of low-quality ones. Bypassing or blacklisting bad reviewers and consulting additional reviewers to settle disagreements can reduce but not eliminate the impact. The other editorial strategies we tested do not significantly improve quality, but pairing manuscripts to reviewers unlikely to selfishly reject them and allowing revision of rejected manuscripts minimize rejection of above-average manuscripts. In its current form, peer review offers few incentives for impartial reviewing efforts. Editors can help, but structural changes are more likely to have a stronger impact."
https://openalex.org/W2763713577,"Goat’s milk, considered a substitute for cow’s milk, has a high nutritional value. However, goat’s milk contains various allergens, predominantly β-lactoglobulin (BLG). In this study, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the BLG locus in goat fibroblasts for sgRNA optimization and generate BLG knock-out goats through co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into goat embryos at the one-cell stage. We firstly tested sgRNA editing efficiencies in goat fibroblast cells, and approximately 8.00%–9.09% of the cells were modified in single sgRNA-guided targeting experiment. Among the kids, the genome-targeting efficiencies of single sgRNA were 12.5% (10 ng/μL sg1) and 0% (10 ng/μL sg2) and efficiencies of dual sgRNAs were 25.0% (25 ng/μL sg2+sg3 group) and 28.6% (50 ng/μL sg2+sg3 group). Relative expression of BLG in BLG knock-out goat mammary glands significantly (p < 0.01) decreased as well as other milk protein coding genes, such as CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2, CSN3 and LALBA (p < 0.05). As expected, BLG protein had been abolished in the milk of the BLG knock-out goat. In addition, most of the targeted kids were chimeric (3/4), and their various body tissues were edited simultaneously. Our study thus provides a basis for optimizing the quality of goat milk, which can be applied to biomedical and agricultural research."
https://openalex.org/W2760982891,"Falls in hospitals are common, therefore strategies to minimize the impact of these events in older patients and needs to be examined. In this pilot study, we investigate a movement monitoring sensor system for identifying bed and chair exits using a wireless wearable sensor worn by hospitalized older patients. We developed a movement monitoring sensor system that recognizes bed and chair exits. The system consists of a machine learning based activity classifier and a bed and chair exit recognition process based on an activity score function. Twenty-six patients, aged 71 to 93 years old, hospitalized in the Geriatric Evaluation and Management Unit participated in the supervised trials. They wore over their attire a battery-less, lightweight and wireless sensor and performed scripted activities such as getting off the bed and chair. We investigated the system performance in recognizing bed and chair exits in hospital rooms where RFID antennas and readers were in place. The system's acceptability was measured using two surveys with 0-10 likert scales. The first survey measured the change in user perception of the system before and after a trial; the second survey, conducted only at the end of each trial, measured user acceptance of the system based on a multifactor sensor acceptance model. The performance of the system indicated an overall recall of 81.4%, precision of 66.8% and F-score of 72.4% for joint bed and chair exit recognition. Patients demonstrated improved perception of the system after use with overall score change from 7.8 to 9.0 and high acceptance of the system with score ≥ 6.7 for all acceptance factors. The present pilot study suggests the use of wireless wearable sensors is feasible for detecting bed and chair exits in a hospital environment."
https://openalex.org/W2761455078,"Performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, designed to simultaneously detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and rifampin (RIF) resistance, has been well documented in low-resource settings with high TB-incidence. However, few studies have assessed its accuracy in low TB incidence settings. We evaluated the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF using clinical sputum specimens routinely collected from suspect pulmonary TB patients over a 4-year time period in San Diego County, California. Xpert MTB/RIF results were compared to acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Of 751 sputum specimens, 134 (17.8%) were MTBC culture-positive and 2 (1.5%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR). For the detection of MTBC, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 89.6% (97.7% and 74.5% in smear-positive and -negative sputa, respectively) and specificity was 97.2%; while AFB smear sensitivity and specificity were 64.9% and 77.8%, respectively. Xpert MTB/RIF detected 35 of 47 smear-negative culture-positive specimens, and excluded 124 of 137 smear-positive culture-negative specimens. Xpert MTB/RIF also correctly excluded 99.2% (121/122) of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) specimens, including all 33 NTM false-positives by smear microscopy. For the detection of RIF resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 98.3%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that Xpert MTB/RIF is able to accurately detect MTBC and RIF resistance in routinely collected respiratory specimens in a low TB-incidence setting, with comparable performance to that achieved in high-incidence settings; and suggest that under these conditions the assay has particular utility in detecting smear-negative TB cases, excluding smear-positive patients without MTBC disease, and differentiating MTBC from NTM."
https://openalex.org/W2761540124,"Genetic P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) variation affects restenosis-risk in patients. PCAF has lysine acetyltransferase activity and promotes nuclear factor kappa-beta (NFκB)-mediated inflammation, which drives post-interventional intimal hyperplasia development. We studied the contributing role of PCAF in post-interventional intimal hyperplasia.PCAF contribution to inflammation and intimal hyperplasia was assessed in leukocytes, macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) in vitro and in a mouse model for intimal hyperplasia, in which a cuff is placed around the femoral artery. PCAF deficiency downregulate CCL2, IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression, as demonstrated on cultured vSMCs, leukocytes and macrophages. PCAF KO mice showed a 71.8% reduction of vSMC-rich intimal hyperplasia, a 73.4% reduction of intima/media ratio and a 63.7% reduction of luminal stenosis after femoral artery cuff placement compared to wild type (WT) mice. The association of PCAF and vascular inflammation was further investigated using the potent natural PCAF inhibitor garcinol. Garcinol treatment reduced CCL2 and TNF-alpha expression, as demonstrated on cultured vSMCs and leukocytes. To assess the effect of garcinol treatment on vascular inflammation we used hypercholesterolemic ApoE*3-Leiden mice. After cuff placement, garcinol treatment resulted in reduced arterial leukocyte and macrophage adherence and infiltration after three days compared to untreated animals.These results identify a vital role for the lysine acetyltransferase PCAF in the regulation of local inflammation after arterial injury and likely the subsequent vSMC proliferation, responsible for intimal hyperplasia."

https://openalex.org/W2763198394,"This study examined characteristics and treatment persistence among patients prescribed oral anticoagulants (OACs) for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). We identified 15,244 patients (51.8% male, 72.7% aged ≥70) with NVAF and no prior OAC therapy who were prescribed apixaban (n = 1,303), rivaroxaban (n = 5,742), dabigatran (n = 1,622) or vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs, n = 6,577) between 1-Dec-2012 and 31-Oct-2014 in German primary care (IMS® Disease Analyzer). We compared OAC persistence using Cox regression over patients' entire follow-up and using a data-driven time-partitioned approach (before/after 100 days) to handle non-proportional hazards. History of stroke risk factors (stroke/transient ischaemic attack [TIA] 15.2%; thromboembolism 14.1%; hypertension 84.3%) and high bleeding risk (HAS-BLED score≥3 68.4%) was common. Apixaban-prescribed patients had more frequent history of stroke/TIA (19.7%) and high bleeding risk (72.6%) than other OACs. 12-month persistence rates were: VKA 57.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56.0-59.0%), rivaroxaban 56.6% (54.9-58.2%), dabigatran 50.1% (47.2-53.1%), apixaban 62.9% (58.8-67.0%). Over entire follow-up, compared to VKA, non-persistence was similar with apixaban (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.95-1.24) but higher with rivaroxaban (1.21, 1.14-1.29) and dabigatran (1.53, 1.40-1.68). Using post-hoc time-partitioned approach: in first 100 days, non-persistence was higher with apixaban (1.37, 1.17-1.59), rivaroxaban (1.41, 1.30-1.53) and dabigatran (1.91, 1.70-2.14) compared to VKA. Compared to apixaban, rivaroxaban non-persistence was similar (1.03, 0.89-1.20), dabigatran was higher (1.39, 1.17-1.66). After 100 days, apixaban non-persistence was lower than VKA (0.66, 0.52-0.85); rivaroxaban (0.97, 0.87-1.07) and dabigatran (1.10, 0.95-1.28) were similar to VKA. Furthermore, rivaroxaban (1.46, 1.13-1.88) and dabigatran (1.67, 1.26-2.19) non-persistence was higher than apixaban. This study describes real-world observations on OAC use, particularly early apixaban use following approval for NVAF, in Germany. We identified potential differential OAC prescribing and higher persistence with apixaban than other OACs after 100 days' treatment. Larger studies are needed with longer follow-up to establish long-term patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2761544055,"Gammarus minus, a freshwater amphipod living in the cave and surface streams in the eastern USA, is an excellent model for investigating evolutionary adaptation to the subterranean environment. RNA-Seq was conducted on one pair of morphologically distinct sister populations inhabiting surface and cave habitats to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the two populations, as well as to compare levels and patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Of the 104,630 transcripts identified in the transcriptome assembly, 57% had higher average levels of expression in the cave population. After Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple tests, 1517 and 551 transcripts were significantly upregulated or downregulated, respectively, in the cave population, indicating an almost three-fold enrichment of cave-upregulated genes. The average level of nucleotide diversity across all transcripts was significantly lower in the cave population. Within the cave population, where the average nucleotide diversity of cave-downregulated transcripts was 75% that of the cave-upregulated transcripts, a highly significant difference, whereas within the spring population the nucleotide diversities of cave-downregulated and cave-upregulated transcripts was virtually identical. Three lines of evidence suggest that the reduced variation in cave downregulated transcripts is due to positive selection in the cave population: 1) the average neutrality index of cave-downregulated genes was < 1, consistent with positive selection, and significantly less than that of cave-upregulated genes; 2) Tajima’s D was positively correlated with the cave:surface expression ratio, and 3) cave-downregulated transcripts were significantly more likely to be highly diverged from their surface homologs than cave-upregulated transcripts. Five transcripts had fixed premature termination codons in the cave population. The expression patterns and sequence variation in one such transcript, encoding the DNA repair protein photolyase, were examined in more detail and provide the first evidence for the relaxation of functional constraint in this light-dependent protein in a subterranean population."
https://openalex.org/W2762964972,"Approximate string matching with k-differences has a number of practical applications, ranging from pattern recognition to computational biology. This paper proposes an efficient memory-access algorithm for parallel approximate string matching with k-differences on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In the proposed algorithm, all threads in the same GPUs warp share data using warp-shuffle operation instead of accessing the shared memory. Moreover, we implement the proposed algorithm by exploiting the memory structure of GPUs to optimize its performance. Experiment results for real DNA packages revealed that the performance of the proposed algorithm and its implementation archived up to 122.64 and 1.53 times compared to that of sequential algorithm on CPU and previous parallel approximate string matching algorithm on GPUs, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2761807471,"Abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown the great impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the cell proliferation of VSMCs. This study examined the effects of miR-137 on the cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs and also explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. The mRNA and protein expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot assays, respectively. The CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay and transwell migration assay were performed to measure cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs. The miR-137-targeted 3’untranslated region of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Platelet-derived growth factor-bb (PDGF-bb) treatment enhanced cell proliferation and suppressed the expression of miR-137 in VSMCs. The gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that overexpression of miR-137 suppressed the cell proliferation and migration, and also inhibited the expression of matrix genes of VSMCs; down-regulation of miR-137 had the opposite effects on VSMCs. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase report assay results showed that IGFBP-5 was a direct target of miR-137, and miR-137 overexpression suppressed the IGFBP-5 expression and down-regulation of miR-137 increased the IGFBP-5 expression in VSMCs. PDGF-bb treatment also increased the IGFBP-5 mRNA expression. In addition, enforced expression of IGFBP-5 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-137 on cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs. More importantly, overexpression of miR-137 also suppressed the activity of mTOR/STAT3 signaling in VSMCs. Taken together, the results suggest that miR-137 may suppress cell proliferation and migration of VSMCs via targeting IGFBP-5 and modulating mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway."

Although labeling of Escherichia coli with the chemical reporter 8-azido-3,8-dideoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo-N3) has been reported, its incorporation into LPS has not been directly shown. We have now verified Kdo-N3 incorporation into E. coli LPS at the molecular level. Using microscopy and PAGE analysis, we show that Kdo-N3 is localized to the outer membrane and specifically incorporates into rough and deep-rough LPS. In an E. coli strain lacking endogenous Kdo biosynthesis, supplementation with exogenous Kdo restored full-length core-LPS, which suggests that the Kdo biosynthetic pathways might not be essential in vivo in the presence of sufficient exogenous Kdo. In contrast, exogenous Kdo-N3 only restored a small fraction of core LPS with the majority incorporated into truncated LPS. The truncated LPS were identified as Kdo-N3–lipid IVA and (Kdo-N3)2–lipid IVA by MS analysis. The low level of Kdo-N3 incorporation could be partly explained by a 6-fold reduction in the specificity constant of the CMP-Kdo synthetase KdsB with Kdo-N3 compared with Kdo. These results indicate that the azido moiety in Kdo-N3 interferes with its utilization and may limit its utility as a tracer of LPS biosynthesis and transport in E. coli. We propose that our findings will be helpful for researchers using Kdo and its chemical derivatives for investigating LPS biosynthesis, transport, and assembly in Gram-negative bacteria. 3-Deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) is an essential component of LPS in the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane.

The treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections has become a growing challenge due to increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (1Yılmaz C. Özcengiz G.

Molecular basis of bacterial outer membrane permeability revisited.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar). A key characteristic of the OM is its asymmetry, with an inner leaflet of phospholipids and an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharides (LPS or endotoxin) (6Nikaido H. Vaara M. Molecular basis of bacterial outer membrane permeability.Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS consists of three parts: lipid A (embedded in the outer leaflet of the OM), the core-oligosaccharide, and the O-antigen. In nearly all Gram-negative bacteria, the first core sugar attached to lipid A is 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) (7Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). Kdo2-lipid A, or deep-rough LPS, is the minimal LPS needed for growth in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli (8Whitfield C. Trent M.S. Biosynthesis and export of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 99-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and triggers the human innate immune response (7Raetz C.R.

A profound understanding of LPS biosynthesis, transport, and assembly in vivo and in vitro may be crucial for developing new classes of antibiotics (10Moison E. Xie R. Zhang G.

In the last decade, there have been great advances in metabolic engineering and bioorthogonal “click” chemistry to label biomolecules in mammalian cells and, more recently, in bacteria (11Carroll L.

The incorporation of functionalized substrates like an amino acid or monosaccharide into mammalian cells or bacteria, followed by labeling via click chemistry, allows the direct investigation of the native biological environment with the unnatural analog (14Kocaoglu O.

In addition, Fugier et al. utilized copper-free click chemistry to label Kdo-N3–treated E. coli cells with a biotin derivative (17Fugier E. Dumont A. Malleron A. Poquet E. Mas Pons J. Baron A.

The biotin-labeled bacteria were captured by magnetic streptavidin beads. This method allowed the enrichment and detection of E. coli in biological samples in the presence of other microbes.

Although the uptake mechanism is not known, exogenously supplied Kdo-N3 is presumed to be incorporated into the LPS via the same pathway as endogenous Kdo (Fig. 1A) (16Dumont A. Malleron A. Awwad M.

If LPS containing Kdo-N3 were flipped from the cytoplasm to the periplasm and further transported to the outer leaflet of the OM (21Okuda S. Sherman D.J. Silhavy T.J. Ruiz N. Kahne D. Lipopolysaccharide transport and assembly at the outer membrane: the PEZ model.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), Kdo-N3 in the LPS would then be available for labeling with suitable partners (Fig. 1B). However, Kdo-N3 incorporation into LPS has not yet been proven on a molecular level, which is important to understand the advantages and drawbacks of Kdo-N3 labeling and to utilize this method to study LPS biology. Here, we report the molecular characterization of Kdo-N3 incorporation into E. coli LPS and reveal limitations of this method. Fugier et al. (17Fugier E. Dumont A. Malleron A. Poquet E. Mas Pons J. Baron A. Vauzeilles B. Dukan S.

We grew E. coli K-12 for 16 h with and without supplementation of 1 mm Kdo-N3 (synthesized as described under “Experimental procedures”) followed by specific labeling of the N3 moiety with Click-IT Alexa Fluor 488-DIBO alkyne (Alexa488-DIBO). This commercially available strained cyclooctyne, which reacts selectively with azides via copper-free click reaction, contains the green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 moiety, allowing fluorescent click labeling with a single step (22Liechti G.W. Kuru E. Hall E. Kalinda A. Brun Y.V. VanNieuwenhze M. Maurelli A.T.

Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2966-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A). Cells grown in the presence of Kdo-N3 and treated with Alexa488-DIBO were fluorescent (supplemental Fig. S2B), whereas no fluorescent labeling with Alexa488-DIBO was observed for cells grown without Kdo-N3 and treated with Alexa488-DIBO (supplemental Fig. S2A). The dose- and time-dependent studies for Kdo-N3 labeling by flow cytometry showed that cells grown in the presence of ≥0.1 mm Kdo-N3 were readily labeled (supplemental Fig. S3A) and that 4-h or longer incubation with Kdo-N3 was required for substantial labeling of E. coli (supplemental Fig. S3C). The green fluorescence observed after labeling E. coli should be localized to the OM if Kdo-N3 is incorporated into the LPS. Although LPS is biosynthesized in the inner membrane (IM), it is then transported directly to the outer leaflet of the OM (21Okuda S. Sherman D.J. Silhavy T.J. Ruiz N. Kahne D. Lipopolysaccharide transport and assembly at the outer membrane: the PEZ model.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), where any Kdo-N3–containing LPS would be available to react with Alexa488-DIBO. To confirm the OM localization of the reacted Alexa488-DIBO, the click-labeled cells were imaged after osmotic shock treatment with high sucrose solution (plasmolysis). During plasmolysis, the cytoplasm shrank, whereas the OM retained its shape, leading to an increased separation of the IM and OM (Fig. 2, A1 and B1, marked with arrows). The expanded periplasm facilitated the differential localization of fluorophores to the cytoplasm, IM, periplasm, and OM (25Cook W.R. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. Compartmentalization of the periplasmic space at division sites in Gram-negative bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In Alexa488-DIBO–labeled E. coli cells stained with the membrane dye FM 4-64, the green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 (Fig. 2A2) and the red fluorescent FM 4-64 (Fig. 2, A3 and A4) were co-localized to the OM. This is consistent with a previous report that FM 4-64 preferentially stains the OM and not the IM of intact wild-type E. coli (26Lewenza S. Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Pugsley A.P. Direct visualization of red fluorescent lipoproteins indicates conservation of the membrane sorting rules in the family Enterobacteriaceae.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3516-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To delineate the IM, we imaged plasmolyzed Alexa488-DIBO–labeled E. coli K-12 expressing mCherry, a red fluorescent protein, in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B3). We found that the green Alexa488-DIBO was also localized to the OM in these cells, whereas the red fluorescence was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B4), confirming the localization of Kdo-N3 to the OM. After localizing the fluorophore to the OM, Kdo-N3 incorporation into the LPS was validated on a molecular level using SDS-PAGE. E. coli cells were grown in the presence or absence of Kdo-N3, followed by reaction with Alexa488-DIBO and LPS separation by SDS-PAGE. The fluorescent gel image showed a green fluorescent band in the sample from cells grown with Kdo-N3 and treated with Alexa488-DIBO (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). This band was not detected in the control samples: untreated cells (lane 2), cells grown without Kdo-N3 and treated with Alexa488-DIBO (lane 3), and cells grown with Kdo-N3 but untreated with Alexa488-DIBO (lane 4). As an additional control, the Alexa488-DIBO reagent alone ran faster than the Alexa488-DIBO fluorescently labeled LPS bands (lanes 5 and 6) in a broad, diffuse band (lane 7). The SDS-polyacrylamide gel was then developed with the Pro-Q Emerald 300 LPS gel stain kit to visualize all LPS bands containing sugars (27Davis Jr., M.R. Goldberg J.B. Purification and visualization of lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria by hot aqueous-phenol extraction.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 10.3791/3916Google Scholar). All E. coli samples (lanes 2–6) showed a very similar Pro-Q Emerald 300 fluorescent LPS pattern (Fig. 3B). To better enable comparison of the Alexa Fluor 488 (Fig. 3A) and the Pro-Q Emerald 300 UV-fluorescence images (Fig. 3B), LPS from E. coli serotype O55:B5 Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (the only commercially available fluorescent LPS probe) was run as a control (lane 1). This conjugate showed fluorescence because of its Alexa Fluor 488 label and was subsequently visible upon Pro-Q Emerald 300 LPS staining due to its LPS sugars. By comparison with this control (lane 1), the Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent band of E. coli K-12 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6) migrated at the same position as the rough LPS band (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–6) visualized with the Pro-Q Emerald 300 LPS kit. It is important to note that the Alexa Fluor 488 signal bled through under the UV light used to image total LPS. The same gel was also treated with Coomassie Blue stain and imaged to visualize the protein and ensure that the samples were equally loaded (see supplemental Fig. S4C). To further confirm Kdo-N3 incorporation into LPS, Kdo-N3 labeling was studied in ΔwaaC E. coli, which lacks the core heptosyltransferase WaaC (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S7). WaaC adds the first heptose unit onto Kdo2-lipid A and therefore forms the attachment point for subsequent core sugars (28Brabetz W. Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Deletion of the heptosyltransferase genes rfaC and rfaF in Escherichia coli K-12 results in an Re-type lipopolysaccharide with a high degree of 2-aminoethanol phosphate substitution.Eur. J.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1097-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S7B). ΔwaaC E. coli produces only Kdo2-lipid A (deep-rough LPS), which is smaller and has a faster electrophoretic mobility compared with rough LPS from E. coli K-12 (30Wang Z. Wang J. Ren G. Li Y. Wang X. Influence of core oligosaccharide of lipopolysaccharide to outer membrane behavior of Escherichia coli.Mar. Drugs. 2015; 13: 3325-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ΔwaaC E. coli was treated with or without Kdo-N3 and Alexa488-DIBO as described for E. coli K-12. The LPS species from ΔwaaC E. coli were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C) and imaged for green fluorescence. The Alexa488-DIBO reagent alone showed a similar SDS-PAGE migration pattern to fluorescently labeled Kdo2-lipid A. Therefore, the protocol was adapted to remove excess Alexa488-DIBO reagent by washing the gel overnight (with the standard washing solution described for the Pro-Q Emerald 300 LPS staining kit) (Fig. 3C, lane 7). After the overnight wash, the gel image revealed a fluorescently labeled band only for ΔwaaC E. coli grown with Kdo-N3 and reacted with the Alexa488-DIBO (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6). As observed for E. coli K-12, the control samples for ΔwaaC E. coli cultures did not show any fluorescent LPS bands (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4). Upon LPS staining with the Pro-Q Emerald 300 kit (Fig. 3D), the gel showed a very similar LPS pattern for all samples (Fig. 3D, lanes 2–6). The faster migration of the fluorescent band (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6) compared with the control LPS from E. coli serotype O55:B5 Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Fig. 3C, lane 1) suggested that the band was the expected deep-rough LPS. E. coli K-12 and ΔwaaC E. coli both have endogenous Kdo biosynthesis. Thus, exogenous Kdo-N3 is competing against endogenous Kdo, which makes it difficult to determine the level of Kdo-N3 incorporation into the LPS. To have a direct read-out of Kdo-N3 incorporation without the competition of endogenous Kdo, a commercially available E. coli K-12 strain (ClearColi K-12) was obtained that lacks endogenous Kdo synthesis but retains intact Kdo cytidylyltransferase (CMP-Kdo synthetase, KdsB, or CKS) and Kdo transferase (KdtA or WaaA) activities (see supplemental Fig. S7) (31Mamat U.

Lindner B. Woodard R.W. Redefining the requisite lipopolysaccharide structure in Escherichia coli.ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). ClearColi K-12 has been previously shown to synthesize only lipid IVA as its LPS (31Mamat U. Wilke K. Bramhill D. Schromm A.B. Lindner B. Kohl T.A. Corchero J.L. Villaverde A. Schaffer L. Head S.R. Souvignier C. Meredith T.C. Woodard R.W. Detoxifying Escherichia coli for endotoxin-free production of recombinant proteins.Microb. Cell Fact. 2015; 14: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this strain should be capable of synthesizing core-lipid IVA after uptake of exogenous Kdo or exogenous Kdo-N3. To test this hypothesis, ClearColi K-12 was grown in the presence or absence of 5 mm Kdo or 5 mm Kdo-N3 for 16 h followed by the reaction with Alexa488-DIBO. After SDS-PAGE and Pro-Q Emerald 300 LPS staining, a band equivalent to rough LPS (core-lipid IVA) was clearly visible from ClearColi K-12 grown with Kdo (Fig. 4B, lane 4). The uptake and substantial incorporation of exogenous Kdo into LPS has not been reported previously. Only a very faint LPS band was visible for ClearColi K-12 grown with Kdo-N3 (Fig. 4B, lane 5). The faster-migrating LPS bands in lanes 3–5 are most likely lipid IVA and one of its precursors, such as disaccharide 4′-monophosphate (see supplemental Fig. S7B) and did not appear to differ with Kdo or Kdo-N3 supplementation. Upon imaging the SDS-polyacrylamide gel for fluorescence (Fig. 4B), the ClearColi sample grown with Kdo-N3 and treated with Alexa488-DIBO revealed two green fluorescent bands (Fig. 4B, lane 6). The upper band corresponds to core-lipid IVA, whereas the lower band is consistent with a smaller, faster-migrating species missing some or all of the core sugars. It is important to note that the Alexa Fluor 488 label bled through under the UV light used to image total LPS, as lanes 5 and 6 only differ in the treatment with Alexa488-DIBO. The SDS-PAGE results indicated Kdo-N3 incorporation into the LPS of different E. coli strains. To directly confirm Kdo-N3 incorporation, we had attempted to obtain the first direct measurement of Kdo-N3 into LPS by MS using the ΔwaaC E. coli strain but were unsuccessful. After detection of the second LPS species in ClearColi K-12 upon Kdo-N3 supplementation, we hypothesized that the faster-migrating Kdo-N3–containing lipid A species (Kdo-N3–lipid IVA or (Kdo-N3)2–lipid IVA) should be extractable by Bligh–Dyer extraction and detectable by MS as reported for deep-rough LPS (33Moon K.

Thus, ClearColi was grown with and without Kdo-N3 supplementation followed by the lipid isolation by acidic Bligh–Dyer extraction (35Zhao J. Raetz C.R. A two-component Kdo hydrolase in the inner membrane of Francisella novicida.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 820-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The total lipid extracts were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The corresponding LPS ions from ClearColi K-12 (with or without Kdo-N3) are summarized in Table 1 with calculated m/z values and observed m/z values (when found). The negative ion mode spectra of both samples showed the most abundant ion at m/z 1403.8 (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). This peak can be attributed to lipid IVA ([M − H]− ion), the major LPS component expressed by ClearColi (31Mamat U. Wilke K. Bramhill D. Schromm A.B. Lindner B. Kohl T.A. Corchero J.L. Villaverde A.

In the ClearColi sample supplemented with Kdo-N3 (red trace), peaks were observed at m/z 1893.9 (Fig. 5B) and m/z 1648.8 (Fig. 5A). Those peaks were not detected for the ClearColi sample grown without Kdo-N3 (blue trace). The peak at m/z 1893.9 is consistent with (Kdo-N3)2-lipid IVA ([M − H]− ion), whereas the peak at m/z 1648.8 can be attributed to Kdo-N3–lipid IVA. MS/MS fragmentation of both ions (1648.8 and 1893.9) produced a fragment ion of m/z 1403.8 (supplemental Fig. S6, A–D). This fragment ion peak is consistent with lipid IVA formed by the loss of one or two Kdo-N3 units, respectively.Table 1Observed lipid IVA species in total lipid extracts of ClearColi K-12 evaluated by MALDI-TOF-MSLPS speciesCalculated mass [M − H]− (m/z)Observed mass [M − H]− (m/z)Relative signal intensity (%)ClearColi Lipid IVA1403.851403.80100 Kdo-lipid IVA1623.901623.830.11 Kdo-N3-lipid IVA1648.91NDaND, not detected.ND (Kdo)2-lipid IVA1843.96NDND Kdo-Kdo-N3-lipid IVA1868.97NDND (Kdo-N3)2-lipid IVA1893.98NDNDClearColi grown with 1 mm Kdo-N3 Lipid IVA1403.851403.80100 Kdo-lipid IVA1623.901623.830.10 Kdo-N3-lipid IVA1648.911648.840.48 (Kdo)2-lipid IVA1843.96NDND Kdo-Kdo-N3-lipid IVA1868.97NDND (Kdo-N3)2-lipid IVA1893.981893.890.02a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Interestingly, a low-intensity signal was observed at m/z 1623.83 in both samples, which can be interpreted as Kdo-lipid IVA (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S5D). MS/MS fragmentation of this ion led also to m/z 1403.8, indicating the loss of one Kdo unit to form lipid IVA. A peak at m/z 1843.96, which would be consistent with (Kdo)2-lipid IVA, was not observed. Whereas ClearColi K-12 is reported to lack the ability to synthesize Kdo, these results suggest that there is a trace amount of Kdo present in the growth medium or produced endogenously by the strain. Trace amounts of Kdo have been previously reported in ClearColi K-12 in a different context (32Meredith T.C. Aggarwal P. Mamat U. Lindner B. Woodard R.W. Redefining the requisite lipopolysaccharide structure in Escherichia coli.ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The results from the ClearColi samples obtained by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-MS indicate that the uptake and incorporation of Kdo-N3 are significantly less efficient than for Kdo. The first step necessary for Kdo-N3 incorporation after its uptake is the formation of CMP–Kdo-N3 by the Kdo cytidylyltransferase KdsB (Fig. 1A; see also supplemental Fig. S7). In KdtA biochemical assays when CMP-Kdo levels are low, KdtA has been observed to transfer a single Kdo instead of two (36Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R. Biosynthesis of endotoxins: purification and catalytic properties of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid transferase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that KdsB does not efficiently recognize Kdo-N3, leading to low levels of CMP–Kdo-N3, which would limit the production of (Kdo-N3)2-lipid IVA and core-lipid IVA and would be an explanation for the detection of Kdo-N3–lipid IVA by MS. To test this hypothesis, KdsB was overexpressed in E. coli and purified. The activity of KdsB was analyzed using the EnzChek pyrophosphate assay kit to detect pyrophosphate released during the reaction of CTP and Kdo sugar (see supplemental Fig. S7A). The apparent Km values for Kdo and Kdo-N3 were measured at fixed saturating concentrations of CTP and Mg2+ at pH 7.6. We found that the apparent Km was substantially higher (suggesting weaker binding)"

https://openalex.org/W2763315826,"The effect of small-sided team sport training and protein intake on muscle mass, physical function, and adaptations important for health in untrained older adults was examined. Forty-eight untrained older (72±6 (±standard deviation, SD) years men and women were divided into either a team sport group ingesting a drink high in protein (18 g) immediately and 3 h after each training session (TS-HP, n = 13), a team sport group ingesting an isocaloric drink with low protein content (3 g; TS-LP, n = 18), or a control group continuing their normal activities (CON, n = 17). The team sport training was performed as ~20 min of small-sided ball games twice a week over 12 weeks. After the intervention period, leg muscle mass was 0.6 kg higher (P = 0.047) in TS-HP, with no effect in TS-LP. In TS-HP, number of sit-to-stand repetitions increased (1.2±0.6, P = 0.054), time to perform 2.45 m up-and-go was lower (0.7±0.3 s, P = 0.03) and number of arm curl repetitions increased (3.5±1.2, P = 0.01), whereas in TS-LP only number of repetitions in sit-to-stand was higher (1.6±0.6, P = 0.01). In TS-LP, reductions were observed in total and abdominal fat mass (1.2±0.5 and 0.4±0.2 kg, P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively), heart rate at rest (9±3 bpm, P = 0.002) and plasma C-reactive protein (1.8±0.8 mmol/L, P = 0.03), with no effects in TS-HP. Thus, team sport training improves functional capacity of untrained older adults and increases leg muscle mass only when ingesting proteins after training. Furthermore, team sport training followed by intake of drink with low protein content does lower fat mass, heart rate at rest and level of systemic inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2762874810,"Gonadal differentiation is tightly regulated by the initial sex determining gene and the downstream sex-related genes in vertebrates. However, sex change in fish can alter the sexual fate from one sex to the other. Chemical-induced maleness in the protogynous orange-spotted grouper is transient, and a reversible sex change occurs after the chemical treatment is withdrawn. We used these characteristics to study Amh signaling during bi-directional sex change in the grouper. We successfully induced the female-to-male sex change by chemical (aromatase inhibitor, AI, or methyltestosterone, MT) treatment. A dormant gonad (a low proliferation rate of early germ cells and no characteristics of both sexes) was found during the transient phase of reversible male-to-female sex change after the withdrawal of chemical administration. Our results showed that amh (anti-mullerian hormone) and its receptor amhr2 (anti-mullerian hormone receptor type 2) were significantly increased in the gonads during the process of female-to-male sex change. Amh is expressed in the Sertoli cells surrounding the type A spermatogonia in the female-to-male grouper. Male-related gene (dmrt1 and sox9) expression was immediately decreased in MT-terminated males during the reversible male-to-female sex change. However, Amh expression was found in the surrounding cells of type A spermatogonia-like cells during the transient phase of reversible male-to-female sex change. This phenomenon is correlated with the dormancy of type A spermatogonia-like cells. Thus, Amh signaling is suggested to play roles in regulating male differentiation during the female-to-male sex change and in inhibiting type-A spermatogonia-like cell proliferation/differentiation during the reversible male-to-female sex change. We suggest that Amh signaling might play dual roles during bi-directional sex change in grouper."
https://openalex.org/W2761761555,"Clinical guidelines recommend early discharge of patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism (LRPE). This study measured the overall impact of early discharge of LRPE patients on clinical outcomes and costs in the Veterans Health Administration population. Adult patients with ≥1 inpatient diagnosis for pulmonary embolism (PE) (index date) between 10/2011-06/2015, continuous enrollment for ≥12 months pre- and 3 months post-index date were included. PE risk stratification was performed using the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Stratification Index. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare 90-day adverse PE events (APEs) [recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleed and death], hospital-acquired complications (HACs), healthcare utilization, and costs among short (≤2 days) versus long length of stay (LOS). Net clinical benefit was defined as 1 minus the combined rate of APE and HAC. Among 6,746 PE patients, 95.4% were men, 22.0% were African American, and 1,918 had LRPE. Among LRPE patients, only 688 had a short LOS. After 1:1 PSM, there were no differences in APE, but short LOS had fewer HAC (1.5% vs 13.3%, 95% CI: 3.77-19.94) and bacterial pneumonias (5.9% vs 11.7%, 95% CI: 1.24-3.23), resulting in better net clinical benefit (86.9% vs 78.3%, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96). Among long LOS patients, HACs (52) exceeded APEs (14 recurrent DVT, 5 bleeds). Short LOS incurred lower inpatient ($2,164 vs $5,100, 95% CI: $646.8-$5225.0) and total costs ($9,056 vs $12,544, 95% CI: $636.6-$6337.7). LRPE patients with short LOS had better net clinical outcomes at lower costs than matched LRPE patients with long LOS."
https://openalex.org/W2761890780,"The MEK1 kinase directly phosphorylates ERK2, after the activation loop of MEK1 is itself phosphorylated by Raf. Studies over the past decade have revealed a large number of disease-related mutations in the MEK1 gene that lead to tumorigenesis and abnormal development. Several of these mutations result in MEK1 constitutive activity, but how they affect MEK1 regulation and function remains largely unknown. Here, we address these questions focusing on two pathogenic variants of the Phe-53 residue, which maps to the well-characterized negative regulatory region of MEK1. We found that these variants are phosphorylated by Raf faster than the wild-type enzyme, and this phosphorylation further increases their enzymatic activity. However, the maximal activities of fully phosphorylated wild-type and mutant enzymes are indistinguishable. On the basis of available structural information, we propose that the activating substitutions destabilize the inactive conformation of MEK1, resulting in its constitutive activity and making it more prone to Raf-mediated phosphorylation. Experiments in zebrafish revealed that the effects of activating variants on embryonic development reflect the joint control of the negative regulatory region and activating phosphorylation. Our results underscore the complexity of the effects of activating mutations on signaling systems, even at the level of a single protein."
https://openalex.org/W2764269715,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis. IL-10-mediated responses are triggered upon binding to a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-10 receptor (IL-10R)1 and IL-10R2. Engagement of the IL-10R complex activates the intracellular kinases Jak1 and Tyk2, but the exact roles of IL-10R2 and IL-10R2-associated signaling via Tyk2 remain unclear. To elucidate the contribution of IL-10R2 and its signaling to IL-10 activity, we re-evaluated IL-10-mediated responses on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, macrophages and mast cells. By using bone marrow from IL-10R-/- mice it was revealed that IL-10-mediated responses depend on both IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 in all three cell types. On the contrary, bone marrow-derived cells from Tyk2-/- mice showed similar responses to IL-10 as wild-type cells, indicating that signaling via this IL-10R2-associated kinase only plays a limited role. Tyk2 was shown to control the amplitude of STAT3 activation and the up-regulation of downstream SOCS3 expression. SOCS3 up-regulation was found to be cell-type dependent and correlated with the lack of early suppression of LPS-induced TNF-α in dendritic cells. Further investigation of the IL-10R complex revealed that both the extracellular and intracellular domains of IL-10R2 influence the conformation of IL-10R1 and that both domains were required for transducing IL-10 signals. This observation highlights a novel role for the intracellular domain of IL-10R2 in the molecular mechanisms of IL-10R activation."
https://openalex.org/W2763720583,"Two-pore-domain K+ (K2P) channels sense a wide variety of stimuli such as mechanical stress, inhalational anesthetics, and changes in extracellular pH or temperature. The K2P channel activity forms a background K+ current and, thereby, contributes to resting membrane potentials. Six subfamilies including fifteen subtypes of K2P channels have been identified. Each K2P channel molecule with two pores consists of a homodimer of each subtype. In addition, a few heterodimers mainly within the same subfamilies have been found recently. In the present study, the possibility of heterodimerization between TASK1 (TWIK-Related Acid-Sensitive K+ channel) and TALK2 (TWIK-Related Alkaline pH-Activated K+ channel) was examined. These channels belong to separate subfamilies and show extremely different channel properties. Surprisingly, single molecular imaging analyses in this study using a total internal reflection microscope suggested the heterodimerization of TASK1 and TALK2 in a pancreatic cell line, QGP-1. This heterodimer was also detected using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay in a HEK293 heterologous expression system. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses showed that the affinity between TASK1 and TALK2 appeared to be close to those of homodimers. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that TASK1 currents in HEK293 cells were significantly attenuated by co-expression of a dominant-negative form of TALK2 in comparison with that of wild-type TALK2. The sensitivities of TASK1-TALK2 tandem constructs to extracellular pH and halothane were characterized as a unique hybrid of TASK1 and TALK2. These results suggested that heterodimerization of TASK1 and TALK2 provides cells with the ability to make multiple responses to a variety of physiological and pharmacological stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2761353542,"CD36 is a multiligand receptor involved in lipid metabolism. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of CP-3(iv), an azapeptide belonging to a new class of selective CD36 ligands. The role of CP-3(iv) in mediating cardioprotection was investigated because CD36 signaling leads to activation of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ, a transcriptional regulator of adiponectin. CP-3(iv) pretreatment reduced infarct size by 54% and preserved hemodynamics in C57BL/6 mice subjected to 30 min coronary ligation and reperfusion but had no effect in CD36-deficient mice. The effects of CP-3(iv) were associated with an increase in circulating adiponectin levels, epididymal fat adiponectin gene expression, and adiponectin transcriptional regulators (Pparg, Cebpb, Sirt1) after 6 h of reperfusion. Reduced myocardial oxidative stress and apoptosis were observed along with an increase in expression of myocardial adiponectin target proteins, including cyclooxygenase-2, phospho-AMPK, and phospho-Akt. Moreover, CP-3(iv) increased myocardial performance in isolated hearts, whereas blockade of adiponectin with an anti-adiponectin antibody abrogated it. CP-3(iv) exerts cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (MI/R) injury and dysfunction, at least in part, by increasing circulating and myocardial adiponectin levels. Hence, both paracrine and endocrine effects of adiponectin may contribute to reduced reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis after MI/R, in a CD36-dependent manner.—Huynh, D. N., Bessi, V.

https://openalex.org/W2761282532,"Functional roles of domestic and wild host populations in infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) epidemiology have been extensively discussed claiming a domestic reservoir for the more susceptible wild hosts, however, based on limited data. With the aim to better assess IKC epidemiology in complex host-pathogen alpine systems, the long-term infectious dynamics and molecular epidemiology of Mycoplasma conjunctivae was investigated in all host populations from six study areas in the Pyrenees and one in the Cantabrian Mountains (Northern Spain). Detection of M. conjunctivae was performed by qPCR on 3600 eye swabs collected during seven years from hunted wild ungulates and sympatric domestic sheep (n = 1800 animals), and cluster analyses of the strains were performed including previous reported local strains. Mycoplasma conjunctivae was consistently detected in three Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra p. pyrenaica) populations, as well as in sheep flocks (17.0% of sheep) and occasionally in mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) from the Pyrenees (22.2% in one year/area); statistically associated with ocular clinical signs only in chamois. Chamois populations showed different infection dynamics with low but steady prevalence (4.9%) and significant yearly fluctuations (0.0%– 40.0%). Persistence of specific M. conjunctivae strain clusters in wild host populations is demonstrated for six and nine years. Cross-species transmission between chamois and sheep and chamois and mouflon were also sporadically evidenced. Overall, independent M. conjunctivae sylvatic and domestic cycles occurred at the wildlife-livestock interface in the alpine ecosystems from the Pyrenees with sheep and chamois as the key host species for each cycle, and mouflon as a spill-over host. Host population characteristics and M. conjunctivae strains resulted in different epidemiological scenarios in chamois, ranging from the fading out of the mycoplasma to the epidemic and endemic long-term persistence. These findings highlight the capacity of M. conjunctivae to establish diverse interactions and persist in host populations, also with different transmission conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2762871664,"We analyzed the antifungal susceptibility profiles, genotypes, and virulence of clinical Aspergillus terreus isolates from six university hospitals in South Korea. Thirty one isolates of A. terreus, comprising 15 respiratory and 16 ear isolates were assessed. Microsatellite genotyping was performed, and genetic similarity was assessed by calculating the Jaccard index. Virulence was evaluated by Galleria mellonella survival assay. All 31 isolates were susceptible to itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole, while 23 (74.2%) and 6 (19.4%) showed amphotericin B (AMB) minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ≤ 1 mg/L and > 4 mg/L, respectively. Notably, respiratory isolates showed significantly higher geometric mean MICs than ear isolates to AMB (2.41 vs. 0.48 mg/L), itraconazole (0.40 vs. 0.19 mg/L), posaconazole (0.16 vs. 0.08 mg/L), and voriconazole (0.76 vs. 0.31 mg/L) (all, P <0.05). Microsatellite genotyping separated the 31 isolates into 27 types, but the dendrogram demonstrated a closer genotypic relatedness among isolates from the same body site (ear or respiratory tract); in particular, the majority of ear isolates clustered together. Individual isolates varied markedly in their ability to kill infected G. mellonella after 72 h, but virulence did not show significant differences according to source (ear or respiratory tract), genotype, or antifungal susceptibility. The current study shows the marked diversity of clinical isolates of A. terreus in terms of antifungal susceptibilities, genotypes and virulence in the G. mellonella model, and ear isolates from Korean hospitals may have lower AMB or triazole MICs than respiratory isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2761142607,"Therapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS) need to be efficiently delivered to the target site of action at appropriate therapeutic levels. However, a limited number of effective drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases has been developed thus far. Further, the pharmacological mechanisms by which such therapeutic agents can protect neurons from cell death have not been fully understood. We have previously reported the novel small-molecule compound, 2-[mesityl(methyl)amino]-N-[4-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl] acetamide trihydrochloride (WN1316), as a unique neuroprotectant against oxidative injury and a highly promising remedy for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). One of the remarkable characteristics of WN1316 is that its efficacious doses in ALS mouse models are much less than those against oxidative injury in cultured human neuronal cells. It is also noted that the WN1316 cytoprotective activity observed in cultured cells is totally dependent upon the addition of fetal bovine serum in culture medium. These findings led us to postulate some serum factors being tightly linked to the WN1316 efficacy. In this study, we sieved through fetal bovine serum proteins and identified two N-linked glycoproteins, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG) and hemopexin (HPX), requisites to exert the WN1316 cytoprotective activity against oxidative injury in neuronal cells in vitro. Notably, the removal of glycan chains from these molecules did not affect the WN1316 cytoprotective activity. Thus, two glycoproteins, AHSG and HPX, represent a pivotal glycoprotein of the cytoprotective activity for WN1316, showing a concrete evidence for the novel glycan-independent function of serum glycoproteins in neuroprotective drug efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2762197986,"Most arthropods generate their posterior bodies by adding segments periodically, as the embryo grows, from a posteriorly located region called the segment addition zone. This mode of segmentation is shared with vertebrates and relies on oscillatory mechanisms, where the temporal periodicity of a clock is translated into repetitive spatial patterns. This ordered anterior-to-posterior pattern is achieved at the same time as the tissue elongates, opening the question of the functional coordination between the mechanisms of segmental patterning and posterior growth. The study of these processes in different arthropods has played an important role in unravelling some of the molecular mechanisms of segment formation. However, the behavior of cells during elongation and how cellular processes affect this segmental patterning has been poorly studied. Cell proliferation together with cell rearrangements are presumed to be the major forces driving axis elongation in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. However, there still no strong evidence about the role and distribution of cell proliferation within the embryo. In this study, we propose to address these questions by using whole embryo cultures and pharmacological manipulation. We show that considerable cell proliferation occurs during germband elongation, measured by incorporation of the nucleoside analog of thymidine 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, EdU. Moreover, proliferating cells appeared to be spread along the elongating embryo with a posterior bias at early segmentation. In addition, when we blocked cell division, treated germbands were always shorter than controls and in some cases not able to fully elongate, even when control embryos already started to retract and leg buds are evident. Finally, we found that the absence of cell proliferation has no apparent effect on segmental patterning, as evidenced by Tc-engrailed (Tc-en) gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2761190114,"Most wild and semi-wild species of the genus Gossypium are exhibit photoperiod-sensitive flowering. The wild germplasm cotton is a valuable source of genes for genetic improvement of modern cotton cultivars. A bi-parental cotton population segregating for photoperiodic flowering was developed by crossing a photoperiod insensitive irradiation mutant line with its pre-mutagenesis photoperiodic wild-type G. darwinii Watt genotype. Individuals from the F2 and F3 generations were grown with their parental lines and F1 hybrid progeny in the long day and short night summer condition (natural day-length) of Uzbekistan to evaluate photoperiod sensitivity, i.e., flowering-time during the seasons 2008–2009. Through genotyping the individuals of this bi-parental population segregating for flowering-time, linkage maps were constructed using 212 simple-sequence repeat (SSR) and three cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers. Six QTLs directly associated with flowering-time and photoperiodic flowering were discovered in the F2 population, whereas eight QTLs were identified in the F3 population. Two QTLs controlling photoperiodic flowering and duration of flowering were common in both populations. In silico annotations of the flanking DNA sequences of mapped SSRs from sequenced cotton (G. hirsutum L.) genome database has identified several potential ‘candidate’ genes that are known to be associated with regulation of flowering characteristics of plants. The outcome of this research will expand our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of photoperiodic flowering. Identified markers should be useful for marker-assisted selection in cotton breeding to improve early flowering characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2762721679,"Objective Recent studies suggest antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may be related to mortality risk, but evidence is sparse and inconclusive. Thus, we investigated ANA associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in U.S. adults. Methods Our sample included 3357 adults (ages ≥20 years) from the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with ANA measurements (1:80 dilution) and mortality data through 2011 (median follow-up: 9.4 years). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) via weighted Cox regression to assess ANA associations with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and obesity. Analyses examined mortality in the full sample and in subgroups based on self-reported histories of CVD and cancer, both overall and stratified by sex and age at enrollment. Results Overall, ANA were not strongly associated with death from all causes (HR: 1.13; CI: 0.79, 1.60), from CVD (HR: 1.60; CI: 0.80, 3.20), or from cancer (HR: 1.58; CI: 0.75, 3.33), though all three HR estimates exceeded 1. In the subgroup with a history of cancer, ANA were associated with elevated all-cause mortality in men (HR: 2.28; CI: 1.01, 5.14) and in participants who enrolled at age ≥75 years (HR: 1.99; CI: 1.04, 3.80). Conclusion These findings suggest that ANA are not strongly associated with mortality in the general population. Longitudinal studies with repeated assessments are needed to understand the temporal relationship between ANA, aging-associated diseases, and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2761193561,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a potent nephrotoxin and carcinogen which is found in a wide variety of common foods and beverages and it is produced by several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. Ochratoxin α (OTα), a major metabolite of OTA, has also been reported to occur in cultures of OTA-producing species. However there is some controversial about the participation of OTα in the biosynthesis of OTA, mainly because its biosynthesis pathway has not yet been completely characterized. Aspergillus carbonarius is the main responsible source of ochratoxin A (OTA) in food commodities such as wine, grapes or dried vine fruits from main viticultural regions worldwide. However, little is known about the presence of OTα in isolates of A. carbonarius. In this study we evaluated the effects of temperature and incubation time on OTα production by both OTA and non-OTA-producing strains of A. carbonarius. OTA and OTα were detected on the basis of HPLC fluorometric response compared with that of their standards and confirmed by HPLC-MS in selected samples. The non-OTA-producing strains did produce neither OTA nor OTα at any of the conditions tested. The OTA-producing strains studied were able to produce both OTA and OTα in most of the conditions tested. In general, higher amounts of OTA than OTα were produced, but a positive correlation in the production of these two metabolites was detected. The lack of production of both OTA and OTα in the non-OTA-producing strains could be caused by the presence of silent genes or by mutations in functional or regulatory genes involved in OTA production."
https://openalex.org/W2747158289,"Modeling the brain as a functional network can reveal the relationship between distributed neurophysiological processes and functional interactions between brain structures. Existing literature on functional brain networks focuses mainly on a battery of network properties in resting state employing, for example, modularity, clustering, or path length among regions. In contrast, we seek to uncover functionally connected subnetworks that predict or correlate with cohort differences and are conserved within the subjects within a cohort. We focus on differences in both the rate of learning as well as overall performance in a sensorimotor task across subjects and develop a principled approach for the discovery of discriminative subgraphs of functional connectivity based on imaging acquired during practice. We discover two statistically significant subgraph regions: one involving multiple regions in the visual cortex and another involving the parietal operculum and planum temporale. High functional coherence in the former characterizes sessions in which subjects take longer to perform the task, while high coherence in the latter is associated with high learning rate (performance improvement across trials). Our proposed methodology is general, in that it can be applied to other cognitive tasks, to study learning or to differentiate between healthy patients and patients with neurological disorders, by revealing the salient interactions among brain regions associated with the observed global state. The discovery of such significant discriminative subgraphs promises a better data-driven understanding of the dynamic brain processes associated with high-level cognitive functions."

Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to match 4284 weekend admissions with AKI-D with 14,788 admissions on weekdays.Of the 53,170 admissions with AKI-D in the whole dataset, 12,357 (23%) were at weekends. The unadjusted mortality for weekend admissions was significantly higher compared to admissions on weekdays (40·6% versus 39·6%, p 0·046). However, in multivariable analysis of the PSM cohort, the odds of death for weekend admissions with AKI-D was 1·01 (95%CI 0·93,1·09). Mortality was higher for weekend admissions in West Midlands (odds ratio (OR) 1·32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·05, 1·66) and lower in East of England (OR 0·77, 95%CI 0·59, 1·00) but was not different to weekday admissions in all other regions. In 2003-04, weekend admissions had lower odds of death (OR 0·45, 95%CI 0·21, 0·96) and in 2010-11 higher odds of death (OR 1·28, 95%CI 1·00, 1·63) but in the other ten years observed, there was no significant difference in mortality between weekday and weekend admissions. Provision of in-centre nephrology services was associated with lower odds of death at 0·57 (95%CI 0·54, 0·62).Weekend admissions in patients with AKI-D had no effect on mortality. Further research is warranted to elucidate the reasons for the lower mortality in hospitals with in-centre nephrology services."

If metabolites with carcinogenic characteristics are present in urine, the urothelial lining of the bladder could be damaged and genetically altered. In this study, we analyzed the interaction of arsenic and N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) on mouse bladder carcinogenesis. Our previous study found that arsenic affects BBN-altered urothelial enzymatic activity, protein expression, DNA oxidation and global DNA CpG methylation levels. In this study, two mouse models were used. First, after administering a co-treatment of BBN and arsenic for 20 weeks, BBN alone led to a urothelial carcinoma formation of 20%, and arsenic promoted a BBN-induced urothelial carcinoma formation of 10%. The protein expression of GSTM1, GSTO1, NQO1, and p21 did not change by arsenic along with the BBN co-treatment, but the Sp1 expression increased. In the second mouse model, BBN was a pretreatment promoter; arsenic dose-dependently deteriorated BBN-promoted dysplasia by 10% and 40% at 10 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. Conversely, BBN pretreatment also accelerated arsenic-induced dysplasia by 30%. The urothelial carcinogenic effect reversed after ceasing BBN for a period of 20 weeks. In summary, three conclusions were drawn from this study. The first is the mutual promotion of arsenic and BBN in bladder carcinogenesis. Second, arsenic dosages without bladder carcinogenicity (10 ppm) or with slight carcinogenicity (100 ppm) promote BBN-induced mice bladder cancer progression. Finally, the dysplastic urothelium had reverted to near-normal morphology after ceasing BBN intake for 20 weeks, providing a good suggestion for people who want to quit smoking."
