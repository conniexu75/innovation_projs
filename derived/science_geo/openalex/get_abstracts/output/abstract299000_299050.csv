https://openalex.org/W2037157640,"Atomic clusters containing from two to several hundred atoms offer the possibility of studying the transition from molecules to crystalline solids. The covalent group IV elements carbon, silicon, and germanium are now being examined with this long-range objective. These elements are particularly interesting because of the very different character of their crystalline solids and because they are intermediate between metals and insulators in the nature of their bonding. Small mass-selected atom cluster ions are formed by pulsed laser techniques and identified by time-of-flight methods. Laser photoexcitation is used to study the relative stability of these clusters and their modes of fragmentation. These modes for C(n)(+) clusters, which tend to fragment with a characteristic loss of a neutral C(3), are found to be different from the modes for Si(n)(+) and Ge(n)(+) clusters, which tend to fragment to ""magic"" clusters such as Si(4)(+), Si(6)(+) and Si(10)(+). These experimental results can be accounted for by recent theoretical calculations of the ground-state structure and stability of small silicon and carbon clusters. Several theoretical approaches give consistent results, showing that small silicon clusters are compact and different from small fragments of the bulk crystal. Calculations show that carbon clusters change from linear structures toward cyclic structures as the cluster size increases, but with significant odd-even differences."
https://openalex.org/W2067411867,"Comparisons are made between the volatile inventories of the terrestrial planets, including Pioneer Venus data, and the predictions of three classes of theories for the origin of planetary atmospheres. Serious difficulties arise for the primary atmosphere and external source hypotheses. The grain accretion hypothesis can account for the trends in the volatile inventory from Venus to Earth to Mars, if volatiles were incorporated into planet-forming grains at nearly the same temperature for all of these planets, but at systematically lower pressures in the regions of planet formation farther from the center of the solar nebula."
https://openalex.org/W2087546292,"The night airglow spectrum of Venus in the ultraviolet is dominated by the vâ€² = 0 progressions of the gamma and delta bands of nitric oxide. The bands are produced by two-body radiative recombination of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Since the source of these atoms is in the dayside thermosphere, the night airglow is a tracer of the day-to-night thermospheric circulation. The airglow is brightest at equatorial latitudes, and at longitudes on the morning side of the antisolar meridian."
https://openalex.org/W2053882976,"Results from the Pioneer Venus sounder probe neutral mass spectrometer indicate that there is no difference in the isotopic ratios of carbon and oxygen between Venus and Earth to within +/- 5 percent. The mixing ratio of nitrogen is 3.5(+3)(-2) percent with an isotopic ratio within 20 percent of that of Earth. The ratio of argon-36 to argon-40 is 85 percent, and the ratio of argon-38 to argon-36 is 20 percent. The mixing ratios of argon-36 and argon-40 are approximately 40 and 50 parts per million, respectively, with an error of about a factor of 2 (mainly toward a lesser amount) resulting from uncertainty in the response of the ion pump to rare gases. Hydrogen chloride cannot account for more than a few percent of the 36 mass peak, and therefore the large excess of primordial argon is a reasonable conclusion. The ratio of neon-20 to argon-36 of 0.5 +/- 0.3 is definitely terrestrial in character rather than solar. These results indicate that there is a large excess of all primordial noble gases on Venus relative to Earth. There appears to be a considerably higher abundance of sulfur compounds below 20 kilometers than in or above the main cloud layer. The 32 and 60 mass peaks show a sharp increase below 22 kilometers, indicating the possible production of sulfur and carbon oxysulfide (COS) at the expense of sulfur dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2031254360,"Pioneer Venus orbiter dual-frequency radio occultation measurements have produced many electron density profiles of the nightside ionosphere of Venus. Thirty-six of these profiles, measured at solar zenith angles (chi) from 90.60 degrees to 163.5 degrees , are discussed here. In the ""deep"" nightside ionosphere (chi > 110 degrees ), the structure and magnitude of the ionization peak are highly variable; the mean peak electron density is 16,700 +/- 7,200 (standard deviation) per cubic centimeter. In contrast, the altitude of the peak remains fairly constant with a mean of 142.2 +/- 4.1 kilometers, virtually identical to the altitude of the main peak of the dayside terminator ionosphere. The variations in the peak ionization are not directly related to contemporal variations in the solar wind speed. It is shown that electron density distributions similar to those observed in both magnitude and structure can be produced by the precipitation on the nightside of Venus of electron fluxes of about 108 per square centimeter per second with energies less than 100 electron volts. This mechanism could very likely be responsible for the maintenance of the persistent nightside ionosphere of Venus, although transport processes may also be important."
https://openalex.org/W2055239469,"Measurements of the composition, temperature, and diurnal variations of the major neutral constituents in the thermosphere of Venus are being made with a quadrupole mass spectrometer on the Pioneer Venus orbiter. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, molecular nitrogen, atomic oxygen, and helium are presented, in addition to an empirical model of the data. The concentrations of the heavy gases, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and molecular nitrogen, rapidly decrease from the evening terminator toward the nightside; the concentration of atomic oxygen remains nearly constant and the helium concentration increases, an indication of a nightside bulge. The kinetic temperature inferred from scale heights drops rapidly from 230 K at the terminator to 130 K at a solar zenith angle of 120 degrees , and to 112 K at the antisolar point."
https://openalex.org/W1983095400,"The Bennett radio-frequency ion mass spectrometer on the Pioneer Venus orbiter is returning the first direct composition evidence of the processes responsible for the formation and maintenance of the nightside ionosphere. Early results from predusk through the nightside in the solar zenith angle range 63 degrees (dusk) to 120 degrees (dawn) reveal that, as on the dayside, the lower nightside ionosphere consists of F(1)and F(2) layers dominated by O(2)(+) and O(+), respectively. Also like the dayside, the nightside composition includes distributions of NO(+), C(+), N(+), H(+), He(+), CO(2)(+), and 28(+) (a combination of CO(+) and N(2)(+)). The surprising abundance of the nightside ionosphere appears to be maintained by the transport of O(+) from the dayside, leading also to the formation of O(2)(+) through charge exchange with CO(2). Above the exobase, the upper nightside ionosphere exhibits dramatic variability in apparent response to variations in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field, with the ionopause extending to several thousand kilometers on one orbit, followed by the complete rertnoval of thermal ions to altitudes below 200 kilometers on the succeeding orbit, 24 hours later. In the upper ionosphere, considerable structure is evident in many of the nightside ion profiles. Also evident are horizontal ion drifts with velocities up to the order of 1 kilometer per second. Whereas the duskside ionopause is dominated by O(+) H(+) dominates the topside on the dawnside of the antisolar point, indicating two separate regions for ion depletion in the magnetic tail regions."
https://openalex.org/W2075587000,"Empirical models of the electron temperature and electron density of the late afternoon and nightside Venus ionosphere have been derived from Pioneer Venus measurements acquired between 10 December 1978 and 23 March 1979. The models describe the average ionosphere conditions near 18 degrees N latitude between 150 and 700 kilometers altitude for solar zenith angles of 80 degrees to 180 degrees . The average index of solar flux was 200. A major feature of the density model is the factor of 10 decrease beyond 90 degrees followed by a very gradual decrease between 120 degrees and 180 degrees . The density at 150 degrees is about five times greater than observed by Venera 9 and 10 at solar minimum (solar flux approximately 80), a difference that is probably related to the effects of increased solar activity on the processes that maintain the nightside ionosphere. The nightside electron density profile from the model (above 150 kilometers) can be reproduced theoretically either by transport of 0(+) ions from the dayside or by precipitation of low-energy electrons. The ion transport process would require a horizontal flow velocity of about 300 meters per second, a value that is consistent with other Pioneer Venus observations. Although currently available energetic electron data do not yet permit the role of precipitation to be evaluated quantitatively, this process is clearly involved to some extent in the formation of the nightside ionosphere. Perhaps the most surprising feature of the temperature model is that the electron temperature remains high throughout the nightside ionosphere. These high nocturnal temperatures and the existence of a well-defined nightside ionopause suggest that energetic processes occur across the top of the entire nightside ionosphere, maintaining elevated temperatures. A heat flux of 2 x 10(10) electron volts per square centimeter per second, introduced at the ionopause, is consistent with the average electron temperature profile on the nightside at a solar zenith angle of 140 degrees ."
https://openalex.org/W2066055271,"The altitude profiles of temperature and pressure measured during the descent of the four Pioneer Venus probes show small contrast below the clouds but significant differences within the clouds at altitudes from 45 to 61 kilometers. At 60 kilometers, the probe which entered at 59.3 degrees north latitude sensed temperatures 25 K below those of the lower latitude probes, and a sizable difference persisted down to and slightly below the cloud base. It also sensed pressure below those of the other probes by as much as 49 millibars at a mean pressure of 200 millibars. The measured pressure differences are consistent with cyclostrophic balance of zonal winds ranging from 130 +/- 20 meters per second at 60 kilometers to 60 +/- 17 meters per second at 40 kilometers, with evidence in addition of a nonaxisymmetric component of the winds. The clouds were found to be 10 to 20 K warmer than the extended profiles of the lower atmosphere, and the middle cloud is convectively unstable. Both phenomena are attributed to the absorption of thermal radiation from below. Above the clouds, in the lower stratosphere, the lapse rate decreases abruptly to 3.5 K per kilometer, and a superimposed wave is evident. At 100 kilometers, the temperature is minimum, with a mean value of about 170 K."
https://openalex.org/W1985233473,"Further results from the Venus orbiter radiometric temperature experiment (VORTEX) on the Pioneer orbiter are presented. These are used to characterize the three-dimensional temperature field, the cloud structure, and the dynamics of the 60-to 130-kilometer altitude region of the Venus atmosphere. One of the new discoveries is a ""dipole"" structure at high latitudes, with two hot spots rotating around the pole, surrounded by banks of cold cloud."
https://openalex.org/W1972369473,"Winds in the lower atmosphere of Venus, inferred from three-dimensional radio interferometric tracking of the descents of the Pioneer day and north probes, are predominantly easterly with speeds of about 1 meter per second near the surface, 50 meters per second at the bottom of the clouds, and more than 200 meters per second within the densest, middle cloud layer. Between about 25 and 55 kilometers altitude the average flow was slanted equatorward, with superimposed wavelike motions and alternating layers of high and low shear."
https://openalex.org/W2063608105,"Measurements of satellite drag obtained from the orbital decay of the Pioneer Venus orbiter on the nightside of Venus indicate an atomic oxygen atmosphere near 155 kilometers (an order of magnitude less dense than expected) with nighttime inferred exospheric temperatures averaging as low as 110 K. Densities at these altitudes decrease sharply from day to night, contrary to the predicted nighttime oxygen bulge. This decrease may be indicative of an unexpectedly weak transport across the evening terminator or a very strong heat sink at night that is possibly related to vertical eddy heat transport. Large periodic oscillations in density and inferred exospheric temperature are detected with a period of 5 to 6 days. We have subsequently discovered temperature variations of the same period in the stratosphere, which are tentatively interpreted as planetary-scale waves that may propagate upward producing the periodic variations in the thermosphere and exosphere. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the temperature oscillations associated with these waves apparently increases with altitude approximately as follows: 1 K (70 kilometers), 3 K (90 kilometers), 40 K (155 kilometers). Inferred nighttime exospheric temperatures are found to be asymmetric relative to midnight, minimizing on the morning side. The possibility of superrotation of the thermosphere, and exosphere is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2095086142,"The multimodal microstructure of the Venus cloud system has been examined. In addition to confirmed H(2)SO(4) droplets and suspected elemental sulfur, a highly concentrated aerosol population has been observed extending above, within, and below the cloud system. These aerosols appear to cycle through the cloud droplets, but can never be removed by the weak precipitation mechanisms present. All cloud particles are likely laced with aerosol contaminants. Sedimentation and decomposition of H(2)SO(4) in the droplets of the lower cloud region contribute more than 7 watts per square meter of heat flux equaling one-fourth of the solar net flux at 50 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2001506412,"Organic dianions have been stabilized by (M(C(5)(CH(3))(5))(2))(+), where M is iron or cobalt. This has allowed the structural and spectroscopic characterization of these dianions. The structure of (M(C(5)(CH(3))(5))(2))(2)(+) (DDQ)(2-), where DDQ is 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone, has been determined by x-ray crystallography. The structure of (DDQ)(2-)is consistent with ab initio molecular orbital calculations that suggest a localizd as opposed to a delocalized (aromatic) ring structure."
https://openalex.org/W1974372545,"Three large Venus surface features, identified previously in images obtained from Earth-based radar observations, are shown by the Pioneer Venus radar mapper to be elevated 5 to 10 kilometers above the surrounding terrain. Two of these features, one bright and the other dark, lie adjacent to each other astride the 65Â°N parallel between longitudes 310Â°E and 10Â°E. The combined region forms a huge tectonically uplifted plateau, surmounted by radar-bright ridges that may have either a volcanic or tectonic origin. The third feature, located at 30Â°N, 283Â°E, is radar-bright and may consist of volcanic material extruded along a fault zone. A first radar-scattering image, compiled from data obtained by the mapper in its imaging mode, shows a region north of the equator; several circular depressions seen in this area may result from meteoritic impact."
https://openalex.org/W1990136242,"Several photometric measurements of Venus made from the Pioneer Venus orbiter and probes indicate that solar near-ultraviolet radiation is being absorbed throughout much of the main cloud region, but little above the clouds or within the first one or two optical depths. Radiative transfer calculations were carried out to simulate both Pioneer Venus and ground-based data for a number of proposed cloud compositions. This comparison rules out models invoking nitrogen dioxide, meteoritic material, and volatile metals as the source of the ultraviolet absorption. Models involving either small ( approximately 1 micrometer) or large ( approximately 10 micrometers) sulfur particles have some serious difficulties, while ones invoking sulfur dioxide gas appear to be promising."
https://openalex.org/W2060271992,"In this report the fluxes measured by the solar flux radiometer (LSFR) of the Pioneer Venus large probe are compared with calculations for model atmospheres. If the large particles of the middle and lower clouds are assumed to be sulfur, strong, short-wavelength absorption results in a net flux profile significantly different from the LSFR net flux measurements. Models in which the smallest particles are assumed to be sulfur gave flux profiles consistent with the measurements if an additional source of absorption is included in the upper cloud. The narrowband data from 0.590 to 0.665 micrometer indicate an absorption optical depth of about 0.05 below the cloud bottom. The broadband data imply that either this absorption extends over a considerable wavelength interval (as might be the case for dust) or that a very strong absorption band lies on one side of the narrowband filter (as suggested by early Venera 11 and Venera 12 reports). Thermal balance calculations based on the measured visible fluxes indicate high surface temperature for reasonable assumptions of cloud opacity and water vapor abundance. The lapse rate becomes convective within the middle cloud. For water mixing ratios of 2.0 x 10(-4) below the clouds we find a subadiabatic region extending from the cloud bottom to altitudes near 35 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2065637752,"Ultraviolet images of Venus over a 3-month period show marked evolution of the planetary scale features in the cloud patterns. The dark horizontal Y feature recurs quasi-periodically, at intervals of about 4 days, but it has also been absent for periods of several weeks. Bow-shaped features observed in Pioneer Venus images are farther upstream from the subsolar point than those in Mariner 10 images."
https://openalex.org/W2093989912,The Geodynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite (GEOS-3) radar altimeter has provided some information on the dynamic sea-surface topography of the global oceans. Regional studies of the densely surveyed Sargasso Sea indicate that the average nontidal variability of the oceans is +/- 28 centimeters. Sea-surface highs and lows determined from GEOS-3 altimetry correlate favorably with eddy structures inferred from Nimbus-6 infrared imagery.
https://openalex.org/W2013482139,Net radiation measurements in the atmosphere of Venus indicate that the bulk of the atmosphere is radiatively cooling at high latitudes and heating at low latitudes. Similarity of features observed by all three probes indicate planetwide stratification. Flux variations within the clouds provide evidence of significant differences in cloud structure. A feature of unusually large opacity found near 60 kilometers at the north probe site is probably related to the unique circulation regime revealed by ultraviolet and infrared imagery. A stable layer between the cloud bottoms and about 35 kilometers contains several features in the flux profiles probably resulting from large-scale compositional stratifications rather than clouds. In the layer below 35 kilometers unexpectedly large fluxes were observed.
https://openalex.org/W4243066409,"A large catalog of materials has been proposed as potential seabed resources, and some seabed materials such as hydrocarbons and tin already contribute to the world's economy. Scientific advances have increased our knowledge of other seabed prospects, but realization of their potential will be determined by their relative economic accessibility compared to rival resources on land. Examination of existing stocks of conventional resources, and of the economic process by which new resources are added, suggests that most potential sources of seabed materials will not be exploited in the near future. Strategic behavior in seabed materials development, however, implies that investment in exploration and R&D could proceed on a larger scale and at a more rapid pace than might be expected solely on the basis of apparent commercial potential."
https://openalex.org/W2021588277,"Backscattering data for the nephelometer experiments conducted aboard the Pioneer Venus mission probes, including data up to the highest altitudes measured by the probes, are presented. A few small signals were detected below the main cloud deck. Ambient radiation was measured at near-ultraviolet and visible wavelengths; the variation of extinction of near-ultraviolet with altitude is inferred. Ambient radiance decreased more rapidly at 530 than at 745 nanometers in the lower atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2030729297,"Laboratory simulation and tests of the inlet sampling system and columns of the Pioneer Venus gas chromatograph show that the sensitivity to argon is not diminished after the column regeneration step, argon isotopes are not separated, oxygen and sulfur dioxide are not produced in the inlet sampling system from sulfur trioxide, and sulfur trioxide is not formed from sulfur dioxide and oxygen. Comparisons of the volatile inventory of Venus and Earth imply similar efficiencies of early outgassing but a lower efficiency for later outgassing in the case of Venus. The high oxidation state of the Venus atmosphere in the region of cloud formation may prohibit the generation of elemental sulfur particles."
https://openalex.org/W2093171176,"The line-of-sight gravity field for Venus has been mapped by tracking the Pioneer Venus spacecraft in the vicinity of periapsis for a 45Â° swath of longitude eastward of 294Â°. There are consistent and systematic variations in the gravity signature from orbit to orbit, attesting to the reality of observed anomalies. Orbit 93 passes over a large positive topographic feature, the ""northern plateau,"" for which there is no corresponding gravity signature. If this region has no isostatic compensation, the gravity signal would exceed the noise level by a factor of 7. The results of simulation modeling indicate that the northern plateau must be compensated at depths of about 100 kilometers or less. The long-wavelength anomalies seen in the Venus gravity data have been Fourier-decomposed along the orbital tracks and compared to analogous spectra for Earth. The gross power in the two mean spectra is approximately the same, but systematic variations among the harmonics suggest differences in dynamic processes or lithospheric behavior, or both, for the two planets."
https://openalex.org/W2006108284,"The 2.3-gigahertz log-amplitude fluctuations observed in the radio links of the Pioneer Venus entry probes during Venus encounter have been used to study turbulence in the Venus atmosphere. The deduced estimates of the upper bound of structure constant c(n) of the refractive index fluctuations (c(n) less, similar 4 x 10(-8) cm(-(1/3))) are inconsistent with similar entry probe measurements by Veneras 4 to 8 but are consistent with the radio occultation measurements by flyby (Mariners 5 and 10) and orbiting (Venerat 9) spacecraft. The Pioneer Venus measurements therefore provide a resolution of the long-standing order of magnitude discrepancy between these earlier measurements of c(n)."
https://openalex.org/W2068234154,A summary is presented of the scientific results obtained during the first 120 days of the Pioneer Venus orbiter mission and produced by analysis of multiprobe data as of about 1 April 1979. The summary is essentially a guide to the material presented in the reports devoted to Pioneer Venus results in this issue of Science.
https://openalex.org/W2070599929,"This report is an introduction to the accompanying collection of early results from the Pioneer Venus orbiter and multiprobe missions, which encountered Venus on 4 December and 9 December 1978, respectively. Initial results for the multiprobe mission and for the first 30 days of the orbiter mission were reported in the 23 February issue of Science. Additional mission features and updated mission parameters based on refined tracking data and trajectory computations are presented here. New scientific results for both missions are given in the subsequent reports which cover the first 130 days (or orbits) of the nominal 243-day orbiter mission."
https://openalex.org/W2009372368,"The second High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO-2, Einstein) is revolutionizing x-ray astronomy just as its namesake revolutionized physics. Earlier x-ray observatories, including HEAO-1, were designed to scan the sky for x-ray emitters. With Einstein, the challenge has shifted from discovering x-ray sources to understanding the processes producing the x-rays. But having 500 times the sensitivity of previous detectors, Einstein makes more than its share of discoveries, too. For example, it sees distant quasars and clusters of galaxies that can barely be detected by the largest optical telescopes."
