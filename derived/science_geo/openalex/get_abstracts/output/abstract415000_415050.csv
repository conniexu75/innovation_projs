https://openalex.org/W2070726080,"Kejia Cai et al. describe a method to non-invasively detect glutamate (Glu) concentrations in the brain with MRI at high resolution. The approach is based on the pH-dependent chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) effect between the amino group of Glu and bulk water and offers advantages over proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Feasibility of GluCEST was demonstrated in rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke and in a rat brain tumor model, as well as in healthy human brain at 7 Tesla. Glutamate, a major neurotransmitter in the brain, shows a pH- and concentration-dependent chemical exchange saturation transfer effect (GluCEST) between its amine group and bulk water, with potential for in vivo imaging by nuclear magnetic resonance. GluCEST asymmetry is observed ∼3 p.p.m. downfield from bulk water. Middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat brain resulted in an ∼100% elevation of GluCEST in the ipsilateral side compared with the contralateral side, predominantly owing to pH changes. In a rat brain tumor model with blood-brain barrier disruption, intravenous glutamate injection resulted in a clear elevation of GluCEST and a similar increase in the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy signal of glutamate. GluCEST maps from healthy human brain were also obtained. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using GluCEST for mapping relative changes in glutamate concentration, as well as pH, in vivo. Contributions from other brain metabolites to the GluCEST effect are also discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2019251983,"Coordinating Synapses Cortical microcircuits produce cell assemblies that emit spatiotemporally orchestrated spiking activity. These activity patterns are decoded by the dendrites of downstream neurons. Whether synaptic inputs are clustered or dispersed over target dendrites at a given time is critical for determining dendritic computational power. However, such subcellular dynamics are poorly understood. In rodent organotypic slice cultures, Takahashi et al. (p. 353 ) found that dendritic spine activities were frequently synchronized within a group of spines in the immediate vicinity of one another. This local synchronization seems to reflect convergent synaptic inputs from intrinsically synchronized presynaptic neuron populations."
https://openalex.org/W2068684244,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provide new prospects for studying human neurodevelopment and modeling neurological disease. In particular, iPSC-derived neural cells permit a direct comparison of disease-relevant molecular pathways in neurons and glia derived from patients and healthy individuals. A prerequisite for such comparative studies are robust protocols that efficiently yield standardized populations of neural cell types. Here we show that long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial-like stem cells (lt-NES cells) derived from 3 hESC and 6 iPSC lines in two independent laboratories exhibit consistent characteristics including i) continuous expandability in the presence of FGF2 and EGF; ii) stable neuronal and glial differentiation competence; iii) characteristic transcription factor profile; iv) hindbrain specification amenable to regional patterning; v) capacity to generate functionally mature human neurons. We further show that lt-NES cells are developmentally distinct from fetal tissue-derived radial glia-like stem cells. We propose that lt-NES cells provide an interesting tool for studying human neurodevelopment and may serve as a standard system to facilitate comparative analyses of hESC and hiPSC-derived neural cells from control and diseased genetic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2076098030,"Background Preclinical data support further investigation of ascorbic acid in pancreatic cancer. There are currently insufficient safety data in human subjects, particularly when ascorbic acid is combined with chemotherapy. Methods and Findings 14 subjects with metastatic stage IV pancreatic cancer were recruited to receive an eight week cycle of intravenous ascorbic acid (three infusions per week), using a dose escalation design, along with standard treatment of gemcitabine and erlotinib. Of 14 recruited subjects enrolled, nine completed the study (three in each dosage tier). There were fifteen non-serious adverse events and eight serious adverse events, all likely related to progression of disease or treatment with gemcitabine or erlotinib. Applying RECIST 1.0 criteria, seven of the nine subjects had stable disease while the other two had progressive disease. Conclusions These initial safety data do not reveal increased toxicity with the addition of ascorbic acid to gemcitabine and erlotinib in pancreatic cancer patients. This, combined with the observed response to treatment, suggests the need for a phase II study of longer duration. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00954525"
https://openalex.org/W2066270788,"Ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) show high allele frequency divergence between different ancestral or geographically distant populations. These genetic markers are especially useful in inferring the likely ancestral origin of an individual or estimating the apportionment of ancestry components in admixed individuals or populations. The study of AIMs is of great interest in clinical genetics research, particularly to detect and correct for population substructure effects in case-control association studies, but also in population and forensic genetics studies. This work presents a set of 46 ancestry-informative insertion deletion polymorphisms selected to efficiently measure population admixture proportions of four different origins (African, European, East Asian and Native American). All markers are analyzed in short fragments (under 230 basepairs) through a single PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) allowing a very simple one tube PCR-to-CE approach. HGDP-CEPH diversity panel samples from the four groups, together with Oceanians, were genotyped to evaluate the efficiency of the assay in clustering populations from different continental origins and to establish reference databases. In addition, other populations from diverse geographic origins were tested using the HGDP-CEPH samples as reference data. The results revealed that the AIM-INDEL set developed is highly efficient at inferring the ancestry of individuals and provides good estimates of ancestry proportions at the population level. In conclusion, we have optimized the multiplexed genotyping of 46 AIM-INDELs in a simple and informative assay, enabling a more straightforward alternative to the commonly available AIM-SNP typing methods dependent on complex, multi-step protocols or implementation of large-scale genotyping technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2047487133,"Perturbations in the adipocytokine profile, especially higher levels of leptin, are a major cause of breast tumor progression and metastasis; the underlying mechanisms, however, are not well understood. In particular, it remains elusive whether leptin is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we provide molecular evidence that leptin induces breast cancer cells to undergo a transition from epithelial to spindle-like mesenchymal morphology. Investigating the downstream mediator(s) that may direct leptin-induced EMT, we found functional interactions between leptin, metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), and Wnt1 signaling components. Leptin increases accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin leading to increased promoter recruitment. Silencing of β-catenin or treatment with the small molecule inhibitor, ICG-001, inhibits leptin-induced EMT, invasion, and tumorsphere formation. Mechanistically, leptin stimulates phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) via Akt activation resulting in a substantial decrease in the formation of the GSK3β-LKB1-Axin complex that leads to increased accumulation of β-catenin. Leptin treatment also increases Wnt1 expression that contributes to GSK3β phosphorylation. Inhibition of Wnt1 abrogates leptin-stimulated GSK3β phosphorylation. We also discovered that leptin increases the expression of an important modifier of Wnt1 signaling, MTA1, which is integral to leptin-mediated regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as silencing of MTA1 inhibits leptin-induced Wnt1 expression, GSK3β phosphorylation, and β-catenin activation. Furthermore, analysis of leptin-treated breast tumors shows increased expression of Wnt1, pGSK3β, and vimentin along with higher nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and reduced E-cadherin expression providing in vivo evidence for a previously unrecognized cross-talk between leptin and MTA1/Wnt signaling in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2060428146,"The relationship between the mineral component of bone and associated collagen has been a matter of continued dispute. We use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of cryogenically ion milled sections of fully-mineralized cortical bone to study the spatial and topological relationship between mineral and collagen. We observe that hydroxyapatite (HA) occurs largely as elongated plate-like structures which are external to and oriented parallel to the collagen fibrils. Dark field images suggest that the structures (“mineral structures”) are polycrystalline. They are approximately 5 nm thick, 70 nm wide and several hundred nm long. Using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis we show that approximately 70% of the HA occurs as mineral structures external to the fibrils. The remainder is found constrained to the gap zones. Comparative studies of other species suggest that this structural motif is ubiquitous in all vertebrates."

These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for PGE(2) in the promotion of tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1968731846,"p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a type II ATPase associated with various cellular activities that forms a homohexamer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (N-domain); two ATPase domains, D1 and D2; and a disordered C-terminal region. Little is known about the role of the N-domain or the C-terminal region in the p97 ATPase cycle. In the p97-associated human disease inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia, the majority of missense mutations are located at the N-domain D1 interface. Structure-based predictions suggest that such mutations affect the interaction of the N-domain with D1. Here we have tested ten major inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia-linked mutants for ATPase activity and found that all have increased activity over the wild type, with one mutant, p97A232E, having three times higher activity. Further mutagenesis of p97A232E shows that the increase in ATPase activity is mediated through D2 and requires both the N-domain and a flexible ND1 linker. A disulfide mutation that locks the N-domain to D1 in a coplanar position reversibly abrogates ATPase activity. A cryo-EM reconstruction of p97A232E suggests that the N-domains are flexible. Removal of the C-terminal region also reduces ATPase activity. Taken together, our data suggest that the conformation of the N-domain in relation to the D1-D2 hexamer is directly linked to ATP hydrolysis and that the C-terminal region is required for hexamer stability. This leads us to propose a model where the N-domain adopts either of two conformations: a flexible conformation compatible with ATP hydrolysis or a coplanar conformation that is inactive. p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a type II ATPase associated with various cellular activities that forms a homohexamer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (N-domain); two ATPase domains, D1 and D2; and a disordered C-terminal region.

https://openalex.org/W2119382114,"It has been demonstrated that motor coordination of interacting people plays a crucial role in the success of social exchanges. Abnormal movements have been reported during interpersonal interactions of patients suffering from schizophrenia and a motor coordination breakdown could explain this social interaction deficit, which is one of the main and earliest features of the illness. Using the dynamical systems framework, the goal of the current study was (i) to investigate whether social motor coordination is impaired in schizophrenia and (ii) to determine the underlying perceptual or cognitive processes that may be affected. We examined intentional and unintentional social motor coordination in participants oscillating hand-held pendulums from the wrist. The control group consisted of twenty healthy participant pairs while the experimental group consisted of twenty participant pairs that included one participant suffering from schizophrenia. The results showed that unintentional social motor coordination was preserved while intentional social motor coordination was impaired. In intentional coordination, the schizophrenia group displayed coordination patterns that had lower stability and in which the patient never led the coordination. A coupled oscillator model suggests that the schizophrenia group coordination pattern was due to a decrease in the amount of available information together with a delay in information transmission. Our study thus identified relational motor signatures of schizophrenia and opens new perspectives for detecting the illness and improving social interactions of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2088621186,"As major effector cells of the innate immune response, macrophages must adeptly migrate from blood to infected tissues. Endothelial transmigration is accomplished by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-induced degradation of basement membrane and extracellular matrix components. The classical activation of macrophages with LPS and IFN-γ causes enhanced microtubule (MT) stabilization and secretion of MMPs. Macrophages up-regulate MMP-9 expression and secretion upon immunological challenge and require its activity for migration during the inflammatory response. However, the dynamics of MMP-9 production and intracellular distribution as well as the mechanisms responsible for its trafficking are unknown. Using immunofluorescent imaging, we localized intracellular MMP-9 to small Golgi-derived cytoplasmic vesicles that contained calreticulin and protein-disulfide isomerase in activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. We demonstrated vesicular organelles of MMP-9 aligned along stable subsets of MTs and showed that selective modulation of MT dynamics contributes to the enhanced trafficking of MMP-9 extracellularly. We found a Rab3D-dependent association of MMP-9 vesicles with the molecular motor kinesin, whose association with the MT network was greatly enhanced after macrophage activation. Finally, we implicated kinesin 5B and 3B isoforms in the effective trafficking of MMP-9 extracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W2103673770,"Identification of gene expression profiles of cancer stem cells may have significant implications in the understanding of tumor biology and for the design of novel treatments targeted toward these cells. Here we report a potential ovarian cancer stem cell gene expression profile from isolated side population of fresh ascites obtained from women with high-grade advanced stage papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used to interrogate the differentially expressed genes between side population (SP) and main population (MP), and the results were analyzed by paired T-test using BRB-ArrayTools. We identified 138 up-regulated and 302 down-regulated genes that were differentially expressed between all 10 SP/MP pairs. Microarray data was validated using qRT-PCR and17/19 (89.5%) genes showed robust correlations between microarray and qRT-PCR expression data. The Pathway Studio analysis identified several genes involved in cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis which are unique to SP cells and a mechanism for the activation of Notch signaling is identified. To validate these findings, we have identified and isolated SP cells enriched for cancer stem cells from human ovarian cancer cell lines. The SP populations were having a higher colony forming efficiency in comparison to its MP counterpart and also capable of sustained expansion and differentiation in to SP and MP phenotypes. 50,000 SP cells produced tumor in nude mice whereas the same number of MP cells failed to give any tumor at 8 weeks after injection. The SP cells demonstrated a dose dependent sensitivity to specific γ-secretase inhibitors implicating the role of Notch signaling pathway in SP cell survival. Further the generated SP gene list was found to be enriched in recurrent ovarian cancer tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2041915407,"Intentional binding refers to the fact that when a voluntary action produces a sensory outcome, action and outcome are perceived as being closer together in time. This phenomenon is often attributed, at least partially, to predictive motor mechanisms. However, previous studies failed to unequivocally attribute intentional binding to these mechanisms, since the contrasts that have been used to demonstrate intentional binding covered not only one but two processes: temporal control and motor identity prediction. In the present study we aimed to isolate the respective role of each of these processes in the emergence of intentional binding of action-effects. The results show that motor identity prediction does not modulate intentional binding of action-effects. Our findings cast doubts on the assumption that intentional binding of action effects is linked to internal forward predictive process."

However, it is still unclear whether an intensive bout of exercise can affect the energy consumption of obese children and adolescents.To compare the impact of high vs. moderate intensity exercises on subsequent 24-h energy intake, macronutrient preferences, appetite sensations, energy expenditure and balance in obese adolescent.This randomized cross-over trial involves 15 obese adolescent boys who were asked to randomly complete three 24-h sessions in a metabolic chamber, each separated by at least 7 days: (1) sedentary (SED); (2) Low-Intensity Exercise (LIE) (40% maximal oxygen uptake, VO(2)max); (3) High-Intensity Exercise (HIE) (75%VO(2)max).Despite unchanged appetite sensations, 24-h total energy intake following HIE was 6-11% lower compared to LIE and SED (p<0.05), whereas no differences appeared between SED and LIE. Energy intake at lunch was 9.4% and 8.4% lower after HIE compared to SED and LIE, respectively (p<0.05). At dinner time, it was 20.5% and 19.7% lower after HIE compared to SED and LIE, respectively (p<0.01). 24-h energy expenditure was not significantly altered. Thus, the 24-h energy balance was significantly reduced during HIE compared to SED and LIE (p<0.01), whereas those of SED and LIE did not differ.In obese adolescent boys, HIE has a beneficial impact on 24-h energy balance, mainly due to the spontaneous decrease in energy intake during lunch and dinner following the exercise bout. Prescribing high-intensity exercises to promote weight loss may therefore provide effective results without affecting appetite sensations and, as a result, food frustrations.ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01036360."

https://openalex.org/W2112639893,"DNA damage triggers a complex signaling cascade involving a multitude of phosphorylation events. We found that the threonine 7 (Thr-7) residue of heat shock protein 90α (Hsp90α) was phosphorylated immediately after DNA damage. The phosphorylated Hsp90α then accumulated at sites of DNA double strand breaks and formed repair foci with slow kinetics, matching the repair kinetics of complex DNA damage. The phosphorylation of Hsp90α was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases, including the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in particular. DNA-PK plays an essential role in the repair of DNA double strand breaks by nonhomologous end-joining and in the signaling of DNA damage. It is also present in the cytoplasm of the cell and has been suggested to play a role in cytoplasmic signaling pathways. Using stabilized double-stranded DNA molecules to activate DNA-PK, we showed that an active DNA-PK complex could be assembled in the cytoplasm, resulting in phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic pool of Hsp90α. In vivo, reverse phase protein array data for tumors revealed that basal levels of Thr-7-phosphorylated Hsp90α were correlated with phosphorylated histone H2AX levels. The Thr-7 phosphorylation of the ubiquitously produced and secreted Hsp90α may therefore serve as a surrogate biomarker of DNA damage. These findings shed light on the interplay between central DNA repair enzymes and an essential molecular chaperone."
https://openalex.org/W1964726939,"IL-31 is a pruritogenic cytokine, and IL-33 is an alarmin for damaging inflammation. They together relate to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). Eosinophil infiltration into the inner dermal compartment is a predominant pathological feature of AD. We herein investigated the in vitro inflammatory effects of IL-31 and IL-33 on the activation of human eosinophils and dermal fibroblasts.Receptors, adhesion molecules and signaling molecules were assessed by Western blot or flow cytometry. Chemokines and cytokine were quantitated by multiplex assay. Functional IL-31 receptor component IL-31RA, OSMR-β and IL-33 receptor component ST2 were constitutively expressed on the surface of eosinophils. Co-culture of eosinophils and fibroblasts significantly induced pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and AD-related chemokines CXCL1, CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL5. Such inductions were further enhanced with IL-31 and IL-33 stimulation. IL-31 and IL-33 could significantly provoke the release of CXCL8 from eosinophils and fibroblasts, respectively, which was further enhanced upon co-culture. In co-culture, eosinophils and fibroblasts were the main source for the release of CCL5, and IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10 and CCL2, respectively. Direct interaction between eosinophils and fibroblasts was required for CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL8 and CCL5 release. Cell surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on eosinophils and fibroblasts was up-regulated in co-culture upon IL-31 and IL-33 stimulation. The interaction between eosinophils and fibroblasts under IL-31 and IL-33 stimulation differentially activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathways. Using specific signaling molecule inhibitors, the differential induction of IL-31 and IL-33-mediated release of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6 and CXCL8 from co-culture should be related to their distinct activation profile of intracellular signaling pathways.The above findings suggest a crucial immunopathological role of IL-31 and IL-33 in AD through the activation of eosinophils-fibroblasts interaction via differential intracellular signaling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2050216133,"Progesterone, via its nuclear receptor (PR), exerts an overall tumorigenic effect on both uterine fibroid (leiomyoma) and breast cancer tissues, whereas the antiprogestin RU486 inhibits growth of these tissues through an unknown mechanism. Here, we determined the interaction between common or cell-specific genome-wide binding sites of PR and mRNA expression in RU486-treated uterine leiomyoma and breast cancer cells.ChIP-sequencing revealed 31,457 and 7,034 PR-binding sites in breast cancer and uterine leiomyoma cells, respectively; 1,035 sites overlapped in both cell types. Based on the chromatin-PR interaction in both cell types, we statistically refined the consensus progesterone response element to G•ACA• • •TGT•C. We identified two striking differences between uterine leiomyoma and breast cancer cells. First, the cis-regulatory elements for HSF, TEF-1, and C/EBPα and β were statistically enriched at genomic RU486/PR-targets in uterine leiomyoma, whereas E2F, FOXO1, FOXA1, and FOXF sites were preferentially enriched in breast cancer cells. Second, 51.5% of RU486-regulated genes in breast cancer cells but only 6.6% of RU486-regulated genes in uterine leiomyoma cells contained a PR-binding site within 5 kb from their transcription start sites (TSSs), whereas 75.4% of RU486-regulated genes contained a PR-binding site farther than 50 kb from their TSSs in uterine leiomyoma cells. RU486 regulated only seven mRNAs in both cell types. Among these, adipophilin (PLIN2), a pro-differentiation gene, was induced via RU486 and PR via the same regulatory region in both cell types.Our studies have identified molecular components in a RU486/PR-controlled gene network involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell migration, and extracellular matrix function. Tissue-specific and common patterns of genome-wide PR binding and gene regulation may determine the therapeutic effects of antiprogestins in uterine fibroids and breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2084823216,"Uveal melanoma is an aggressive cancer that metastasizes to the liver in about half of the patients, with a high lethality rate. Identification of patients at high risk of metastases may provide indication for a frequent follow-up for early detection of metastases and treatment. The analysis of the gene expression profiles of primary human uveal melanomas showed high expression of SDCBP gene (encoding for syndecan-binding protein-1 or mda-9/syntenin), which appeared higher in patients with recurrence, whereas expression of syndecans was lower and unrelated to progression. Moreover, we found that high expression of SDCBP gene was related to metastatic progression in two additional independent datasets of uveal melanoma patients. More importantly, immunohistochemistry showed that high expression of mda-9/syntenin protein in primary tumors was significantly related to metastatic recurrence in our cohort of patients. Mda-9/syntenin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in cultured uveal melanoma cells or primary tumors. Interestingly, mda-9/syntenin showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in cell lines and in a fraction of patients, suggesting its possible involvement in nuclear functions. A pseudo-metastatic model of uveal melanoma to the liver was developed in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ null mice and the study of mda-9/syntenin expression in primary and metastatic lesions revealed higher mda-9/syntenin in metastases. The inhibition of SDCBP expression by siRNA impaired the ability of uveal melanoma cells to migrate in a wound-healing assay. Moreover, silencing of SDCBP in mda-9/syntenin-high uveal melanoma cells inhibited the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered invasion of matrigel membranes and inhibited the activation of FAK, AKT and Src. Conversely syntenin overexpression in mda-9/syntenin-low uveal melanoma cells mediated opposite effects. These results suggest that mda-9/syntenin is involved in uveal melanoma progression and that it warrants further investigation as a candidate molecular marker of metastases and a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2081014220,"Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorder, results from the inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Previously, wildtype GCase was used for high throughput screening (HTS) of large collections of compounds to identify small molecule chaperones that could be developed as new therapies for GD. However, the compounds identified from HTS usually showed reduced potency later in confirmatory cell-based assays. An alternate strategy is to perform HTS on mutant enzyme to identify different lead compounds, including those enhancing mutant enzyme activities. We developed a new screening assay using enzyme extract prepared from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher disease with genotype N370S/N370S. In tissue extracts, GCase is in a more native physiological environment, and is present with the native activator saposin C and other potential cofactors. Using this assay, we screened a library of 250,000 compounds and identified novel modulators of mutant GCase including 14 new lead inhibitors and 30 lead activators. The activities of some of the primary hits were confirmed in subsequent cell-based assays using patient-derived fibroblasts. These results suggest that primary screening assays using enzyme extracted from tissues is an alternative approach to identify high quality, physiologically relevant lead compounds for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2040234391,"IL-1 family ligand does not possess a typical hydrophobic signal peptide and needs a processing enzyme for maturation. The maturation process of IL-33 (IL-1F11), a new member of the IL-1 family ligand, remains unclear. Precursor IL-33 ligand affinity column isolates neutrophil proteinase 3 (PR3) from human urinary proteins. PR3 is a known IL-1 family ligand-processing enzyme for IL-1β (IL-1F2) and IL-18 (IL-1F4), including other inflammatory cytokines. We investigated PR3 in the maturation process of precursor IL-33 because we isolated urinary PR3 by using the precursor IL-33 ligand affinity column. PR3 converted inactive human and mouse precursor IL-33 proteins to biological active forms; however, the increase of PR3 incubation time abrogated IL-33 activities. Unlike caspase-1-cleaved precursor IL-18, PR3 cut precursor IL-33 and IL-18 at various sites and yielded multibands. The increased incubation period of PR3 abated mature IL-33 in a time-dependent manner. The result is consistent with the decreased bioactivity of IL-33 along with the increased PR3 incubation time. Six different human and mouse recombinant IL-33 proteins were expressed by the predicted consensus amino acid sequence of PR3 cleavage sites and tested for bioactivities. The human IL-33/p1 was highly active, but human IL-33/p2 and p3 proteins were inactive. Our results suggest the dual functions (activation/termination) of PR3 in IL-33 biological activity."

Swarming behavior has been observed in many groups of organisms, including humans, and recent research has revealed that plants also demonstrate social behavior based on mutual interaction with other individuals. However, this behavior has not previously been analyzed in the context of swarming. Here, we show that roots can be influenced by their neighbors to induce a tendency to align the directions of their growth. In the apparently noisy patterns formed by growing roots, episodic alignments are observed as the roots grow close to each other. These events are incompatible with the statistics of purely random growth. We present experimental results and a theoretical model that describes the growth of maize roots in terms of swarming."
https://openalex.org/W2008979886,"Approximately 50 years ago, Nile tilapia were accidentally introduced to Brazil, and the decline of pearl cichlid populations, which has been intensified by habitat degradation, in some locations has been associated with the presence of Nile tilapia. There is, however, little strong empirical evidence for the negative interaction of non-native fish populations with native fish populations; such evidence would indicate a potential behavioural mechanism that could cause the population of the native fish to decline. In this study, we show that in fights staged between pairs of Nile tilapia and pearl cichlids of differing body size, the Nile tilapia were more aggressive than the pearl cichlid. Because this effect prevailed over body-size effects, the pearl cichlids were at a disadvantage. The niche overlap between the Nile tilapia and the pearl cichlid in nature, and the competitive advantage shown by the Nile tilapia in this study potentially represent one of several possible results of the negative interactions imposed by an invasive species. These negative effects may reduce population viability of the native species and cause competitive exclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2020185102,"Background Laboratory studies have suggested that antibiotic resistance may result in decreased fitness in the bacteria that harbor it. Observational studies have supported this, but due to ethical and practical considerations, it is rare to have experimental control over antibiotic prescription rates. Methods and Findings We analyze data from a 54-month longitudinal trial that monitored pneumococcal drug resistance during and after biannual mass distribution of azithromycin for the elimination of the blinding eye disease, trachoma. Prescription of azithromycin and antibiotics that can create cross-resistance to it is rare in this part of the world. As a result, we were able to follow trends in resistance with minimal influence from unmeasured antibiotic use. Using these data, we fit a probabilistic disease transmission model that included two resistant strains, corresponding to the two dominant modes of resistance to macrolide antibiotics. We estimated the relative fitness of these two strains to be 0.86 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.90), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.93), relative to antibiotic-sensitive strains. We then used these estimates to predict that, within 5 years of the last antibiotic treatment, there would be a 95% chance of elimination of macrolide resistance by intra-species competition alone. Conclusions Although it is quite possible that the fitness cost of macrolide resistance is sufficient to ensure its eventual elimination in the absence of antibiotic selection, this process takes time, and prevention is likely the best policy in the fight against resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2029498053,"Mitochondria exist as a network of interconnected organelles undergoing constant fission and fusion. Current approaches to study mitochondrial morphology are limited by low data sampling coupled with manual identification and classification of complex morphological phenotypes. Here we propose an integrated mechanistic and data-driven modeling approach to analyze heterogeneous, quantified datasets and infer relations between mitochondrial morphology and apoptotic events. We initially performed high-content, multi-parametric measurements of mitochondrial morphological, apoptotic, and energetic states by high-resolution imaging of human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Subsequently, decision tree-based analysis was used to automatically classify networked, fragmented, and swollen mitochondrial subpopulations, at the single-cell level and within cell populations. Our results revealed subtle but significant differences in morphology class distributions in response to various apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, key mitochondrial functional parameters including mitochondrial membrane potential and Bax activation, were measured under matched conditions. Data-driven fuzzy logic modeling was used to explore the non-linear relationships between mitochondrial morphology and apoptotic signaling, combining morphological and functional data as a single model. Modeling results are in accordance with previous studies, where Bax regulates mitochondrial fragmentation, and mitochondrial morphology influences mitochondrial membrane potential. In summary, we established and validated a platform for mitochondrial morphological and functional analysis that can be readily extended with additional datasets. We further discuss the benefits of a flexible systematic approach for elucidating specific and general relationships between mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083062699,"Human myeloid α-defensins called HNPs play multiple roles in innate host defense. The Trp-26 residue of HNP1 was previously shown to contribute importantly to its ability to kill S. aureus, inhibit anthrax lethal factor (LF), bind gp120 of HIV-1, dimerize, and undergo further self-association. To gain additional insights into the functional significance of dimerization, we compared wild type HNP1 to dimerization-impaired, N-methylated HNP1 monomers and to disulfide-tethered obligate HNP1 dimers. The structural effects of these modifications were confirmed by x-ray crystallographic analyses. Like the previously studied W26A mutation, N-methylation of Ile-20 dramatically reduced the ability of HNP1 to kill Staphylococcus aureus, inhibit LF, and bind gp120. Importantly, this modification had minimal effect on the ability of HNP1 to kill Escherichia coli. The W26A and MeIle-20 mutations impaired defensin activity synergistically. N-terminal covalent tethering rescued the ability of W26A-HNP1 to inhibit LF but failed to restore its defective killing of S. aureus. Surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that Trp-26 mediated the association of monomers and canonical dimers of HNP1 to immobilized HNP1, LF, and gp120, and also indicated a possible mode of tetramerization of HNP1 mediated by Ile-20 and Leu-25. This study demonstrates that dimerization contributes to some but not all of the many and varied activities of HNP1."
https://openalex.org/W1976364609,"In this study, a novel universal primer-multiplex-PCR (UP-M-PCR) method adding a universal primer (UP) in the multiplex PCR reaction system was described. A universal adapter was designed in the 5′-end of each specific primer pairs which matched with the specific DNA sequences for each template and also used as the universal primer (UP). PCR products were analyzed on sequencing gel electrophoresis (SGE) which had the advantage of exhibiting extraordinary resolution. This method overcame the disadvantages rooted deeply in conventional multiplex PCR such as complex manipulation, lower sensitivity, self-inhibition and amplification disparity resulting from different primers, and it got a high specificity and had a low detection limit of 0.1 ng for single kind of crops when screening the presence of genetically modified (GM) crops in mixture samples. The novel developed multiplex PCR assay with sequencing gel electrophoresis analysis will be useful in many fields, such as verifying the GM status of a sample irrespective of the crop and GM trait and so on."
https://openalex.org/W2066558125,"Pathogen/microbe- or plant-derived signaling molecules (PAMPs/MAMPs/DAMPs) or elicitors induce increases in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca(2+) followed by a series of defense responses including biosynthesis of antimicrobial secondary metabolites called phytoalexins; however, the molecular links and regulatory mechanisms of the phytoalexin biosynthesis remains largely unknown. A putative voltage-gated cation channel, OsTPC1 has been shown to play a critical role in hypersensitive cell death induced by a fungal xylanase protein (TvX) in suspension-cultured rice cells. Here we show that TvX induced a prolonged increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), mainly due to a Ca(2+) influx through the plasma membrane. Membrane fractionation by two-phase partitioning and immunoblot analyses revealed that OsTPC1 is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane. In retrotransposon-insertional Ostpc1 knock-out cell lines harboring a Ca(2+)-sensitive photoprotein, aequorin, TvX-induced Ca(2+) elevation was significantly impaired, which was restored by expression of OsTPC1. TvX-induced production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins and the expression of a series of diterpene cyclase genes involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis were also impaired in the Ostpc1 cells. Whole cell patch clamp analyses of OsTPC1 heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells showed its voltage-dependent Ca(2+)-permeability. These results suggest that OsTPC1 plays a crucial role in TvX-induced Ca(2+) influx as a plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channel consequently required for the regulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells."
https://openalex.org/W2143780822,"Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the main functional protein component of human high-density lipoproteins. ApoA-I shows various anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective properties toward macrophages; however, endogenous apoA-I expression has not been investigated in macrophages. We have shown that endogenous apoA-I gene is expressed in human macrophages at both mRNA and protein levels. Endogenous ApoA-I is localized in intracellular vesicles and at the external side of the plasma membrane in association with ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and lipid rafts in macrophages. We have shown that endogenous ApoA-I stabilizes ABCA1, moreover, down-regulation of ApoA-I by siRNA results in an increase of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA and membrane surface protein expression, as well as an enhancement of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) genes in human macrophages. TNF-α stimulates ApoA-I expression and secretion (1.2±0.2 vs. 4.3±0.9 ng/mg total protein) in macrophages. Obtained results suggest that endogenous ApoA-I has anti-inflammatory properties, presumably due to ABCA1 stabilization in macrophages; these results elucidate the cell type-specific mechanism of the TNF-α-mediated regulation of apoA-I gene expression in monocytes and macrophages.—Mogilenko, D.

https://openalex.org/W2083434097,"Upon antigen exposure, cord blood derived T cells respond to ubiquitous environmental antigens by high proliferation. To date it remains unclear whether these ""excessive"" responses relate to different regulatory properties of the putative T regulatory cell (Treg) compartment or even expansion of the Treg compartment itself.Cord blood (>37 week of gestation) and peripheral blood (healthy controls) were obtained and different Treg cell subsets were isolated. The suppressive potential of Treg populations after antigen exposure was evaluated via functional inhibition assays ([(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay and CFSE staining) with or without allergen stimulation. The frequency and markers of CD4(+)CD25(high)FoxP3(+) T cells were characterized by mRNA analysis and flow cytometry.Cord blood derived CD4(+)CD25(high) cells did not show substantial suppressor capacity upon TCR activation, in contrast to CD4(+)CD25(high) cells freshly purified from adult blood. This could not be explained by a lower frequency of FoxP3(+)CD4(+)CD25(high)cells or FOXP3 mRNA expression. However, after antigen-specific stimulation in vitro, these cells showed strong proliferation and expansion and gained potent suppressive properties. The efficiency of their suppressive capacity can be enhanced in the presence of endotoxins. If T-cells were sorted according to their CD127 expression, a tiny subset of Treg cells (CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)) is highly suppressive even without prior antigen exposure.Cord blood harbors a very small subset of CD4(+)CD25(high) Treg cells that requires antigen-stimulation to show expansion and become functional suppressive Tregs."
https://openalex.org/W2050606723,"Riparian areas are noted for their high biodiversity, but this has rarely been tested across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We set out to describe species richness, species abundance, and community similarity patterns for 11 taxonomic groups (forbs & grasses, shrubs, trees, solpugids, spiders, scarab beetles, butterflies, lizards, birds, rodents, and mammalian carnivores) individually and for all groups combined along a riparian–upland gradient in semiarid southeastern Arizona, USA. Additionally, we assessed whether biological characteristics could explain variation in diversity along the gradient using five traits (trophic level, body size, life span, thermoregulatory mechanism, and taxonomic affiliation). At the level of individual groups diversity patterns varied along the gradient, with some having greater richness and/or abundance in riparian zones whereas others were more diverse and/or abundant in upland zones. Across all taxa combined, riparian zones contained significantly more species than the uplands. Community similarity between riparian and upland zones was low, and beta diversity was significantly greater than expected for most taxonomic groups, though biological traits explained little variance in diversity along the gradient. These results indicate heterogeneity amongst taxa in how they respond to the factors that structure ecological communities in riparian landscapes. Nevertheless, across taxonomic groups the overall pattern is one of greater species richness and abundance in riparian zones, coupled with a distinct suite of species."

The stem structure of CD44 encoded by ten normal exons can be enlarged by ten variant exons (v1-v10) by alternative splicing. We have succeeded in preparing MV5 fully human IgM and its class-switched GV5 IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing the extracellular domain of a CD44R1 isoform that contains the inserted region coded by variant (v8, v9 and v10) exons and is expressed on the surface of various human epithelial cancer cells.We demonstrated the growth inhibition of human cancer xenografts by a GV5 IgG mAb reshaped from an MV5 IgM. The epitope recognized by MV5 and GV5 was identified to a v8-coding region by the analysis of mAb binding to various recombinant CD44 proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GV5 showed preferential reactivity against various malignant human cells versus normal human cells assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistological analysis. When ME180 human uterine cervix carcinoma cells were subcutaneously inoculated to athymic mice with GV5, significant inhibition of tumor formation was observed. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injections of GV5markedly inhibited the growth of visible established tumors from HSC-3 human larynx carcinoma cells that had been subcutaneously transplanted one week before the first treatment with GV5. From in vitro experiments, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and internalization of CD44R1 seemed to be possible mechanisms for in vivo anti-tumor activity by GV5.CD44R1 is an excellent molecular target for mAb therapy of cancer, possibly superior to molecules targeted by existing therapeutic mAb, such as Trastuzumab and Cetuximab recognizing human epidermal growth factor receptor family."

The structure and function of HspB2 are not well understood. We have cloned and expressed the protein in E.coli and purified it to homogeneity. Far-UV circular dichroic spectrum of the recombinant HspB2 shows a β-sheet structure. Fluorescence spectroscopic studies show that the sole tryptophan residue at the 130(th) position is almost completely solvent-exposed. Bis-ANS binding shows that though HspB2 exhibits accessible hydrophobic surfaces, it is significantly less than that exhibited by another well characterized small HSP, αB-crystallin. Sedimentation velocity measurements show that the protein exhibits concentration-dependent oligomerization. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer study shows that HspB2 oligomers exchange subunits. Interestingly, HspB2 exhibits target protein-dependent chaperone-like activity: it exhibits significant chaperone-like activity towards dithiothreitol (DTT)-induced aggregation of insulin and heat-induced aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase, but only partially prevents the heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase, co-precipitating with the target protein. It also significantly prevents the ordered amyloid fibril formation of α-synuclein. Thus, our study, for the first time, provides biophysical characterization on the structural aspects of HspB2, and shows that it exhibits target protein-dependent chaperone-like activity."

Among them, hydroxyproline (Hyp)-rich glycoproteins constitute a complex family of O-glycoproteins with various structures and functions. In this study, we characterized an atypical Hyp-rich glycoprotein, AGP31 (arabinogalactan protein 31), which displays a multidomain organization unique in Arabidopsis thaliana, consisting of a short arabinogalactan protein (AGP) motif, a His stretch, a Pro-rich domain, and a C-terminal PAC (PRP-AGP containing Cys) domain. The use of various mass spectrometry strategies was innovative and powerful: it permitted us to locate Hyp residues, to demonstrate the presence of carbohydrates, and to refine their distribution over the Pro-rich domain. Most Hyp were isolated within repeated motifs such as KAOV, KSOV, K(PO/OP)T, K(PO/OP)V, T(PO/OP)V, and Y(PO/OP)T. A few extensin-like motifs with contiguous Hyp (SOOA and SOOT) were also found.

HRGPs are characterized by the presence of Hyp-rich repetitive motifs, called glycomodules, containing from 3 to 16 amino acids. Glycomodule sequences determine Pro hydroxylation and the subsequent Hyp O-glycosylation. These two consecutive sequence-driven post-translational modifications define the so-called Hyp-O-glycosylation code (3.Kieliszewski M. The latest hype on Hyp-O-glycosylation codes.Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

EXTs display clusters of Ser-(Hyp)2,4 containing short O-Hyp arabinose (Ara)-oligosaccharides. Finally, PRPs are probably the most heterogeneous group, regarding their repetitive sequences and their carbohydrate patterns.

This glycoprotein mostly contains Gal residues and was called AGP31 because of its positive interaction with the β-glucosyl Yariv reagent. This protein, encoded by At1g28290, was shown to be a multidomain protein and was classified as a chimeric AGP (9.Showalter A.M. Keppler B. Lichtenberg J. Gu D. Welch L.R.

Combining two isolation processes and three detection methods, we demonstrated that the native AGP31 displays a huge heterogeneity with various O-glycans and truncated forms. After enrichment, MS analyses were permitted to determine the location of Hyp residues within the Pro-rich domain, to demonstrate the presence of carbohydrates, and to refine their distribution. A. thaliana seeds (ecotype Columbia 0) were grown in the dark as described (16.Irshad M. Canut H. Borderies G. Pont-Lezica R. Jamet E.

Two strategies were employed to isolate AGP31 from a total CWP extract: (i) a combination of cation exchange chromatography (CEC) and nickel affinity chromatography (NAC) and (ii) an affinity chromatography using a peanut agglutinin lectin from Arachis hypogaea (PNA)-agarose resin. PNA is a lectin specific for GalNAc, α-Gal, and β-Gal (18.Arockia Jeyaprakash A. Jayashree G. Mahanta S.K. Swaminathan C.P. Sekar K. Surolia A. Vijayan M.

AGP31 was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) from MALDI-TOF MS analysis of CEC elution fraction aliquots separated by SDS-PAGE. The elution fractions containing AGP31 were pooled, desalted, lyophilized, and subsequently loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column supplied in the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Fast Start Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's recommendations. For the second isolation strategy, 2 mg of CWPs were incubated with 1 ml of PNA-agarose resin (Sigma). Chromatography was performed as previously reported (19.Zhang Y. Giboulot A. Zivy M. Valot B.

AGP31-enriched fractions issued from the two isolation processes (CEC/NAC and PNA) were desalted using Econo-Pac 10 DG columns (Bio-Rad) and lyophilized prior to SDS-PAGE. Dried samples were dissolved in 150 μl of water. Fifty μl of each sample were loaded on a 10 × 12 × 0.15-cm SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a concentration of 12.5%/0.33% of acrylamide/bisacrylamide. Separation was performed according to Laemmli (21.Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). Staining of gels with colloidal blue was carried out using PageBlueTM protein staining solution (Fermentas, Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse, France) or the β-glucosyl Yariv reagent (22.Willats W.G.

For lectin blots, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) using a semi-dry transfer cell (Trans-Blot SD; Bio-Rad). Transfer was carried out at 4 °C in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris-HCl, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS, 20% methanol) for 1 h at 20 V. AGP31 bound to the membrane was revealed by a lectin blot method, using the digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled PNA provided in the DIG glycan differentiation kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). AGP31-enriched fractions issued from the two isolation processes (CEC/NAC and PNA) were desalted using Econo-Pac 10 DG columns (Bio-Rad) and lyophilized prior to acid hydrolysis carried out for 1 h at 110 °C using 2 n trifluoroacetic acid. Trimethylsilylated derivatives were prepared and analyzed by GC-MS as described (23.Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Carbohydrate composition analysis of glycoconjugates by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A sample of total CWPs extracted from 11-day-old etiolated hypocotyls was HF-deglycosylated for 1 h at 4 °C as described (24.Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Synthetic genes for glycoprotein design and the elucidation of hydroxyproline-O-glycosylation codes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sample preparation for all MS analyses was performed as previously described (26.Borderies G. Jamet E. Lafitte C. Rossignol M. Jauneau A. Boudart G. Monsarrat B. Esquerré-Tugayé M.T. Boudet A.

MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS analyses were performed using a MALDI-TOF/TOF Voyager 4700 (Applied Biosystems/MDS, Sciex). MS/MS data were recorded using the following parameters: accelerating voltage of 8 and 15 kV (sources 1 and 2, respectively) and grid voltage of 86%. The mass selection of the precursor ion was achieved using a mass window of ±5 Da, and collision was performed in CID off mode. The data were acquired with 3750 shoots/spectrum. For LC-MS/MS analyses, chip-based nano-LC separation was performed with an Agilent 1260 nano-pump system consisting of binary capillary flow and nano-flow pumps, a vacuum degasser, and an autosampler (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Chromatographic separation of tryptic peptides was performed on a C18 chip (75-mm diameter, 43-mm length, 40-nl preconcentration trap, and 5-μm particle size). The chip column was equilibrated at room temperature with 97% eluent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 3% eluent B (0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile and 10% water) at a flow rate of 600 nl/min. The chip preconcentration trap was equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid in 97% water and 3% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 4 μl/min. After injection of the sample, the separation was carried out using a linear gradient from 3–55% mobile phase B for 20 min, 55–95% mobile phase B for 1 min, and 95% mobile phase B for 2.5 min. The LC system was interfaced to a Bruker Daltonics (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany) Amazon ion trap mass spectrometer via a ChipCube interface (Agilent Technologies Inc.). The spraying voltage was set to 1780 V. MS scans were performed in the “enhanced resolution” mode, and MS/MS scans were performed in “ultrascan” mode covering the 100–3000 m/z range for the analyses of all glycopeptides. For electron transfer dissociation (ETD) analyses, a negative chemical ionization source generated fluoranthene radical anions, which were transported to the ion trap and used as the electron transfer agents. To produce the radical anions, the reactant temperature was set at 60 °C, whereas the ionization energy and emission current were set at 70 eV and 4 μA, respectively. The reaction time for radical anions was set to 100 ms. PMF was done by comparison to the non-redundant database of A. thaliana at NCBI using ProteinProspector MS-FIT. The criteria used for the database search were: a monoisotopic mass accuracy of 20 ppm, one missed cleavage, and hydroxylation of Pro residues. MS/MS results were analyzed using Protein Prospector MS-Product with Pro hydroxylation and glycosylation added as possible modifications. In our previous cell wall proteomics analyses of A. thaliana etiolated hypocotyls, we identified AGP31 as an abundant protein (16.Irshad M. Canut H. Borderies G. Pont-Lezica R. Jamet E.

Combining various strategies to increase the coverage of the plant cell wall glycoproteome.Phytochemistry. 2011; 72: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This protein comprises several domains, from the N terminus to the C terminus (Fig. 1A): a predicted signal peptide, a short AGP motif, a His stretch, a Pro-rich domain, and a C-terminal Cys-rich domain also called the PAC (PRP-AGP containing Cys) domain (28.Baldwin T. Domingo C. Schindler T. Seetharaman G. Stacey N. Roberts K. DcAGPI, a secreted arabinogalactan protein, is related to a family of basic proline-rich proteins.Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Following a fractionation step using CEC, AGP31 was eluted at the end of the salt gradient, at ∼0.5 m NaCl, as determined by MALDI-TOF MS analyses of elution fraction aliquots separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The fractions containing AGP31 were collected for subsequent NAC. The combination of these two chromatographic steps was very efficient for isolating AGP31, which migrated as a smear from 50 to 90 kDa on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2, lane 1a). This is much higher than the predicted molecular mass of AGP31, i.e. 38 kDa. In addition, an SDS-PAGE analysis of a similar fraction containing three times more proteins than previously (i.e. 36 μg) showed an additional smear from 30 to 40 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1b). MALDI-TOF MS analyses of samples taken all along both smears (30–40 kDa and above 50 kDa) identified AGP31 as unique protein. Up to seven tryptic peptides were used for AGP31 identification by PMF (corresponding to a maximum coverage of 33.3%), among which four belonged to the C-terminal PAC domain and three to the Pro-rich domain (named P1, P2, and P4) (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 3A). Truncated forms of AGP31 missing the C-terminal PAC domain were found in the 30–40-kDa smear.FIGURE 3Comparison of MALDI-TOF MS spectra of glycosylated and HF-deglycosylated forms of AGP31. A, identification of AGP31 by PMF using MALDI-TOF MS. After separation by SDS-PAGE of an AGP31-enriched fraction obtained combining CEC and NAC, bands containing glycosylated AGP31 were excised from the 50–60-kDa mass range and digested with trypsin. Unmodified tryptic peptides from the C-terminal domain (see Fig. 1B) are shown with white arrows, whereas tryptic peptides of the Pro-rich domain (P1, P2, and P4) are labeled with black arrows. O-Glycopeptides associated with these peptides are shown with a brace, and the masses of most intense ones are indicated. Note that other intense ions (842.51, 870.55, and 1045.57) correspond to trypsin or matrix peptides. B, identification of AGP31 after HF deglycosylation. After separation by SDS-PAGE of a total CWP extract, the bands containing deglycosylated AGP31 were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. AGP31 glycopeptides (shown in A) disappeared in favor of the corresponding deglycosylated peptides (P0–P4, black arrows). As expected, unmodified peptides from the C-terminal domain (white arrows) were not modified by the HF treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two minor contaminant proteins, a thaumatin encoded by At2g28790 and a glycine-rich protein encoded by At2g05580, were also found in this fraction, in bands of 26 and 20 kDa, respectively (labeled with asterisks on Fig. 2, lane 1b). These co-purified proteins may be AGP31 interactants or have similar behavior toward both chromatographic resins used. In particular, At2g28790 possesses a His stretch that may be responsible for its retention on the nickel resin. Altogether, an AGP31-enriched fraction containing ∼40 μg of proteins was routinely obtained from 6 mg of CWPs after CEC and NAC. A PNA-lectin blot analysis of this enriched fraction showed a signal from 34 to 170 kDa, particularly strong above 50 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). This result corroborated the fact that AGP31 contains Gal residues, as previously reported (12.Liu C. Mehdy M. A nonclassical arabinogalactan protein gene highly expressed in vascular tissues, AGP31, is transcriptionally repressed by methyl jasmonic acid in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and showed that AGP31 displays a heterogeneous pattern of glycosylation. Monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that AGP31-enriched fraction mostly contains Gal (53.2%) but also Ara (39.5%) in a higher proportion than previously reported (12.Liu C. Mehdy M. A nonclassical arabinogalactan protein gene highly expressed in vascular tissues, AGP31, is transcriptionally repressed by methyl jasmonic acid in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lesser amounts of Xyl (2.2%), Fuc (1.9%), Glc (1.8%), Man (1.3%), and GlcUA (0.3%) were also detected. Finally, no signal was obtained with the β-glucosyl Yariv reagent, specific for AGPs, suggesting that AGP31 isolated by CEC and NAC does not display any AG (Fig. 2, lane 3). Interestingly, the analysis of the flow-through fraction of the CEC showed a positive response with the β-glucosyl Yariv reagent, demonstrating that AGPs did not bind to that resin, probably because their carbohydrate content hides their charge (Fig. 2, lane 4). An alternative isolation strategy was carried out using a PNA-lectin agarose matrix, capitalizing on the remarkable affinity of AGP31 toward this lectin (19.Zhang Y. Giboulot A. Zivy M. Valot B. Jamet E. Albenne C. Combining various strategies to increase the coverage of the plant cell wall glycoproteome.Phytochemistry. 2011; 72: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Approximately 40 μg of proteins were routinely obtained in the PNA elution fraction from 2 mg of CWPs. AGP31 was identified by PMF using MALDI-TOF MS, with the same tryptic peptides as reported above (Fig. 1B). It migrates as two smears from 30 to 40 kDa and above 50 kDa, respectively, where AGP31 was the only protein identified (Fig. 2, lane 5). As expected, it was recognized by PNA, and the lectin blot signal was similar to that obtained using the CEC/NAC isolation strategy, confirming the large heterogeneity of AGP31 (Fig. 2, lane 6). The presence of residual Gal from the elution buffer (containing 0.5 m Gal) in the desalted AGP31-enriched fraction did not permit to determine a reliable monosaccharide composition of this fraction. Note that the At5g11420 and At5g25460 proteins containing a DUF642 domain of unknown function were found in bands of 43 and 40 kDa, respectively (labeled with asterisks on Fig. 2, lane 5). Finally, the β-glucosyl Yariv reagent gave a signal at the top of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel for the PNA elution fraction (Fig. 2, lane 7). This signal was assumed to be due to AGP31. Note that no other protein has been identified by PMF above 50 kDa in this fraction and that the flow-through fraction of the PNA chromatography showed a positive response with the β-glucosyl Yariv reagent, showing that other AGPs were not retained (data not shown). As mentioned above, among the seven tryptic peptides used for AGP31 identification, three belonged to the Pro-rich domain (named P1, P2, and P4) (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 3A). P1, P2, and P4 were predicted to contain six, five, and nine hydroxyl groups, respectively. We assumed that these modifications correspond to hydroxylation of Pro residues, giving rise to Hyp. Additional peaks were observed on MS spectra of samples taken from 50 to 60 kDa and from 30 to 40 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 1a, 1b, and 5). The masses of these peaks matched those of P1, P2, and P4 with regular mass increments of 162 and/or 132 Da, corresponding to the masses of a hexose and a pentose, respectively (Figs. 3A and 4). Because these peptides were predicted to contain Hyp residues"
https://openalex.org/W2045966074,"The increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance in Anopheles sinensis, a major vector of malaria in Jiangsu province in eastern China, threatens to compromise the successful use of insecticides in malaria control strategies. It is therefore vital to understand the insecticide resistance status of An. sinensis in the region. This study examined the nucleotide diversity of the para-sodium channel and knockdown resistance (kdr) in five field populations of adult An. sinensis mosquitoes collected in Jiangsu province, identifying the L1014F and L1014C substitutions for the first time. Competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of specific allele (cPASA) and polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for resistance diagnosis were developed and validated. Comparing the results with direct sequencing revealed that the PCR-RFLP method was more sensitive and specific whereas the cPASA method was more convenient and suitable. The significant positive correlation between kdr allele frequency and bioassay-based resistance phenotype demonstrates that the frequency of L1014F and L1014C substitutions in the kdr gene provides a useful molecular marker for monitoring beta-cypermethrin resistance in natural populations of An. sinensis. Our results point to the L1014F substitution as the key mutation associated with beta-cypermethrin resistance. The high resistance and mutation frequency detected in the five populations also suggest cross-resistance with other pyrethroids may occur in An. sinensis, highlighting the need for further surveys to map insecticide resistance in China and the adoption of a rational management of insecticide application for resistance management and mosquito vector control."
https://openalex.org/W2068909778,"α-Dystroglycan (α-DG) is a membrane-associated glycoprotein that interacts with several extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin and agrin. Aberrant glycosylation of α-DG disrupts its interaction with ligands and causes a certain type of muscular dystrophy commonly referred to as dystroglycanopathy. It has been reported that a unique O-mannosyl tetrasaccharide (Neu5Ac-α2,3-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,2-Man) and a phosphodiester-linked modification on O-mannose play important roles in the laminin binding activity of α-DG. In this study, we use several dystroglycanopathy mouse models to demonstrate that, in addition to fukutin and LARGE, FKRP (fukutin-related protein) is also involved in the post-phosphoryl modification of O-mannose on α-DG. Furthermore, we have found that the glycosylation status of α-DG in lung and testis is minimally affected by defects in fukutin, LARGE, or FKRP. α-DG prepared from wild-type lung- or testis-derived cells lacks the post-phosphoryl moiety and shows little laminin-binding activity. These results show that FKRP is involved in post-phosphoryl modification rather than in O-mannosyl tetrasaccharide synthesis. Our data also demonstrate that post-phosphoryl modification not only plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of dystroglycanopathy but also is a key determinant of α-DG functional expression as a laminin receptor in normal tissues and cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064726055,"β-Xylosidases are hemicellulases that hydrolyze short xylo-oligosaccharides into xylose units, thus complementing endoxylanase degradation of the hemicellulose component of lignocellulosic substrates. Here, we describe the cloning, characterization, and kinetic analysis of a glycoside hydrolase family 43 β-xylosidase (Xyl43A) from the aerobic cellulolytic bacterium, Thermobifida fusca. Temperature and pH optima of 55-60 °C and 5.5-6, respectively, were determined. The apparent K(m) value was 0.55 mM, using p-nitrophenyl xylopyranoside as substrate, and the catalytic constant (k(cat)) was 6.72 s(-1). T. fusca Xyl43A contains a catalytic module at the N terminus and an ancillary module (termed herein as Module-A) of undefined function at the C terminus. We expressed the two recombinant modules independently in Escherichia coli and examined their remaining catalytic activity and binding properties. The separation of the two Xyl43A modules caused the complete loss of enzymatic activity, whereas potent binding to xylan was fully maintained in the catalytic module and partially in the ancillary Module-A. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis revealed a specific noncovalent coupling of the two modules, thereby restoring enzymatic activity to 66.7% (relative to the wild-type enzyme). Module-A contributes a phenylalanine residue that functions as an essential part of the active site, and the two juxtaposed modules function as a single functional entity."
https://openalex.org/W2049191492,"Blockade of the ERK signaling pathway by ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors selectively enhances the induction of apoptosis by microtubule inhibitors in tumor cells in which this pathway is constitutively activated. We examined the mechanism by which such drug combinations induce enhanced cell death by applying time-lapse microscopy to track the fate of individual cells. MEK inhibitors did not affect the first mitosis after drug exposure, but most cells remained arrested in interphase without entering a second mitosis. Low concentrations of microtubule inhibitors induced prolonged mitotic arrest followed by exit of cells from mitosis without division, with most cells remaining viable. However, the combination of a MEK inhibitor and a microtubule inhibitor induced massive cell death during prolonged mitosis. Impairment of spindle assembly checkpoint function by RNAi-mediated depletion of Mad2 or BubR1 markedly suppressed such prolonged mitotic arrest and cell death. The cell death was accompanied by up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (to which MEK inhibitors contributed) and by down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 (to which microtubule and MEK inhibitors contributed synergistically). Whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of Bim suppressed cell death, stabilization of Mcl-1 by RNAi-mediated depletion of Mule slowed its onset. Depletion of Mcl-1 sensitized tumor cells to MEK inhibitor-induced cell death, an effect that was antagonized by knockdown of Bim. The combination of MEK and microtubule inhibitors thus targets Bim and Mcl-1 in a cooperative manner to induce massive cell death in tumor cells with aberrant ERK pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2154866293,"Paternity insurance and dominance tenure length are two important components of male reproductive success, particularly in species where reproduction is highly skewed towards a few individuals. Identifying the factors affecting these two components is crucial to better understand the pattern of variation in reproductive success among males. In social species, the social context (i.e. group size and composition) is likely to influence the ability of males to secure dominance and to monopolize reproduction. Most studies have analyzed the factors affecting paternity insurance and dominance tenure separately. We use a long term data set on Alpine marmots to investigate the effect of the number of subordinate males on both paternity insurance and tenure of dominant males. We show that individuals which are unable to monopolize reproduction in their family groups in the presence of many subordinate males are likely to lose dominance the following year. We also report that dominant males lose body mass in the year they lose both paternity and dominance. Our results suggest that controlling many subordinate males is energetically costly for dominant males, and those unable to support this cost lose the control over both reproduction and dominance. A large number of subordinate males in social groups is therefore costly for dominant males in terms of fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2025704191,"Ecological disturbances frequently control the occurrence and patterning of dominant plants in high-diversity communities like C(4) grasslands and savannas. In such ecosystems disturbance-related processes can have important implications for species, and for whole communities when those species are dominant, yet mechanistic understanding of such processes remains fragmentary. Multiple bunchgrass species commonly co-dominate disturbance-dependent and species-rich pine savannas, where small-scale fuel heterogeneity may influence bunchgrass survival and growth following fires. We quantified how fire in locally varying fuel loads influenced dynamics of dominant C(4) bunchgrasses in a species-rich pine savanna in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We focused on two congeneric, co-dominant species (Schizachyrium scoparium and S. tenerum) with similar growth forms, functional traits and reproductive strategies to highlight effects of fuel heterogeneity during fires. In experimental plots with either reduced or increased fuels versus controls with unmanipulated fuels, we compared: 1) bunchgrass damage and 2) mortality from fires; 3) subsequent growth and 4) flowering. Compared to controls, fire with increased fuels caused greater damage, mortality and subsequent flowering, but did not affect post-fire growth. Fire with reduced fuels had no effect on any of the four measures. The two species responded differently to fire with increased fuels--S. scoparium incurred measurably more damage and mortality than S. tenerum. Logistic regression indicated that the larger average size of S. tenerum tussocks made them resistant to more severe burning where fuels were increased. We speculate that locally increased fuel loading may be important in pine savannas for creating colonization sites because where fuels are light or moderate, dominant bunchgrasses persist through fires. Small-scale heterogeneity in fires, and differences in how species tolerate fire may together promote shared local dominance by different bunchgrasses."
https://openalex.org/W2087501918,"Information arriving at a neuron via anatomically defined pathways undergoes spatial and temporal encoding. A proposed mechanism by which temporally and spatially segregated information is encoded at the cellular level is based on the interactive properties of synapses located within and across functional dendritic compartments. We examined cooperative and interfering interactions between long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two forms of synaptic plasticity thought to be key in the encoding of information in the brain. Two approaches were used in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the mouse hippocampus: (1) induction of LTP and LTD in two separate synaptic pathways within the same apical dendritic compartment and across the basal and apical dendritic compartments; (2) induction of LTP and LTD separated by various time intervals (0-90 min). Expression of LTP/LTD interactions was spatially and temporally regulated. While they were largely restricted within the same dendritic compartment (compartmentalized), the nature of the interaction (cooperation or interference) depended on the time interval between inductions. New protein synthesis was found to regulate the expression of the LTP/LTD interference. We speculate that mechanisms for compartmentalization and protein synthesis confer the spatial and temporal modulation by which neurons encode multiplex information in plastic synapses."

We investigated how hyperglycaemia impairs expansion and differentiation of the growing pancreas. We have grafted xenogenic (avian) embryonic pancreas in severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mouse and analyzed endocrine and endothelial development in hyperglycaemic compared to normoglycaemic conditions. Methods 14 dpi chicken pancreases were grafted under the kidney capsule of normoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic, streptozotocin-induced, SCID mice and analyzed two weeks later. Vascularization was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively using either in situ hybridization with both mouse- and chick-specific RNA probes for VEGFR2 or immunohistochemistry with an antibody to nestin, a marker of endothelial cells that is specific for murine cells. To inhibit angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), SCID mice were treated with 4 mg/kg IP L1–10 twice/week. Results In normoglycaemic condition, chicken-derived endocrine and exocrine cells developed well and intragraft vessels were lined with mouse endothelial cells. When pancreases were grafted in hyperglycaemic mice, growth and differentiation of the graft were altered and we observed endothelial discontinuities, large blood-filled spaces. Vessel density was decreased. These major vascular anomalies were associated with strong over-expression of chick-Ang2. To explore the possibility that Ang2 over-expression could be a key step in vascular disorganization induced by hyperglycaemia, we treated mice with L1–10, an Ang-2 specific inhibitor. Inhibition of Ang2 improved vascularization and beta-cell density. Conclusions This work highlighted an important role of Ang2 in pancreatic vascular defects induced by hyperglycaemia."

Lead-compounds were selected from screens that involved testing for inflammatory potential, cytotoxicity and glucose-binding. These were then conjugated to insulin-encapsulating nanoparticles and agglomerated via sugar-boronate ester linkages to form AVTs. In vitro, the particles demonstrated triggered release of insulin upon exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose (10 mmoles/L–40 mmoles/L). The agglomerates were also shown to be responsive to multiple spikes in glucose levels over several hours, releasing insulin at a rate defined by the concentration of the glucose trigger."
https://openalex.org/W1972090905,"The Memory-Prediction Framework (MPF) and its Hierarchical-Temporal Memory implementation (HTM) have been widely applied to unsupervised learning problems, for both classification and prediction. To date, there has been no attempt to incorporate MPF/HTM in reinforcement learning or other adaptive systems; that is, to use knowledge embodied within the hierarchy to control a system, or to generate behaviour for an agent. This problem is interesting because the human neocortex is believed to play a vital role in the generation of behaviour, and the MPF is a model of the human neocortex. We propose some simple and biologically-plausible enhancements to the Memory-Prediction Framework. These cause it to explore and interact with an external world, while trying to maximize a continuous, time-varying reward function. All behaviour is generated and controlled within the MPF hierarchy. The hierarchy develops from a random initial configuration by interaction with the world and reinforcement learning only. Among other demonstrations, we show that a 2-node hierarchy can learn to successfully play “rocks, paper, scissors” against a predictable opponent."
https://openalex.org/W1995162550,"Firefly luciferase is one of the few soluble proteins that is acted upon by a wide variety of general anesthetics and alcohols; they inhibit the ATP–driven production of light. We have used time–resolved photolabeling to locate the binding sites of alcohols during the initial light output, some 200 ms after adding ATP. The photolabel 3-azioctanol inhibited the initial light output with an IC50 of 200 µM, close to its general anesthetic potency. Photoincorporation of [3H]3-azioctanol into luciferase was saturable but weak. It was enhanced 200 ms after adding ATP but was negligible minutes later. Sequencing of tryptic digests by HPLC–MSMS revealed a similar conformation–dependence for photoincorporation of 3-azioctanol into Glu-313, a residue that lines the bottom of a deep cleft (vestibule) whose outer end binds luciferin. An aromatic diazirine analog of benzyl alcohol with broader side chain reactivity reported two sites. First, it photolabeled two residues in the vestibule, Ser-286 and Ile-288, both of which are implicated with Glu-313 in the conformation change accompanying activation. Second, it photolabeled two residues that contact luciferin, Ser-316 and Ser-349. Thus, time resolved photolabeling supports two mechanisms of action. First, an allosteric one, in which anesthetics bind in the vestibule displacing water molecules that are thought to be involved in light output. Second, a competitive one, in which anesthetics bind isosterically with luciferin. This work provides structural evidence that supports the competitive and allosteric actions previously characterized by kinetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2021803139,"The etiology of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) is largely unknown, although evidence implicates the pathological hallmark molecules amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau. Work in animal models suggests that altered axonal transport caused by Kinesin-1 dysfunction perturbs levels of both Aβ and phosphorylated Tau in neural tissues, but the relevance of Kinesin-1 dependent functions to the human disease is unknown. To begin to address this issue, we generated human embryonic stem cells (hESC) expressing reduced levels of the kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) Kinesin-1 subunit to use as a source of human neural cultures. Despite reduction of KLC1, undifferentiated hESC exhibited apparently normal colony morphology and pluripotency marker expression. Differentiated neural cultures derived from KLC1-suppressed hESC contained neural rosettes but further differentiation revealed obvious morphological changes along with reduced levels of microtubule-associated neural proteins, including Tau and less secreted Aβ, supporting the previously established connection between KLC1, Tau and Aβ. Intriguingly, KLC1-suppressed neural precursors (NPs), isolated using a cell surface marker signature known to identify cells that give rise to neurons and glia, unlike control cells, failed to proliferate. We suggest that KLC1 is required for normal human neural differentiation, ensuring proper metabolism of AD-associated molecules APP and Tau and for proliferation of NPs. Because impaired APP metabolism is linked to AD, this human cell culture model system will not only be a useful tool for understanding the role of KLC1 in regulating the production, transport and turnover of APP and Tau in neurons, but also in defining the essential function(s) of KLC1 in NPs and their progeny. This knowledge should have important implications for human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases."

However, the relationship between integrin signaling and membrane blebbing is unclear. Here, we show that an integrin-ligand interaction induces both membrane blebbing and changes in membrane permeability. Sodium-proton exchanger 1 (NHE1) and sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) are membrane proteins located on the bleb membrane. Inhibition of NHE1 disrupts membrane blebbing and decreases changes in membrane permeability. However, inhibition of NCX1 enhances cell blebbing; cells become swollen because of NHE1 induced intracellular sodium accumulation. Our study found that NHE1 induced sodium influx is a driving force for membrane bleb growth, while sodium efflux (and calcium influx) induced by NCX1 in a reverse mode results in membrane bleb retraction. Together, these findings reveal a novel function for NHE1 and NCX1 in membrane blebbing and permeability, and establish a link between membrane blebbing and integrin signaling.

Animal cell plasma membranes undergo dynamic local expansion and retraction to form transient, small spherical blebs. Local disruption of the plasma membrane interaction with the actin submembrane cortex initiates bleb formation, followed by lipid incorporation into the bleb site (1Charras G.T.

It is not clear if integrin signaling generally triggers ion transport. In this study, we employed whole cell voltage-clamp techniques to measure the ion flow when cells contacted with various substrates, including fibrinogen and rhodostomin.

H. Ginsberg (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and Dr. Y. Takata (University of California-Davis, School of Medicine). Purification of recombinant rhodostomin (both wild-type RGD and mutant RGE) and the isolation of human platelets from volunteers were performed as previously described (13Chang C.P. Chang J.C. Chang H.H. Tsai W.J. Lo S.J. Positional importance of Pro53 adjacent to the Arg49-Gly50-Asp51 sequence of rhodostomin in binding to integrin αIIbβ3.Biochem.

Human fibrinogen, fibronectin, poly-l-lysine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), n-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG), bepridil, and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) were purchased from Sigma. Sodium Green fluorescent dye was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Preparation of substrates (fibrinogen, fibronectin, recombinant rhodostomin, and poly-l-lysine) at 4 × 10−7 m concentration was carried out as previously described (12Chang H.H. Lin C.H. Lo S.J. Recombinant rhodostomin substrates induce transformation and active calcium oscillation in human platelets.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For whole cell voltage-clamp recording, we used a commercially available amplifier and data acquisition software (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). For the preparation of cell suspensions, cells were harvested using a 1× trypsin solution, and dissociated using Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) (Invitrogen). Cells were kept in suspension for 10 min in the presence or absence of EIPA (25 μm) before use. Suspended cells were plated onto various substrates for 5 min prior to transfer to the recording chamber containing an extracellular electrolyte solution. Whole cell voltage-clamp recording was carried out in the chamber under a phase contrast microscope (DM IRE, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Membranes were clamped at −40 mV and current changes continuously recorded for 10 min. The intracellular electrolyte solution was composed NaCl (140 mm), KCl (5 mm), MgCl2 (2 mm), and HEPES (5 mm) at pH 7.35. The extracellular electrolyte solution was prepared as per the intracellular electrolyte solution, with the further addition of CaCl2 (1 mm). For ion substitution experiments, sodium was replaced by an equal molar amount of N-methyl-d-glucamine. Live cell and sodium images were recorded according to previously described methods with some modifications (15Yi Y.H. Ho P.Y. Chen T.W. Lin W.J. Gukassyan V. Tsai T.H. Wang D.W. Lew T.S. Tang C.Y.

Suspended cells were pretreated in the presence or absence of EIPA (25 μm for CHOαIIbβ3cell, 100 μm for NIH3T3 cell) or bepridil (80 μm) for 10 min, and then plated for 5 min, in preparation for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, and fluorescence time-lapse microscopy. Cells were observed under these various microscopic methods in a climate chamber, to maintain cell viability and activity. Images were recorded at 5-s intervals. For sodium imaging, suspended cells were labeled either with 2 μm Sodium Green dye at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of EIPA (100 μm) before cell plating. Fluorescence signals were recorded (532 nm) at 20-s intervals, and then converted into pseudo-color using the MetaMorph software version 6.1 (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Suspended cells were plated for 10 min and subjected to immunofluorescence staining using previously described methods (15Yi Y.H. Ho P.Y. Chen T.W. Lin W.J. Gukassyan V. Tsai T.H. Wang D.W. Lew T.S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 3855-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Antibody probes and concentrations were used as follows: integrinαIIb antibodies (1:100 dilution) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), NHE-1 (1:100 dilution), NCX-1 (1:100 dilution), and CD45 (1:100 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All stained samples were observed under a BD CARV IITM confocal microscope (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). We used whole cell voltage-clamp recording to measure ionic flow across the plasma membrane, to investigate if plating CHOαIIbβ3 cells onto fibrinogen or rhodostomin (RGD wild type) substrates induced changes in ion current (Fig. 1A). From representative data, there were changes in ion current of approximately −1.5 to −2.5 nA during the first 10 min, as cells attached onto fibrinogen or rhodostomin (RGD) substrates (orange and red trace). Fig. 1B summarizes quantitative data from 6 and 12 individual cells attached onto fibrinogen and rhodostomin (RGD) substrates respectively. Plating CHOαΙIbβ3 cells onto rhodostomin (RGE mutant, a glutamic acid-substituted rhodostomin), BSA, or poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated substrates (Fig. 1, A and B) did not produce any change in membrane permeability. Nor did we observe any change in membrane permeability when parental CHO cells (data not shown) and CHO cells expressing integrinαvβ3 were plated onto the rhodostomin (RGD)-coated substrate (Fig. 1C). The observed change in membrane permeability was specific to integrinαIIbβ3-ligand interactions. Thus, activation of integrinαIIbβ3 induces changes in cell membrane permeability. During the execution of the experiments on membrane permeability, we monitored membrane blebbing by time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy. Attaching CHOαIIbβ3 cells onto the fibrinogen-coated substrate produced blebbing before cell spreading occurred (arrowheads in upper panels of Fig. 2A and in supplemental movie S1). Few CHOαIIbβ3 cells attached to the BSA-coated substrate control did not produce noticeable blebbing (Fig. 2A, lower panels). We tested human platelet cells, abundant in integrinαΙIbβ3, to determine whether integrin-induced membrane blebbing occurs for other cell types. We observed membrane blebbing from platelets when seeded onto fibrinogen-coated substrate before spreading occurred (arrows in Fig. 2B and supplemental movie S2). We observed similar results after plating NIH3T3 cells, a mouse fibroblast cell containing two members of the RGD receptor (integrinαvβ3 and integrinα5β1) (21Woods D. Cherwinski H. Venetsanakos E. Bhat A. Gysin S. Humbert M. Bray P.F. Saylor V.L. McMahon M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3192-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), onto fibronectin-coated substrate (arrowheads in upper panels of Fig. 2C and supplemental movie S3). Occasionally, filopodium elongation occurred at the membrane blebbing site of NIH3T3 cell (double arrowheads in upper panels of Fig. 2C). By contrast, most NIH3T3 cells attached onto BSA-coated plates did not produce noticeable blebbing (Fig. 2C and supplemental movie S4). Taken together, these data demonstrate that for various cell types, integrin-ligand interactions induce membrane blebbing prior to cell spreading. Previous work established that downstream signals of integrinαIIbβ3 can target NHE1 and NCX1 to the plasma membrane (15Yi Y.H. Ho P.Y. Chen T.W. Lin W.J. Gukassyan V. Tsai T.H. Wang D.W. Lew T.S.

We were interested to find out if the membrane blebs contain the two cation exchangers and if so, to determine if the exchangers are involved in either inducing membrane blebbing, or in the observed permeability changes, or both. After attaching CHOαIIbβ3 cells onto the fibrinogen substrate, immunofluorescent antibody staining revealed the presence of NHE1 (Fig. 3A, first row) but not CD45 (a control membrane protein; Fig. 3A, second row) in the bleb membrane. However, the few CHOαIIbβ3 cells attached onto BSA-coated substrate did not show noticeable bleb formation (Fig. 3A, third row). We identified NHE1 in the bleb membranes of 83% of cells, while no CD45 was detected (Fig. 3B). No membrane blebs appeared from CHOαIIbβ3 or NIH3T3 cells attached to fibrinogen or fibronectin substrates after pretreatment with NHE1 inhibitor (EIPA) (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, EIPA also blocked changes in membrane permeability (Fig. 3, E and F). These data suggest that NHE1, which can pump sodium ions into cells, is required for integrin-mediated cell membrane blebbing and membrane permeability changes. NHE1 and NCX1 are functionally coupled (15Yi Y.H. Ho P.Y. Chen T.W. Lin W.J. Gukassyan V. Tsai T.H. Wang D.W. Lew T.S. Tang C.Y. Lo S.J. Chen T.Y. Kao F.J. Lin C.H.

Immunofluorescent antibody staining revealed that NCX1 (Fig. 4A, first row), but not CD45 (Fig. 4A, second row), was present in the bleb membranes of untreated CHOαIIbβ3 cells attached onto fibrinogen substrate. There was no noticeable bleb formation from cells plated onto the BSA substrate (Fig. 4A, third row). Analysis of three independent experiments showed the presence of NCX1 on bleb membranes in 26% of cells, while no CD45 was detected (Fig. 4B). Moreover, we found that CHOαIIbβ3 cells pretreated with bepridil produced enlarged membrane blebs, and the cells themselves became swollen (double arrowheads, Fig. 4C). Previously, we reported that cell swelling accompanies intracellular sodium accumulation in bepridil-pretreated CHOαIIbβ3 cells attached onto fibrinogen substrate (15Yi Y.H. Ho P.Y. Chen T.W. Lin W.J. Gukassyan V. Tsai T.H. Wang D.W. Lew T.S. Tang C.Y. Lo S.J. Chen T.Y. Kao F.J. Lin C.H. Membrane targeting and coupling of NHE1-integrin αIIbβ3-NCX1 by lipid rafts following integrin-ligand interactions trigger Ca2+ oscillations.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3855-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sodium accumulation also occurred in the membrane blebs of NIH3T3 cells when attached to fibronectin substrate (arrows in Fig. 4D and supplemental movie S5). Few EIPA-pretreated NIH3T3 cells attached onto fibronectin substrate, and they did not show any noticeable increases in intracellular sodium (Fig. 4D). To investigate the role of NCX1 in changes of membrane permeability, N-methyl-d-glucamine (the inhibitor of sodium transport) was applied to replace intracellular sodium. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording revealed that N-methyl-d-glucamine replacement inhibited sodium efflux and reduced membrane permeability to 0.8 nA (Fig. 4E). These data suggest that NCX1, which can operate reversibly and generate sodium efflux, counteracts NHE1-mediated sodium influx in these cells. Membrane blebbing is associated with many cellular activities, such as cell spreading, cell migration, virus entry, cytokinesis, and apoptosis. Nevertheless, little is known about the detailed mechanisms (1Charras G.T. A short history of blebbing.J. Microsc. 2008; 231: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 2Charras G. Paluch E.

Blebbing dynamics during endothelial cell spreading.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our observations show that integrinαIIbβ3 signals, which mediate cell spreading, induce membrane blebbing in CHOαIIbβ3 cells (Fig. 2A). Membrane blebbing was also observed on human platelet cells, when they adhere onto a fibrinogen substrate, and before they are fully spreading (Fig. 2B), indicating that signals downstream of integrinαIIbβ3-ligand binding can induce membrane blebbing. Membrane blebbing also occurred when NIH3T3 cells adhere onto fibronectin substrate (Fig. 2C), and together with results from CHOαIIbβ3 cells and platelets (Fig. 2, A and B), these data suggest that integrin-ligand interactions induce cell adhesion to the solid substrate, and that membrane blebbing is a common phenomenon that occurs in the early stages of cell spreading (4Norman L. Sengupta K. Aranda-Espinoza H. Blebbing dynamics during endothelial cell spreading.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

However, it is not clear whether NHE1 is required for changes in integrinαIIbβ3-mediated permeability or membrane blebbing during cell spreading. Our study links the two cation exchangers, NHE1 and NCX1, to integrinαIIbβ3-mediated changes in membrane permeability and blebbing. As shown in Figs. 3B and 4B, there are a greater percentage of cells with NHE1 in the bleb membrane (85%) than there are cells with NCX1 in the bleb membrane (26%). This may suggest that the bleb membrane contains a greater amount of NHE1 protein than it does NCX1. In many animal cells, NHE1 operates in parallel with a Cl−/HCO3− anion exchanger, which allows cells to take up sodium and chloride ions (26Ritter M. Fuerst J. Wöll E. Chwatal S. Gschwentner M. Lang F. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Na(+)/H(+)exchangers: linking osmotic dysequilibrium to modified cell function.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This uptake can drive the influx of water by osmosis, resulting in increases in cellular volume and intracellular (osmotic) pressure, causing cell blebbing and swelling (26Ritter M. Fuerst J. Wöll E. Chwatal S. Gschwentner M. Lang F. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Na(+)/H(+)exchangers: linking osmotic dysequilibrium to modified cell function.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Many proteins associated with actin, including ERM protein, Rho A, ROCK, and ankyrin interact with NHE1 or NCX1 (22Baumgartner M. Patel H. Barber D.L. Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE1 as plasma membrane scaffold in the assembly of signaling complexes.Am. J. Physiol.

Blebs lead the way: how to migrate without lamellipodia.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 3Fackler O.T. Grosse R. Cell motility through plasma membrane blebbing.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Additionally, sodium and calcium are enriched in membrane blebs of inner hair cell (28Shi X. Gillespie P.G. Nuttall A.L. Na+ influx triggers bleb formation on inner hair cells.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C1332-C1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), zebrafish primordial germ cells (29Blaser H. Reichman-Fried M. Castanon I. Dumstrei K. Marlow F.L. Kawakami K. Solnica-Krezel L. Heisenberg C.P. Raz E. Migration of zebrafish primordial germ cells: a role for myosin contraction and cytoplasmic flow.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 613-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4C). We modified the membrane blebbing model proposed by Fackler and Grosse (3Fackler O.T. Grosse R. Cell motility through plasma membrane blebbing.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), hypothesizing that NHE1 and NCX1 coupling plays a role in membrane blebbing, driving the influx of calcium, and subsequent actin-filament formation and myosin sliding to control the dynamic changes of membranes (Fig. 5). When integrins are activated by binding to their protein substrates, vesicular NHE1 and NCX1 are targeted to the plasma membrane (15Yi Y.H. Ho P.Y. Chen T.W. Lin W.J. Gukassyan V. Tsai T.H. Wang D.W. Lew T.S. Tang C.Y. Lo S.J. Chen T.Y. Kao F.J. Lin C.H. Membrane targeting and coupling of NHE1-integrin αIIbβ3-NCX1 by lipid rafts following integrin-ligand interactions trigger Ca2+ oscillations.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3855-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, panel 1). Previous studies of human neutrophil adherence and spreading on fibrinogen-coated slides revealed these processes to be β2-integrin mediated with concomitant activation of NADPH oxidase (30Demaurex N. Downey G.P. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. Intracellular pH regulation during spreading of human neutrophils.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Activation of NADPH oxidase increases superoxide production and causes cytosolic acidification, which in turn activates NHE1 and rapid alkalization of the cytoplasm. Thus, it is probable that downstream integrin signaling, followed by elevation of superoxide and proton concentrations by NADPH oxidase, activates NHE1, causing subsequent cytosolic alkalization and sodium ion influx (Fig. 5, panels 2 and 3). Sodium ion influx can increase cellular volume and intracellular pressure (22Baumgartner M. Patel H. Barber D.L. Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE1 as plasma membrane scaffold in the assembly of signaling complexes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C844-C850Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), an initial driving force that triggers membrane bleb growth by forming a membrane-blebbing nucleation site (15Yi Y.H. Ho P.Y. Chen T.W. Lin W.J. Gukassyan V. Tsai T.H. Wang D.W. Lew T.S. Tang C.Y. Lo S.J. Chen T.Y. Kao F.J. Lin C.H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 3855-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Figs. 4C and 5, panel 3). As sodium influx continues, the membrane bleb grows, which triggers NCX1 to operate reversibly in bleb membrane and so decreases intracellular pressure by refluxing sodium ions out from the cells and influxing calcium ions into cells (15Yi Y.H.

As demonstrated by the zebrafish primordial germ cell study described above, calcium ion accumulates in the membrane bleb region inducing myosin-mediated contraction, accompanied by activation of actin-associated proteins located underneath the membrane bleb, so causing membrane bleb retraction (Fig. 5, panel 5) (3Fackler O.T.

Previous studies on NHE1 and NCX1 focused on their roles in maintaining ion homeostasis in cardiac myocytes (33Hilgemann D.W. Yaradanakul A. Wang Y. Fuster D. Molecular control of cardiac sodium homeostasis in health and disease.J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2006; 17: S47-S56Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and some studies demonstrated that NHE1 is involved in the cell migration (18Hisamitsu T. Ben Ammar Y. Nakamura T.Y.

Our results demonstrate that both NHE1 and NCX1 play roles in maintaining membrane blebbing, which is involved in cell migration (1Charras G.T. A short history of blebbing.J. Microsc. 2008; 231: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 2Charras G. Paluch E. Blebs lead the way: how to migrate without lamellipodia.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Integrins in cancer: biological implications and therapeutic opportunities.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar), and we speculate that up-regulation of NHE1 and NCX1 might occur in these cells. These two cation exchangers could provide new useful biomarkers of metastatic cancers, a hypothesis we are currently testing. We thank Scott C.
