https://openalex.org/W1506520614,"We have previously described the oxidative inactivation of several key metabolic enzymes by a variety of mixed function oxidation systems. Because many of the enzymes which are inactivated have been shown by others to accumulate as inactive or less active forms during cellular aging, we have examined the levels of oxidatively modified proteins in two model systems used for studies on aging. The results show that levels of oxidatively modified proteins increase with age in circulating erythrocytes, and this change is correlated with the loss of marker enzyme activity. Our studies also show that in cultured fibroblasts from normal donors the levels of oxidatively modified proteins increase only after the age of 60. However, the levels of oxidatively modified proteins in fibroblasts from individuals with progeria or Werner's syndrome are significantly higher than age-matched controls. Moreover, treatment of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with a mixed function oxidation system leads to oxidative modification and increased heat lability of the enzyme. Taken together these results suggest that loss of functional enzyme activity and increased heat lability of enzymes during aging may be due in part to oxidative modification by mixed function oxidation systems."
https://openalex.org/W1482431053,"Ricin is a potent cytotoxic protein derived from the higher plant Ricinus communis that inactivates eukaryotic ribosomes. In this paper we have studied the mechanism of action of ricin A-chain on rat liver ribosomes in vitro. Our findings indicate that the toxin inactivates the ribosomes by modifying both or either of two nucleoside residues, G4323 and A4324, in 28 S rRNA. These nucleotides are located close to the alpha-sarcin cleavage site and become resistant to all ribonucleases tested. The examination of the lability of phosphodiester bonds of these nucleotides to both mild alkaline digestion and aniline treatment at acidic pH suggests that the base of A4324 is removed by the toxin. This unique activity of ricin A-chain was also observed when naked 28 S rRNA is used as a substrate, indicating that the toxin directly acts on the RNA. Similar activity on 28 S rRNA is also exhibited by abrin and modeccin, ricin-related toxins, suggesting a general mechanistic pathway for ribosome inactivation by lectin toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2008656832,"Promoters were assembled in nucleosomes or ligated to nucleosomes and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase or with mammalian RNA polymerase II and accessory factors. Neither polymerase would initiate transcription at a promoter in a nucleosome, but once engaged in transcription, both polymerases were capable of reading through a nucleosome. In the course of readthrough transcription, the histones were displaced from the DNA, as shown by the exposure of restriction sites and by a shift of the template to the position of naked DNA in a gel. It may be true, in general, that processive enzymes will traverse regions of DNA organized in nucleosomes and displace histones."
https://openalex.org/W2097172537,"An optical method for measuring oxygen concentrations in aqueous solutions is described. This method is based upon the oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence. Phosphorescence excitation and emission spectra and lifetimes of some of the probe molecules suitable for measurement of oxygen in aqueous solutions are given. The probes include fluorescein derivatives, 4'5'-diiodofluorescein, eosin Y, 5(and 6)-carboxyeosin, erythrosin, and 5(and 6)-carboxyerythrosin as well as the Zn(II), Y(III), Sn(IV), Lu(III), and Pd(II) derivatives of meso-tetra-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphine, meso-tetra-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphine and coproporphyrin. The phosphorescence lifetimes of the given probes were found to depend upon the oxygen concentration by a simple Stern-Volmer relationship with a quenching constant of approximately 10(9) M-1 S-1. Binding of the molecules to bovine serum albumin decreased the quenching constant for oxygen by approximately an order of magnitude and also inhibited probe self-quenching, indicating that at the protein binding site the probes are somewhat protected from collision with quenchers. The use of this optical method for measuring oxygen is demonstrated for reactions catalyzed by glucose oxidase and by cytochrome c oxidase. It is shown that, using this method oxygen concentrations can be measured from approximately 250 microM (air saturation) down to the nanomolar range."
https://openalex.org/W2002267855,"We have analyzed the transcriptional regulation of plastid genes during chloroplast development in illuminated spinach cotyledons and during leaf formation. The RNAs encoded by plastid genes accumulate with different kinetics during the developmental transitions. Using a novel plastid run-on transcription assay we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulation of a large, diverse group of chloroplast genes is of relatively minor importance for the control of their expression. The general transcriptional activity of the plastid genome increases after illumination and decreases during leaf development. This modulation of general transcriptional activity affects most plastid genes simultaneously and is not correlated with adjustments of the plastid DNA copy number. There are no major changes in the relative transcriptional activities of different genes, although their steady-state mRNA levels change dramatically. The analysis of ten specific plastid genes shows that their relative transcriptional activities are largely maintained throughout the developmental program. This limited transcriptional regulation suggests that plastid gene expression in higher plants is effectively controlled at the posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1564137887,"The new, fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, promises to expand our understanding of the role of subcellular changes in Ca2+ underlying cell function. During an investigation of the role of Ca2+ in the polarization response of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, we found that fura-2 trapped by cells incubated with the acetoxy-methyl ester of fura-2, F2-AM, yielded measurements of Ca2+ that were depressed at rest and during the response to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Fura-2, trapped by the cells, exhibited a spectrum in the presence of saturating Ca2+ that differed from that of fura-2 free acid. We have shown that the cellular fluorescence can be spectrally decomposed into two components: one with Ca2+ sensitivity identical to fully deesterified fura-2, and another which is Ca2+-insensitive. The Ca2+-insensitive component appears to be more fluorescent than F2-AM as well as spectrally different from F2-AM. The insensitive form probably results from incomplete deesterification of F2-AM by the cells. In order to accurately measure Ca2+ in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, it is imperative to check for the presence of Ca2+-insensitive fluorescence. The contribution of Ca2+-insensitive fura-2 fluorescence can be assessed routinely from spectral data obtained by calibration of intracellular fura-2 with known [Ca2+] using ionomycin. The end-of-experiment calibration step not only ensures accurate [Ca2+] measurements in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and in other cell types that display Ca2+-insensitive, contaminating fluorescence but also yields the spectral characteristics of the insensitive species."
https://openalex.org/W2113814538,"The selectivity of T7 RNA polymerase for its own promoters is used to direct all transcription and replication to bacteriophage T7 DNA during infection. We now find that T7 lysozyme, which is known to cut a bond in the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, forms a specific complex with T7 RNA polymerase and inhibits transcription. Mutations that weaken this interaction have been found in the coding sequence for T7 RNA polymerase; an affinity column containing wildtype polymerase selectively binds T7 lysozyme, but a similar column containing mutant polymerase does not. The lysozyme-polymerase interaction ensures a controlled burst of late transcription during infection, and could possibly have some direct role in replication and/or control of lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1578213988,"The internalization of fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine following their insertion into the plasma membrane of cultured Chinese hamster fibroblasts was examined. When liposomes containing the fluorescent lipid 1,2-(palmitoyl-N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-amino-caproyl) phosphatidylserine [palmitoyl-C6-NBD)-PS), were incubated with monolayer cell cultures at 2 degrees C, spontaneous transfer of the fluorescent lipid from the liposomes to the cells occurred, resulting in prominent labeling of the plasma membrane. However, if the cells were washed and warmed to 7 degrees C for 30 min, the (palmitoyl-C6-NBD)-PS also labeled numerous intracellular membranes. Evidence is presented suggesting that this internalization was not due to endocytosis, but was the result of transmembrane movement of the (palmitoyl-C6-NBD)-PS at the plasma membrane followed by translocation of lipid monomers from the plasma membrane to internal membranes. This transmembrane movement was reversibly inhibited by depletion of cellular ATP levels and was blocked by treatment with structural analogs of the lipid or by pretreatment of cells with glutaraldehyde or N-ethyl-maleimide. A fluorescent analog of phosphatidylethanolamine [palmitoyl-C6-NBD)-PE), which also exhibits transmembrane movement at the plasma membrane at 7 degrees C (Sleight, R. G., and Pagano, R. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1146-1154), was further studied. Its transmembrane movement was also inhibited by depletion of cellular ATP levels, or by pretreatment of cells with N-ethylmaleimide. The transmembrane movement of the fluorescent phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine analogs was inhibited when the unnatural D-isomers of these lipids were used, further suggesting that this process was stereospecific and therefore likely to have been protein-mediated."
https://openalex.org/W2083699794,"We previously demonstrated that a critical 35 bp region 3′ of the AAUAAA is required for rabbit β-globin mRNA 3′ end formation. Recently, we synthesized and tested sequence elements derived from this region. Here, we report that a GU-rich and a U-rich sequence element are both required for efficient rabbit β-globin mRNA 3′ end formation. The efficiency of processing is restored to the wild-type level when the two elements are placed together and is greatly diminished when only one element is present. The level of 3′ end formation is also decreased when the distance between the two elements is expanded. These results demonstrate that the GU-rich and U-rich elements function synergistically to restore efficient mRNA 3′ end formation and that they most likely form a single requisite sequence 3′ of the AAUAAA. Furthermore, we show that the effect of the GU-rich and U-rich sequence elements is position-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2029991413,"The transferrin receptor (TR) mediates cellular iron uptake by bringing about the endocytosis of transferrin. We investigated whether the cytoplasmic domain of 65 N-terminal amino acids or phosphorylated sites within this domain constitute a structure that is required for TR endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we modified the cytoplasmic serine residues or introduced a deletion of 36 amino acids by in vitro mutagenesis of a cDNA expression vector for human TR. Upon expression in transfected mouse Ltk- cells, both the wild-type and phosphorylation site mutant receptors mediated transferrin internalization, whereas the truncated receptor did not. These results provide evidence that the cytoplasmic domain, or part of it, is essential for internalization of the TR, but argue against a role for receptor phosphorylation in endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1511703847,"The superoxide-generating enzyme of human neutrophils, NADPH oxidase, is converted from an inactive to an active form upon stimulation of the neutrophil. This activation process was examined using a recently developed cell-free system in which dormant oxidase is activated by arachidonic acid in the presence of a soluble factor from the neutrophil (Curnutte, J. T. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 75, 1740-1743). NADPH oxidase from unstimulated human neutrophils was detected only in the membrane fraction. The soluble activation factor was localized entirely to the cytosolic fraction and exhibited two peaks of activity when partially purified under nondenaturing conditions: a major peak with a molecular mass of approximately 250 kDa and a variable minor peak with a mass of approximately 40 kDa. Both forms activated NADPH oxidase in a similar manner and did not exhibit synergy when combined. The cytosolic factor is not protein kinase C (or another kinase) as both peaks of factor activity could be resolved from the protein kinase C peak and neither required calcium or ATP to activate the oxidase. Activation of NADPH oxidase did require the simultaneous presence of the membrane fraction, the cytosolic factor, arachidonic acid, and magnesium. Following activation, however, only the membrane fraction was then required for O2- production. Cytosolic factor levels were normal in five patients with either X-linked or autosomal recessive cytochrome b-negative chronic granulomatous disease. In contrast, the membrane fractions from each failed to generate O2-, indicating that the defects in these two genetic forms of chronic granulomatous disease reside either in the oxidase itself or in a membrane component required for activation."
https://openalex.org/W1964767594,"Production of the mitochondrial respiratory system and expression of mitochondrial genes are developmentally regulated in T. brucei. We have found three classes of apocytochrome b (CYb) transcripts. Two of these contain U's within their 5' sequence that are not found in the CYb gene. They occur in procyclic forms, which have a complete mitochondrial respiratory system, but are absent in bloodstream forms, which lack this respiratory system. The third transcript has the sequence predicted from the genomic sequence and is present in both life cycle stages. These findings suggest that there is developmentally regulated posttranscriptional addition of U's to CYb transcripts. This process may contribute to the developmentally regulated production of the mitochondrial respiratory system."
https://openalex.org/W1577986704,"Prolonged incubation of L-isoaspartate-containing forms of lactate dehydrogenase (231-242), sperm activating peptide, and adrenocorticotropin (22-27) at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine and protein carboxyl methyltransferase from bovine brain leads to extensive conversion of the atypical isopeptide bond to a normal peptide bond. For the lactate dehydrogenase-related peptide, conversion was 80% complete after 24 h. For the other two peptides, conversion reached a level of approximately 65% after 48 h. The mechanism of conversion involves (i) rapid enzymatic methylation of the alpha-carboxyl of the L-iso-Asp residue; (ii) nonenzymatic demethylation resulting in formation of an L-aspartyl cyclic imide; and (iii) a slow, nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the cyclic imide to form a mixture of 15-25% normal L-Asp peptide and 75-85% L-iso-Asp peptide. The regenerated L-iso-Asp peptide is remethylated and the cycle is repeated. The extent of conversion is limited by a competing side reaction wherein the L-imide slowly racemizes, leading to the formation of mainly D-iso-Asp peptide, which is not a substrate for the methyltransferase. The ability of protein carboxyl methyltransferase to initiate conversion of L-iso-Asp residues to normal L-Asp suggests a possible role for this enzyme in facilitating the repair or degradation of deamidated proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1492408334,"Equilibrium [3H]cytochalasin B binding to class I sites of human red cell membranes (the sugar transporter) was examined in the presence and absence of intracellular or extracellular sugars known to interact with the transport system. D-Glucose, a transported sugar, is without effect on cytochalasin B binding when present in the extracellular medium but is an effective inhibitor of binding when present within the cell. Ethylidene glucose and maltose (reactive but nontransported sugars) inhibit cytochalasin B (CCB) binding when present either outside or inside the red cell. Inhibition by intracellular sugar (Si) is of the simple, linear competitive type. Inhibition by extracellular sugars (So) is more complex; the Kd(app) for cytochalasin B binding increases in a saturable fashion with [So]. These observations are compared with the predictions of the one-site, alternating conformer model and the two-site model for substrate binding to the sugar transporter, X. The experimental results are inconsistent with the one-site model but are explained by a two-site model in which the ternary complexes of So . X . Si or So . X . CCBi exist and where the binding sites for So and Si display negative cooperativity when occupied by nontransported substrate and little or no cooperativity when occupied by the transported species, D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1602510516,"Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) catalyzes the last step of urea synthesis in the liver of ureotelic animals. The nucleotide sequence of rat liver arginase cDNA, which was isolated previously (Kawamoto, S., Amaya, Y., Oda, T., Kuzumi, T., Saheki, T., Kimura, S., and Mori, M. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 136, 955-961) was determined. An open reading frame was identified and was found to encode a polypeptide of 323 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 34,925. The cDNA included 26 base pairs of 5'-untranslated sequence and 403 base pairs of 3'-untranslated sequence, including 12 base pairs of poly(A) tract. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and the sequences of two internal peptide fragments, determined by amino acid sequencing, were identical to the sequences predicted from the cDNA. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the rat liver arginase with that of the yeast enzyme revealed a 40% homology."
https://openalex.org/W1582847673,"The present study describes experiments on the myocardial trabeculae from the right ventricle of Syrian hamsters whose troponin C (TnC) moiety was exchanged with heterologous TnC from fast skeletal muscle of the rabbit. These experiments were designed to help define the role of the various classes of Ca2+-binding sites on TnC in setting the characteristic sensitivities for activations of cardiac and skeletal muscles. Thin trabeculae were skinned and about 75% of their troponin C extracted by chemical treatment. Tension development on activations by Ca2+ and Sr2+ was found to be nearly fully blocked in such TnC extracted preparations. Troponin C contents and the ability to develop tension on activations by Ca2+ and Sr2+ was permanently restored after incubation with 2-6 mg/ml purified TnC from either rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle (STnC) or the heart (CTnC, cardiac troponin C). The native (skinned) cardiac muscle is characteristically about 5 times more sensitive to activation by Sr2+ than fast muscle, but the STnC-loaded trabeculae gave response like fast muscle. Attempts were also made to exchange the TnC in psoas (fast-twitch muscle) fibers, but unlike cardiac muscle tension response of the maximally extracted psoas fibers could be restored only with homologous STnC. CTnC was effective in partially extracted fibers, even though the uptake of CTnC was complete in the maximally extracted fibers. The results in this study establish that troponin C subunit is the key in setting the characteristic sensitivity for tension control in the myocardium above that in the skeletal muscle. Since a major difference between skeletal and cardiac TnCs is that one of the trigger sites (site I, residues 28-40 from the N terminus) is modified in CTnC and has reduced affinity for Ca2+ binding, the possibility is raised that this site has a modulatory effect on activation in different tissues and limits the effectiveness of CTnC in skeletal fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1497169640,"Cell aggregation in the marine sponge Microciona prolifera is mediated by a multimillion molecular weight aggregation factor (MAF) and is based on two functional properties, a Ca2+-independent cell binding activity and a Ca2+-dependent factor-factor self-interaction. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared against purified MAF, and one clone was characterized which selectively inhibited the MAF-MAF association activity. Binding of the blocking antibody (Block 1) to MAF demonstrated that this epitope structure was present in 1100 copies per one MAF molecule of Mr = 2 X 10(7). Such blocking antibodies precipitated a small molecular weight protein-free glycan fraction prepared from MAF by Pronase digestion, thus indicating that the highly repetitive epitope is located in the carbohydrate portion of the molecule. Since the inhibitory activity of the Block 1 antibody could only be achieved when most of the sites were occupied by Fab fragments of this antibody, the self-association of MAF seemed to be based on the polyvalency of the carbohydrate determinants. The affinity of the protein-free glycans was very low as shown by the fact that they did not display any measurable self or MAT binding activity in their monomeric form. After cross-linking them with glutaraldehyde into polymers of the size of MAF, however, the self-interaction could be reconstituted. Thus, the MAF-MAF association activity, which is needed for cell aggregation in sponges, seems to be based on multiple low affinity carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, which is different from most interactions mediated by adhesion molecules characterized so far."
https://openalex.org/W104468390,"Cultured vascular endothelial cells produce several mitogens including a platelet-derived growth factor-like protein (PDGF-c). We previously reported that acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL) caused accumulation of cholesterol and specific inhibition of PDGF-c production by bovine aortic endothelial cells (Fox, P. L., and DiCorleto, P. E. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 4774-4778). We have now examined the role of cholesterol and other lipids on the inhibition of production of PDGF-c. Incubation of endothelial cells with free cholesterol/albumin complexes resulted in a large increase in cellular cholesterol content but did not inhibit PDGF-c production, demonstrating that cholesterol itself is not inhibitory. Involvement of lipid peroxides in the suppression of PDGF-c production was indicated by three observations. LDL modified in vitro by free radical lipid peroxidation quantitatively inhibited PDGF-c production. The inhibition was dependent on the level of LDL oxidation (as measured by thiobarbituric acid reactivity) and was specific since total protein synthesis was not affected. Inhibition of PDGF-c production by acetyl-LDL was also dependent on peroxidation. A lipid extract from oxidized LDL, but not from native LDL, specifically inhibited PDGF-c production. Chloroquine, monensin, and NH4Cl, inhibitors of lysosomal hydrolytic activity, did not prevent acetyl-LDL-mediated inhibition of PDGF-c production, indicating that cellular metabolism of the lipoprotein was not required for the inhibition. Furthermore, acetyl-LDL suppressed PDGF-c production by endothelial cells even in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene, an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, suggesting that cellular propagation of free radicals was not required for the inhibition. Finally, inhibition of PDGF-c production may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level since Northern blot analysis using a v-sis probe showed that the PDGF B-chain mRNA amounts were unaffected by oxidized or acetylated LDL. In summary, levels of an oxidized lipoprotein that have no effect on endothelial cell viability or protein synthetic rates can completely suppress production of a growth factor which may act as a paracrine mitogen in normal and pathological vascular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1658155341,"The majority of DNA polymerase alpha and primase activities bound to the nuclear matrix of regenerating rat liver were released into an extract by a mild sonication procedure. During maximal in vivo replication (22-h posthepatectomy) most of the solubilized alpha-polymerase and primase cosedimented at approximately 100 and 150 S as discrete megacomplexes with smaller amounts at 10 and 17 S. In contrast, high salt extracts obtained during nuclear matrix isolation as well as matrix extracts prepared just before the onset of in vivo replication (14-h posthepatectomy) were completely devoid of megacomplexes. In vitro incubation of the matrix extracts resulted in rapid dissolution of the megacomplexes to the 10 and 17 S forms. These relationships lead us to propose a dynamic assembly of the eucaryotic replisome which is initiated pre-replicatively as 10 and 17 S complexes and functionally expressed during in vivo replication as 100 and 150 S megacomplexes or clustersomes."
https://openalex.org/W1584420390,"We have developed methods for the preparative purification of two sialoglycoproteins (glycophorins B and C) from human erythrocyte membranes by high-performance ion exchange and gel permeation chromatography in the presence of Triton X-100. Glycophorin B was obtained without any detectable contaminants, and glycophorin C exhibited a purity of about 90-95%. The amino acid sequence of the intramembranous domain (residues 36-71) of glycophorin B was determined and found to be similar to that of the hydrophobic region of the major sialoglycoprotein (glycophorin A). The amino acid sequence of the hydrophobic domain (residues 49-88) of glycophorin C, that was also determined, agreed completely with the structure recently deduced from cDNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1527772104,"The assembly of reduced pro-alpha chains of type I and type II procollagen into the native triple-helical molecule was examined in vitro in the presence and absence of pure protein disulfide isomerase. The data clearly indicates that protein disulfide isomerase is able to accelerate the formation of native interchain disulfide bonds in these procollagens. It takes about 6 min after disulfide bonding before triple-helical molecules exist, while the time required to produce triple-helical type I procollagen in the presence of protein disulfide isomerase is 9.4 min and that for type II procollagen 17.2 min. These values agree with those obtained for type I and II procollagen in vivo suggesting that protein disulfide isomerase is also an enzyme catalyzing interchain disulfide bond formation in procollagen in vivo. The formation of native disulfide bonds can proceed without any enzyme catalysis but then requires the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Bonding is rather slow in such a case, however, resulting in a delay in the formation of the triple helix."
https://openalex.org/W1572703984,"We have isolated cDNA clones and determined the gene structure of chicken ovoinhibitor, a seven domain Kazal serine proteinase inhibitor. Using RNA blot hybridization analysis, the gene was identified initially as a region 9-23 kilobases upstream of the gene for the related inhibitor ovomucoid. Ovoinhibitor RNA appears in oviduct and liver. cDNA clones were identified by screening an oviduct cDNA library with a nick-translated DNA restriction fragment which contained an exon of the gene. The mature protein sequence derived from a cDNa clone is in excellent agreement with that which we obtained from direct sequencing of purified ovoinhibitor. The protein-sequencing strategy is reported. The P1 amino acids of the Kazal domains are consistent with the known broad inhibitory specificity of ovoinhibitor. The gene is about 10.3 kilobases in length and consists of 16 exons. Each Kazal domain is encoded by two exons. Like ovomucoid, introns fall between the coding sequences of the ovoinhibitor domains, an arrangement which may have facilitated domain duplication. The intradomain intron occurs in an identical position in all of the ovoinhibitor and ovomucoid Kazal domains, suggesting that this intron was present in the primordial inhibitor gene. We discuss the location of the intradomain intron in relation to the known structure of four Kazal inhibitors and suggest a scheme for the evolution of the ovoinhibitor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1532573283,"We have recently shown that a thyroid hormone-responsive transcription stimulatory element exists in the 5'-flanking DNA near the rat growth hormone (rGH) gene (Crew, M. D., and Spindler, S. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5018-5022). Progressive deletion-transfection analysis of the 5' end of the gene has led to the identification of two genetic elements responsive to thyroid hormone. The first of these is a thyroid hormone-responsive transcription stimulatory element, or TSE. The TSE induced a thyroid hormone-dependent induction-attenuation transcription cycle similar to that of the natural rGH gene. Deletion of sequences between positions -254 and -241 in the rGH 5'-flanking DNA eliminated TSE activity. The second regulatory element is a thyroid hormone-responsive transcription inhibitory element (TIE). When this element was active, thyroid hormone strongly but transiently inhibited rGH promoter utilization. Deletion of sequences between nucleotides -46 and -21 abolished the effects of the TIE. To determine whether the TSE and TIE are enhancer-like, we ligated various regions of rat growth hormone 5'-flanking DNA containing these elements to a chimeric test gene containing the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Thyroid hormone activated heterologous promoter utilization when a rat growth hormone 5'-flanking DNA fragment containing the TSE (-520 to -115) was linked in cis, regardless of the distance or orientation of the TSE with respect to the promoter. These data suggest that the TSE is a thyroid hormone-dependent enhancer. In contrast, when the TIE was placed immediately 5' to the thymidine kinase promoter, transcription was not effected by 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine, suggesting that the TIE is not enhancer-like."
https://openalex.org/W1545500504,"A new member of the phycocyanin family of phycobiliproteins, R-phycocyanin II (R-PC II) has been discovered in several strains of marine Synechococcus sp. R-PC II has absorption maxima at 533 and 554 nm, a subsidiary maximum at 615 nm, and a fluorescence emission maximum at 646 nm. It is the first phycoerythrobilin (PEB)-containing phycocyanin of cyanobacterial origin. The purified protein is made up of alpha and beta subunits in equal amounts and is in an (alpha beta)2 aggregation state. The alpha and beta subunits of this protein are homologous to the corresponding subunits of previously described C- and R-phycocyanins as assessed by amino-terminal sequence determination and analyses of sequences about sites of bilin attachment. R-PC II carries phycocyanobilin (PCB) at beta-84 and PEB at alpha-84 and beta-155 (residue numbering is that for C-phycocyanin), whereas in C-phycocyanin PCB is present at all three positions. In R-phycocyanin, the bilin distribution is alpha-84 (PCB), beta-84 (PCB), beta-155 (PEB). In both R-phycocyanin and R-phycocyanin II excitation at 550 nm, absorbed primarily by PEB groups, leads to emission at 625 nm from PCB. These comparative data support the conclusion that the invariant beta-84 PCB serves as the terminal energy acceptor in phycocyanins."
https://openalex.org/W1588206284,"Two enzymes were purified from actinomycin-synthesizing Streptomyces chrysomallus which could be identified as peptide synthetases involved in the biosynthesis of actinomycin. Actinomycin synthetase II activates the first two amino acids of the peptide chains of the peptide lactone antibiotic, threonine and valine (or isoleucine), as thioesters via their corresponding adenylates. It is a single polypeptide chain of Mr 225,000. Similarly, actinomycin synthetase III activates proline, glycine, and valine (the remaining three amino acids in the antibiotic) as thioesters and is a single polypeptide chain of about Mr 280,000. It also carries the methyltransferase function(s) for N-methylation of thioesterified glycine and valine. In addition, it catalyzes the formation of cyclo(sarcosyl-N-methyl-L-valine) from glycine, L-valine, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine at the expense of ATP. Although the cell-free synthesis of the peptide lactone was not as yet accomplished, the data provide evidence that together with the 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid-activating enzyme (now designated as actinomycin synthetase I) all amino acid-activating protein components of the actinomycin-synthesizing enzyme complex are identified."
https://openalex.org/W1572819472,"To evaluate the impact of taurine on hepatic cholesterol catabolism low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding, internalization and degradation were measured in cultured Hep G2 cells. Preincubation of cells with 0.1-10 mM taurine for 24 h stimulated LDL receptor activity by as much as 100%. Only the high affinity LDL receptor activity (specific) was increased by taurine preincubation, whereas the low affinity receptor activity (nonspecific) remained unchanged. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that taurine doubled the number of LDL receptors without affecting receptor affinity. Taurine-enhanced LDL receptor activity was most pronounced when LDL concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/ml, but was noted at taurine concentrations as low as 0.1 mM (plasma level). Interestingly, taurine had no effect on LDL receptor activity when it was added simultaneously with 125I-LDL to Hep G2 cells, or when non-bile acid-producing human skin fibroblasts were tested. Stimulation of LDL receptor activity was also obtained with 10 mM cysteine, a taurine precursor, but not with glycine. Increased cellular concentrations of taurine and cysteine were associated with an elevated rate of bile acid synthesis and a reduced cellular free cholesterol concentration. The data suggest that taurine enhanced LDL receptor activity by sparing cysteine, a known sulfhydryl group donor and stimulator of 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, and that the latter stimulated bile acid production leading to increased utilization of cellular free cholesterol and enhanced LDL uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1482969059,"In order to determine the ratio of phosphates to hormone-binding sites on nonactivated (non-DNA-binding) glucocorticoid receptors in WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells, we have extracted these receptors from cells grown to a steady state with 32P, labeled them with a saturating concentration of [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate, purified them using a monoclonal antibody, and analyzed them by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions. The complexes contained approximately 5 mol of phosphate/mol of bound steroid. Only half of the phosphates were associated with the approximately 100-kDa protein which is labeled with [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate. The remaining phosphates were associated with the approximately 90-kDa non-steroid-binding component of the nonactivated complex. Dual label studies, using [35S]methionine to measure receptor protein and 32P to measure receptor phosphates, have enabled us to determine the phosphate content, relative to receptor protein, of both nonactivated and activated cytosolic complexes generated in intact WEHI-7 cells exposed to triamcinolone acetonide at 37 degrees C. The total amount of phosphate associated with the activated complex is roughly half of that associated with the nonactivated complex, the decrease being accounted for by dissociation of the approximately 90-kDa phosphoprotein which accompanies activation. However, the ratio of 32P to 35S counts associated with the approximately 100-kDa steroid-binding protein is the same for the activated and nonactivated complexes. These results indicate that there is no net change in the phosphorylation of the approximately 100-kDa steroid-binding component of the cytosolic glucocorticoid-receptor complex upon activation in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W1502597963,"In previous studies it was shown that hepatocellular uptake of fatty acids is mediated by a specific fatty acid binding membrane protein. To determine now directly the driving forces for their entry into hepatocytes, the uptake of a representative long chain fatty acid, [3H]oleate, by basolateral rat liver plasma membrane vesicles was examined. Influx of oleate was stimulated by increasing the Na+ concentration of the medium. In the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient (NaSCN, NaNO3, NaCl) oleate was accumulated during the initial uptake phase (20 s) at a concentration of 1.4-1.9-fold that at equilibrium (overshoot). This activation of influx was not observed after replacement of Na+ by Li+, K+, or choline+. Na+-dependent oleate uptake was significantly stimulated by creation of a negative intravesicular potential, either by altering the accompanying anions or by valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potentials, suggesting an electrogenic transport mechanism. Na+-dependent fatty acid uptake was temperature dependent, with maximal overshoots occurring at 37 degrees C, and revealed saturation kinetics with a Km of 83.1 nM and Vmax of 2.9 nmol X min-1 X mg protein-1. These studies demonstrate that the carrier-mediated hepatocellular uptake of fatty acids represents an active potential-sensitive Na+-fatty acid cotransport system."

https://openalex.org/W2057073888,The fate of gamete DNA was followed in the next generation embryos of the nematode C. elegans. Either male worms or spermless hermaphrodites were grown on bromodeoxyuridine-containing E. coli in order to label germ-line DNA. Matings then produced embryos in which only the DNA strands provided by the gametes contained label. This original gamete DNA could be detected during embryonic development by using a fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody specific to bromodeoxyuridine. Both the number and position of fluorescent spots in the embryo indicate that gamete DNA strands segregate randomly during development. Random segregation of parental DNA strands rules out models of development that invoke chromosome imprinting or immortal DNA strands.

Na+-stimulated Mg2+ efflux was inhibited by quinidine and by ATP depletion. In the absence of external Na+, Mg2+ efflux was stimulated by increases in external Mn2+ concentration following a Michaelian-like function with an apparent dissociation constant (KMn) of 35 +/− 15 microM (mean +/− S.D. of four experiments) and a variable maximal rate ranging from 350 to 1400 mumol (1 cells X h)−1.

Quinidine-sensitive (or ATP-dependent) Mg2+ efflux exhibited very similar values when compared with quinidine-sensitive (or ATP-dependent) Mn2+ influx. Mn2+ efflux in rat erythrocytes (loaded with total internal Mn2+ contents of 230-450 mumol/l cells) was stimulated by increases in external Na+ concentration and inhibited by quinidine. In the absence of external Na+, Mn2+ efflux was stimulated by increases in external Mg2+ concentration following a Michaelian-like function with an apparent dissociation constant (KMg) of about 35 +/− 5 microM (mean +/− range of two experiments) and a maximal rate of about 60-100 mumol (1 cells X h)−1.

https://openalex.org/W1564607697,"The kinetics of assembly have been monitored spectrophotometrically for normal and variant human oxyhemoglobins in 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, at 21.5 degrees C. Oxyhemoglobin versus oxy chain static difference spectra were performed and revealed subtle but significant absorption changes in both the visible and Soret regions. Kinetic experiments were performed by rapidly mixing equivalent (in heme) concentrations of alpha and beta A chains and following the change in absorbance at 583 nm with time. Over a protein concentration range of 10-100 microM in heme prior to mixing, these time courses were homogeneous and followed first-order kinetics, yielding a value of 0.069 s-1 for the apparent rate constant of dissociation of oxygenated beta A chain tetramers. Under these conditions, the overall assembly of oxyhemoglobins S (beta 6Glu----Val) and N-Baltimore (beta 95Lys----Glu) were also governed by the rates of dissociation of their respective oxygenated beta S and beta N-Baltimore chain tetramers with the apparent first-order rate constants of 0.044 and 0.15 s-1, respectively. In the Soret region, the alpha, beta monomer combination reaction could be observed if the protein concentration (heme basis) was lowered and if protein nonequivalency (beta chain exceeded alpha chain concentration) mixing experiments were performed. A kinetic oxyhemoglobin A, oxy-alpha, oxy-beta A monomer difference spectrum could be generated, and simple second-order kinetics were observed (415 nm) yielding rate constants of 2.3, 3.3, and 4.8 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 for the assembly of oxyhemoglobins S, A, and N-Baltimore, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first kinetic study to reveal significant differences between the rate of association of alpha and beta monomers of hemoglobin A and those of two distinctly charged hemoglobin variants."

Assuming 1:1 stoichiometry of the enzymes in the complex, an apparent dissociation constant of 10(-6) M was calculated from fluorescence anisotropy measurements. The effect of various metabolites on the interaction was tested. NAD+, oxalacetate, citrate, ATP, and L(-)- or D(+)-malate had no effect on the association of the two enzymes, whereas alpha-ketoglutarate increased and NADH decreased it. The interaction of mitochondrial citrate synthase with cytosolic malate dehydrogenase was found to be much weaker, whereas interaction of citrate synthase with another cytosolic enzyme, aldolase, could not be detected. In kinetic experiments, the activation of malate dehydrogenase by citrate synthase was observed. The effect of pyridine nucleotides and alpha-ketoglutarate is discussed in relation to the direction of the metabolic flow of oxalacetate."

https://openalex.org/W1535813107,"In quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) known to elevate cAMP increased rapidly cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) as measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin2. The primary source of the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was extracellular. Pretreatment of the cells with various doses of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, inhibited the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner. Inversely, TPA enhanced slightly the PGE1-induced increase of cAMP. TPA alone did not affect the basal level of [Ca2+]i or cAMP in the absence of PGE1. The inhibitory action of TPA on the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was mimicked by other protein kinase C-activating agents such as phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol. 4 alpha-Phorbol 12,13-didecanoate known to be inactive for protein kinase C was ineffective in this capacity. Prolonged treatment of the cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate resulted in the down-regulation and disappearance of protein kinase C. In these protein kinase C-deficient cells, PGE1 still elevated [Ca2+]i to the same extent as that in the control cells, but TPA did not inhibit the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. These results strongly suggest that protein kinase C serves as an inhibitor for PGE1-induced Ca2+ influx in Swiss 3T3 cells."

NBD-colcemid exhibited a visible absorption maximum at 465 nm and fluoresced in the range of 520-540 nm, highly in environments of low polarity, whereas only slightly in aqueous solution. The addition of NBD-colcemid to bovine brain tubulin was accompanied by a striking enhancement of fluorescence. The fluorescent titration study suggested a stoichiometric binding of NBD-colcemid to tubulin. Assembled microtubules were directly visualized after mixing with NBD-colcemid using a fluorescence microscope. NBD-colcemid reversibly disrupted the metaphase spindles of sea urchin eggs as well as unlabeled colcemid. However, even when the birefringence of spindles was mostly lost, self-quenching properties of the NBD fluorescence allowed tubulin and its oligomers aggregated in higher concentrations in eggs to be visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The results suggest a wide applicability of NBD-colcemid as a fluorescent probe for studying the interactions of colcemid with tubulin and microtubules, as well as for localizing other colcemid-binding structures within cells."
https://openalex.org/W1586711009,"The upper and lower limits of the mechanistic stoichiometry (n) of electric charge translocation coupled to mitochondrial electron transport have been determined for the oxidation of succinate and beta-hydroxybutyrate using a recently described method (Beavis, A. D., and Lehninger, A. L. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 158, 307-314). This method requires no assumptions regarding the magnitude of proton leakage or pump slippage, but it takes advantage of the ability to predict the direction of change as the coupled fluxes are modulated by specific means. In this study, the rates of K+ uptake (JK) and O2 consumption (JO) were determined from simultaneous electrode measurements in the presence of various concentrations of valinomycin or inhibitors of electron flow. When valinomycin is varied, the rate of proton leakage or pump slippage should decrease as JO increases, with the result that the slope dJK/dJO will be greater than n. On the other hand, when an inhibitor of electron flow is varied, the rate of proton leakage or pump slippage should increase as JO increases, with the result that the slope dJK/dJO should be less than n. The data obtained using this approach indicate that n lies between 6.7 and 7.3 for succinate oxidation and between 10.2 and 11.7 for beta-hydroxybutyrate (or NADH) oxidation. It is concluded that the mechanistic stoichiometry of charge separation coupled to electron flow is 7 q+/O in the span from succinate to oxygen and 11 q+/O in the span from NADH to oxygen. These conclusions are fully consistent with the limits of the mechanistic ATP/O ratios previously determined for these spans (Beavis, A. D., and Lehninger, A. L. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 158, 315-322)."
https://openalex.org/W2167460329,"Abstract Actively reinitiating cell-free translation systems from sea urchin eggs and embryos have been developed. The extracts retain the overall differences in protein synthetic activity observed in intact eggs and embryos. The effect of combining extracts from eggs and embryos suggests the presence of a dominant inhibitor of translation in the egg. This inhibitor also prevents the initiation of translation in a cell-free system from rabbit reticulocytes. In the reticulocyte system, the egg inhibitor causes the accumulation of 48 S preinitiation complexes, as measured by the accumulation of initiator tRNA and globin mRNA on the small ribosomal subunit. Accumulation of this uncommon intermediate suggests either that the inhibitor prevents the binding of the 60 S ribosomal subunit, or that it prevents migration of the 40 S subunit from the 5' end of mRNA to the first AUG."
https://openalex.org/W1544481199,"Abstract As deduced from its 1H NMR spectrum, oncomodulin's solution conformation is very similar to the tertiary structure of other single domain 2-site calcium-binding proteins of the troponin C class. Despite its extensive amino acid sequence homology with parvalbumins, however, oncomodulin differs significantly from these proteins in its Ca(II)----Ln(III) exchange characteristics. Although the relative affinity of Lu(III) for the EF site of Ca2-oncomodulin was normal, beta Lu:EF/beta Ca:EF being 175 +/- 15, displacement of Ca(II) from the CD site was not favored, beta Lu:CD/beta Ca:CD being 1.2 +/- 0.1. Lineshape analyses of several 1H NMR resonances generated by the Lu(III) titration of Ca2-oncomodulin indicated that Ca(II)----Ln(III) exchange at the CD site was 15-20 s-1, approximately 100 times faster than exchange at the CD site of parvalbumins. Analyses of the distribution of metal-bound oncomodulin species showed that Ca(II)----Lu(III) exchange was cooperative, the coefficient of cooperativity being estimated as 5 +/- 1. The kinetics of the release of Yb(III) from oncomodulin as measured by optical stopped-flow techniques corroborated the observed cooperativity in metal binding; the off-rate constant of Yb(III) from the EF site of Yb2-oncomodulin was 0.0036 s-1, approximately 19 times slower than the release of Yb(III) from the EF site of Ca1Yb1-oncomodulin. We attribute part of the reduced preference of small Ln(III)s for the CD site of oncomodulin to a combination of this site's inherent incompressibility (Williams, T.C., Corson, D.C. & Sykes, B.D. (1984) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106, 5698-5702) and the Glu----Asp substitution at sequence position 59, the residue which chelates metal at the -X coordination position. Like the CD site in oncomodulin, site III in troponin C has not only a lower affinity for calcium relative to the CD site of parvalbumins but also aspartic acid at its -X position; a water molecule bridges the gap between bound metal and the carboxyl group of the relatively short side chain of Asp-114 (Herzberg, O. & James, M. N. G. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 5298-5302). Hence, we suggest that Asp-59 in oncomodulin binds metal only indirectly through an intervening water molecule, a proposal which is consistent with the CD site's reduced affinity for ions the size of Ca(II) or smaller."

Proline hydroxylation of the nascent chains was at least 40% complete, based on radioactive hydroxyproline/proline ratios. These data provide the first direct evidence that hydroxylation of procollagen proline residues does occur on nascent chains. The electrophoretic profiles of [3H]proline-labeled nascent chains and of unlabeled nascent chains visualized by Western blotting with 35S-labeled monoclonal antibodies to the alpha 1(I) N-propeptide or the C-propeptides indicate that there are pauses in the translation of procollagen alpha-chains in the intact cells. Approximately 25% of the radioactivity associated with [3H]proline-labeled polysomes was in fully elongated but underhydroxylated (relative to secreted procollagen) pro-alpha-chains. The association of these completely elongated but only partially modified procollagen chains with the polysome complex may facilitate the carboxyl-terminal interactions which lead to triple helix formation."
https://openalex.org/W1517516914,"The possible role of the regulatory light chains (LC2) in in vitro assembly of rabbit skeletal and dog cardiac myosins was examined by formation of minifilaments and synthetic thick filaments. After LC2 was removed, the resulting myosin preparations exhibited little aggregation in 0.5 M KCl and 0.05 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.5). Minifilaments migrated as a single, hypersharp peak during sedimentation velocity, but electron microscopic analysis revealed a more destabilized structure for LC2-deficient minifilaments. Thick filaments were formed in buffers containing 0.15 M KCl and the following: 20 mM imidazole; 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM ATP; or 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM MgCl2, all at pH 7.0. Skeletal and cardiac myosin filaments formed in imidazole buffer alone were bipolar, tapered at both ends, and about 1.6 micron long. Removal of LC2 resulted in the formation of shorter thick filaments (1.2 micron long). This effect could be reversed by reassociation with LC2. Inclusion of ATP in the buffer disrupted the filament structure, resulting in irregular, short filaments (less than 0.6 micron); addition of both ATP and MgCl2 largely reversed the effects of ATP alone. In cardiac myosin filaments, the bare zone diameter increased from 16 nm as measured in control and LC2-recombined samples to 20 nm in LC2-deficient myosin assemblies. These results implicate LC2 in an active role in controlling synthetic thick filament length in both skeletal and cardiac muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1608583560,"The flavin prosthetic group (FAD) of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) from Pseudomonas fluorescens, was replaced by 6-hydroxy-FAD (an extra hydroxyl group on the carbon at position 6 of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD). The catalytic cycle of this modified enzyme was analyzed and compared to the function of native (FAD) enzyme. Transient state kinetic analyses of the multiple changes in the chemical state of the flavin were the principal methods used to probe the mechanism. Four known substrates of the native enzyme were used to probe the reaction. With the natural substrate, p-hydroxybenzoate, the 6-hydroxy-FAD enzyme activity was 12-15% of native enzyme, due to a slower release of product from the enzyme, and less than one product molecule was formed per NADPH oxidized, due to an increased rate of nonproductive decomposition of the transient peroxyflavin essential to the catalytic pathway. More extensive changes in mechanism were observed with the substrates, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate and p-aminobenzoate. The results suggest that, during catalysis, when the reduced state of FAD is ready for oxygen reaction, the substrate is located below and close to the C-4a/N-5 edge of the isoalloxazine ring. The nature of the high extinction, transient state of flavin, formed upon transfer of oxygen to substrate is discussed. It is not a flavin cation, and is unlikely to be an oxygen-substituted analogue of N-3/C-4 dihydroflavin."
https://openalex.org/W1652853529,One portion of the mitochondrial genome of mammals contains no structural genes. This so-called displacement loop (D-loop) region includes the two major transcriptional promoters and one of the origins of DNA replication. The D-loop region is often found in a novel triplex structure in which a discrete single-stranded DNA segment is hybridized to one strand of the genome displacing the other strand. The significance of this triplex structure and the possible function of the single-stranded D-loop segment have remained obscure. Here we show that the locations of the major 5' termini of D-loops in growing and nongrowing bovine cells differ by 46 nucleotides. The location of bovine D-loop 5' termini is dependent on the cell cycle but is not directly linked to nuclear DNA replication. The nature of D-loop 5' termini in growing cells is altered by inhibitors of cytoplasmic protein synthesis but not by inhibitors of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Changes in D-loop 5' termini correlate with alterations in transcripts from one of the transcriptional promoters. These findings implicate D-loops in the control of bovine mitochondrial gene expression and suggest mechanisms by which this control might by accomplished.
https://openalex.org/W1549127727,"Abstract Electron microscopy studies have shown that the structure of the complex of myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) cross-linked to actin with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethyl-amino) propyl] carbodiimide is very different in the presence and absence of ATP (Craig, R., Greene, L. E., and Eisenberg, E. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3247-3251). More recent studies have found that the structure of the cross-linked complex between S-1 modified extensively with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM.S-1) and actin resembles that of the rigor complex both in the presence and absence of ATP, whereas the structure of the cross-linked complex between S-1 modified with N',N'-p-phenylenedimaleimide (pPDM.S-1) and actin resembles that of the cross-linked actin.S-1 complex in the presence of ATP. In the present study, we have obtained biochemical evidence supporting these results. The conformation of the different cross-linked actin.S-1 complexes was determined by studying their effect on the troponin-tropomyosin-actin complex (regulated actin). The basis of this probe for conformation is that S-1.ATP, which is in the weak-binding conformation, interacts very differently with regulated actin than S-1 or S-1.ADP, which are in the strong-binding conformation. We find that both in the presence and absence of ATP, cross-linked NEM.S-1 appears to be in the strong-binding conformation, whereas cross-linked pPDM.S-1 appears to be shifted toward the weak-binding conformation. In contrast, cross-linked unmodified S-1 appears to be in the strong-binding conformation in the presence of ADP and the weak-binding conformation in the presence of ATP. Therefore, in agreement with electron microscopy studies, the cross-linked actin.S-1 complex appears to be able to alternate between the weak-binding and strong-binding conformation during the cross-bridge cycle."

One analog, [Nle-(-25), Nle-(-21), Asp-(-18), Ala-(-14), D-Tyr-(+1)]preproPTH-(-29-+1)amide, inhibits preprotein processing in the mammalian system but fails to induce translation arrest in the plant system.

These studies demonstrate that the chemically synthesized signal region of a precursor protein interacts directly with signal recognition particle and functionally mimics the proposed properties of a native signal sequence linked to a nascent protein as it emerges from the ribosome during biosynthesis, and an analog of the signal peptide reveals fundamental differences between the components involved in the protein secretion apparatus in mammals and plants."

The inhibitors 2-methyl lactate or sulfite decreased the incorporation to 0.9 mol of DNP per mole of flavin. Peptide mapping by high performance liquid chromatography of radioactively labeled protein digested with trypsin showed three peaks of radioactivity. DNP-amino acid analysis and peptide sequencing showed that 2 distinct cysteine residues and a histidine residue had been modified. Both cysteine peptides were protected from modification by either of the inhibitors, whereas the histidine was only partially protected. The sum of the 2 cysteine peptides accounted for nearly 1 mole of label per mole of monomer. Since both of the cysteines are protected by inhibitors, they both must be in or near the substrate-binding site of the enzyme and appear to be modified in a mutually exclusive fashion. The histidine, on the other hand, does not lie directly in the substrate-binding site. It is possible that this histidine is the positively charged residue that is postulated to be near the N-1 position of the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1579988568,"Abstract The rate of dissociation of labeled estradiol from [3H] estradiol-8-9 S receptor complexes ([3H]E2-8-9 S ER) molybdate-stabilized was determined in the presence of either an excess of unlabeled hormone (chase) or of charcoal/dextran suspension (stripping). Biphasic dissociation of the hormone was observed in both cases, but the fraction of the fast-dissociating component was dramatically reduced (5% instead of 60%) when stripping was used. As the dissociation patterns were independent of the degree of saturation of the receptor, the results do not favor the possibility of cooperative effects between binding sites in the 8-9 S ER. After pretreatment of cytosol by charcoal at 28 degrees C for 15 min, the dissociation studied by chase displayed only the slowly dissociating component (t1/2 approximately 65 min). This effect was dependent on temperature and influenced by the ligand bound to 8-9 S ER, being pronounced with estradiol (E2) and absent with [3H]4-hydroxytamoxifen. The slow-dissociating component obtained after charcoal treatment was reconverted to fast-dissociating state by adding dithiothreitol or by incubation with cytosol at 20 degrees C. The charcoal treatment did not change the sedimentation coefficient (approximately 9 S) and the Stokes radius (approximately 7 nm) of the [3H]E2-8-9 S ER, and the slow-dissociating form obtained did not bind to DNA-cellulose either in the presence or absence of molybdate ions. Thus there are likely small but functionally significant changes of structure in the 8-9 S ER which remain in a non-DNA-binding form, whereas the rate of estradiol dissociation is modified."
https://openalex.org/W1608883348,"The lentil (LcH) and pea (PSA) lectins, which are members of the class of D-glucose/D-mannose binding lectins, are Ca2+ X Mn2+ metalloproteins that require the metal ions for their saccharide binding and biological activities. We have prepared a variety of Cd2+ derivatives of PSA and LcH, with Cd2+ in either the transition metal (S1) or calcium (S2) sites, or in both. Thus, Cd2+ X Zn2+, Cd2+ X Mn2+, and Ca2+ X Cd2+ derivatives were prepared, in addition to the Cd2+ X Cd2+ derivatives which we have recently reported. This is the first report of stable mixed metal Cd2+ complexes of lectins. The physical and saccharide binding properties of the Cd2+ derivatives of both lectins were characterized by a variety of physiochemical techniques and found to be the same as those of the corresponding native proteins. 113Cd NMR spectra of mono- and disubstituted 113Cd2+ complexes of LcH and PSA were recorded and compared with 113Cd NMR data for concanavalin A (ConA) (Palmer, A.R., Bailey, D.B., Behnke, W.D., Cardin, A.D., Yang, P.P., and Ellis, P.D. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5063-5070). The data for the PSA and LcH derivatives were found to be very similar, indicating close homology of their metal ion binding sites. 113Cd resonances at 44.6 ppm and -129.4 ppm for 113Cd2+ X 113Cd2+ X LcH, and at 46.6 and -130.4 for the corresponding PSA derivative, are chemical shifts very similar to those observed for 113Cd2+ X 113Cd2+ X ConA. Assignment of the resonances to the transition metal (S1) and calcium (S2) sites were unambiguous since the Ca2+ X 113Cd2+ and 113Cd2+ X Zn2+ derivatives of both lectins showed single resonances characteristic of the S1 and S2 sites, respectively. The results indicate that, unlike ConA, 113Cd2+ binds tightly to PSA and LcH. Binding of monosaccharide to both lectins induce small (2 ppm) upfield shifts in their S2 113Cd resonances, in contrast to the larger shift (8 ppm) observed in ConA. The 113Cd2+ X Mn2+ complexes of PSA and LcH fail to show a 113Cd resonance characteristic of these derivatives, which provides evidence for the close proximity of the metal ions in the two proteins. The present findings indicate that the coordinating ligand atoms to the metal ions at the S1 and S2 sites in LcH, PSA, and ConA are the same."
