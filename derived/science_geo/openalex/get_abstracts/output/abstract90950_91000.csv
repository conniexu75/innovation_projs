https://openalex.org/W1540618467,"The plasminogen activator secreted by a cultured human melanoma cell line was purified and compared with urokinase and with tissue plasminogen activator from human uterus. The purification procedure consisted of chromatography on zinc chelate-agarose, concanavalin A-agarose, and Sephadex G-150 in the presence of 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80. The purified material was obtained from the culture medium with a yield of 46% and a purification factor of 263. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed one main band with a molecular weight of about 72,000, and in the presence of reducing agents, two bands of 33,000 and 39,000. Addition of the protease inhibitor Aprotinin to the culture media and column buffers yielded a one-chain plasminogen activator with a molecular weight of about 72,000. One molecule of activator reacted with about one molecular of [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate. The melanoma plasminogen activator and the uterine tissue plasminogen activator appeared to be very similar on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and amidolytic properties. Both activators bound to fibrin clots, while urokinase did not. In immunodiffusion, as well as in quenching experiments of the fibrinolytic activities, the melanoma plasminogen activator appeared to be immunologically identical with the uterine tissue plasminogen activator, but unrelated to urokinase. All these findings indicate that the plasminogen activator secreted by human melanoma cells in culture is very similar to, or identical with, the plasminogen activator found in normal tissue, but different from urokinase."
https://openalex.org/W2064421628,"To examine germ line genes of the heavy chain variable region (VH) that might contribute to formation of antibodies of the NPb family, we have derived cDNA clones from two hybridomas making NPb antibodies. One, B1-8, made an IgM protein and was derived during a primary response; the other, S43, made an IgG2a protein and was derived during a hyperimmune response. Sequence comparison of the two clones showed that they differed by only 10 bp in the VH region, had very different D segments and had identical J segments (J2). A set of closely related germ line VH genes was then cloned from a partial Eco RI library of C57Bl/6 DNA. By comparing the germ line VH regions to the cDNA VH regions, we identified seven potential candidates for encoding the VH regions of NPb antibodies. The seven VH regions were sequenced, and one V(186-2) contained exactly the DNA sequence found in the clone derived from B1-8. None of the DNA sequence differences that distinguished the S43-derived clone from the B1-8 clone was found in any of the other six germ line genes. Because the S43 sequence was more closely related to the V(186-2) germ line sequence than to any of the other VH genes, we conclude that the differences between the genes resulted from somatic mutation and that the two hybridomas derived their VH regions from the same germ line gene. Certain of the sequenced VH genes contain crippling mutations; the repertoire of germ line VH genes that can contribute to the diversity of antibodies may therefore be less than the total number of genes detectable by hydridization."
https://openalex.org/W1969540823,"Just two years ago one of the hottest topics in eucaryotic DNA synthesis was identification of the polymerase(s) responsible for chromosomal DNA replication. Today the controversy is nearly over; only the details remain to be filled in. DNA polymerase (Y is clearly the principal DNA polymerase required for DNA replication; major credit for this conclusion goes to the unusual antibiotic, aphidicolin. Aphidicolin is a tetracyclic diterpene tetraol, obtained from Cephalosporium aphidicola and certain other fungi. Its structure (shown below) is steroid-like, but it contains an unusual new ring system (Brundret et al., J. Chem. Sot. Chem. Comm. 1027-l 028, 1972). Aphidicolin inhibits the growth of eucaryotic cells (except those, like normal yeast cells, that are impermeable to it) and the growth of certain animal viruses (SV40, herpes virus and vaccinia virus) by inhibiting replicative DNA synthesis (Bucknali et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 4, 294-298, 1973; Krokan et al., Biochemistry 78, 4431-4443, 1979). The recent excitement about aphidicolin began with the demonstration that it is a specific, direct inhibitor of animal DNA polymerase 01 but is without effect on polymerases p or y (Ikegami et al., Nature 275, 458460, 1978). More recent studies show that it also inhibits the a-like DNA polymerases of plants (Sala et al., FEBS Lett. 7 7 7, 93-98, 1980) and of yeast (Plevani et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 78, 5057, 1980) and inhibits the DNA polymerases coded by vaccinia virus and herpes virus (Pedrali-Noy and Spadari, J. Virol. 36, 457-464, 1980). Although aphidicolin does inhibit DNA polymerase II of yeast (Plevani et al., lot. cit.), which, like procaryotic DNA"
https://openalex.org/W1971312119,"An E. coli strain carrying a fusion of the MalE and lacZ genes is induced for the synthesis of a hybrid protein, consisting of the N-terminal part of the maltose-binding protein and the enzymatically active C-terminal part of beta-galactosidase, by addition of maltose to cells. The secretion of the protein is initiated by the signal peptide attached to the N terminus of the maltose-binding protein sequence, but is not completed, presumably because the beta-galactosidase moiety of the hybrid protein interferes with the passage of the polypeptide through the cytoplasmic membrane. Thus the protein becomes stuck to the cytoplasmic membrane. Under such conditions, periplasmic proteins, including maltose-binding protein (encoded by the malE gene) and alkaline phosphatase, and the major outer-membrane proteins, including OmpF, OmpA and probably lipoprotein, are synthesized as precursor forms with unprocessed signal sequences. This effect is observed within 15 min after high levels of induction are achieved. The simplest explanation for these results and those of pulse-chase experiments is that specific sites in the cytoplasmic membrane become progressively occupied by the hybrid protein, resulting in an inhibition of normal localization and processing of periplasmic and outer-membrane proteins. These results suggest that most of the periplasmic and outer-membrane proteins share a common step in localization before the polypeptide becomes accessible to the processing enzyme. If this interpretation is correct, we can estimate that an E. coli cell has roughly 2 x 10(4) such sites in the cytoplasmic membrane. A system is described for detecting the precursor of any exported protein."
https://openalex.org/W1568917698,"Dual radiolabel incorporation of [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]palmitate or [14C]stearate by human neutrophils was employed to study both the release and metabolism of arachidonic acid. Results indicate the involvement of a phospholipase A2 mechanism causing [3H]arachidonate release from membrane phospholipid. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine were the sources of [3H]arachidonate; about twice as much radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol was degraded as phosphatidylcholine. Challenge of neutrophils with opsonized zymosan and calcium ionophores caused the release of [3H]arachidonate; however, ionophores but not opsonized zymosan led to the production of [3H]hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and [3H]dihydroxyicosatetraenoic acid. These products were preferentially released by neutrophils into the extracellular milieu in contrast with free [3H]arachidonate which remained cell associated. One-third of the [3H]hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid but not [3H]dihydroxyicosatetraenoic acid was reincorporated into cellular lipid, primarily phospholipid. No significant production of [3H]prostaglandin or [3H]thromboxane was detected. In contrast to zymosan and ionophore, phorbol myristate acetate, another potent stimulant of neutrophil oxidative metabolism and degranulation, did not release [3H]arachidonate."
https://openalex.org/W1985712090,"We have established the exon-intron structure of the gene coding for the constant (C) region of the mouse immunoglobulin delta heavy chain, using DNA clones isolated from BALB/c embryos and the delta mRNA extracted from two delta-producing hybridomas, B1-8. delta 1 and GCL2.8. At least three types of C delta gene structures are identified. A 2.7 kb delta mRNA reveals six exons. This delta mRNA may code for a membrane-bound delta chain. A second delta mRNA of 1.8 kb shares the first (5' side relative to direction of transcription) three exons with the 2.7 kb delta mRNA and in addition contains a fourth exon unique to this mRNA species. This delta mRNA most likely codes for a secreted delta chain. A third delta mRNA, also of 1.8 kb, shares the first four exons and a part of the fifth exon with the 2.7 kb mRNA. Its function, if any, remains unclear. We investigated the question of how a lymphocyte can produce the mu and delta heavy chains simultaneously, using the hybridoma GCL 2.8, which makes both IgM and IgD. Results of Southern gel blot analysis and gene cloning experiments indicate that this cell utilizes the same rearranged VH gene for the synthesis of the mu and delta chains, and yet maintains the embryonic configuration for the C mu and C delta genes and for the intervening region. Based on these results, we conclude that the VH sequence is spliced alternatively to the C mu or C delta sequence during processing of the primary RNA transcript. An alternative mechanism for the expression of the delta gene is found in hybridoma B1-8. delta 1, which actively secretes delta chains and synthesizes no mu chain. This mechanism involves deletion of the C mu gene, which brings the complete VH gene closer to the C delta gene."
https://openalex.org/W1598223054,"Measurements of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA) by phosphorus assays and by radioactivity ([14C]arachidonate) indicate that thrombin induces the degradation of a given fraction of the total PI to PA. The maximal conversion of PI to PA represents approximately one-third of the total PI which can be degraded by thrombin. This same amount of PI is converted to PA even in the presence of 1 mM quinacrine, which completely inhibits the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids and which reduces by two-thirds the loss of labeled PI. In this case the fall in PI is equal to the amount of PA formed. If thrombin is added to platelets previously maximally stimulated by ionophore A23187, PA is produced from PI in amounts equal to those produced by thrombin in the absence of other stimuli. Furthermore, the resynthesis of PI from PA is also unaffected by quinacrine, and thus the entire thrombin-stimulated PI-cycle is maintained. The data thus indicate the existence of a quinacrine-insensitive phospholipase C which can initially convert a given amount of PI to PA and which is closely associated to the thrombin receptor. The further breakdown of PI and production of arachidonic acid might result from the action of quinacrine-sensitive activities (i.e. phospholipase A2). The simplest scheme is one in which thrombin specifically produces an active fraction of PA which in some way results in the subsequent production of arachidonic acid from various phospholipids (including PI), perhaps by activation of quinacrine-sensitive phospholipase A2."
https://openalex.org/W2102071252,"We have discovered in animal cells a novel class of dispersed, solitary genetic elements derived from tandem multigene families. We refer to such displaced elements as orphons. Orphons arise from both protein-coding and non-protein-coding structural gene families, including those of histone and ribosomal genes. Southern transfer hybridization experiments, on DNA digested with enzymes that do not cut the major repeat unit of the family of genes of interest, reveal histone gene orphons in the sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus), ribosomal gene orphons in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and ribosomal and H3 histone gene orphons in Drosophila melanogaster. There are more than 50 histone gene orphons in each sea urchin genome. Each of the five histone-coding regions has a number of orphons (5–20), in addition to the several hundred copies in the clusters that are not cut by Bam HI. Most such orphons appear to contain only one coding region. Nearly all sea urchin histone gene orphon loci are polymorphic in the population; no two individuals have the same sets of histone orphons for any coding region. An H3-coding orphon, pLpH3o-1, was isolated from the genome of L. pictus. The H3 region homologous to the histone gene clusters is 1200 bases long and includes the complete early H3 gene and some surrounding histone DNA. The orphon is flanked by at least 1.7 kb of 5′ and 3 kb of 3′ nonhistone DNA. These flanking sequences are each moderately repetitive in the genome and are not homologous to each other. The orphon differs less than 2% in base sequence from the analogous region of pLpC and only slightly more from pLpA (the major histone gene clones). DNA sequence analysis of the junctions between the H3 region and the immediate flanking nonhistone DNA reveals no evidence of repetitive or palindromic sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1521281147,"We have recently shown that the estrogen-induced protein of rat uterus (IP) is indistinguishable from a constitutive protein in rat brain, and that the brain type gamma gamma isozyme of enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) is a component of IP. Here we report that the brain type BB isozyme of creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) is the major component of IP. The two IP components, creatine kinase BB and enolase gamma gamma, were copurified from rat brain by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The enzymes were separated on reactive blue 2 agarose, which absorbs creatine kinase BB but not enolase gamma gamma, at 40 mMNaCl, pH 5.2. The major component of IP was identified as the BB isozyme of creatine kinase on the basis of its specific enzyme activity, chromatographic behavior, and specific immunoprecipitation by anti-creatine kinase BB antiserum. The identity of the major component of IP and creatine kinase BB was confirmed by double isotope ratio analysis, limited protease digestion patterns, and the rapid increase in the rate of synthesis of creatine kinase in rat uterus in response to estrogen. IP has been a favored marker for estrogen action in rat uterus because of its early response to the hormone both in vivo and in vitro. The identification of the major component of IP as the BB isozyme of creatine kinase is a step toward understanding the function of IP in the early responses of the uterus to estrogen and reveals a further advantage for IP as a marker for the study of gene expression, and as a possible enzymic marker for hormone responsive tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1593696535,"Gelatin-binding material was isolated from a human plasma cryoprecipitate by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose. Individual fragments of fibronectin with Mr = 170,000, 100,000, and 80,000 and a mixture of fragments with Mr = 205,000 and 190,000 (200K fraction) were isolated from this material. These fragments reacted with antifibronectin and with antibodies to a gelatin-binding Mr = 70,000 tryptic fragment of fibronectin. They all shared the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. The 205K and 190K fragments bound also to heparin-Sepharose, whereas the smaller fragments did not. The 200K fraction and the 170K fragment mediated cell attachment when used to coat plastic, whereas the 100K and 80K fragments were inactive in this assay. Further digestion of the 205K and 190K fragments with chymotrypsin yielded separate sets of smaller fragments that bound to either gelatin-Sepharose or heparin-Sepharose, as well as fragments that did not show either of these binding activities but mediated cell attachment. Since the NH2-terminal ends of the 205K, 190K, 100K, and 80K fragments are the same, the results define the order of the active sites in the fibronectin molecule as gelatin-binding site, cell attachment site, and heparin-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2032199672,"Using electron microscopy, we had previously demonstrated a very close transmembrane relationship between actin microfilaments and fibronectin fibrils, termed the fibronexus. Since vinculin, a recently discovered intracellular protein, is localized at the membrane-insertion regions of actin fibers, we studied its possible relationship to fibronectin and the fibronexus. Using double-label immunofluorescence microscopy, we have observed that the distributions of vinculin and fibronectin are strikingly coincident in normal Nil 8 hamster fibroblasts arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and in HSV-transformed Nil hamster cells treated with purified fibronectin after culturing in 0.3% serum. Extensively spread Nil 8 cells have numerous vinculin-positive focal patches, which are localized either directly over or in tandem with fibronectin fibers at the ventral surface. However, fibronectin and vinculin do not exhibit this relationship in Nil 8 cells grown in 5% serum. These vinculin patches closely resemble the vinculin plaques that Geiger found to be dark under interference-reflection microscopy, suggesting that fibronectin is associated with substrate-adhesion plaques in arrested cells. Fibronectin treatment of the HSV-transformed Nil cells cultured in a low concentration of serum results in the formation of ventral microprocesses, exhibiting an extraordinary congruence of vinculin and fibronectin staining. In addition, these cells bind matrix-like arrangements of fibronectin on their dorsal surface at sites of cell-cell interaction that are vinculin-negative. These results imply that two distinct types of fibronexuses may exist: a ventral substrate-adhesive nexus consisting of fibronectin, vinculin and actin, and a dorsal association matrix fibers. Transmembrane vinculin-fibronectin associations are evidently sensitive to the growth state of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1515424959,"In previous publications from this laboratory we have described a soluble, partially purified cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase complex that, in the presence of NADPH and O2, catalyzes the monohydroxylation of long chain fatty acids, alcohols, and amides at the omega -1, omega -2, and omega -3 positions. We have now found that this preparation catalyzes the epoxidation as well as the hydroxylation of palmitoleic acid and a variety of other monounsaturated fatty acids. The experimental results reported here strongly support the concept that both hydroxylation and epoxidation are catalyzed by an identical cytochrome P-450 complex utilizing the same active and binding sites. Furthermore, for saturating levels of these substrates, the rate-limiting step in oxygenation does not appear to involve substrate structure. Thus, although the position and geometry of the double bond may dramatically affect the rate of epoxidation relative to hydroxylation, the combined rate of substrate oxygenation is essentially a constant independent of this ratio. Finally, we propose and present evidence for an enzyme-substrate binding model that involves polar binding of the carboxyl terminus and strong hydrophobic binding and sequestering of the terminal methyl group of the fatty acid. The three methylene carbons adjacent to the methyl group are positioned in a set geometry around the active site but the midchain region of a monounsaturated fatty acid is relatively free to interact or bind loosely with the enzyme surface in a variety of conformations. Depending on fatty acid structure, one or more of these conformations can bring the unsaturated center close enough to the active site to permit epoxidation of the double bond."
https://openalex.org/W1515888743,"Abstract Lipoxygenase metabolites of guinea pig peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with 10 microM A23187 plus arachidonic acid were isolated and identified. These metabolites were compared with each other and to chemically synthesized arachidonate metabolites for their ability to stimulate leukocyte degranulation. 5(S),12(R)-Dihydroxy-6,8,10-(cis/trans/trans)14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene B4) produced a significant release of lysozyme, but not beta-glucuronidase or beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase at low concentrations (EC50 = 6.5 x 10(-9) M), while the leukocyte nonenzymatically generated 5,12-or 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids had no effect at these concentrations. Higher concentrations (1--10 microM) of all the dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and its hydroperoxy precursor stimulated significant lysozyme release which was greater than that produced by 15-hydroxy-5,8,11-13-eicosatetraenoic acid, arachidonic acid, or its acetylene analogue, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid. Micromolar concentrations of leukotriene B4 and 5-HETE also stimulated significant release of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase above controls, but not beta-glucuronidase. These results suggest that leukotriene B4 may play a role in regulating the release of certain granule-bound enzymes from polymorphonuclear leukocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1592832398,"To investigate the type of phospholipase activated by agents that stimulate prostaglandin synthesis, we used transformed mouse cells whose phospholipids were doubly labeled with [14C]inositol and [3H]arachidonic acid. [14C]Inositol was incorporated mostly into the phosphatidylinositol and [3H]arachidonic acid was distributed into the various phospholipids. When these cells were incubated with bradykinin, a stimulator of prostaglandin synthesis, the release of 3H radioactivity from cellular phospholipids and the synthesis of prostaglandin were initiated within seconds and reached a maximum in 40 to 70 s. Analysis of the intracellular lipids revealed a concomitant increase of radioactivity associated with lysophosphatidylinositol, which was detectable within 5 s of incubation with bradykinin and reached a maximum between 40 and 70 s. Lysophosphatidylinositol which could be formed either from a phospholipase A1 or phospholipase A2 reaction, was identified by its chromatographic properties and conversion to glycerophosphorylinositol. We found that the 3H/14C ratio of purified lysophosphatidylinositol was 1/11 of that of phosphatidylinositol, which indicated that lysophosphatidylinositol formed in response to bradykinin is 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylinositol and most probably is formed from a phospholipase A2 deacylation of phosphatidylinositol (a phospholipase A1 deacylation would result in the formation of lysophosphatidylinositol of a 3H/14C ratio similar to phosphatidylinositol). Furthermore, we did not detect between control and stimulated cells any significant difference in the level of several phospholipase C metabolites including inositol phosphate, diglyceride, and phosphatidic acid. These results suggest that phospholipase C is probably not activated. The formation of lysophosphatidylinositol was also stimulated by thrombin and ionophore A23187, both activators of prostaglandin synthesis. Dexamethasone, a lipase inhibitor, inhibited the appearance of lysophosphatidylinositol, whereas aspirin and low concentrations of indomethacin, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, did not inhibit. The results presented in ths paper provide evidence that a phospholipase A2-hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol is activated when intact cells are stimulated for prostaglandin synthesis."

Most, if not all, of the macronuclear DNA is subchromosomal, ranging in size from above 100 kb down to 2.1 kb, with molecules in the lower molecular weight range being resolvable by gel electrophoresis into reproducible, specific, discrete size classes. A prominent class of linear 9.3 kb molecules consists of single free rRNA genes. Upon denaturation and partial renaturation, a high percentage of total macronuclear DNA was found as single-stranded circles. Sequence analysis showed that a minimum of 38 tandem repeats of the sequence CCCCAA is present in inverted orientation at each end of most or all Glaucoma macronuclear DNA molecules, including the rDNA. This sequence must therefore be recognized during site-specific fragmentation of chromosomes in macronuclear development."
https://openalex.org/W1487766219,"Monoclonal antibodies reactive with NIH/3T3 cell surface antigens were obtained from hybridomas of murine myeloma cells fused to spleen cells of rats immunized with NIH/3T3 cell plasma membranes. Four of the antibodies, of forty that have been studied, appeared to react with allospecific antigenic determinants: they bound to NIH/3T3 cells but not to BALB/ 3T3 cells. Each of these four antibodies immunoprecipitated a glycoprotein of about 80,000 daltons that migrated to an isoelectric point of about pH 5.0. Polypeptides of identical molecular weight and isoelectric points, and yielding the same proteolytic cleavage fragments, were present in BALB/3T3 cells, but were not antigenically reactive. The 80,000-dalton glycoprotein was a major constituent of the plasma membrane. It was a predominant lactoperoxidase iodinated component of intact NIH/3T3 cells, and saturation binding of 125I-labeled antibody indicated that there were about 10(6) antigenic sites/cell. Studies of the distribution of the immunoreactive glycoprotein among different strains of mice confirmed the polymorphic expression of the determinant: Spleen cells of BALB/c, DBA/1, DBA/2, and CBA mice did not bind anti-80,000-dalton glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies, whereas spleen cells of a large number of other strains of mice were positive for antibody-binding. The antigenic reactivity varied markedly among different cell lines and was greatest with the NIH/3T3 mouse embryo fibroblast, G8-1 Swiss Webster myoblast, and IC-21 SV40-transformed C57BL/6 mouse peritoneal macrophage. The properties of the 80,000-dalton glycoprotein characterized this molecule as a new cell surface differentiation alloantigen of murine mesenchymal cells."

Superoxide dismutase, added in increasing amounts to the vesicles, inhibited the formation of superoxide anions and, in a concomitant manner, also the production of acetaldehyde from ethanol in the system. Also horseradish peroxidase inhibited ethanol oxidation catalyzed by the vesicles; acetaldehyde formation and H2O2 formation decreased in a concomitant manner as the amount of the peroxidase was increased. Externally added hydrogen peroxide markedly stimulated cytochrome P-450-dependent ethanol oxidation, but not until the concentration of H2O2 reached 0.3 mM, whereas the hydroxyl radical scavenger mannitol completely inhibited the cytochrome P-450-dependent acetaldehyde production. Oxidation of ethanol was also accomplished using vesicles containing cytochrome b5 instead of cytochrome P-450 and in other systems regenerating superoxide anions, e.g. the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system and dihydroxyfumarate. The results are consistent with an iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss mechanism for regeneration of hydroxyl radicals which subsequently react with ethanol, thereby giving the corresponding aldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W1972539456,Using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay we have detected a protein component in extracts prepared from the nuclei of D. melanogaster third instar larvae which shows sequence-specific binding to a short region on a cloned D. melanogaster DNA segment containing a copy of the major heat-shock protein gene. The specificity of binding was confirmed by direct visualization of the protein DNA complexes in the electron microscope. Protein blotting experiments demonstrated that three polypeptides in the extract were capable of such sequence-specific binding. The protein binding site detected in this cloned sequence lies 800-1000 bp upstream from the presumptive transcription start.

https://openalex.org/W1561005695,"Colonic mucin was prepared by phenol-water partition extraction of th colonic mucosa, followed by ethanol precipitation of the water-soluble material, molecular sieve chromatography, and reductive sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel electrophoresis in an agarose-polyacrylamide gradient gel. Although this material as observed to be relatively homogeneous by physical criteria, it was shown to contain at least two components by immunodiffusion. Molecular sieve, ion exchange, adsorption, lectin affinity, and electrophorectic techniques failed to separate the two components. However, by protease digestion employing either 1% w/w pronase or papain, followed by molecular sieve chromatography, we were able to separate at least the portions of the molecules containing the immunodeterminants. Physicochemical and immunologic properties of both components were characteristic of mucins. Mucin A (pronase digest fraction 1 from molecular sieve chromatography) was enriched in threonine, proline, and sialic acid, while mucin B (pronase digest fraction 3 from molecular sieve chromatography) was enriched in serine, alanine, and fucose. Mucin A and mucin b were shown to be immunologically distinct. The evidence suggests that the protease-digested mucin fractions originate from two different mucins, one a sialomucin, the other a fucomucin; however, the alternative explanation, that these two mucin fragments may originate from a single mucin molecule, cannot be ruled out at present."
https://openalex.org/W2050486776,Rats with lesions of the hippocampus or mammillary bodies were impaired in learning reversal problems in a T-maze. Test trials given after learning each reversal disclosed little forgetting in the mammillary body group but rapid forgetting in the hippocampal group. These findings resemble those recently reported in patients with amnestic syndromes.
https://openalex.org/W1500313131,"Studies were made using antibody against a lectin induced in the hemolymph of Sarcophaga peregrina larvae on injury. The results suggested that the alpha subunit (Mr = 32,000) of the lectin is normally present in the hemolymph. On injury of the body wall, part of the alpha subunit seems to be converted to the beta subunit (Mr = 30,000), probably by partial proteolysis with a protease activated in response to the injury. As a result, an active lectin with the structure alpha 4 beta 2 is formed."
https://openalex.org/W1568931256,"The tryptophan residues on cholera toxin and its A and B protomers have been modified by reaction with 2-nitrophenylsulfenyl chloride and 2,4-dinitrophenylsulfenyl chloride. Modification of the tryptophan residues of cholera toxin results in complete loss of toxicity measured in a skin permeability assay. Modification of cholera toxin and its B protomer results in the complete loss of binding activity toward membrane receptors, the ganglioside galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylceramide (GM1), and the oligosaccharide moiety of the ganglioside GM1. Modification of cholera toxin and its A protomer results in a complete loss of the ADP-ribosylation activity exhibited by their native counterparts. Modification of the A protomer results in no apparent change in its physical properties by sedimentation velocity in the ultracentrifuge or by gel filtration chromatography. Modification of the B protomer, either directly or when it remains a component part of the holo toxin structure, results in a change in its sedimentation value and its elution from gel filtration columns. The changes are compatible with a conversion of the B protomer from a pentameric moiety in aqueous solvents to its existence as a monomer unit, i.e. to the individual polypeptide chains comprising the native B pentamer. Thiolysis of the 2,4-dinitrophenylsulfenyl chloride derivative of the B protomer reaggregates the individual-polypeptide chains but does not return its ability to interact with GM1."
https://openalex.org/W2132725494,"We have shown previously that processing of preprolactin to prolactin in isolated rat pituitaries is inhibited by the threonine analog, beta-hydroxynorvaline (Hnv), presumably because of its substitution for the threonine at the cleavage site. Here, we show by amino-terminal sequence analyses that Hnv altered the site at which preprolactin produced had three extra amino acids at the amino terminus. The miscleaved prolactin was secreted into the medium, and there was a delay of approximately 5 min between the initial appearance of prolactin and the formation of miscleaved prolactin. This lag period suggests that miscleaved prolactin did not represent an intermediate in the normal processing of preprolactin but resulted from cleavage of completed preprolactin chains containing Hnv. These results show that modification of the structure of a preprotein can alter the site of its cleavage. One site that appears to be critical for correct cleavage is the final amino acid residue in the prepeptide. The data also indicate that complete removal of the presequence is not required for secretion of a protein."

https://openalex.org/W2064908645,"By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, an antiserum raised in rabbit against serum thymic factor (FTS) was found to decorate the epithelial cells not only in the thymus, but also in the kidney, uterus, urinary bladder, prostatic glands, stomach, ileum, colon, submaxillary glands, trachea, epidermis and epidermal appendages of mouse. The staining ability was completely absorbed with an FTS-binding immunoabsorbent, and affinity-purified anti-FTS IgG showed the same staining patterns as the original antiserum. The staining profiles resembled those described for tissues stained with antiprekeratin and antikeratin antibodies in both distribution in tissue and localization in the epithelial cells. In primary-cultured cells from mouse kidney medullae, the anti-FTS antibodies decorated the cytoplasmic fiber network. The fibers were wavy, bundled together and branched. They were dense in the perinuclear cytoplasm and spread in the cytoplasm toward the cell periphery. This decoration was resistant to colchicine and cytochalasin B, but sensitive to pretreatment with formaldehyde. The organization and shape of the fiber network were similar to those of the networks of intermediate-sized filaments containing cytokeratins, keratins and vimentin. However, the antiserum did not give a precipitin band in immunodiffusion test with prekeratin from bovine muzzle, keratin from human epidermis or 3T3 vimentin. Neither tubulin nor actin formed precipitin bands with the antiserum. These results show that the epithelial cells of various mouse tissues contain FTS or substances close to FTS in chemical structure and suggest that they are associated with the intermediate-sized filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1913825921,Abstract A soluble enzyme from quail oviduct which incorporates sulfate into position 6 of the nonreducing N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate end group of chondroitin sulfate has been purified. This enzyme (termed 6-sulfotransferase) was partially separated from a 6-sulfotransferase present in the same tissue which catalyzes the incorporation of sulfate into interior portion of unsulfated chondroitin. The basic requirements for the terminal 6-sulfotransferase reaction were shown to be 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (donor) and chondroitin 4-sulfate (acceptor). The substitution of unsulfated chondroitin (prepared from squid skin) for chondroitin 4-sulfate resulted in a total loss of activity. These results suggest that the organization of the proteoglycan-synthesizing apparatus may well involve hitherto unrecognized mechanisms for the sulfation of chondroitin chains.
https://openalex.org/W1588478579,"The sulfated glycosaminoglycans, such as keratan sulfate and chitin sulfate having 3-hydroxy free N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residues as constituents, reacted with wheat germ agglutinin and Solanum tuberosum agglutinin by sugar-specific interaction. The glycosaminoglycans showed different inhibitory activities to the hemagglutination reaction of these lectins and keratan sulfate and its modified products formed insoluble complexes with both of the lectins at pH 7.0 in physiological saline solutions (0.15 M NaCl). S. tuberosum agglutinin was precipitated within a particularly narrow concentration range of keratan sulfate, and the formation of a soluble complex was observed by gel chromatography. These interactions were specifically inhibited by N,N'-diacetylchitobiose but not by 2 M NaCl. The specific interactions of the glycosaminoglycans with S. tuberosum agglutinin were confirmed by their ultraviolet difference spectra with two peaks at 285 and 298 nm attributable to the tryptophan residues in the binding site of the agglutinin. It was also found that S. tuberosum agglutinin and wheat germ agglutinin have different binding specificities. The presence of sulfate groups in either keratan sulfate or chitin sulfate did not interfere with their specific interactions with S. tuberosum agglutinin as strongly as with wheat germ agglutinin. The N-acetylneuraminic acid residues in keratan sulfate were found to be receptor sites for wheat germ agglutinin but not for S. tuberosum agglutinin."
https://openalex.org/W1591981520,"Enzyme activity is restored to two defective beta-galactosidase molecules (M15 protein lacking amino acid residues 11-41 and M112 protein lacking residues 23-31) by incubation with CNBr2 (residues 3-92 of beta-galactosidase). M15 and M112 proteins (alpha-acceptors) are dimers. Complemented enzyme, like wild type, has a tetrameric structure. Cleavage of CNBr2 with glutamic acid-specific protease yielded a much smaller alp ha-donor (3-41 peptide) which was also effective in complementation, indicating that the M15 protein can supply all of the residues from 42-92 for the structure of complemented enzyme. Treatment of M112 protein/3-41 peptide complemented enzyme with trypsin under very mild conditions followed by examination of the products demonstrated that the alpha-donor pep]tide supplies the NH2-terminal segment of complemented enzyme. Similar trypsin treatment of M15 protein/CNBr2 indicated that in this complemented enzyme the polypeptide region beyond those residues missing in the alpha-acceptor can be provided by either the alpha-donor or the alpha-acceptor. Both M15 protein and M112 protein are more susceptible to mild tryptic proteolysis than complemented enzyme, indicating a more open structure. Several antipeptide antibodies that react with these two proteins do not react with beta-galactosidase. M112 protein, like M15 protein, can be activated by anti-beta-galactosidase but to a much higher level."
https://openalex.org/W1559464530,"Spleen cells from mice immunized with the Dolichos biflorus seed lectin were fused with cells from the mouse myeloma Sp2/O-Ag14 cell line to form hybridomas. Those hybridomas producing antibodies against the seed lectin were cloned at least four times and the monoclonal antibodies from clone C11/64-56.28 were characterized and found to be specific for Subunit I of the lectin; they do not react with the structurally similar Subunit II. In previous studies, we have shown that although these two subunits appear to differ only at their COOH-terminal ends, only Subunit I has carbohydrate binding activity. Using a solid phase enzyme immunoassay, the antigenic determinant fr the monoclonal antibody was found to be located on the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide fragment of this subunit. The monoclonal antibody inhibits the ability of the lectin to agglutinate erythrocytes and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, the specific hapten for the lectin, inhibits the ability of the antibody to combine with the lectin. These results suggest that the monoclonal antibody recognizes a determinant that is located either at or near the active site of the lectin or that is conformationally interdependent with the active site."

https://openalex.org/W1517097694,"13C NMR was used to study the molecular dynamics of the chick limb bud proteoglycan core protein. Because only about 10% of the proteoglycan is protein, [2-13C]glycine and [3-13C]serine were incorporated into the core protein of the chick limb bud proteoglycan monomer using a chondrocyte culture system. The purified labeled monomer was studied in solution (50 mg/ml, 0.05 M sodium acetate/0.05 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. Spin-lattice relaxation times, line widths, and nuclear Overhauser enhancements were measured for the labeled carbons in the protein and for the natural abundance carbons in the glycosaminoglycan chains. Analyses of these data show that correlation times for backbone reorientation of protein and polysaccharide chains in the intact monomer are predominantly in the range of 0.5-5.0 ns. These correlation times are 10(2)-10(3) times smaller than the minimum correlation time calculated for a rigid monomer, indicating that the core protein and polysaccharide backbones are segmentally flexible. Signal intensity data show that at least 80% of the protein backbone is flexible but do not exclude the possibility that 20% of the protein backbone has ordered structure. We observe both broad and narrow signal components in the spectrum of the intact monomer, showing that backbone motion is heterogeneous. The broad signal component is not observed after the monomer is digested with chondroitinase. This result and the strong concentration dependence of the 13C line width observed in solutions of chondroitin 4-sulfate suggest an assignment of the broad signal component to residues near the protein-polysaccharide linkage region. The difference in NMR parameters observed for free and substituted serine carbons confirms that motion of the substituted serine side chain is restricted."

https://openalex.org/W142833466,"The interactions of Mn2+, nucleotides, monosaccharide substrates, and the modifier protein alpha-lactalbumin with galactosyltransferase have been studied by difference spectroscopy. MnCl2, required for significant binding of UDP-galactose or UDP to the enzyme, does not exhibit specific interactions with tyrosine or tryptophan residues. The interaction of UDP-galactose or UDP with galactosyltransferase in 2 mM MnCl2 produces difference spectra with a major positive peak at 284 nm, a second positive peak at 298 nm, and a large negative trough at 254 nm, suggesting the involvement of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in the interaction. The interaction of GlcNAc with the enzyme in 2 mM MnCl2 produces only small nonspecific difference spectra. However, the addition of 100 mM GlcNAc markedly increases the difference extinction coefficient at 284 nm of the UDP-bound enzyme-ligand complex, while the coefficient at 254 nm which arises from UDP remains constant. The results suggest that a conformational change involving tyrosine residues, which does not affect UDP, occurs in the process, enzyme.Mn + UDP + GlcNAc leads to enzyme.Mn.UDP.GlcNAc. Glucose does not show a similar effect. The interaction of galactosyltransferase and alpha-lactalbumin produces difference spectra characteristic of tryptophan and does not affect the difference spectra of galactosyltransferase produced by the interaction with UDP and GlcNAc. This implies that the interaction of the two proteins does not involve the bound UDP on galactosyltransferase and does not affect the conformational change induced by UDP and GlcNAc."

Lipoxygenase, with Mr 102,000, is predicted to have a rotational correlation time tau c - 1.2 X 10(-7) s, yielding a 1/T2,bd = 1.56 X 10(4) s-1 for tightly bound ligand.

https://openalex.org/W1542819329,"Previous experiments suggesting that tetrahydrofolate binds to serine hydroxymethyltransferase with positive homotropic cooperativity have been reinvestigated. Our results show that the sigmoid-shaped tetrahydrofolate saturation curve, previously obtained by several other investigators, is due to the instability of tetrahydrofolate in the assay solution. Using a different assay method, we have shown that tetrahydrofolate gives a hyperbolic saturation curve with serine hydroxymethyltransferase. We could find no evidence, as suggested by other investigators, that heating the enzyme during purification destroyed its allosteric properties or that NADH binds to the enzyme as an allosteric effector. Evidence is presented that the loss of tetrahydrofolate during the assay period is due to oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen."
