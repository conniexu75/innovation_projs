https://openalex.org/W2104251051,"Recent evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may function as intracellular messengers in receptor signaling pathways. The possible role of ROS in epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling was therefore investigated. Stimulation of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells with EGF resulted in a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of ROS, measured with the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and laser-scanning confocal microscopy. The predominant ROS produced appeared to be H2O2, because the EGF-induced increase in fluorescence was completely abolished by incorporation of catalase into the cells by electroporation. The elimination of H2O2 by catalase also inhibited the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins including the EGF receptor and phospholipase C-γ1. The dependence of H2O2 production on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor and the autophosphorylation sites located in its COOH-terminal tail was investigated. EGF failed to induce H2O2 generation in cells expressing a kinase-inactive EGF receptor. However, normal H2O2 generation was observed in cells expressing a mutant receptor from which the 126 COOH-terminal amino acids had been deleted to remove four (out of the total of five) autophosphorylation sites. These results suggest that EGF-induced H2O2 formation requires the kinase activity but probably not the autophosphorylation sites of the EGF receptor and that inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity by H2O2 may be required for EGF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation to be manifested.

However, at low concentrations, ROS may function as physiological mediators of cellular responses (1Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Google Scholar). For example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mimics the stimulatory effects of insulin on glucose transport and lipid synthesis in adipocytes (2Mukherjee S.P. Lane R.H. Lynn W.S. Biochem.

Recently, the production of ROS has been detected in a variety of cells stimulated with cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β1 (4Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki K. Nose K. J.

The term ROS encompasses many species including singlet oxygen, the superoxide anion radical (O2), H2O2, lipid peroxides, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite (ONOO−), the thiyl peroxyl radical (RSOO·), the ferryl radical (FeO2+) and the hydroxyl radical (OH·) (13Moncada S.

However, the chemical nature of ROS generated in response to the activation of various receptors has not been well characterized. H2O2 was shown to be a major component of ROS in cells activated by transforming growth factor-β1 or PDGF (4Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki K. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Google Scholar, 8Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Google Scholar). The generation of ROS in response to various external stimuli has been related to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB (17Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Google Scholar) and AP-1 (7Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 18Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A.

Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Google Scholar), and to the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) (21Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

H2O2 is a small, diffusible, and ubiquitous molecule that can be synthesized, as well as destroyed, rapidly in response to external stimuli. As such it fulfills the important prerequisites for an intracellular messengers. We have now investigated the role of ROS in epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal transduction by the EGF receptor (EGFR) protein. Bovine catalase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), modified Eagle's medium without phenol red, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc.; enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from Amersham Corp.; antibodies to phosphotyrosine and the EGFR were from Upstate Biotechnology; antibodies to catalase and α-tubulin were from Calbiochem and Oncogene Science, respectively; protein A-Sepharose beads were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) was from Molecular Probes. A mixture of monoclonal antibodies that was used for immunoprecipitation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) was prepared as described (23Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Choi W.C. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14497-14504Google Scholar). Human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were maintained at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in 150-mm dishes containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. At 80-90% confluency, cells were deprived of serum for 24 h and then harvested by trypsin treatment. Harvested cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM at a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml, and 100-μl portions of the cell suspension were placed in an electroporation chamber in the absence or the presence of catalase (8 mg/ml). Electroporation was performed by subjecting cells to six pulses, at intervals of 1 or 2 s, at a field strength of 850 ± 50 V/cm and a single-pulse width of 250 μs. Cell viability, assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was typically 70-80% after electroporation under these conditions. The construction, operation, and efficiency of the electroporation apparatus have been described previously (24Tekle E. Astumian R.D. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4230-4234Google Scholar). The electroporated cells were transferred to DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS and the same concentration of catalase as was present in the electroporation chamber and were placed in an incubator for 18 h. For analysis of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were stimulated with EGF (500 ng/ml) for 10 min and then exposed to lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured with the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible assay kit and bovine serum albumin as standard. The lysate supernatants were incubated with monoclonal antibodies to PLC-γ1 or to phosphotyrosine for 8 h, after which protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional hour. The beads were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 5 min, washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8% gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies to PLC-γ1, to phosphotyrosine, or to EGFR. Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies and ECL reagents. Intracellular ROS production was measured by the method of Bass et al. (25Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917Google Scholar) as modified for confocal microscopy by Ohba et al. (4Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki K. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Google Scholar). Briefly, dishes of confluent cells at various times after stimulation with EGF were washed with modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and incubated in the dark for 5 min in Krebs-Ringer solution containing 5 mM DCFH-DA. DCFH-DA is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the nonfluorescent polar derivative DCFH and thereby trapped within the cells (25Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917Google Scholar). In the presence of a proper oxidant, DCFH is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Culture dishes were transferred to a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope, equipped with a ×20 Neofluor objective and Zeiss LSM 410 confocal attachment, and ROS generation was detected as a result of the oxidation of DCFH (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 515-540 nm). The effects of DCFH photo-oxidation was minimized by collecting the fluorescent image with a single rapid scan (line average, 4; total scan time, 4.33 s) and identical parameters, such as contrast and brightness, for all samples. The cells were then imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy. Five groups of 20-30 cells each were randomly selected from the image in the digital interserence contrast (DIC) channel for each sample, the fluorescence intensity was then measured for each group from the fluorescence image, and the relative fluorescence intensity was taken as the average of the five values. Therefore, the relative fluorescence intensity (given in arbitrary units) reflects measurements performed on a minimum of 100 cells for each sample. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Intracellular generation of ROS in A431 cells was measured with DCFH-DA and laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Exposure of quiescent A431 cells to EGF (500 ng/ml) resulted in a rapid increase in DCF fluorescence, with the maximal, 2-fold increase apparent 5 min after stimulation (Fig. 1); fluorescence had returned to the baseline value after 20 min. Introduction of catalase, an enzyme that specifically catalyzes the dismutation of H2O2 to O2 and H2O into A431 cells by electroporation, prevented EGF-induced DCFH oxidation (Fig. 2), suggesting that the latter is mainly mediated by H2O2. The amount of catalase incorporated into cells was about five times that of the endogenous enzyme (see below). The introduction of catalase also reduced DCFH oxidation in cells not exposed to EGF. We next assessed the effect of incorporated catalase on EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. EGF induced a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in control cells as revealed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3A). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼160 kDa that was recognized by antibody to the EGFR was particularly prominent. However, in cells containing exogenous catalase, EGF had no apparent effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR or other proteins. Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, a well characterized target of the EGFR kinase, was studied further. Immunoblot analysis, with antibodies to PLC-γ1, of PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitated from control cells treated with EGF revealed a broad immunoreactive band (Fig. 3B); the increased breadth of the band relative to that apparent with unstimulated cell is indicative of increased tyrosine phosphorylation (26Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1101-1107Google Scholar). The effect of catalase was investigated by subjecting PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PLC-γ1 to immunoblot analysis with antibody to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3C). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was apparent from control EGF-treated cells but not with that from EGF-treated cells containing exogenous catalase. As demonstrated previously (26Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1101-1107Google Scholar, 27Wahl M.I. Nishibe S. Suh P.-G. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1568-1572Google Scholar), coprecipitation of autophosphorylated EGFR with tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-γ1 was observed. The requirement for H2O2 of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was also demonstrated by precipitating proteins with antibody to phosphotyrosine and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PLC-γ1 (Fig. 3D). Because the exogenous bovine catalase and endogenous human catalase can be separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3E), the amount of exogenous catalase incorporated to cells was estimated from immunoblot analysis to be approximately five times the amount of endogenous enzyme. Equal application of lysate protein among gel lanes for all immunoblot experiments was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to α-tubulin (Fig. 3F). To test whether the number of EGFR on the cell surface is affected by electroporation or by the addition of catalase concurrent with electroporation, we measured the number of EGFR using 125I-EGF. The binding of 125I-EGF was saturable and inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the addition of unlabeled EGF (figure not shown). The calculated binding site densities per cell were 4 × 106, 6 × 106, and 5 × 106, respectively, for control cells, electroporated cells assessed after 18 h of recovery, and cells electroporated in the presence of catalase and assessed after 18 h of recovery, suggesting that receptor number is not affected by the treatments. We also found that the autophosphorylation activity of immunoprecipitated EGFR is not affected by the presence of catalase (8 mg/ml) or H2O2 (1 mM) (data not shown). These results suggest that the inhibition of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in cells electroporated in the presence of catalase is not attributable to either the reduction in EGFR number, the inhibition of EGFR kinase by catalase, or the requirement of H2O2 for the activation of EGFR kinase. To assess the role of the intrinsic kinase activity and autophosphorylation sites of the EGFR in the EGF-induced generation of H2O2, we studied cell lines that express either the wild-type EGFR, a tyrosine kinase-negative EGFR in which Lys721 is replaced with Met, or a truncated EGFR (CD-126) lacking the COOH-terminal 126 amino acids (and therefore the four tyrosine phosphorylation sites at positions 1173, 1148, 1086, and 1068). These cell lines were generated previously by Margolis et al. (28Margolis B. Bellot A. Honegger A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Zilberstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 435-441Google Scholar, 29Margolis B.L. Lax I. Kris R. Dombalagian M. Honegger A.M. Howk R. Givol D. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10667-10671Google Scholar) by expression of human EGFR cDNAs in NIH 3T3 cells that lack endogenous EGFR (2.2 cells). Receptor density was 3 × 105, 3 × 105, 1.5 × 105 receptors/cell, respectively, for cells expressing wild-type, kinase-negative, and CD-126 mutant EGFR (30Honegger A.M. Dull T.J. Felder S. Van Obberghen E. Bellot F. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1987; 51: 199-209Google Scholar, 31Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Ureña J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Google Scholar). Treatment with EGF increased the concentration of H2O2 in cells expressing the wild-type or CD-126 mutant EGFR but not in the cells expressing the catalytically inactive mutant (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, but not the four autophosphorylation sites, is essential for the EGF-induced H2O2 generation. Extracellular release of ROS is a well characterized response of phagocytic cells to a variety of agonists. However, recent observations indicate that nonphagocytic cells also generate ROS (4Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki K. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Google Scholar, 5Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Google Scholar, 6Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S.

Dokidos A. Laskin D.L. Laskin J.D. Reiners Jr., J.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6062-6067Google Scholar). To identify the ROS responsible for the intracellular oxidation of DCFH, Ohba et al. (4Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki K. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Google Scholar) added catalase to the culture medium of osteoblastic cells. The addition of catalase completely inhibited the transforming growth factor-β1-induced increase in DCF fluorescence, suggesting that H2O2 was important in DCFH oxidation in response to transforming growth factor-β1. Because the cells are not permeable to catalase, the researchers proposed that H2O2 was released into the medium from the plasma membrane, the site of its production, and then diffused into the cells. Whether this diffusion was promoted by the trapped DCFH is not clear. Catalase was also used to characterize the ROS generated in PDGF-treated rat vascular smooth muscle cells (8Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Google Scholar). Unlike most other cells, these muscle cells incorporated, by an unknown mechanism, catalase that was added to the culture medium. Catalase incorporation completely blocked the PDGF-stimulated increase in H2O2 production, suggesting that H2O2 is also the predominant ROS induced by PDGF in these cells. We have now shown that EGF induces ROS production in A431 cells and that the increase in DCF fluorescence was primarily attributable to H2O2 on the basis of its sensitivity to catalase introduced into the cells by electroporation. With incorporation of catalase by electroporation, no ambiguity arises as to whether H2O2 is released first into the medium and is then taken up by the cells. Unlike rat vascular smooth muscle cells, the simple addition of catalase to the culture medium did not result in uptake of the enzyme and a consequent decrease in DCF fluorescence (data not shown). The incorporation of catalase also reduced DCFH oxidation in A431 cells not exposed to EGF, indicating that substantial amounts of H2O2 are generated in the absence of EGF, probably as a result of respiratory activity and the presence of various growth factors in 1% FBS. Overnight incubation of electroporated cells in medium containing 1% FBS was necessary for cells to recover from the electroporation procedure and to exhibit a tyrosine phosphorylation response to EGF. A high background of DCF fluorescence was apparent even in cells containing exogenous catalase. Whether this background DCFH oxidation is caused by residual H2O2 not degraded by catalase, by cellular oxidants other than H2O2, or by oxidants introduced by the experimental procedure (for example, by photo-oxidation) is not clear. Therefore, we took great care to manipulate the cells under identical conditions, with the exception of the indicated additions. The EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins was completely blocked in A431 cells containing exogenous catalase. Furthermore, detailed experiments with PLC-γ1 indicated that its tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF requires the EGF-induced increase in H2O2 concentration. Because tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for the activation of PLC-γ1 in growth factor-treated cells (32Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Google Scholar), an increase in H2O2 would appear to be required for growth factor-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Treatment of smooth muscle cells with H2O2 was previously shown to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores that are sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (33Roverti A. Coassin M. Maiorino M. Zamburlini A. van Amsterdam F.T.M. ratti E. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 265-270Google Scholar). We also observed a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ following addition of 1 mM H2O2 to A431 cells in a Ca2+-free medium (figure not shown). These observations are consistent with the notion that H2O2 inhibits PTPases and thereby causes activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) of PLC-γ1 (see below). Our study with EGF, together with previous studies with basic fibroblast growth factor (7Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 9Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem J. 1995; 307: 549-556Google Scholar) and PDGF (8Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Google Scholar, 9Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem J. 1995; 307: 549-556Google Scholar), suggests that the generation of H2O2 is a common signaling event for peptide growth factors. However, the role of H2O2 in growth factor signaling is not clear. Exogenously added H2O2 was previously shown to elicit tyrosine phosphorylation in several cell types (34Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Google Scholar, 35Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of the PDGF-induced increase in H2O2 blocked various steps in signaling by this growth factor, including tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase (8Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Google Scholar). Furthermore, H2O2 directly inhibits PTPase activity in vitro, and this inhibition is completely reversed by incubation with dithiothreitol (21Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 773-779Google Scholar). All PTPases contain one essential sulfhydryl group at their active site that is susceptible to oxidation because of its unusually low pKa (<5) (36Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PTPases may be targets of intracellularly generated H2O2. Inactivation of PTPases would result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the specific activities of PTPases in vitro are 10-1000 times those of protein tyrosine kinases (37Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Google Scholar). Therefore, in most cells, the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase by the binding of a growth factor may not be sufficient to increase the steady-state level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation; concurrent inhibition of PTPases might be necessary, and this inhibition may be achieved through H2O2. Binding of various peptide growth factors to their cognate receptors activates multiple signaling pathways, including those mediated by PLC-γ1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (STAT), and MAP kinase (38Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar, 39Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Google Scholar). The ligand-bound receptors dimerize and transphosphorylate each other at several tyrosine residues, thereby creating binding sites for cellular proteins that contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, including PLC-γ1, GTPase-activating protein of RAS, the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85), and SH2-containing collagen protein. Studies with autophosphorylation site mutants of the receptors for PDGF (40Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Google Scholar), colony-stimulating factor (41Reedijk M. Liu X. van der Geer P. Letwin K. Waterfield M.D. Hunter T. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1365-1372Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factor (42Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Google Scholar), and nerve growth factor (43Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Google Scholar) have shown that elimination of specific individual sites selectively abrogates the association of one or two SH2-containing proteins with the receptors, suggesting that individual autophosphorylation sites mediate the binding of specific SH2-containing protein. However, the association of PLC-γ1, GTPase-activating protein, p85, or SH2-containing collagen protein with the EGFR, which contains five autophosphorylation sites (residues 992, 1068, 1086, 1148, and 1173) in the COOH-terminal region, does not appear to stringently require individual autophosphorylation sites, but decreases gradually as the sites are removed one by one by COOH-terminal truncation (44Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Google Scholar). The intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation sites of the EGFR are not required for all signaling pathways activated by EGF. The activation of MAP kinase can occur independently of EGFR kinase activity (45Campos-González R. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14535-14538Google Scholar, 46Selva E. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2250-2254Google Scholar), and the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins requires none of the autophosphorylation sites (47David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thomson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Google Scholar). Our data with the kinase-inactive mutant indicate that EGFR-dependent H2O2 generation requires the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor. The CD-126 mutant receptor, which lacks four of the five autophosphorylation sites, was as effective as the wild-type receptor in inducing H2O2 generation, suggesting that the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the EGFR are not required for this effect. However, the possibility that the remaining autophosphorylation site (Tyr992) in CD-126 specifically serves as the binding site for a signaling molecule that mediates H2O2 generation cannot be excluded. The mechanism by which H2O2 is generated has been studied extensively in neutrophils and macrophages (48Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Google Scholar). In these phagocytic cells, O2 is first produced from the reduction of O2 by a multicomponent NADPH oxidase system, which consists of a membrane-bound cytochrome b, a 22-kDa subunit (p22-phox), and a 90-110-kDa glycoprotein subunit (gp91-phox). In addition to these membrane-bound components, NADPH oxidase activity requires various cytosolic factors including SH3-containing proteins (p47-phox and p67-phox) and the small GTP-binding protein Rac. The mechanism of O2 and H2O2 generation in nonphagocytic cells is unknown. Neither the xanthine oxidase system nor the mitochondrial respiratory chain appears to mediate receptor-triggered ROS generation (6Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem J. 1989; 263: 539-545Google Scholar). Evidence suggests involvement of an NADPH oxidase-like system, which might be linked to p22-phox, p47-phox, and p67-phox proteins, in fibroblast cells (6Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem J. 1989; 263: 539-545Google Scholar, 7Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 9Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H.

Jones O.T.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 178-182Google Scholar). However, the cytochrome b in fibroblasts appears to be structurally and genetically distinct from that in phagocytic cells (50Meier B. Jesaitis A. Emmendörffer A. Roesler J. Quinn M.T. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 481-486Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this cytochrome b might be modulated by the kinase activity of the EGFR requires further investigation. We thank Drs. J. Schlessinger and I.

https://openalex.org/W2092014913,"The tyrosine kinase class of receptors induces mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation through the sequential interaction of the signaling proteins Grb2, Sos, Ras, Raf, and MEK. Receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine triphosphate-binding protein (G protein) stimulate MAPK through G β γ subunits, but the subsequent intervening molecules are still poorly defined. Overexpression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) in COS-7 cells activated MAPK in a G β γ -dependent fashion, and expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PI3Kγ abolished the stimulation of MAPK by G β γ or in response to stimulation of muscarinic (m2) G protein-coupled receptors. Signaling from PI3Kγ to MAPK appears to require a tyrosine kinase, Shc, Grb2, Sos, Ras, and Raf. These findings indicate that PI3Kγ mediates G β γ -dependent regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2077321849,"The role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in preventing apoptosis was examined in differentiated PC12 cells. Induction of differentiation was achieved using nerve growth factor, and apoptosis was provoked by serum withdrawal. After 4-6 h of serum deprivation, apoptosis was initiated, concomitant with a 30% decrease in cell number and a 75% decrease in MTT activity. IGF-1 was capable of preventing apoptosis at concentrations as low as 10−9M and as early as 4 h. The phosphatidylinositol 3′ (PI3′)-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (at concentrations of 10−8M) and LY294002 (10−6M) blocked the effect of IGF-1. The pp70 S6 kinase (pp70S6K) inhibitor rapamycin (10−8M) was, however, less effective in blocking IGF-1 action. Moreover, stable transfection of a dominant-negative p85 (subunit of PI3′-kinase) construct in PC12 cells enhanced apoptosis provoked by serum deprivation. Interestingly, in the cells overexpressing the dominant-negative p85 protein, IGF-1 was still capable of inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting the existence of a second pathway involved in the IGF-1 effect. Blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with the specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-response kinase kinase inhibitor PD098059 (10−5M) inhibited the IGF-1 effect.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death plays an important role in embryonic development, involution of organs, and tumorigenesis. During development of the nervous system, a large proportion of neurons die by this process; about 50% of embryonic postmitotic neurons ultimately die during the period when synapses are formed between neurons and their targets (1Oppenhein R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Barres B.A. Burne J.F. Coles H.S. Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.I. Science. 1993; 262: 695-700Google Scholar). The survival of neurons is dependent on neurotrophins secreted by the target cells (3Batistatou A. Greene L.A. Cuello A.C.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) prevents apoptosis in a number of cell types. For example, IGF-1 at physiological concentrations was effective in inhibiting apoptosis in fibroblasts overexpressing c-myc (5Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 303-306Google Scholar), in neuroblastoma cells under hyperosmotic stress (8Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 323-331Google Scholar), and potassium-deprived cerebellar granule cells (9D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar, 10Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Google Scholar). Most cell types require IGF-1 for growth in culture (11Goldring M.B. Goldring S.R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 301-326Google Scholar), and a decrease in IGF-1 receptor number induces apoptosis in tumor cells (12Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469Google Scholar). IGF-1 can also act as a survival factor in the absence of other factors. Specifically, IGF-1 inhibits apoptosis of several interleukin-3-dependent cell lines when IL-3 is removed (13Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M.K.L. Garcia I. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 535-540Google Scholar). Insulin and the IGFs exert their biological effects by binding to their respective transmembrane receptors. Insulin and IGF-1 receptors are similar, heterotetrameric proteins with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (14Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Iiay Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-760Google Scholar, 15Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. LeBon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Google Scholar). Both receptors are capable of binding insulin and IGF-1, but each receptor binds its own ligand with a 100-1000-fold higher affinity than that of the heterologous peptide. In addition, IGF-1 activity is also regulated by binding to specific IGF-binding proteins that do not bind insulin (16Clemmons D.R. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 80-87Google Scholar). IGF-1, the IGF-1 receptor, and the binding proteins are expressed in many tissues, creating an autocrine-paracrine hormonal system. One of the earliest steps in signal transduction by both insulin and IGF-1 is the extensive phosphorylation of IRS-1, a 185-kDa protein. Tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-1 then interacts with numerous SH2 domain-containing proteins, including PI3′-kinase and the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Grb2/SOS. PI3′-kinase then initiates phospholipid turnover, and Grb2/SOS activation results in initiation of the MAP kinase signal transduction cascade by sequential phosphorylation and activation of proto-oncogenes Ras and Raf and the MAPK/ERK kinases (MEK1 and MEK2). While the effectiveness of IGF-1 on inhibition of apoptosis is well established, the signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and the mechanisms of action by which IGF-1 and other agents prevent apoptosis are largely unknown. The PI3′-kinase inhibitor wortmannin is known to block the protective action of NGF and platelet-derived growth factor in serum-deprived PC12 cells (4Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Google Scholar); this finding suggests an important role of the PI3′-kinase pathway in apoptosis prevention by growth factors. PI3′-kinase is an important component of intracellular signal transduction processes linked directly or indirectly to diverse receptor types. PI3′-kinase is an heterodimer composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (17Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Google Scholar). The p85 subunit, through its SH2 domains, mediates the association of p110 with activated protein tyrosine kinase receptors or phosphotyrosine-containing peptides such as IRS-1 (18Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar). In the present work, the involvement of PI3′-kinase in mediating IGF-1 prevention of apoptosis in PC12 cells was further explored using the PI3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, and PC12 cells were stably transfected with either a wild-type p85 (Wp85) construct or a dominant-negative p85 construct (δp85) (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Google Scholar). The δp85 protein lacks the inter-SH2 region required for binding to p110, thereby blocking activation of p110 (20Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Google Scholar). Rapamycin, which inhibits pp70 S6 kinase (pp70S6K) activation, was also used (21Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Google Scholar). In addition, the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in the prevention of apoptosis by IGF-1 was tested using PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK and the MAP kinase cascade (22Allesi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27495Google Scholar, 23Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar). Recombinant IGF-1 and mouse 2.5S NGF were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), wortmannin was from Sigma, and LY294002 was from BioMol Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rapamycin was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The specific MEK inhibitor PD098059 has been previously described (22Allesi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T.

Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Biofluids, Inc. (Rockville, MD). TACS Apoptotic DNA laddering kit was purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). Radionuclides, [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [γ- 32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), were from DuPont NEN. PC12 cells (a gift from Dr. G. Guroff, NICHD, NIH, Bethesda, MD) were typically maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. For each experiment, cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes in DMEM until they reached 60-70% confluence. Cell differentiation was then allowed to proceed as described previously (24Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Google Scholar) by changing cells to low serum (2% horse serum and 1% fetal bovine serum) medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml 2.5S NGF. After 6-7 days, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the medium was changed overnight to serum containing DMEM without added NGF. The next day, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of IGF-1 (concentrations ranging from 10−10 to 10−7M) in serum-free DMEM. At various intervals as stated in the figure legends, the cells remaining attached to the plate were harvested and combined with those cells suspended in the medium, which were collected by centrifugation. In some experiments, the PI3′-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (10−9-10−7M) or LY294002 (10−6-10−5M) were added 6 h prior to harvesting the cells to the serum-free DMEM, either in the absence or presence of IGF-1 (10−8M). For cells growing in either absence or presence of IGF-1, rapamycin (10−8-10−7M) was added 6 or 24 h prior to collecting the cells. In other experiments, the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (10−6-10−4M) was added to cells in serum-free medium as described (22Allesi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27495Google Scholar, 23Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated for 30 min with PD098059 prior to the addition of IGF-1. Insulin and IGF-1 receptor number in PC12 cells were determined by the Scatchard method as described previously (25Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Google Scholar) using tracer amounts of Tyr-A14 monoiodinated insulin (2000 Ci/mmol specific activity, Amersham Life Science, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) or des(1-3)IGF-1 (44 μCi/μg, GroPep, Adelaide, Australia). Genomic DNA was prepared from PC12 cells using the TACS Apoptotic DNA laddering kit. The concentration and purity of DNA were determined by measuring UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Equal amounts of DNA from each sample (1 μg) were 3′-end-labeled for 10 min at room temperature using the Klenow fragment of DNA Pol I and the radiolabeled nucleotide (0.5 μCi [α-32P]dCTP, 6000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was stopped by adding 6 × DNA loading buffer, and samples were then electrophoresed through a 1.5% TreviGel 500 matrix (26Vanek P.G. Fabian S.J. Fisher C.L. Chirikjian J.G. Collier G.B. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 704-706Google Scholar) in 1 × Tris acetate/EDTA buffer. Following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid for several hours, dried on Whatman 3 MM paper (Whatman Int., Maidstone, United Kingdom) in a gel dryer at 70°C, and analyzed by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat AR film and Cronex Lightning Plus enhancing screens. PC12 cells were grown in 60-mm plates until 60-70% confluent. Cells were co-transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA (SRα-Wp85 or SRα-δp85, the kind gift of Professor Masato Kasuga, Kobe University, Japan) (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K.

A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Google Scholar) and 1 μg pMC1-neo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were performed for 12 h, and the medium was then changed to DMEM for an additional 24 h. After 24 h of recovery, the cell mixtures were serially diluted and plated onto 150-mm dishes. Stably transfected cells were selected using 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Independent colonies were picked using cloning cylinders (Specialty Media Inc., Lavallette, NJ). Individual clones overexpressing bovine Wp85 or δp85 were selected by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-p85 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). PI3K activity was measured as described previously (25Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Cells were stimulated with 3 × 10−8M IGF-1 for 2 min, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-p85 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (Sigma) was used as substrate in the kinase assay. MAPK/ERK activity was assayed as described (27Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14373-14381Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Briefly, cells maintained overnight in serum-free medium were stimulated with IGF-1 (10−7M) for 12 min at 37°C. The cells were then rapidly washed in ice-cold 1 × PBS and solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein from each sample (5 μg) were incubated for 15 min at 30°C in the presence of 400 μg/ml specific MAP kinase substrate peptide (myelin basic protein 95-98, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and 100 μM [γ32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by spotting samples onto Whatman P81 paper squares followed by extensive washing in 150 mM phosphoric acid. The papers were air dried and counted in a β-counter with scintillation liquid. A modification of the MTT assay that measures mitochondrial function was used (28Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Google Scholar). Differentiated PC12 cells were plated on 24-well plates (50,000-80,000 cells/well) and maintained overnight in complete medium. Cells were then changed to serum-free medium in the absence or presence of IGF-1 (10−8M) and the different inhibitors. At the indicated periods of time, the medium was aspirated from the wells, and 200 μl of MTT reagent (1 mg/ml) were added to each well. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C and lysed by addition of 200 μl of isoamyl alcohol and shaking for 20 min. A 200-μl aliquot of each sample was then translated to 96-well plates and read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 570-690 nm. In parallel, direct counting of the cells remaining attached to the plate was performed. After treatment, medium was aspirated, and plates were washed twice with 1 × PBS. Cells still attached to the plate were trypsinized and counted in a Neuebauer chamber. Differentiation of PC12 cells was induced by incubating the cells with NGF-containing medium for 6-7 days. Apoptosis in these differentiated cells was induced by removal of NGF and incubation of the cells in serum-free DMEM (SFM). Within the first 4-6 h, apoptosis was detected by increased DNA laddering (Fig. 1A). The ability of IGF-1 to inhibit the process of apoptosis following the withdrawal of NGF was studied by incubating the cells in SFM with varying concentrations of IGF-1. IGF-1 was extremely effective in inhibiting apoptosis in both a time- and a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect of IGF-1 was detected as early as 4 h and at concentrations as low as 10−9M, with maximal effects seen at 10−8M (Fig. 1B). At the same time, 6 h of serum deprivation provoked a 29 ± 10% decrease in cell number (Fig. 2A) as well as a decrease in MTT activity (Fig. 2B). IGF-1, on the other hand, was capable of inhibiting both effects. The effect of insulin on inhibition of apoptosis was detected only at higher concentrations of the hormone (10−7M) (Fig. 1C). Since the PC12 cells used in these experiments expressed ∼39,000 IGF-1 receptors/cell and ∼7,600 insulin receptors/cell, we suggest that insulin may affect apoptosis in these cells by its interaction with the IGF-1 receptor.Fig. 2Serum withdrawal induces loss of cells and metabolic activity. Differentiated PC12 cells were plated in 24-well plates and maintained for 6, 12, and 24 h in SFM or 10−8M IGF-1 alone or in the presence of 10−5M PD098059, 10−8M rapamycin, or 10−6M LY294002 as indicated. A, at the time points indicated, plates were washed with 1 × PBS, and attached cells were trypsinized and counted in a Neuebauer chamber.

Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar), a synthetic inhibitor of PI3′-kinase. The cells were incubated with IGF-1 (10−8M) and varying concentrations of wortmannin (10−9-10−7M). Wortmannin at 10−8M inhibited the action of IGF-1. This inhibition was maximal at 10−7M wortmannin (Fig. 3). The presence of DNA laddering as a consequence of the incubation with wortmannin was detected at both 6 h (Fig. 3) and 24 h (data not shown), being maximal at 6 h. This is not unexpected, due to the instability of the inhibitor at the physiological temperature of the medium, as previously reported (4Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Google Scholar, 30Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Google Scholar). To confirm that the PI3′-kinase pathway was involved, we used LY294002, a reversible PI3′-kinase inhibitor. Similarly to wortmannin, concentrations of 10−6 and 10−5M LY294002 blocked the effect of IGF-1 on inhibition of apoptosis as measured by increased DNA laddering (data not shown), decrease in cell number (Fig. 2A), and mitochondrial activity (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, both wortmannin and LY294002 in the absence of IGF-1 enhanced the degree of apoptosis detected (Fig. 3, lanes 6-8), possibly resulting from the inhibition of basal PI3′-kinase activity. However, the level of apoptosis seen with the inhibitor alone is greater than when the inhibitor and IGF-1 are combined (Fig. 3, lane 3 versus 7 and lane 4 versus 8). These results support the conclusion that the PI3′-kinase pathway plays a role in mediating apoptosis. Furthermore, the IGF-1 effect on inhibition of apoptosis is, at least in part, via PI3′-kinase activation. pp70S6K is known to play a role in the signaling cascade initiated by PI3′-kinase (21Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Google Scholar). Stimulation of pp70S6K can also be blocked by wortmannin (31Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Google Scholar, 32Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Google Scholar) or LY294002 (21Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Google Scholar). The inhibitor rapamycin is known to block the activation of pp70S6K at some point downstream of PI3′-kinase although its specific target remains unknown (31Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Google Scholar, 32Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Google Scholar). In our system, 10−7M rapamycin completely blocked IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of pp70S6K as detected by a shift of the band in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel blotting with anti-pp70S6K antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (data not shown). However, incubation of PC12 cells with 10−8M or 10−7M rapamycin resulted only in partial inhibition of the IGF-1 effect on protecting the cells from apoptosis. This effect was detected as a faint laddering (data not shown) concomitant with a loss of cells. The effect of 10−8M rapamycin was significant only after a 24-h incubation (Fig. 2A). Incubation with 10−7M rapamycin, on the other hand, resulted in a significant, although moderate, decrease in cell number after 6 h (87 ± 4% of cells survived), which was more prominent after 24 h (73 ± 9% of cells survived). Rapamycin alone at 10−8 or 10−7M did not significantly increase the degree of apoptosis in cells maintained in SFM without IGF-1. To further establish that the PI3′-kinase pathway is involved in apoptosis, we stably transfected PC12 cells with vectors containing either a dominant-negative p85 construct (δp85) or a wild-type p85 construct (Wp85) as a control. Multiple clones of each cell type were obtained, and Western blot analyses established enhanced expression of the proteins (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of the wild-type p85 construct (Wp85) did not significantly affect the IGF-1 effect on apoptosis (data not shown). Conversely, expression of δp85 resulted in enhanced apoptosis (Fig. 4, B and C), concomitant with a partial decrease in IGF-1-stimulated PI3′-kinase activity (Fig. 4D). The addition of LY294002 yielded an even greater effect on induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4B, lane 6 versus 3). Similar results were obtained using wortmannin (data not shown). After 16 h of incubation in SFM, the difference in the degree of apoptosis between the parental cells and the different δp85 clones studied was maintained or increased (data not shown). Interestingly, in the cells overexpressing the dominant negative p85 protein, IGF-1 was still capable of inhibiting apoptosis although its sensitivity was decreased compared with its effect on parental cells (Fig. 4C). The IC50 of the IGF-1 effect was 10−8M in two δp85 clones studied as compared with 10−9M in the parental cells, suggesting that inhibition of PI3′-kinase activity resulted in a decreased effectiveness of IGF-1 on inhibition of apoptosis. On the other hand, the IGF-1 effect was not completely eliminated by inhibiting the PI3′-kinase pathway. This could be explained in part by the fact that the level of expression of the dominant-negative p85 is insufficient to totally block the PI3′-kinase pathway (Fig. 4D). Alternatively, other signaling pathways may be involved in the IGF-1 effect. Since the MAP kinase pathway mediates many of the known effects of IGF-1, we next blocked this pathway to determine its role in IGF-1 prevention of apoptosis. For this purpose, we used a specific MEK inhibitor, PD098059 (22Allesi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27495Google Scholar, 23Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar), that inhibits MAPK activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A). When incubated with IGF-1, PD098059 at concentrations of 10−5 and 10−4M inhibited the IGF-1 effect on apoptosis prevention (Fig. 5B, lanes 3-4 versus lane 1). This effect was detectable at 10 h but was maximal at 25 or 30 h (Fig. 5C). PD098059 alone (10−5-10−4M) also increased apoptosis (Fig. 5B, lanes 6-7 versus lane 5). These results suggest that the MAPK pathway is also involved in apoptosis and mediates the IGF-1 prevention of apoptosis. In agreement with the DNA laddering experiments, a decrease in cell number was found at 24 h but not at 6 h (Fig. 2A) although a decrease in MTT activity was already detected at 6 h, being significant at 12 h (Fig. 2B). Since both wortmannin and PD098059 were effective in inhibiting the IGF-1 action, we next determined whether their effects were additive or synergistic. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the effect of addition of both inhibitors is synergistic. For example, the degree of apoptosis in lane 8 is greater than the degree of apoptosis predicted by the addition of lanes 2 and 4. Moreover, the extensive DNA laddering obtained by incubation of the cells with both inhibitors was easily visible in electrophoretic gels after staining the DNA with ethidium bromide. In contrast, the laddering provoked after the incubation with either one or the other inhibitor could not be visualized that way, needing radioactive labeling (data not shown). Macroscopically, incubation with both inhibitors simultaneously resulted in 70-80% of the cells detaching from the plate, in contrast to about 30% when either of the inhibitors was used separately (data not shown). During embryonic development, rapid cellular proliferation is necessary for organ growth. However, appropriate function of each organ also depends on an orderly removal of certain cells. This is achieved by the process of apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death. Apoptosis is detected initially as internucleosomal fragmentation of genomic DNA, followed by chromatin condensation, nuclear disintegration, and cellular fragmentation (33Kerr J.F.R. Wylie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar, 34Wylie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 68: 251-306Google Scholar). In addition, apoptosis may play an important role in regulating tumorigenesis. For example, the tumor suppressor gene product, p53, may regulate tumorigenesis by inducing apoptosis in the presence of oncogenic factors (35Symonds H. Krall L. Remington L. Saenz-Rubles M. Lowe S. Jacks T. Van Dyke T. Cell. 1994; 78: 703-711Google Scholar). Mutations in the p53 gene are found in patients with a variety of malignancies, and a poor clinical prognosis is often correlated with the existence of these mutations. Therefore, understand"
https://openalex.org/W2067257071,"CspA, the major cold-shock protein of Escherichia coli, is dramatically induced during the cold-shock response. The amino acid sequence of CspA shows 43% identity to the “cold-shock domain” of the eukaryotic Y-box protein family, which interacts with RNA and DNA to regulate their functions. Here, we demonstrate that CspA binds to RNA as a chaperone. First, CspA cooperatively binds to heat-denatured single-stranded RNA if it is larger than 74 bases, causing a supershift in gel electrophoresis. A minimal concentration of CspA at 2.7 × 10−5M is absolutely required for this cooperative binding, which is sufficiently lower than the estimated cellular concentration of CspA (10−4M) in cold-shocked cells. No specific RNA sequences for CspA binding were identified, indicating that it has a broad sequence specificity for its binding. When the 142-base 5′-untranslated region of the cspA mRNA was used as a substrate for ribonucleases A and T1, the addition of CspA significantly stimulated RNA hydrolysis by preventing the formation of RNase-resistant bands due to stable secondary structures in the 5′-untranslated region. These results indicate that binding of CspA to RNA destabilizes RNA secondary structures to make them susceptible to ribonucleases. We propose that CspA functions as an RNA chaperone to prevent the formation of secondary structures in RNA molecules at low temperature. Such a function may be crucial for efficient translation of mRNAs at low temperatures and may also have an effect on transcription.

Such a function may be crucial for efficient translation of mRNAs at low temperatures and may also have an effect on transcription. The cold-shock response is a physiological response of living cells to temperature downshift, which is considered to be essential for cells to survive at low temperatures (for review, see 1Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Google Scholar). When an exponentially growing culture of Escherichia coli is shifted from 37 to 10°C, there is a lag period of cell growth for approximately 4 h before cell growth is resumed (2Jones P.G. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Google Scholar). Cold-shock proteins are induced during this lag period, and a total of 17 cold-shock proteins have been identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2Jones P.G. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Google Scholar, 3Jones P.G. Krah R. Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5798-5802Google Scholar, 4Lee S.J. Xie A. Jiang W. Etchegaray J.-P. Jones P.G.

CspA is the major cold-shock protein in Escherichia coli, and its production reaches more than 10% of total cellular protein synthesized during the cold shock response (6Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 283-287Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the expression of cspA is regulated at the level of transcription (6Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 283-287Google Scholar, 7Tanabe H. Goldstein J. Yang M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3867-3873Google Scholar, 8Jiang W. Jones P.G. Inouye M. J.

Pietroni P. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Google Scholar, 11Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Google Scholar). CspA consists of 70 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 7.4 kDa (6Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 283-287Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CspA has been determined both by NMR (12Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (13Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Google Scholar). CspA consists of five anti-parallel β sheets, which form a β-barrel structure. RNA binding motifs RNP1 (Phe18-Gly19-Phe20) and RNP2 (Phe31-Val32-His33) are located on β-2- and β-3-sheet, respectively (12Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Google Scholar). Seven of eight aromatic residues are distributed on the same surface of the CspA molecule, suggesting potential interactions between CspA and nucleic acids through hydrophobic interactions. Indeed, it has been shown that CspA interacts with a 24-base ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAssRNAsingle-stranded RNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNACSDcold-shock domainUTRuntranslated region. (12Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Google Scholar). single-stranded DNA single-stranded RNA double-stranded DNA cold-shock domain untranslated region. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of CspA shows 43% identity to the “cold-shock domain” (CSD) of the eukaryotic Y-box protein family. All Y-box proteins characterized to date show varied nucleic acid binding activities (for review, see 14Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298Google Scholar, 15Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Google Scholar, 16Sommerville J. Ladonery M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 435-443Google Scholar). Some Y-box proteins bind to DNA to affect gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair, while other Y-box proteins interact with mRNA to affect translational efficiency. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the CSD is directly responsible for nucleic acid binding activities (17Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. New Biol. 1992; 4: 349-359Google Scholar, 18Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that CspA cooperatively binds to ssRNA. A certain length of ssRNA (more than 74 bases) is required for the cooperative binding. CspA binding to ssRNA displays a low sequence specificity. A minimal concentration of CspA required for RNA binding is 2.7 × 10−5M, which is sufficiently lower than the cellular concentration of CspA in cold-shocked cells (10−4M). In the presence of CspA, ssRNA became much more sensitive to ribonucleases, and furthermore, secondary structures formed in the RNA molecule that are resistant to ribonucleases became highly susceptible to ribonuclease digestion. These results indicate that CspA binding to RNA results in unfolding RNA secondary structures. We propose that CspA functions at low temperatures as an RNA chaperone, which binds to mRNAs with a low sequence specificity to prevent the formation of secondary structures in mRNAs. Such a function is considered to be important for efficient translation of mRNAs at low temperatures. All NTPs were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. SP6 RNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs. T7 RNA polymerase was from Promega. RNase inhibitor was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. CspA was purified as described previously (19Chatterjee S. Jiang W. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 663-669Google Scholar). RNA fragments (fragments A-F; see Fig. 1, Fig. 2) were obtained as described previously (20Lee C. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4398-4407Google Scholar). Basically, RNA fragment A was prepared by transcribing the pGEMI (Promega) plasmid cut with PvuII using SP6 RNA polymerase. Fragment B was prepared by transcribing the plasmid pSP65 cut with XbaI using SP6 RNA polymerase. Fragment C was made by transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase of pGEM3cs− plasmid cut with HaeII (21Scheffner M. Knippers R. Stahl H. Cell. 1989; 57: 955-963Google Scholar). Fragment D was made by transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase of pGEM3 plasmid cut with SacI. Fragment E was prepared by transcribing pGEM3cs− cut with RsaI using T7 RNA polymerase. Fragment F was synthesized by transcribing pGEM3 cut with AccI using T7 RNA polymerase.Fig. 2CspA binding to different heat-denatured single-stranded RNA templates. All ssRNA fragments were synthesized by in vitro transcription as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RNA sequences of fragments C, D, E, and F are shown at the top.

Briefly, fragment A1 was made by transcribing pGEMI cut with HindIII by SP6 RNA polymerase. Fragment A2 was made by transcribing pGEMI cut with EcoRI by SP6 RNA polymerase. Fragment A3 was made as follows. pGEMI was digested by HindIII and EcoRI, followed by Klenow fill-in and self-ligation. The resulting plasmid was cut with PvuII and transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase. Fragment A4 was prepared by cutting pGEMI with XbaI and EcoRI, followed by self-ligation. The resulting plasmid was cut with PvuII and transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase. Fragment A5 was made as follows. The 60-base pair fragment from pTH1 digested with SacI (22Musso R.E. Hodam T. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 205-207Google Scholar) was inserted into the SacI site of pGEMI. The resulting plasmid was digested by HindIII and transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase. Fragment A6 was made by transcribing the same plasmid used for A5 cut with PvuII using SP6 RNA polymerase. All labeled RNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]CTP. In vitro transcription was carried out using the protocols provided by the manufacturer. dsDNA fragment A′ was made as follows. pGEMI was cut with HindIII and end-labeled by Klenow filled-in with [α-32P]dATP. The linear DNA fragment was then cut with PvuII followed by gel purification of the resulting 88-base pair fragment A′. As a result, only the minus strand DNA was labeled. The labeled minus strand DNA was then obtained by heat-denaturing the labeled dsDNA fragment A′. The plus strand DNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 kinase after heat-denaturing dsDNA fragment A′. This procedure also labeled the 3′-end-labeled minus strand DNA at its 5′-end as well. RNA binding assay was carried out in a 15-μl reaction containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 7.4% glycerol, 1 × 106 cpm RNA template, and purified protein. Mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min and then loaded on a 8% polyacrylamide gel. The running buffer was 1 × TBE (50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM boric acid). Electrophoresis was carried out at 130 V for 3.5 h at 4°C. The gel was vacuum-dried and visualized by autoradiography. The DNA binding assay was carried out in exactly the same manner. 32P-Labeled RNA substrates were incubated with 3 μg of purified CspA in the binding buffer for 15 min on ice. The volume of the final reaction mixture was 15 μl. RNase A or RNase T1 was added to the RNA-substrate solution, and the mixture was kept on ice for 15 min in the case of fragment B or at 15°C for 5 min in the case of the 5′-UTR of the cspA mRNA. Half of the mixture was loaded onto a 8% acrylamide gel. In the case of fragment B, the remaining half was heat-denatured for 5 min and subjected to 7 M urea, 10% acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The region corresponding to the 5′-UTR from +1 to +142 of the cspA mRNA was placed under T7 promoter using polymerase chain reaction, and in vitro transcription of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified template was carried out in the presence of [α-32P]CTP according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. To examine whether CspA can bind to RNA, we first utilized a partially double-stranded RNA as shown in Fig. 1. RNA fragments A and B were synthesized by in vitro transcription, and fragment B was labeled with [α-32P]CTP. When fragments A and B were annealed, the product had a 29-base pair double-stranded region with single-stranded regions at the 5′-end (28 bases) and the 3′-end (41 bases) on fragment A and at the 5′-end of fragment B (9 bases) (Fig. 1). Using the annealed complex, gel retardation experiments were carried out with different amounts of the purified CspA as shown in Fig. 1. When the annealed complex that migrated at position b (lane 1) was heat-denatured and quickly cooled on ice before loading on the gel, 32P-labeled fragment B was separated from nonradioactive fragment A and migrated at position a (lane 2). When increasing amounts of CspA were added to the annealed complex, its migration became retarded shifting from position b to c (lanes 3-6). As a control, the same amounts of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were added, where no shifted band was observed (lanes 7 and 8). It is interesting to note that the amounts of CspA used in this assay were rather high; 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 μg of CspA was added in a final 15-μl reaction mixture in lanes 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Fig. 1, respectively. In addition, the shift caused by CspA was discontinuous as the band was suddenly shifted from position b to c at 2 μg of CspA (lane 5) and more notably at 3 μg (lane 6). The CspA concentration in the reaction mixture at 3 μg was calculated to be 2.7 × 10−5M. At 1 μg (lane 4), no shift was observed. This result suggests a cooperative binding of CspA to RNA. In order to find out which strand in the annealed complex (A or B) is responsible for CspA binding, fragments A and B were labeled with [α-32P]CTP separately. Both fragments were heat-denatured before the addition of CspA. As shown in Fig. 2, the same amount of CspA used in Fig. 1 was able to cause a mobility shift of fragment A (lanes 1 and 2) but not fragment B (lanes 3 and 4). To investigate whether CspA binding to heat-denatured ssRNA has any sequence specificity, four other RNA fragments (fragments C, D, E, and F) shown in Fig. 2 were synthesized by in vitro transcription. They were also labeled with [α-32P]CTP, and a gel retardation assay was carried out as described above. Among the new RNA fragments, fragments C (lanes 5 and 6) and E (lanes 9 and 10) were found to form complexes with CspA, as judged from their retarded migration in the gel. In contrast, CspA did not bind to fragments D (lanes 7 and 8) and F (lanes 11 and 12). Those fragments incapable of CspA binding (fragments B, D, and F) were shorter in length (39, 52, and 46 bases, respectively) than those fragments to which CspA was able to bind (fragments A, C, and F are 98, 107, and 103 bases, respectively). Such a size dependence of RNA binding has also been observed with FRGY2, a Xenopus Y-box protein (18Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Google Scholar). In order to examine the effect of the length of ssRNA on CspA binding, a number of deletions or insertions were created based on fragment A as shown in Fig. 3A. The results of a gel retardation assay performed with these fragments are shown in Fig. 3B. CspA could not bind to fragment A1 (32 nucleotides) and A2 (56 nucleotides), which resulted from deleting 66 (fragment A1) and 42 bases (fragment A2) from the 3′-end of fragment A (lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4, respectively). When an internal 46-base region was removed, leaving the 42-base 3′-end sequence that was deleted in fragment A2, a minor retardation was observed with the resulting fragment A3 (52 nucleotides; lanes 5 and 6). When the internal deletion became shorter by 22 bases, CspA was able to bind well to the resulting fragment A4 (74 nucleotides), causing a supershift (lanes 12 and 13) as observed with fragment A (lanes 7-9). These results demonstrate that CspA binding to ssRNA requires a certain length of the target RNA. Fragment A4 is the shortest template that is capable of CspA binding. Based on the fact that CspA caused a minor retardation of fragment A3, it was postulated that CspA binding to heat-denatured ssRNA may also have some sequence specificity that exists in the 3′-end region of fragment A. To test this possibility, a 60-base sequence from pTH1 (22Musso R.E. Hodam T. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 205-207Google Scholar) digested with SacI was added to the 3′-end of fragment A2, creating fragment A5 of 116 bases in length, which is longer than fragment A (see Fig. 3A). CspA was found to hardly bind to fragment A5 (Fig. 3B, lanes 14 and 15). This result indicates that there is a preferable CspA binding sequence located at the 3′-end region of fragment A in addition to the length required for CspA binding. The 56-base 5′-end sequence of fragment A (fragment A2) does not contain such a sequence as required for the CspA binding. Note that the 60-base sequence added to fragment A2 did not have any negative effect on the CspA binding, since the insertion of the sequence at the middle of fragment A resulting in fragment A6 did not inhibit the supershift of fragment A6 (lanes 16 and 17). When the nucleotide sequences of fragments A, C, and E, all of which showed specific interaction with CspA, were compared with each other, a 15-base sequence common to all three fragments was found: CUAUAGUGAGUCGUA, from base 66 to 80 in fragment A and from base 25 to 39 in fragment C and CUAUAGUGucUCcUA in fragment E from base 25 to 39 (Fig. 2; mismatched bases in lowercase type). This region in fragment A (8 nucleotides at a time) was randomized, and the SELEX method (23Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Google Scholar) was applied to screen the most preferable sequences for CspA binding. However, this approach was unsuccessful, since CspA was still able to bind to the fragments with the randomized sequences. We further examined the cooperation of CspA binding to ssRNA using fragment A. As shown in Fig. 4, when 1 μg of CspA was added to 32P-labeled fragment A in a 15-μl reaction mixture, a minor retardation was observed (compare lane 2 with lane 1). However, when 3 μg of CspA were added in the same final volume (15 μl) as in the case of lane 2, the band was supershifted (lane 3). This supershifted band did not change its migration even when a 24-fold excess of nonradioactive fragment A was added to the reaction mixture (lane 4), suggesting that all RNA molecules added were shifted. A similar result was obtained when a 5-fold (lane 6) or 24-fold (not shown) excess of 32P-labeled fragment A was added, indicating that CspA binding to ssRNA is cooperative. This cooperative binding is only dependent on the CspA concentration (2.7 × 10−5M) and not dependent on the molar ratio of CspA to RNA. This was demonstrated by the following experiment; when 1 μg of CspA, which could not cause the supershift in lane 2, was used in a 5-μl reaction mixture (one-third of the reaction volume used in the experiment in lane 2), the supershift was observed as shown in lane 5. In this reaction, the CspA concentration became identical to that with 3 μg of CspA in the 15-μl reaction mixture. This critical concentration can be calculated to be approximately 2.7 × 10−5M. Note that the concentration of CspA inside the cold-shocked cell is estimated at 10−4M (6Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 283-287Google Scholar), which is higher than the critical concentration obtained above. It is known that most Y-box proteins that contain a cold-shock domain are capable of nucleic acid binding (for review, see 14Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298Google Scholar, 15Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Google Scholar, 16Sommerville J. Ladonery M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 435-443Google Scholar). Some of them bind to RNA, while others bind to DNA. Therefore, it was interesting to investigate whether CspA is also able to bind to ssDNA. To test this, a dsDNA (fragment A′) was generated from the template DNA used to generate fragment A RNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fragment A′ was labeled by [α-32P]dATP at the 3′-end of the minus strand by Klenow fill-in. As shown in Fig. 5, CspA failed to bind the dsDNA fragment A′ (lanes 1 and 2). When this dsDNA was heat-denatured, the labeled minus strand was separated from the plus strand and migrated at position b (lane 3). The addition of CspA caused a minor shift of the minus strand (compare lane 4 with lane 3). As a result of a minor shift of the minus strand in the presence of CspA, it migrated at the same position as double-stranded fragment A′ at position c. Therefore, we subsequently performed the following experiment. In addition to the 3′-end labeling, the 5′-ends of both strands were also labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 kinase. When this dsDNA was heat-denatured, it yielded two distinct bands at positions a and b (lane 5). The band at position b corresponded to the minus strand according to lane 3, where only the minus strand was labeled. Thus, the band at position a corresponded to the plus strand. When CspA was added to the heat-denatured fragment A′, two bands at positions c and d appeared (lane 6). The band at position c appears to correspond to the bands observed in lane 4, resulted from a minor shift of the minus band caused by CspA. Therefore, the band at position d was caused by a supershift, which resulted from the CspA binding to the plus strand, the band at position a in lane 5. These results indicate that CspA is able to bind to both ssRNA and ssDNA with the same sequence specificity. However, CspA cannot bind to dsDNA. “RNA chaperone” refers to proteins that prevent RNA misfolding and resolve misfolded RNAs, thereby ensuring their biological functions (24Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Google Scholar). Based on RNA binding characteristics of CspA presented above, which include low sequence specificity, cooperative binding, and low binding affinity to RNA (2.7 × 10−5M), it is speculated that CspA may function as an RNA chaperone. First, we attempted to examine whether CspA interacts with secondary structures in RNA. For this purpose, we tested the effect of CspA on non-heat-denatured fragment B. As shown in Fig. 2, CspA does not interact with heat-denatured fragment B. When fragment B was analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis without heat denaturation, two additional bands appeared at positions b and d (Fig. 6A, lane 1), in addition to the band at position a, which is considered to be the same as heat-denatured fragment B (lane 2). RNAs at positions b and d are likely to be dimers and trimers of fragment B, respectively, which resulted from intermolecular hybrid formation using a number of short inverted repeats in fragment B. Interestingly, when increased amounts of CspA were added to non-heat-denatured fragment B (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 μg for lanes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively), band b shifted to c and band d disappeared with concomitant appearance of band e. Band a hardly moved as previously shown in Fig. 2, and the addition of the same amounts of BSA (1, 2 and 3 μg for lanes 8, 9, and 10, respectively) did not change the pattern. In order to confirm that CspA did not modify the RNA molecule, the same reaction mixtures used above were loaded on a 7 M urea-10% acrylamide gel, and all gave a single band at the same position as shown from lane 1 to 10 in Fig. 6B. These results indicate that CspA can also interact with certain structures formed by intermolecular interaction between RNA molecules. Next, the ribonuclease assay was carried out to examine whether CspA binding to RNA secondary structure facilitates the RNA susceptibility to ribonuclease A. In the absence of CspA, fragment B was degraded by RNase A into two major products, indicated as X and Y (Fig. 6B, lane 11). However, when 3 μg of CspA was added to fragment B followed by the addition of RNase A, product Y was further degraded and migrated to the bottom of the gel (not shown in Fig. 6B), while product X was unchanged (lane 12). Note that CspA itself did not contain any ribonuclease activity (Fig. 6B, lanes 3-10), this result indicates that fragment B becomes more sensitive to the RNase A in the presence of CspA. When the equal amount of BSA was added with RNase A, no enhancement of RNase A digestion was observed (lane 13). On the basis of the results obtained above, we next used a longer RNA from the cspA mRNA, which has a long 5′-UTR consisting of 159 bases (6Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 283-287Google Scholar). Out of the 159-base 5′-UTR, the RNA from +1 to +142 was produced under a T7 promoter in the presence of [α-32P]CTP. As shown in Fig. 7, this RNA migrated at position h in 8% acrylamide gel electrophoresis (lane 1). When CspA (3 μg in the final volume of 15 μl) was added, it was supershifted to position j (lane 2). When 0.5 μg of RNase A was added to the RNA and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 15°C, five RNase A-resistant bands appeared at positions a, b, c, d, and e (lane 3). As the concentration of RNase was reduced to 0.25 and 0.125 μg, the density of band e increased, while the density of band d decreased (lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Further reduction of RNase A to 0.063 μg resulted in substantially long RNA fragments at positions f and g without producing shorter fragments at positions c, d, and e (lane 6). However, when 3 μg of CspA was added before the addition of RNase A, RNase-resistant bands at positions c, d, and e disappeared as shown in lanes 7, 8, and 9, respectively, leaving mainly bands a and b. At the lowest RNase A concentration in the presence of CspA (lane 10), a broad, supershifted band at position i as well as very broad bands around position f were observed. Similar results were obtained with RNase T1; in the absence of CspA, digestion of the RNA with 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 μg of RNase T1 (lanes 11, 12, and 13, respectively) resulted in the formation of a stable RNA fragment at positions o and l. In the presence of 0.4 μg of RNase T1, part of the band at position o was further digested to produce a band at position m. When CspA was added into the reaction mixture, the band at position o completely disappeared, leaving a very stable band at position l in all concentrations of RNase T1 (lanes 14-16). It should be noted that in the presence of 0.4 μg of RNase T1 (lane 14), the background in the region higher than band l was very low, and a faint band at position n observed in the absence of CspA (lanes 11-13) was not detected. Instead, another stable band at position k appeared. It should also be noted that CspA itself did not have RNase activity as shown in lane 2 of Fig. 7, where RNA was quantitatively supershifted. The results described above demonstrate that CspA indeed enhances susceptibility of RNA to RNases; in the case of RNase A, it was estimated that CspA stimulates the RNase activity approximately 10-fold (compare lane 9 with lane 3 in Fig. 7). RNase-resistant bands observed in Fig. 7 are considered to be due to secondary structures formed in the RNA molecule. Fig. 8 shows a predicted secondary structure of the 5′-UTR of the cspA mRNA from +1 to +142. In such a structure, loop regions are sensitive to RNase cleavage, which generates a number of fragments of different sizes like bands a, b, c, d, and e in RNase A digestion and k, l, m, and n in RNase T1 digestion (cleavage at G residues circled in Fig. 8). The fact that these bands disappeared in the presence of CspA indicates that CspA destabilizes the secondary structures existing in RNA molecules to further digest them into smaller fragments. We, therefore, propose that CspA functions as an RNA chaperone. CspA shows 43% identity with the CSD of eukaryotic Y-box proteins that have RNA or DNA binding activities (for review, see 14Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298Google Scholar, 15Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Google Scholar, 16Sommerville J. Ladonery M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 435-443Google Scholar). In previous studies, it has been suggested that CspA binds to DNA and is involved in gene regulation (3Jones P.G. Krah R. Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5798-5802Google Scholar, 25La Teana A. Brandi A. Falconi M. Spurio R. Pon C.C. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10907-10911Google Scholar). In addition, the three-dimensional structure of CspA strongly indicates that CspA is a nucleic acid-binding protein (12Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Google Scholar). In this paper, we have demonstrated that CspA binds cooperatively to heat-denatured ssRNA as well as ssDNA with a low sequence specificity, while CspA cannot bind to dsDNA. A certain length of ssRNA (74 nucleotides) and the minimal concentration of CspA at 2.7 × 10−5M are required for the supershift of the RNA caused by CspA. Since the CspA concentration in cold-shocked cells was estimated to be 10−4M (6Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 283-287Google Scholar), CspA in cold-shocked cells is able to cooperatively bind ssRNA. In addition to CspA binding to heat-denatured ssRNA, we demonstrated that CspA is able to interact with RNA secondary structures formed either intermolecularly or intramolecularly. As a result, RNA becomes more susceptible to RNase digestion, and RNase-resistant double-stranded RNA fragments disappear. All of these properties of CspA support a notion that CspA functions as an RNA chaperone, which weakly interacts with RNA to affect RNA folding. Such a property is considered to be essential for efficient translation of mRNA at low temperatures (1Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Google Scholar). Recently, a new cold-shock protein, CsdA, was found, which is exclusively associated with ribosomes and has double-stranded RNA unwinding activity (5Jones P.G. Mitta M. Kim Y. Jiang W. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 93: 76-80Google Scholar). It is possible that CsdA unwinds stable secondary structures formed in mRNAs at low temperatures and that CspA, as an RNA chaperone, binds to unwound mRNAs. Alternatively, CspA first binds to RNA to assist the CsdA activity to unwind folded RNA. The weak binding of CspA to mRNAs, however, probably does not interfere with the translational activity of ribosomes, but rather may facilitate mRNA translation. It is possible that CspA may share some functional similarities with a Xenopus Y-box protein, FRGY2, which is known to mask mRNA in oocytes (26Richter J.D. Smith L.D. Nature. 1984; 309: 378-380Google Scholar, 27Ranjan M. Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1725-1736Google Scholar, 28Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Google Scholar). FRGY2, however, binds to a 95-base RNA having a specific 6-base sequence at a Kd value of 2 × 10−8M, 1000-fold lower than the concentration of CspA required for its binding to RNA (18Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Google Scholar). Its CSD of 77 residues by itself was shown to still retain a reasonably low Kd value (about 10−7M) with the sequence-specific RNA binding ability. In contrast, our attempts to determine the specific CspA-binding sequences by SELEX (23Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. At present, it is not known what accounts for the differences in RNA binding and sequence specificity between CspA and the FRGY2 CSD. One can speculate that FRGY2 acquired the sequence-specific binding ability as well as the ability to bind to RNA more tightly during evolution. Also, other domains of FRGY2 may contribute to the higher affinity to RNA as well as the sequence specificity for its binding. It is important to note that FRGY2 is a major component of masked maternal mRNA in Xenopus oocytes, while CspA is speculated in the present paper to be an RNA chaperone to facilitate mRNA translation at low temperatures. Nevertheless, these two proteins also share some similar properties such as the size requirement of RNA and the ability to bind nonspecific RNA (18Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Google Scholar and this study). It has been speculated that nonspecific binding of CspA to RNA may occur through the hydrophobic interactions between nucleotide bases and the seven aromatic side chains regularly aligned on the surface of the CspA molecule (12Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Google Scholar). Mutations of these aromatic residues were indeed shown to affect the interaction between RNA and proteins for CspB from Bacillus subtilis (29Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Google Scholar) and for FRGY2 (18Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Google Scholar).

In recent papers, it was demonstrated that targeted disruption of the murine p27 gene enhances growth of mice without an increase in the amounts of either growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor-1 and that disruption of p27 function leads to striking enlargement of thymus, pituitary, and adrenal glands and gonadal organs (10Nakayama K.

Dulic V. Slingerland J.M. Lees E. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5291-5295Google Scholar, 14Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Google Scholar). Recent studies have also demonstrated that the ability of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to interfere with cell cycle progression could be attributed to its ability to suppress the isoprenylation of proteins, rather than its ability to interrupt cholesterol synthesis (15Chakrabarti R. Engleman E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12216-12222Google Scholar, 16Ortiz M.B. Goin M. Gomez D.A.M.B. Hammarstrom S. Jimenez D.A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 139-146Google Scholar). However, the requirements of mevalonate and its metabolites for the elimination of p27 and the activation of Cdk2 during the transition from G1 to S phase have not yet been examined. The present investigation was performed in order to develop insights into the regulation of p27 by mevalonate metabolite(s) during the transition from G1 to S phase. For this purpose, we studied the following questions: 1) which metabolite(s) of mevalonate are active in promoting the elimination of p27? 2) Is protein isoprenylation involved in the elimination of p27? Rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells provide a suitable model for these studies, since their progression from quiescence into the cell cycle is associated with a burst of mevalonate synthesis caused by a large transcriptional activation of the HMG-CoA reductase gene by thyrotropin (TSH) (17Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Google Scholar). [3H]Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ([3H]GGPP) and [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate ([3H]FPP) were purchased from DuPont NEN. GGPP and FPP were purchased from Sigma. To make liposomes containing each, an aliquot of a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (5 μmol) and GGPP or FPP (200 μg) was added to a pear-shaped flask, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and then a vacuum pump. The dried lipid film was then dispersed in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Warming the flask to 50°C facilitates smooth dispersion. The liposomes were sonicated and stored at 4°C. FRTL-5 cells (ATCC CRL 8305), a strain of rat thyroid cells in continuous culture, were grown in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and a six-hormone mixture of TSH (1 × 10−10M), insulin (10 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.4 ng/ml), human transferrin (5 μg/ml), glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine acetate (10 ng/ml), and somatostatin (10 ng/ml) (18Yamamoto K. Hirai A. Ban T. Saito J. Tahara K. Terano T. Tamura Y. Saito Y. Kitagawa M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2036-2042Google Scholar). This medium is referred to as 6H medium. For all experiments, cells were initially cultivated in 6H medium for at least 3 days. As appropriate to individual experiments, cells were then shifted to medium containing no TSH, no insulin, and only 0.2% calf serum, which is referred to as 4H medium, for at least 5 days before use in individual experiments. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that the percentage of cells in G0/G1 at that point is over 95%. These cells are referred to as quiescent cells; the quiescent cells challenged with 6H medium are referred to as growth-stimulated cells. For whole cell lysates, cells were collected and resuspended in cold lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 10 mM NaF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture [10 μg/ml p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain]. The cells were allowed to lyse on ice for 60 min. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min in a Microfuge at 4°C to obtain supernatants. For subcellular fractionation, cells were disrupted by sonication in hypotonic buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM dithiothreitol) containing the protease inhibitor mixture and separated into crude membrane- and cytosol-containing fractions by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min). For pulse-chase analysis, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 2 h, 18-20 h after growth stimulation, and then chased for 20-90 min. For labeling cells with [3H]GGPP, cells were incubated for 36 h with 6H medium in the presence of pravastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (19Tsujita Y. Kuroda M. Shimada Y. Tanzawa K. Arai M. Kaneko I. Tanaka M. Masuda H. Tarumi C. Watanabe Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 50-60Google Scholar) with supplementation of [3H]GGPP (18.5 MBq/μmol) in liposomes. Pravastatin was kindly provided by Dr. S. Kurakata (Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cdk2 activity was determined reported by Turner et al. (20Turner J.E. Minkoff C.G. Martin K.H. Misra R. Swenson K.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1145-1162Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined as reported previously (18Yamamoto K. Hirai A. Ban T. Saito J. Tahara K. Terano T. Tamura Y. Saito Y. Kitagawa M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2036-2042Google Scholar). The cell cycle profiles of samples were analyzed as previously reported (18Yamamoto K. Hirai A. Ban T. Saito J. Tahara K. Terano T. Tamura Y. Saito Y. Kitagawa M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2036-2042Google Scholar). Anti-p27 (C-19), anti-Cdk2 (M2), anti-Rho A (119), and anti-Rho B (119) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (18Yamamoto K. Hirai A. Ban T. Saito J. Tahara K. Terano T. Tamura Y. Saito Y. Kitagawa M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2036-2042Google Scholar). cDNA was prepared from mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit. The full-length mouse p27 cDNA was obtained using polymerase chain reaction. Mouse liver cDNA was used as template, and the following oligonucleotides were prepared as primers, 5′-CGAGGAGGAAGATGTCAAACGT-3′ and 5′-AGCTGTTTACGTCTGGCGTCG-3′. The positive clone (595 base pairs) coded for nucleotides 1-595 of mouse p27 cDNA as reported by Toyoshima et al. (7Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Google Scholar) and contained the full-length coding region for the mouse p27. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (21Hirai A. Kino T. Tokinaga K. Tahara K. Tamura Y. Yoshida S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2215-2223Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse p27-glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was prepared using cDNA containing the full length coding region for mouse p27. Cell extracts were prepared as described by Pagano et al. (5Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beerromero P. Delsal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Google Scholar). Purified recombinant p27-GST fusion protein (1 μg) was incubated with cell extracts in the presence of ATP and an ATP generating system. The reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p27 antibody. Adenosine-5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, led to a reduction in p27 proteolysis. MG-115, an inhibitor of the proteasome, but not E-64 also led to a reduction in p27 proteolysis. Purified recombinant GST was not degraded in cell extracts. The stimulation of quiescent FRTL-5 cells with TSH, insulin, and 5% calf serum resulted in the increase of thymidine incorporation into DNA (Fig. 1A, lane 2 versus 1). Immunoblotting revealed a coincident increase of the rapidly migrating, phosphorylated form of Cdk2 as a single major 33-kDa band (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus 1). The kinase activity associated with Cdk2 was also stimulated (Fig. 1C, lane 2 versus 1). In contrast, the level of p27 in quiescent FRTL-5 cells was high and diminished after growth stimulation (Fig. 1D, lane 2 versus 1). Pravastatin (1200 μM) inhibited growth-stimulated DNA synthesis and induced G1 arrest in FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 1A, lane 3 versus 2 and Fig. 1E). Both the activation of Cdk2 and the elimination of p27 during the transition from G1 to S phase were also inhibited by pravastatin (Fig. 1, B-D, lane 3 versus 2). The presence of pravastatin during the first 16 h of culture did not affect the activation of Cdk2 nor the elimination of p27 in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells; however the continued presence of pravastatin beyond 16 h inhibited both the activation of Cdk2 and the elimination of p27 (Fig. 1, B and D, lanes 3-5 versus 2). The kinase activity associated with Cdk2 had the same time course-dependence of down-regulation in pravastatin-treated cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 3-5 versus 2). Pravastatin did not increase p27 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A, lane 1 versus 2); instead, pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that the half-life of p27 in pravastatin-treated cells was nearly three times as long as its half-life in non-treated cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3 versus lanes 4-8). Since the rate of p27 degradation was markedly slowed by the treatment with pravastatin in the presence of constant amount of mRNA, the accumulation of p27 could be attributed to reduced protein degradation rather than to increased protein synthesis. We used extracts from pravastatin-treated and nontreated cells as a source of ubiquitinating enzymes and proteasomes. Purified recombinant mouse p27-GST fusion protein was used as a substrate. We found that pravastatin treatment had no significant effect on the degradation of p27 in cell extracts (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-3 versus lanes 4-6). This indicates that pravastatin may impair the degradation of p27 at the intracellular processing step(s) proximal to the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Mevalonolactone (0.5 mg/ml) reversed pravastatin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1A, lane 6 versus 3). Pravastatin-induced inhibition of Cdk2 activation and p27 elimination were reversed by the addition of mevalonolactone (Fig. 1, B-D, lane 6 versus 3). Mevalonolactone only overcame the pravastatin effect when added within the first 24 h following growth stimulation (data not shown). In contrast, mevalonolactone did not reverse pravastatin action at later times. Mevalonolactone did not decrease p27 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Mevalonate acts as a isoprenyl precursor for farnesyl or geranylgeranyl molecules which have an important signaling function (22Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Google Scholar). Exogenous FPP and/or GGPP might be expected to counteract the effect of pravastatin. Unfortunately, the experimental use of these compounds is limited by their membrane impermeability and sensitivity to thiol reagents present in the culture medium. Therefore, we introduced a novel approach to evaluate the role of isoprenoids and protein isoprenylation in the elimination of p27: the preparation of liposomes of these isoprenoids. All of the effects of pravastatin on DNA synthesis, Cdk2 activation, the elimination of p27, and cell cycle progression were wholly reversed by the addition of liposomes containing GGPP at the concentration of 10 μM (Fig. 1, A-D, lane 9 versus lane 7 or 3 and Fig. 1E). p27 mRNA levels were not affected by GGPP (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Pulse-chase analysis of the turnover rate of p27 demonstrated that the elongated half-life of p27 in pravastatin-treated cells is shortened to the level of nontreated cells by the addition of GGPP (Fig. 2B, lanes 4-8 versus 9-11). In contrast, the degradation of p27 in cell extracts containing ubiquitinating enzymes and proteasomes was not affected by pravastatin treatment and the supplementation with GGPP (Fig. 2C, lanes 4-6 versus lanes 7-9). These data indicate that GGPP is required for growth stimulation-induced p27 degradation and does affect the availability of p27 to the ubiqutin-proteasome pathway. The addition of FPP had no effect on the inhibitory action of pravastatin (Fig. 1, A-D, lane 8 versus lane 7 or 3), although incorporation of [3H]FPP in liposomes into FRTL-5 cells was almost equal to that of [3H]GGPP (data not shown). GGPP is biosynthetically derived from the single condensation of FPP and IPP. Since IPP could not be synthesized in pravastatin-treated cells, FPP could not be converted to GGPP. These data indicate that GGPP can rescue the pravastatin-induced G1 arrest in the absence of upstream intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis and that geranylgeranylated rather than farnesylated proteins are responsible for inducing p27 elimination in FRTL-5 cells. A class of geranylgeranylated small GTP-binding proteins, termed Rho small GTPases, are proposed to be involved in the transition from G1 to S phase (23Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N. Kozaki S. Ikai K. Imamura S. Narumiya S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1449-1455Google Scholar, 24Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal lipids form part of the hydrophobic signal that targets proteins to various membranes within the cell. We, therefore, determined the subcellular distribution of Rho small GTPases in pravastatin-treated cells with or without GGPP supplementation. Immunoblot analysis of membrane and cytosolic fractions for Rho A and Rho B revealed that GGPP promotes the translocation of Rho A and Rho B from the cytoplasm to membranes during the transition from G1 to S phase (Fig. 3A). In contrast, these proteins were detected only in the cytosolic fraction in the absence of GGPP. The immunoprecipitation of Rho A and Rho B in membrane fraction demonstrated that these proteins were labeled by the supplementation with [3H]GGPP in liposomes (Fig. 3B). High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the lipids associated with these proteins showed that these proteins were geranylgeranylated, but not farnesylated (data not shown). Botulinum C3 exoenzyme specifically inactivates Rho small GTPases (25Nemoto Y. Namba T. Kozaki S. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19312-19319Google Scholar, 26Kikuchi A. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16303-16308Google Scholar, 27Narumiya S. Sekine A. Fujiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17255-17257Google Scholar). The restoring effect of GGPP was abolished with C3 exoenzyme (60 μg/ml) (Fig. 4). Thus it is reasonable to suggest the possible involvement of Rho small GTPase(s) in the elimination of p27. Consistent with this, Rho controls signal transduction pathways that are essential for cell growth; and Rho is required for stress fiber formation, transformation by oncogenic Ras, and signaling to serum response factor by growth stimuli (28Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar, 29Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Google Scholar, 30Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that among mevalonate metabolites, GGPP, not FPP, reversed the reduced p27 degradation induced by pravastatin. In the presence of GGPP, Rho proteins necessary for S phase development are also geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes during G1/S progression. The restoring effect of GGPP was abolished with botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates Rho proteins. Thus, geranylgeranylated protein(s), most likely Rho, appear to play a critical role in regulating p27 elimination and Cdk2 activation during G1/S progression. Recently, a family of target proteins of Rho small GTPases has been identified (31Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Google Scholar, 32Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S.

Differences in peptide-binding specificity among Hsp70s have led to the hypothesis that peptide binding determines specific Hsp70 functions. Protein domains were identified that were required for two separate functions of a yeast Hsp70 family. The peptide-binding domain was not required for either of these specific Hsp70 functions, which suggests that peptide-binding specificity plays little or no role in determining Hsp70 functions in vivo."

Crystal structures have revealed contact surfaces between G protein subunits, but not the surfaces or molecular mechanism through which Gαβγ responds to activation by transmembrane receptors. Such a surface was identified from the results of testing 100 mutant α subunits of the retinal G protein transducin for their ability to interact with rhodopsin. Sites at which alanine substitutions impaired this interaction mapped to two distinct Gα surfaces: a βγ-binding surface and a putative receptor-interacting surface.

https://openalex.org/W2106018616,"The natural product lactacystin exerts its cellular antiproliferative effects through a mechanism involving acylation and inhibition of the proteasome, a cytosolic proteinase complex that is an essential component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for intracellular protein degradation. In vitro, lactacystin does not react with the proteasome; rather, it undergoes a spontaneous conversion (lactonization) to the active proteasome inhibitor, clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone. We show here that when the beta-lactone is added to mammalian cells in culture, it rapidly enters the cells, where it can react with the sulfhydryl of glutathione to form a thioester adduct that is both structurally and functionally analogous to lactacystin. We call this adduct lactathione, and like lactacystin, it does not react with the proteasome, but can undergo lactonization to yield back the active beta-lactone. We have studied the kinetics of this reaction under appropriate in vitro conditions as well as the kinetics of lactathione accumulation and proteasome inhibition in cells treated with lactacystin or beta-lactone. The results indicate that only the beta-lactone (not lactacystin) can enter cells and suggest that the formation of lactathione serves to concentrate the inhibitor inside cells, providing a reservoir for prolonged release of the active beta-lactone."
https://openalex.org/W2076552482,"We have previously reported that plasma apolipoprotein (apo) E-containing high density lipoprotein particles have a potent anti-platelet action, apparently by occupying saturable binding sites in the cell surface. Here we show that purified apoE (10-50 μg/ml), complexed with phospholipid vesicles (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, DMPC), suppresses platelet aggregation induced by ADP, epinephrine, or collagen. This effect was not due to sequestration of cholesterol from platelet membranes; apoE·DMPC chemically modified with cyclohexanedione (cyclohexanedione-apoE·DMPC) did not inhibit aggregation but nevertheless removed similar amounts of cholesterol as untreated complexes, about 2% during the aggregation period. Rather we found that apoE influenced intracellular platelet signaling. Thus, apoE·DMPC markedly increased cGMP in ADP-stimulated platelets which correlated with the resulting inhibition of aggregation (r = 0.85; p < 0.01, n = 10), whereas cyclohexanedione-apoE·DMPC vesicles had no effect. One important cellular mechanism for up-regulation of cGMP is through stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, the NO generated by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, binds to and activates guanylate cyclase. This signal transduction pathway was implicated by the finding that NO synthase inhibitors of distinct structural and functional types all reversed the anti-platelet action of apoE, whereas a selective inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (100 nM), had a similar reversing action. Direct confirmation that apoE stimulates NO synthase was obtained by use of L-[3H]arginine; platelets pretreated with apoE·DMPC produced markedly more L-[3H]citrulline (0.71 ± 0.1 pmol/h/109 platelets) than controls (0.18 ± 0.03; p < 0.05). In addition, hemoglobin which avidly binds NO also suppressed the anti-aggregatory effect, indicating that apoE stimulated sufficient production of NO by platelets for extracellular release to occur. We conclude that apoE inhibits platelet aggregation through the L-arginine:NO signal transduction pathway. We have previously reported that plasma apolipoprotein (apo) E-containing high density lipoprotein particles have a potent anti-platelet action, apparently by occupying saturable binding sites in the cell surface.

Thus, apoE·DMPC markedly increased cGMP in ADP-stimulated platelets which correlated with the resulting inhibition of aggregation (r = 0.85; p < 0.01, n = 10), whereas cyclohexanedione-apoE·DMPC vesicles had no effect. One important cellular mechanism for up-regulation of cGMP is through stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, the NO generated by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, binds to and activates guanylate cyclase. This signal transduction pathway was implicated by the finding that NO synthase inhibitors of distinct structural and functional types all reversed the anti-platelet action of apoE, whereas a selective inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (100 nM), had a similar reversing action. Direct confirmation that apoE stimulates NO synthase was obtained by use of L-[3H]arginine; platelets pretreated with apoE·DMPC produced markedly more L-[3H]citrulline (0.71 ± 0.1 pmol/h/109 platelets) than controls (0.18 ± 0.03; p < 0.05). In addition, hemoglobin which avidly binds NO also suppressed the anti-aggregatory effect, indicating that apoE stimulated sufficient production of NO by platelets for extracellular release to occur. We conclude that apoE inhibits platelet aggregation through the L-arginine:NO signal transduction pathway."

Recently it was shown that a 21-residue fragment of the prion protein (106-126) could be toxic to cultured neurons. We report here that this peptide forms ion-permeable channels in planar lipid bilayer membranes. These channels are freely permeable to common physiological ions, and their formation is significantly enhanced by “aging” and/or low pH. We suggest that channel formation is the cytotoxic mechanism of action of amyloidogenic peptides found in prion-related encephalopathies and other amyloidoses. The channels reported here are large enough and nonselective enough to mediate cell death through discharge of cellular membrane potential, changes in ionic homeostasis, and specifically, influx of calcium, perhaps triggering apoptosis.

In human platelets, two membrane glycoprotein (GP) abnormalities, integrin α2β1 deficiency and GPVI deficiency, have been reported to result in severe hyporesponsiveness to fibrillar collagen. Although it has been well established that integrin α2β1, also known as the GPIa-IIa complex, functions as a primary platelet adhesion receptor for collagen, the mechanism by which GPVI contributes to collagen-platelet interaction has been ill defined to date. However, our recent observation that GPVI cross-linking couples to cyclic AMP-insensitive activation of c-Src and Syk tyrosine kinases suggested a potential role for GPVI in regulating protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by collagen (Ichinohe, T., Takayama, H., Ezumi, Y., Yanagi, S., Yamamura, H., and Okuma, M.

To further investigate this hypothesis, here we examined the collagen-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in GPVI-deficient platelets expressing normal amounts of α2β1. In response to collagen, these platelets exhibited α2β1-dependent c-Src activation accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates including cortactin. In contrast, severe defects were observed in collagen-stimulated Syk activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-Γ2, Vav, and focal adhesion kinase, implicating a specific requirement of GPVI for recruiting these molecules to signaling cascades evoked by collagen-platelet interaction.

To further understand the signaling pathway of MAPKAP kinase 2, we have purified p60 from a heat-treated neutrophil lysate by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Microsequencing of five peptides derived from purified p60 indicates that p60 is lymphocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1). Furthermore antibodies specific for human and mouse LSP1 react with human and mouse p60. The sequence of human LSP1 indicates two serine residues at positions 204 and 252 as potential phosphorylation sites.

In order to delineate whether the involvement of NF-κB activation is required for triggering of the apoptotic signal of TNF, we inhibited the nuclear translocation of this transcription factor in TNF-sensitive MCF7 cells by introducing a human MAD-3 mutant cDNA coding for a mutated IκBα that is resistant to both phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation and that behaves as a potent dominant negative IκBα protein. Our results demonstrated that the mutated IκBα was stably expressed in the transfected MCF7 cells and blocked the TNF-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation. Indeed, TNF treatment of these cells induced the proteolysis of only the endogenous IκBα but not the mutated IκBα. The nuclear NF-κB released from the endogenous IκBα within 30 min of TNF treatment was rapidly inhibited by the mutated IκBα. There was no significant difference either in cell viability or in the kinetics of cell death between control cells and the mutated IκBα transfected cells. Furthermore, electron microscopic analysis showed that the cell death induced by TNF in both control and mutated IκBα transfected cells was apoptotic. The inhibition of NF-κB translocation in mutated IκBα-transfected cells persisted throughout the same time course that apoptosis was occurring. Our data provide direct evidence that the inhibition of NF-κB did not alter TNF-induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells and support the view that TNF-mediated apoptosis is NF-κB independent."

In particular, in rat and human osteoblasts, 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases the expression of Osteocalcin by interacting, through a hormone-receptor complex, with a vitamin D-responsive element present in the promoter of the genes. Here we show that in mouse, 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibits the expression of both osteocalcin genes, OG1 and OG2. This inhibition was observed in primary osteoblast cultures and in the whole animal. From sequence inspection, DNA transfection experiments, and DNA binding assays, we could not identify a functional vitamin D-responsive element in the promoter of OG2 or in the first 3.3 kilobases of the OG1 promoter. However, we show that 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of primary osteoblasts abolishes the binding of OSF2, an osteoblast-specific activator of transcription that binds to OSE2, a critical osteoblast-specific cis-acting element present in OG1 and OG2 promoters. Consistent with these DNA binding data, a mutation in OSE2 in the OG2 promoter abrogated the inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment on this promoter activity. This study illustrates that 1,25-(OH)2D3 can play different roles in the expression of the same gene in various species and indicates that this regulation in mouse occurs through an indirect mechanism, 1,25-(OH)2D3 acting on a gene genetically located upstream of Osteocalcin. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), a key regulator of mineral metabolism, regulates the expression of several genes that are expressed in osteoblasts.

Baukol S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11660-11663Google Scholar). It also induces a rapid increase in Osteocalcin expression in the whole animal early after 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment (14Ikeda T. Kohono H. Yamamuro T. Kasai R. Ohta S. Okumura H. Konidhi J. Kikuchi H. Shigeno C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1231-1235Google Scholar). The promoters of the human and rat osteocalcin genes were the first promoter elements in which VDREs were identified and characterized (10Lian J. Stewart C. Puchacz E. Mackowiak S. Shalhoub V.

The VDRE is typically made up of two direct repeats separated by a 3-bp spacer. This finding contributed to the definition of the “3, 4, 5 rule” for DNA binding of various nuclear receptors (15Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Google Scholar). The hormone-VDR complex binds to this element as an heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (16MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Google Scholar). Notably, the VDRE is located in most cases within the first kilobase (kb) of 5′-flanking sequence of the target gene (17Carlberg C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 517-527Google Scholar). In spite of this regulatory role, the precise physiological function of 1,25-(OH)2D3 during osteoblast differentiation in vivo remains unclear. The fact that normal bone mineralization can be achieved in human in the absence of a functional VDR, provided that adequate serum calcium and phosphorus levels are maintained (18Balsan S. Garabedian M. Larchet M. Gorski A.M. Cournot G. Tau C. Bourdeau A. Silve C. Ricour C. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1661-1667Google Scholar), suggests that the main function of the hormone in bone is to mobilize calcium through resorption. We recently cloned the two mouse osteocalcin genes, OG1 and OG2 (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar), and used the OG2 promoter to study the mechanisms controlling the osteoblast-specific expression of this gene (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 21Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Google Scholar). In the course of this work, we were surprised to find a total absence of up-regulation of this promoter activity by 1,25-(OH)2D3, even though a VDRE-like sequence was present. Thus, we decided to systematically study this aspect of the regulation of expression of the mouse osteocalcin genes in vivo and in vitro. Here we show that the expression of the mouse osteocalcin genes, unlike their rat and human homologues, is down-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and that an indirect mechanism is involved in this down-regulation. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from calvariae of 2-day-old mice as described previously (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 22Harris S.E. Sabatini M.

Calvariae were sequentially digested for 20, 40, and 90 min at 37°C in α-modified minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1 mg/ml collagenase P (Boehringer Mannheim) and 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells of the first two digests were discarded, whereas cells released from the third digestion were plated in α-modified minimum essential medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 2 days, this medium was replaced by mineralization medium (α-modified minimum essential medium and 10% fetal bovine serum containing 5 mMβ-glycerophosphate and 0.1 mg/ml ascorbic acid), which was changed every 2 days. After 10 days of culture in mineralization medium, the cells were treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 dissolved in ethanol or with vehicle and harvested at specific intervals before RNA extraction.

A SalI site was introduced at position +13 of OG2 by PCR amplification of the sequence extending from positions −657 to +13, using as primers the oligonucleotides 5′-CCAAGACCTGGCCCAG-3′ for the 5′-side and 5′-TGGTCGACTTGTCTGT-3′ for the 3′-side. This initial fragment was used to generate p657OG2-luc (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). p1316OG2-luc was created by inserting the EcoRV-NcoI fragment of the OG2 promoter (positions −1316 to −657) at the 5′-end of p657OG2-luc (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). p147OG2-luc was obtained by an NcoI-PvuII (positions −343 to −147) deletion of p657OG2-luc (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). p2900OG2-luc was created by inserting at the −1035 PstI site in p1316OG2-luc a 1.9-kb PstI-BamHI fragment of the OG2 promoter. p147OG2mut-luc was generated by cloning in p4luc a PCR fragment resulting from the amplification of p147OG2-luc, using as primers the oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCGCTGCAATCACCAAGAACAGCA-3′ for the 5′-side and 5′-TGGTCGACTTGTCTGT-3′ for the 3′-side. The existence of the 2-bp substitution mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. To generate pOG1-luc constructs, a SalI site was first introduced at position +13 of OG1 by PCR amplification of the OG1 promoter sequence extending from positions −343 to +13, using as primers the BglII site-containing oligonucleotide 5′-CCGAATTCAGATCTCT-3′ for the 5′-side and the SalI site-containing oligonucleotide 5′-TGGTCGACTTGTCTGT-3′ for the 3′-side. A PstI-BglII fragment of the OG1 promoter (positions −1035 to −343) was cloned upstream of the initial BglII-SalI fragment to generate p1049OG1-luc. p3300OG1-luc was created by cloning a PstI-EcoRI fragment extending 2.3 kb upstream of the PstI site (position −1035) to this latter construction. PCR product sequences were all verified by DNA sequencing. The rat osteocalcin-luc construct was created by insertion of 1.7 kb of the HindIII-BamHI rat Osteocalcin promoter fragment (a gift from Dr. M. Demay), blunt-ended, into the SmaI site of p4luc. pROP-luc contains 1.7 kb of the rat Osteopontin promoter fused to luciferase (26Ridall A.L. Daane E.L. Dickinson D.P. Butler W.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 59-66Google Scholar); pMOP-luc contains 1 kb (positions −910 to +90) of mouse Osteopontin promoter fused to luciferase (a gift from Dr. A. Ridall). Orientation and conformity of the inserts cloned in p4luc were confirmed by restriction analysis. Nine-week-old mice (28 g) were injected intraperitoneally with 24 ng of 1,25-(OH)2D3 or with vehicle as described previously (27Silver J. Naveh-Many T. Mayer H. Schmeizer H.J. Popovtzer M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1296-1301Google Scholar) and killed 24 h later. Calvariae were dissected out and cleaned of soft tissues, and RNA was prepared by extraction with guanidine isothiocyanate, followed by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation (28Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1987; Vol. 1: 4.9.1-4.9.3Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (28Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1987; Vol. 1: 4.9.1-4.9.3Google Scholar). Denatured RNA samples were loaded on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon filters (Amersham Corp.). The filters were then hybridized with either the Osteocalcin (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar) or Osteopontin (29Oldberg A. Franzen A. Heinegard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8819-8823Google Scholar) probes labeled by random priming. After autoradiography and signal quantification using a PhosphorImager, filters were stripped and reprobed with a mouse β-actin probe that was used as a control of RNA loading. Reverse transcription was conducted on 5 μg of DNase-treated total RNA from 10-day-old primary osteoblast cultures treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−7M) or vehicle 60 h before harvest. cDNA synthesis was performed by oligo(dT) priming using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) under conditions suggested by the supplier. PCR amplification was conducted on one-tenth of the reverse transcription reaction using as 5′-primer 5′-CAAGTCCCACACAGCAGCTT-3′ (positions +8 to +27) and as 3′-primer 5′-AAAGCCGAGCTGCCAGAGTT-3′ (positions +359 to +378) to generate a 370-bp PCR product for osteocalcin cDNAs (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar). The primers 5′-GTTGAGAGATCATCTCCACC-3′ and 5′-AGCGATGATGAACCAGGTTA-3′ were used to generate a 320-bp PCR product corresponding to exon 2 of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase cDNA. For the analysis of reverse transcription-PCR products, aliquots of the PCR mixtures were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and the gel was dried. Two synthetic oligonucleotides were used as probes to detect mRNA specifically transcribed from either OG1 (5′-AGGACCATCTTTCTGCTC-3′, positions +35 to +52) or OG2 (5′-AGGACCCTCTCTCTGCTC-3′, positions +35 to +52) (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out at 42°C directly on the gel as described previously (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar, 30Johannes F. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 48Google Scholar). DNA transfections of ROS 17/2.8 and MC3T3-E1 cells were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle for 64 h before harvest as described previously (11Demay M.B. Roth D.A. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2279-2282Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were assayed by using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and D-luciferin substrate (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mM ATP, 15 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. β-Galactosidase activities in each lysate, measured by a colorimetric enzyme assay using resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) as a substrate, were used to normalize transfection efficiency between experiments. Nuclear extracts from ROS 17/2.8 cells and primary osteoblasts were prepared as described (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3, retinoic acid, BMP7 (one orphogenetic rotein), β-estradiol, or vehicle 48 h before harvest. For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, double-stranded mouse VDRE-like, rat VDRE, OSE2 (steoblast-pecific lement), and mOCE1 oligonucleotides were labeled and purified as described previously (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). Five fmol of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated in binding buffer (50 mM KCl, 12 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 12% glycerol) with 8 μg of nuclear extracts and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, the indicated amount of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction with the other components. The samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA (44.5 mM Tris-HCl, 44.5 mM boric acid, and 4 mM EDTA). DNA binding and electrophoresis conditions for OSE2 and mOCE1 were as described previously (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). In the promoter of one rat osteocalcin gene, a functional VDRE is located between positions −455 and −441 (10Lian J. Stewart C. Puchacz E. Mackowiak S. Shalhoub V. Collart D. Zambetti G. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1143-1147Google Scholar, 11Demay M.B. Roth D.A. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2279-2282Google Scholar). A similar sequence, but containing a 2-bp substitution, is located at approximately the same place (positions −465 to −451) in the promoter elements of OG1 and OG2. To determine whether this was a functional VDRE, we performed DNA transfection experiments in ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells using four different constructs. The p1049OG1-luc and p657OG2-luc promoter-luciferase chimeric genes both contain the VDRE-like sequence; p147OG2-luc, which lacks any recognizable VDRE, served as a negative control, and the 1.7-kb rat Osteopontin promoter-luciferase chimeric gene (pROP-luc), which contains two well characterized functional VDREs, served as a positive control (26Ridall A.L. Daane E.L. Dickinson D.P. Butler W.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 59-66Google Scholar). ROS 17/2.8 cells were transfected with these vectors and treated with or without 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−7 or 10−8M) for 64 h. In agreement with previous findings (32Sztajnkrycer M.D. Kronenberg M.S. Rowe D.W. Pan L.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 235Google Scholar), the expression of OG1-luc and OG2-luc chimeric genes was never up-regulated by treatment of transfected cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1). Instead, their expression was always reduced by this treatment, whereas the expression of pROP-luc, the positive control vector, was always up-regulated (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate that the absence of up-regulation of the OG1 and OG2 promoter activities was not due to the choice of a rat cell line for studying the activity of mouse promoters, we performed two additional experiments. First, we tested whether the mouse Osteopontin promoter activity was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment in ROS 17/2.8 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of ROS 17/2.8 cells transfected with the pMOP-luc construct, which contains 1 kb of the mouse Osteopontin promoter, increased the activity of this promoter 3.2 times. Second, the regulation of the OG1 and OG2 promoter activities by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was tested in a mouse osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1). The expression of p147OG2-luc was always reduced by treatment of these cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3, while the activity of pMOP-luc exhibited at least 10 times the control activity following the same treatment. These results indicate that the absence of up-regulation of OG1 and OG2 promoter-luciferase constructs by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is not due to the absence of a mouse specific cofactor in ROS 17/2.8 cells. The results of these experiments also implied that the 2-bp substitution in the VDRE-like sequence of OG1 and OG2 promoters abolished or greatly diminished the binding of the hormone-VDR complex to this site. To test this hypothesis, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using as probes an oligonucleotide encompassing the VDRE of the rat Osteocalcin promoter (rat VDRE) and an oligonucleotide containing the VDRE-like element present in OG1 and OG2 promoters (mouse VDRE-like) (Fig. 2A). As a source of proteins, we used nuclear extracts of ROS 17/2.8 cells, either untreated or treated for 48 h with retinoic acid (10−7M), β-estradiol (10−8M), or 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−8M). Incubation of untreated or retinoic acid- or β-estradiol-treated ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts with rat VDRE or mouse VDRE-like probes did not generate a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3 and 5). In contrast, when we used nuclear extracts of 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated ROS 17/2.8 cells, there was a marked increase in the amount of binding to the labeled rat VDRE oligonucleotide, but not to the labeled mouse VDRE-like oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 4 and lanes 5 and 6). This result suggests that the mouse VDRE-like sequence has a much lower affinity for the 1,25-(OH)2D3-VDR complex than does the rat VDRE. This was confirmed by DNA competition experiments in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The binding of hormone-treated ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extracts to the labeled rat VDRE oligonucleotide was substantially inhibited by excess molar amounts of the unlabeled rat VDRE oligonucleotide, but not by the same molar amounts of the unlabeled mouse VDRE-like oligonucleotide (Fig. 2C). Thus, taken together, the DNA transfection experiments, the DNA binding studies, and the DNA competition experiments demonstrate that the 2-bp substitution in the VDRE-like sequence of OG1 and OG2 promoters nearly abolished the binding of the hormone-VDR complex to this sequence and explain the absence of up-regulation of OG1 and OG2 promoter-luciferase activities by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. We then analyzed the regulation of expression of the endogenous osteocalcin genes by 1,25-(OH)2D3. We first used mouse primary osteoblast cultures as an experimental system. These cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−7, 10−8, or 10−9M) for 36, 48, or 60 h and assayed for Osteocalcin expression by Northern blot analysis. Surprisingly, osteocalcin mRNA was readily detectable in untreated cells, but was nearly undetectable following 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of these cultures. This inhibition of Osteocalcin expression was concentration-dependent and occurred at every time point analyzed (Fig. 3A). In contrast, as previously shown (33Noda M. Rodan G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 713-718Google Scholar), Osteocalcin expression in ROS 17/2.8 cells was barely detectable before 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, but was up-regulated up to 7-fold by the hormonal treatment (Fig. 3B). To demonstrate that this down-regulation of the mouse Osteocalcin expression was not due to our culture conditions, we monitored the expression of Osteopontin, a gene whose expression is known to be increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment in mouse (34Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. Deluca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9995-9999Google Scholar). Consistent with our DNA transfection experiments, Osteopontin expression was always up-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of these cultures (Fig. 3A). β-Actin expression was used as an internal control in these experiments since it is not affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment (27Silver J. Naveh-Many T. Mayer H. Schmeizer H.J. Popovtzer M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1296-1301Google Scholar). To show that the down-regulation of Osteocalcin in 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated primary osteoblasts was an accurate reflection of the regulation occurring in vivo, we treated 9-week-old mice with a single dose of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (24 ng), isolated RNA from calvariae 24 h later, and measured Osteocalcin expression. In the entire animal, 1,25-(OH)2D3 also led to a marked decrease (6-fold) in osteocalcin mRNA accumulation (Fig. 3C). Taken together, our results show that in mouse, 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibits Osteocalcin expression. To determine whether both osteocalcin genes were down-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, we used an allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of the reverse transcription-PCR product assay (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar). RNA from untreated or 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated mouse primary osteoblasts was used as template. Aliquots of each PCR mixture were electrophoresed on an agarose gel along with aliquots of plasmids containing either OG1 or OG2. The gel was hybridized with a labeled “OG1” oligonucleotide that recognizes only transcripts originating from OG1 (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar). OG1 expression was virtually abolished by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−7M) treatment of these cells (Fig. 4). This gel was stripped and rehybridized with the “OG2” oligonucleotide designed to visualize cDNAs originating only from OG2 (19Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Google Scholar). OG2 expression was also virtually abolished by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of these cultures (Fig. 4). Thus, the expression of the two mouse osteocalcin genes is down-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in vivo. Given this inhibition of OG1 and OG2 expression by 1,25-(OH)2D3, we then searched for VDREs located farther upstream in the promoters of these genes. First, we sequenced 2.9 kb of the OG2 promoter and 3.3 kb of the OG1 promoter, but no VDRE consensus sequence (15Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Google Scholar) could be identified (data not shown). Next, we generated promoter-luciferase constructs containing the largest OG2 promoter fragment isolated (2.9 kb) or 3.3 kb of the OG1 promoter. Each of these constructs was transfected into ROS 17/2.8 or MC3T3-E1 cells, which were subsequently treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle. We used three different positive controls in this experiment: pROP-luc, pROC-luc, and pMOP-luc. The activity of the three positive control constructs in treated cells was always several times that in untreated cells. The activity of the OG1 and OG2 promoter-luciferase constructs was constantly reduced by approximately half by the same treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 5). The moderate effect observed in DNA transfection experiments suggested that 1,25-(OH)2D3 might act indirectly on Osteocalcin transcription, possibly by inhibiting the expression of a gene that encodes a factor controlling Osteocalcin expression. Although no such gene has been identified yet, osteoblast-specific nuclear proteins binding to osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements have been characterized (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 21Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Google Scholar, 35Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 773-782Google Scholar). To determine whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 modulated binding of these factors, we monitored the amount of binding to two well characterized cis-acting elements in nuclear extracts of untreated and 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated mouse primary osteoblasts. OSE2 is an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element that binds OSF2 (osteoblast-pecific actor), an osteoblast-specific nuclear protein. OSE2 controls the osteoblast-specific expression of OG2 (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 21Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Google Scholar). mOCE1 binds a ubiquitously expressed protein and does not affect OG2 promoter activity significantly (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). When we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using as a probe a labeled OSE2 oligonucleotide, OSF2 binding was nearly abolished in 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated nuclear extracts (Fig. 6A, lane 3). Two lines of evidence indicate that this effect was specific. First, it could not be obtained by using nuclear extracts of cells treated with another differentiation agent of the osteoblasts such as BMP7 (Fig. 6A, lane 2); second, the binding of nuclear proteins to mOCE1 was unaffected by treatment of the cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 6B, lane 3). This latter result demonstrated the integrity of the nuclear extracts. Likewise, 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of primary osteoblasts did not affect the binding of nuclear proteins to OSE1 (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar), another osteoblast-specific cis-acting element (data not shown). The specific inhibition of binding of OSF2 to OSE2 in 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated nuclear extracts suggests that the regulation of Osteocalcin expression by 1,25-(OH)2D3 occurs through an indirect mechanism: the hormone either down-regulates OSF2 expression or induces post-translational modification, preventing binding of OSF2 to DNA. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of ROS 17/2.8 or MC3T3-E1 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 down-regulated the activity of the 147-bp OG2 promoter fragment that contains the originally described OSE2 sequence (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). To demonstrate the importance of this sequence in the inhibition of OG2 promoter activity, we introduced in this OG2 promoter fragment a 2-bp substitution mutation in OSE2 that abolishes OSF2 binding (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). We then performed DNA transfection experiments using constructs containing either the wild-type or mutated promoters fused to luciferase in ROS 17/2.8 cells or MC3T3-E1 cells. In agreement with our DNA binding data, the activity of the mutated promoter was not down-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of these cells, but rather slightly up-regulated (Fig. 7). We have analyzed the regulation of the mouse osteocalcin genes by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and showed that their expression is down-regulated by this hormone. Our results also indicate that this effect is mediated, at least in part, through an indirect mechanism inasmuch as 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of osteoblasts abolished OSF2 binding to OSE2, a potent osteoblast-specific cis-activator of transcription (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 21Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Google Scholar). One of the roles of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in bone is to promote osteoblast differentiation, although the overall physiological consequences of this differentiating action are not clearly understood (1Reichel H. Koeffler H.P. Norman A.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 980-991Google Scholar). 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulates the expression of several genes expressed in osteoblasts, among them Osteocalcin (8Price P.A. Baukol S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11660-11663Google Scholar, 9Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Google Scholar, 10Lian J. Stewart C. Puchacz E. Mackowiak S. Shalhoub V. Collart D. Zambetti G. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1143-1147Google Scholar, 11Demay M.B. Roth D.A. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2279-2282Google Scholar, 12Ozono K. Liao J. Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21881-21888Google Scholar). This regulation of expression occurs at the transcriptional level, wherein the hormone-receptor complex binds to a VDRE located in the promoter of the rat and human osteocalcin genes (9Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Google Scholar, 10Lian J. Stewart C. Puchacz E. Mackowiak S. Shalhoub V. Collart D. Zambetti G. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1143-1147Google Scholar, 11Demay M.B. Roth D.A. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2279-2282Google Scholar). However, a growing body of evidence indicates that once the osteoblasts begin to express Osteocalcin, the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on gene expression can vary with the time at which the hormonal treatment is initiated. For instance, when 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of rat calvaria cultures was initiated during the proliferative stage of this culture, there was no increase in Osteocalcin expression (36Ishida H. Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 61-66Google Scholar). These data suggest that the hormone may have multiple and complex effects in vivo on osteoblast gene expression varying with the stage of differentiation of the cells. Several experimental arguments suggest that the inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on mouse Osteocalcin expression was not due to the stage of differentiation of the osteoblasts under our culture conditions. First, we did not begin 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment before the osteoblasts reached the mineralizing stage. Second, the expression of Osteopontin, a gene expressed earlier than Osteocalcin during osteoblast differentiation and which was used in these experiments as a positive control (7Owen T.A. Aranow M.S. Brone L.M. Bettencourt B. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1496-1504Google Scholar), was always up-regulated in our cultured osteoblasts. Third and most important, the same inhibition of Osteocalcin expression occurred when we performed this treatment in the entire animal. What is the mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibits mouse Osteocalcin expression? Based on our results, we propose that the hormone achieves this function through an indirect mechanism. 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of mouse primary osteoblasts selectively abolished the binding of OSF2, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor that binds to and controls the activity of OG1 and OG2 promoters (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 21Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Google Scholar). 2P. Ducy and G. Karsenty, manuscript in preparation. Our working hypothesis is that 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of primary osteoblasts inhibits transcription of the gene coding for OSF2. Such an indirect mechanism may also explain why we observed only a 2-fold effect when we tested the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment on OG1 and OG2 promoter activity in DNA transfection experiments. Indeed, it is known that other cis-acting elements are involved in the control of Osteocalcin expression (20Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar, 35Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 773-782Google Scholar), and the binding of nuclear factors to these elements was not affected by the hormonal treatment. The fact that the inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment was greater on longer promoter fragments suggests that other OSE2-related sequences could be present farther upstream in OG1 and OG2 promoters. We (21Geoffroy V. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30973-30979Google Scholar) and others (37Merriman H.L. Wijnen A.J.V. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Google Scholar) recently presented evidence that OSF2 may be a member of the PEBP2α family of transcription factors. The eventual identification of a cDNA for OSF2 will allow a direct demonstration of the proposed mechanism. Broess et al. (38Broess M. Riva A. Gerstenfeld L.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 57: 440-451Google Scholar) reported recently that 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibits Osteocalcin expression in differentiated osteoblasts from chicken; it will be important to determine whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 also inhibits OSF2 binding to the promoter of the chicken osteocalcin gene. This hypothesis does not exclude the possibility that 1,25-(OH)2D3 affects Osteocalcin expression directly. The hormone-VDR complex may bind to an as yet unidentified VDRE and, through its interaction with specific cofactors, inhibit its transcription. This mechanism has been shown recently to explain the ligand-independent repression of transcription by the thyroid hormone receptor (39Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Google Scholar). Although most of the VDREs identified to date are located within 1 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the target gene (17Carlberg C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 517-527Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that the VDRE is located farther upstream or downstream in the Osteocalcin locus, as has been demonstrated for the regulation of the HoxA cluster by retinoic acid (40Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Google Scholar). Experiments in progress are designed to test these two hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive. A more general question raised by our studies is, what is the importance of the regulation of Osteocalcin expression by 1,25-(OH)2D3 during osteoblast differentiation in vivo? Since this hormone differently regulates the expression of the same gene in closely related species such as rat and mouse, its role is not likely to be essential for the establishment of the osteoblastic phenotype. Indeed, we have observed in osteocalcin-deficient mice that the osteoblasts do differentiate normally and can lay down an extracellular matrix and mineralize it (13Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B.

The immunological activities of all of these AraLAMs drastically decrease with the loss of the mild alkali groups, which were believed to be restricted to the fatty acid residues from the phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor. This report reveals the presence and the structure of mild alkali-labile phosphoinositide units linked via the phosphate to the C-5 of the β-D-Araf in the AraLAMs of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast growing mycobacterial species. Their structure was unambiguously established with a strategy based on both one-dimensional 31P and two-dimensional 1H-31P heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy (HMQC) and HMQC-homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy NMR experiments applied to native AraLAMs and to AraLAMs treated in mild alkali conditions. Next to these alkali-labile phosphoinositides estimated at three per molecule, two other mild alkali-stable phosphoinositide units were identified: the expected (myo-inositol-1)-phosphate-(3-glycerol) unit typifying the well known glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the mannan core and, more surprisingly, one (myo-inositol-1)-phosphate-(5-β-D-Araf) unit having the same structure as the alkali-labile ones. Moreover, these four phosphoinositide units were found capping the arabinan side chains. Thus, their different behavior toward mild alkaline hydrolysis was explained according to their accessibility to the alkali reagent. This novel class of LAMs, namely phosphoinositols-glyceroarabinomannans (PI-GAMs), are characterized by their phosphoinositide units but also by the absence of fatty acid residues.

In recent years, the immunological findings concerning lipoarabinomannans (LAMs) 1The abbreviations used are: LAMlipoarabinomannanAraLAMLAM without mannosyl extensionsdAraLAMdeacylated AraLAMBCGbacillus Calmette GuérinDEPTdistortionless enhancement by polarization transferdLAMdeacylated LAMGC/MSgas chromatography/mass spectrometryHMQCheteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopyHOHAHAhomonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy3JH,H′vicinal spin-spin coupling constantsManLAMLAM with mannosyl extensionsP1 and P2phosphates 1 and 2, respectivelyPI-GAMphosphoinositol-glyceroarabinomannanTMStrimethylsilylationTNFtumor necrosis factorInsinositolGroglycerolt-terminalLPSlipopolysaccharideSWspectral widthTPPItime-proportional phase increment. have indicated that they play a key role in tuberculosis immunopathogenesis (1Brennan P.J. Hunter S.W. McNeil M. Chatterjee D. Daffé M. Ayoub E.M. Cassell G.H. Branche W.C. Henry T.J. Microbial Determinants of Virulence and Host Response.American Society for Microbiology. 1990; : 55-75Google Scholar). These lipopolysaccharide-like molecules are ubiquitously found in the cell walls of the Mycobacterium genus (2Daniel T.M. Kubica G.P. Wayne L.G. The Mycobacteria: A Sourcebook.Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1984; : 417-465Google Scholar). According to their structure, LAMs have been classified into two types, the mannosylated LAMs, called ManLAMs, and the AraLAMs. ManLAMs are characterized by the presence of small α(1-2)-manno-oligosaccharides located at the arabinan side-chain termini. More recently, the ManLAMs have been subdivided into two types according to the presence or absence of phosphatidyl-myo-Ins anchor (3Venisse A. Rivière M. Vercauteren J. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15012-15021Google Scholar). ManLAMs were first isolated from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Erdman strain (4Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Google Scholar, 5Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. McNeil M. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 497-506Google Scholar) and further from the vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG (6Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Google Scholar, 7Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Google Scholar). AraLAMs are devoid of manno-oligosaccharide caps, but the presence of myo-Ins phosphate units capping a minor portion of the AraLAM arabinan side chains was recently established (8Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12380-12389Google Scholar). These AraLAMs arise from an unidentified fast growing mycobacterial strain that was initially considered as H37Ra (9Chatterjee D. Bozic C.M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9652-9660Google Scholar). lipoarabinomannan LAM without mannosyl extensions deacylated AraLAM bacillus Calmette Guérin distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer deacylated LAM gas chromatography/mass spectrometry heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy vicinal spin-spin coupling constants LAM with mannosyl extensions phosphates 1 and 2, respectively phosphoinositol-glyceroarabinomannan trimethylsilylation tumor necrosis factor inositol glycerol terminal lipopolysaccharide spectral width time-proportional phase increment. AraLAMs mediate the early activation of macrophages. They stimulate early gene responses, at the mRNA level, of the c-fos gene and chemotactic JE and KC cytokines (10Roach T.I. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1886-1896Google Scholar, 11Roach T.I. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1176-1184Google Scholar), but they also induce transcription of the mRNA for cytokines characteristically produced by macrophages (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukins 1-α, 1-β, 6, 8, and 10). The TNF-α transcription induced by AraLAMs was blocked by monoclonal antibodies against CD14, an LPS receptor (12Zhang Y. Doerfler M. Lee T.C. Guillemin B. Rom W.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2076-2083Google Scholar). These AraLAM activities dramatically decrease when ManLAMs are used (10Roach T.I. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1886-1896Google Scholar), in agreement with the fact that virulent organisms survive and multiply within the infected macrophages. However, ManLAMs mediate other major specific interactions between immune cells and mycobacteria. It was demonstrated that the ManLAMs from M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG bind selectively to murine and human macrophages through the mannose receptor (13Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930Google Scholar, 14Venisse A. Fournié J.J. Puzo G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 440-447Google Scholar), suggesting that they mediate the binding of these mycobacteria to the alveolar macrophages. More recent data (15Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 227-230Google Scholar) indicate that double negative human CD4− CD8−αβ T-cell lines recognize ManLAMs from M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae presented by human CD1b molecules. All these ManLAM and AraLAM properties disappear after mild alkaline treatment, revealing the key role of the alkali-labile residues (16Barnes P.F. Chatterjee D. Abrams J.S. Lu S. Wang E. Yamamura M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 541-547Google Scholar, 17Sibley L.D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1232-1236Google Scholar). To date, from the ManLAM and AraLAM structural models proposed, these alkali residues are restricted to the fatty acids of the myo-Ins phosphatidyl anchor. However, Hunter and Brennan (18Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Google Scholar) reported the existence of alkali-stable and alkali-labile myo-Ins in the LAMs from H37Ra. The alkali-stable myo-Ins was assigned to the phosphatidyl-myo-Ins anchor located at the nonreducing end of the mannan core. Its structure was completely elucidated by two-dimensional NMR 1H-31P heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy-homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn (HMQC-HOHAHA) experiments, unambiguously establishing that the anchor was part of the LAMs and not due to possible phosphatidylinositol mannoside contamination (3Venisse A. Rivière M. Vercauteren J. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15012-15021Google Scholar). However, the precise location of the alkali-labile myo-Ins phosphate residues as well as their substituent structures were unknown (18Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Google Scholar). Mycobacterium smegmatis is a fast growing mycobacterial strain. A serologically active acidic arabinomannan was purified from M. smegmatis by Weber and Gray (19Weber P.L. Gray G.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 74: 259-278Google Scholar) and was fractioned into phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated molecules. Preliminary structural studies revealed that both forms have similar core structures characterized by 1→5-linked Araf residues attached to O-4 of Arap and 6-O-linked α-D-Manp residues. In the present work, we have undertaken to explore the structure of the LAMs from M. smegmatis obtained by solvent cell wall extraction, using NMR spectroscopy, and more particularly, we address the question of the existence of alkali-stable and alkali-labile myo-Ins phosphates, their substituent structures, and their locations. The extraction and purification of M. smegmatis ATCC 607 AraLAMs were performed as described previously for the ManLAMs from M. bovis BCG (6Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Google Scholar). The M. smegmatis native LAMs monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis show a broad band located around 30 kDa, indicating that LAMs were not contaminated by lipomannans. dAraLAMs were prepared from the crude fraction containing lipoglycan, namely LAMs and lipomannans (60 mg) treated with 0.1 N NaOH for 2 h at 40°C followed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel G75 column eluted by 0.1 N CH3COOH. The dLAM fractions were characterized by GC after hydrolysis and derivatization by a molar ratio of Ara to Man of 1.45:1. Native AraLAMs (10 mg) were submitted to mild alkaline hydrolysis (0.1 N NaOD at 40°C) in an NMR tube, and the reaction was monitored at different times (30 min, 1 h, 1 h 30 min, and 2 h) by 31P one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Then partial acidic hydrolysis of the dAraLAMs was performed with 0.06 N HCl for 15 min at 100°C, and the hydrolysate after cooling was applied on a Bio-Gel P-4 column eluted by water. The collected samples were characterized by gas-liquid chromatography after hydrolysis (2 N trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 100°C) and TMS derivatization. Native AraLAMs (5 mg) were submitted in a NMR tube to partial acidic hydrolysis (0.1 N DCl for 15 min at 80°C). The reaction was monitored by one-dimensional 31P NMR. The products of the reaction were then submitted to mild alkaline hydrolysis (0.1 N NaOD for 1 h at 40°C) with no intermediate purification. AraLAMs were O-methylated three times according to a modified (6Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Google Scholar) procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek (20Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Google Scholar). Per-O-methylated LAMs were hydrolyzed with 2 N trifluoroacetic acidic at 120°C for 2 h, reduced with NaBD4, and acetylated. The alditol acetates were identified by GC/MS and quantified by GC. Table I reveals the presence per LAM molecule of the same ratio of t-Araf units and 3,5-di-O-linked Araf units.Table I.Methylation analysis of AraLAMs from M. smegmatisFull name of the partially methylated alditol acetate derivativeAbbreviated name of the glycosyl residueLAMaAverage values from three experiments.mol%2,3,5-Tri-O-Me-1,4-di-O-Ac-arabinitolt-Araf113,5-Di-O-Me-1,2,4-tri-O-Ac-arabinitol2-O-Linked Araf92,3-Di-O-Me-1,4,5-tri-O-Ac-arabinitol5-O-Linked Araf452-O-Me-1,3,4,5-tetra-O-Ac-arabinitol3,5-Di-O-linked Araf112,3,4,6-Tetra-O-Me-1,5-di-O-Ac-mannitolt-Manp122,3,4-Tri-O-Me-1,5,6-tri-O-Ac-mannitol6-O-Linked Manp53,4-Di-O-Me-1,2,5,6-tetra-O-Ac-mannitol2,6-Di-O-linked Manp7a Average values from three experiments. Open table in a new tab Routine gas chromatography was performed on a Girdel series 30 chromatograph equipped with an OV1 wall-coated open tubular capillary column (25-m length × 0.22-mm inner diameter; Spiral, Dijon, France) using helium gas at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with a flame ionization detector at 310°C. A temperature program from 100 to 280°C at a speed of 3°C/min was used. The injector temperature was 260°C for TMS glycoside analysis. GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5889X mass spectrometer (electron energy, 70 eV) working in both electron impact and chemical ionization modes, coupled with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph series II fitted with an OV1 column (12 m × 0.30 mm). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer equipped with an Aspect X32 computer. Samples were exchanged in D2O (Spin et Techniques, Paris, France; 99.9% purity) with intermediate lyophilization and then dissolved in 99.96 atom % D2O at a concentration of 40 mg/ml for the native LAMs and 6 mg/ml for the dLAMs and analyzed in a 200 × 5-mm 535-PP NMR tubes. 1H Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from the signal for internal 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propane sulfonic acid sodium salt (δH/TMS 0.015). The one-dimensional proton (1H) spectrum was measured using a 30-90° tipping angle for the pulse and 1 s as a recycle delay between each of the 256 acquisitions of 1.64 s. The spectral width of 5005 Hz was collected in 16,000 complex points that were multiplied by an exponential function (LB = 2 Hz) prior to processing to 32,000 real points in the frequency domain. After Fourier transformation, the spectra were base line-corrected with a fourth order polynomial function. The one-dimensional phosphorus (31P) spectra were measured at 202 MHz by employing a spectral width of 25 kHz, and phosphoric acid (85%) was used as the external standard (δP 0.0). The data were collected in 32,000 complex data sets, and an exponential transformation (LB = 5 Hz) was applied prior to processing to 64,000 real points in the frequency domain. All two-dimensional NMR data sets were recorded at 35°C without sample spinning, and data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase increment (TPPI) method (21Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Google Scholar). The two-dimensional HOHAHA spectrum was recorded using a MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 30 ms (22Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). The spin-lock field strength corresponded to a 90° pulse width of 30 μs. The spectral width was 5000 Hz in each dimension. The HOD signal was presaturated for 1 s during the relaxation delay. 1024 spectra of 4096 data points with 16 scans/t1 increment were recorded. 1H-31P and 1H-13C correlation spectra were recorded in the proton-detected mode with a Bruker 5-mm 1H broad band tunable probe with reversal geometry. The single-bond correlation spectra (HMQC) of 1H-13C and 1H-31P were obtained according Bax's pulse sequence (23Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Res. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). The GARP sequence (24Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) at the carbon or phosphorus frequency was used as a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. For the 1H-13C HMQC spectrum, spectral widths of 16,250 Hz in 13C and 4500 Hz in 1H dimensions were used to collect a 4096 × 400 (TPPI) point data matrix with 32 scans/t1 value expanded to 4096 × 1024 by zero filling. The relaxation delay was 1.2 s. A sine bell window shifted by π/2 was applied in both dimensions. The 1H-31P HMQC spectrum was obtained with a 4096 × 80 (TPPI) point data matrix with 64 scans/t1 value. The spectral window was 4003 Hz in F2 dimension (1H) and 810 Hz in F1 dimension (31P). Relaxation delay was 1.2 s. The original data matrix point was expanded to a 4096 × 512 real matrix. The pulse sequence used for 1H-detected heteronuclear relayed spectra (HMQC-HOHAHA) 1H-31P was that of Lerner and Bax (25Lerner L. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1986; 69: 375-380Google Scholar). These spectra were obtained with a 4096 × 80 (TPPI) point data matrix with 64 scans/t1 value. The spectral window was 4003 Hz in F2 dimension (1H) and 810 Hz in F1 dimension (31P). The relaxation delay was 1.2 s, and different experiments were realized with different mixing times. The original data matrix was expanded to a 4096 × 512 real matrix. THP-1 monocyte/macrophage human cell line was maintained as nonadherent cells in continuous culture with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. The purified molecules were added in duplicate to THP-1 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in 24-well tissue culture plates and then incubated for 6 h at 37°C. Stimuli were previously incubated 1 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml polymyxin B (Sigma) known to inhibit the effect of LPS (26Adams L.B. Fukutomi Y. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4173-4181Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were then assayed for TNF using the previously described cytotoxic assay against WEHI164 clone 13 cells (27Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Google Scholar). Each supernatant was tested at two dilutions (1:2 and 1:20) in duplicate. The assay was performed as follows. 50 μl of sample were added to 50 μl of WEHI cells (4 × 105 cells/ml) in flat-bottom 96-well plates. In each experiment, a reference curve was obtained using serial dilutions of human recombinant TNF-α (Life Technologies) starting at 5000 down to 1 pg/ml. After a 20-h incubation at 37°C, 50 μl of tetrazolium salts (1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, Sigma) were added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Formazan crystals were solubilized with 100 μl of lysis buffer (N,N-dimethyl formamide, 30% SDS (1:2) adjusted at pH 4.7 with acetic acid), and optical density was read at 570 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Fig. 1A presents the J-modulated 13C one-dimensional spectrum of the LAMs from M. smegmatis treated in mild alkaline conditions called dLAMs. This spectrum shows the same anomeric carbon resonances as those present in the partial DEPT 13C one-dimensional spectrum of the M. bovis BCG dLAMs (Fig. 1B). However, they differ by their relative intensity in the anomeric as well as in the exocyclic aliphatic carbon regions (not shown). First, the resonances at 103.42 ppm (V1) and 65.77 ppm (V5) (Fig. 1A), assigned to the C-1 and C-5 of t-β-Arafs, are relatively more intense than those of the analogous carbons of the M. bovis BCG dLAMs, so the M. smegmatis LAMs contain relatively more t-β-Araf units than the M. bovis BCG ones. The second major difference is the decrease of the anomeric carbon resonance intensity at δ 101.01 (VII1) (Fig. 1A) assigned to 2,6-di-O-linked α-Manps and maybe to 2-O-linked α-Manps, the latter of which are the ManLAM reporter units. In order to clarify this assignment, the M. smegmatis dLAM 1H-13C HMQC spectrum was recorded (Fig. 2). The C-1 resonance at δ 101.01 (VII1) correlated with one anomeric proton signal at 5.12 ppm, while in the M. bovis BCG dManLAM HMQC spectrum (6Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Google Scholar), this C-1 resonance correlated with two H-1 signals at 5.25 and 5.22 ppm. These protons were assigned to the H-1s of 2,6-di-O-linked α-Manps and 2-O-linked Manps corresponding, respectively, to the Manps from the mannan core and from the manno-oligosaccharide caps. So these data unambiguously reveal the absence of 2-O-linked Manp units in the LAMs of M. smegmatis. Likewise, a single correlation was observed between the M. smegmatis dLAM t-Manp C-1 resonance at 104.93 ppm (IV1) and the anomeric proton at 5.06 ppm. In the case of the M. bovis BCG LAMs, this anomeric carbon correlated with two H-1 signals assigned to the t-Manps from the mannan core and the manno-oligosaccharide caps. So, this result demonstrates that M. smegmatis LAMs contain a single type of t-Manps restricted to the mannan core. Thanks to the 1H-13C HMQC comparative analysis, we propose that the M. smegmatis LAMs are devoid of α-Manp-(1→[2)-α-Manp(1→]n (0 < n < 2) oligosaccharides capping the arabinan side chains and thus belong to the AraLAM class.Fig. 2Expanded region (δ1H 4.85-5.33; δ13C 100.0-111.5) of the 1H-13C HMQC spectrum of M. smegmatis dLAMs. Glycosyl residues are labeled in roman numerals, and their carbons are labeled in arabic numerals.

The one-dimensional 31P spectrum shows two distinct resonances at −0.11 ppm (P1) and −0.35 ppm (P2) with an integration ratio P2:P1 of 4. The P2 and P1 chemical shifts, which are not significantly affected by shifting the pD value from 6 to 10, were assigned to phosphodiester groups (28Henderson T.O. Glonek T. Myers T.C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 623-628Google Scholar). The P1 resonance was tentatively assigned to the anchor phosphate based on the phosphate chemical shift (−0.1 ppm) of the phosphatidyl-myo-Ins anchor of M. bovis BCG ManLAMs (3Venisse A. Rivière M. Vercauteren J. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15012-15021Google Scholar). Moreover, from a previous study the mild alkali-stability of this phosphodiester linkage was established (3Venisse A. Rivière M. Vercauteren J. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15012-15021Google Scholar). Then, in order to support the P1 assignment, the AraLAMs were submitted to mild alkaline hydrolysis (0.1 N NaOD, 40°C), and the reaction products were monitored by one-dimensional 31P NMR spectroscopy. After 30 min of mild alkaline hydrolysis (Fig. 4B), the P2:P1 ratio value decreases from 4 (Fig. 4A) to approximately 1 and remains constant with longer reaction times: 30 min (Fig. 4B) and 2 h (Fig. 4C). These data highlight the presence of three mild alkali-labile phosphate units (P2) and two mild alkali-stable phosphates (P1 and P2). One of the alkali-stable phosphate, probably P1, can be assigned to the anchor phosphate, but the presence of a supplementary and unexpected P2 alkali-stable resonance makes this P1 assignment hazardous. So, to demonstrate the P1 attribution and also to establish the substituent structure of the novel P2 alkali-stable unit, the AraLAMs treated in mild alkaline conditions, namely dAraLAMs, were analyzed by two-dimensional 1H-31P HMQC (Fig. 5b) and 1H-31P HMQC-HOHAHA (Fig. 5c) experiments. The 1H-31P HMQC sequence allows the assignment of the protons borne by the carbons involved in the phosphodiester linkage, while the 1H-31P HMQC-HOHAHA sequence leads to the definition of the substituent spin systems.Fig. 4One-dimensional 31P NMR spectra (δ31P −1.00-1.00) of M. smegmatis AraLAMs (A) and after 30 min (B) and 2 h (C) of mild alkali hydrolysis (0.1 N NaOD, 40°C).

Numerals correspond to the proton number of the two myo-Ins units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The dAraLAM 1H-31P HMQC spectrum (Fig. 5b) provides correlations between the P1 resonance and three well-defined proton resonances at δ 4.16, δ 4.00, and δ 3.94. Since these protons resonate in an overcrowded area, their assignments based on chemical shifts remain hazardous. To overcome this problem, 1H-31P HMQC-HOHAHA spectra were performed with different mixing times. Using a long mixing time (63 ms) (Fig. 5c), the spectrum shows a complex set of correlations. However, the cross-peak at δ 3.39 reveals a well resolved proton resonance correlating on the HOHAHA spectrum (Fig. 5a) with five protons whose chemical shifts and multiplicities agree with a 1-phospho-myo-Ins spin system (Table II). In Table II, it can be seen that the myo-Ins H-1 (δ 4.16), H-2 (δ 4.35), and H-6 (δ 3.87) are downfield-shifted compared with those of the 1-phospho-myo-Ins standard, in agreement with the glycosylation of the myo-Ins at the C-6 by the mannan core and at the C-2 by one single α-D-Manp unit. Moreover, the P1 linkage to the myo-Ins C-1 was supported by the fact that H-1 (δ 4.16) resonates as a pseudodoublet and as a pseudotriplet in the 1H-31P decoupled HMQC-HOHAHA and in the HOHAHA spectra, respectively. The remaining δ 4.00 and δ 3.94 protons from the HMQC spectrum (Fig. 5b) were assigned to the glycerol prochiral H-3 and H-3′, while H-1 and H-1′ are defined from the HMQC-HOHAHA spectrum (Fig. 5c) at 3.70 and 3.73 ppm. The weak intensity cross-peak observed at 3.96 ppm on the HMQC-HOHAHA spectrum, using a short mixing time, reveals a connectivity between P1 and Gro H-2. As expected, it is now clearly established that the alkali-stable P1 corresponds to the phosphate unit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.Table II.myo-Ins proton assignmentSignalδJaJ1,P values of 9.6 (P1) and 9.7 Hz (P2) were measured on the HOHAHA spectrum.Multiplicityδ myo-Ins 1PbData from Refs. 37 and 38.P1P2P1P2ppmHzppmH-14.163.99J1,2 2.22.0Pseudotriplet3.90H-24.35cThe substantial downfield shift (0.1 ppm) suggests that these positions are glycosylated.4.27J2,3 2.22.0Pseudosingulet4.23H-33.613.57J3,4 9.29.9Pseudodoublet3.58H-43.673.67J4,5 9.29.4Triplet3.64H-53.393.34J5,6 9.69.6Triplet3.34H-63.87cThe substantial downfield shift (0.1 ppm) suggests that these positions are glycosylated.3.77J6,1 9.69.7Triplet3.74a J1,P values of 9.6 (P1) and 9.7 Hz (P2) were measured on the HOHAHA spectrum.b Data from 37Cerdan S.

Open table in a new tab The same NMR approach was applied in order to determine the substituent structure of the unexpected alkali-stable P2 resonance. As for P1, the HMQC spectrum shows that P2 correlates with three proton resonances at 4.14, 4.04, and 3.99 ppm (Fig. 5b). The HMQC-HOHAHA experiment reveals a complex pattern of connectivities. Again, the proton at 3.34 ppm, which resonates independently in the one-dimensional 1H spectrum, is attributed to H-5 from a second myo-Ins spin system (δ H-1 3.99; δ H-2 4.27; δ H-3 3.57; δ H-4 3.67; δ H-5 3.34; δ H-6 3.77) (Fig. 5a). Likewise, P2 was found to esterify the second myo-Ins unit at the C-1 position from the multiplicity of H-1 (t, J1,P = J1,6 9.7 Hz) in the HOHAHA spectrum (Fig. 5a). The H-1, H-2, and H-6 protons are upfield-shifted compared with those of P1 myo-Ins resonating at chemical shifts comparable with those of the 1-phospho-myo-Ins standard, establishing that positions C-2 and C-6 are not glycosylated ("
https://openalex.org/W2005861201,"Cytokines regulate cell growth by inducing the expression of specific target genes. We have recently identified a cytokine-inducible, immediate-early gene, DUB-1, that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme with growth regulatory activity. In the current study, we have isolated a highly related gene, DUB-2, that is induced by interleukin-2. The DUB-2 mRNA was induced in T cells as an immediate-early gene and was rapidly down-regulated. Like DUB-1, the DUB-2 protein had deubiquitinating activity in vitro. When a conserved cysteine residue of DUB-2, required for ubiquitin-specific thiol protease activity, was mutated to serine (C60S), deubiquitinating activity was abolished. DUB-1 and DUB-2 proteins are highly related throughout their primary amino acid sequence except for a hypervariable region at their COOH terminus. Moreover, the DUB genes co-localize to a region of mouse chromosome 7, suggesting that they arose by a tandem duplication of an ancestral DUB gene. Additional DUB genes co-localize to this region, suggesting a larger family of cytokine-inducible DUB enzymes. We propose that different cytokines induce specific DUB genes. Each induced DUB enzyme thereby regulates the degradation or the ubiquitination state of an unknown growth regulatory factor, resulting in a cytokine-specific growth response."

Here we report the existence of a second phospholipase D activity, designated PLD2, in yeast cells bearing disruption at the PLD1 locus. PLD2 is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme which preferentially utilizes phosphatidylethanolamine over phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. In contrast to PLD1, the activity of PLD2 is insensitive to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and the enzyme is incapable of catalyzing the transphosphatidylation reaction with short chain alcohols as acceptors. Subcellular fractionation shows that PLD2 localizes mainly to the cytosol, but could also be detected in the particulate fraction. Thus, the biochemical properties of PLD2 appear to be substantially different from those of PLD1. PLD2 activity is significantly and transiently elevated upon exit of wild type yeast cells from stationary phase, suggesting that it may play a role in the initiation of mitotic cell division in yeast. In view of the significantly different properties of PLD1 and PLD2, and because the yeast genome contains PLD1 as the sole member of the recently defined PLD gene family, it may be concluded that PLD2 is structurally unrelated to PLD1.

As a first step toward elucidating the function of Cbl in TCR-initiated signaling, we evaluated the ability of wild-type Cbl or a transforming Cbl mutant (70Z/3) to induce transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) element derived from the interleukin 2 (IL2) promoter in transiently cotransfected Jurkat-TAg T cells. 70Z/3, but not Cbl, caused NFAT activation which was significantly enhanced by stimulation with calcium ionophore, and was drastically reduced by cyclosporin A pretreatment. A point mutation of a potential phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) binding site (Y731EAM to Y731EAC) in 70Z/3 disrupted the association of PI3-K with 70Z/3, but did not reduce the induction of NFAT activity, suggesting that the interaction between Cbl and PI3-K is not required in the 70Z/3-mediated induction of NFAT. Additional mapping studies indicated that defined deletions of C-terminal 70Z/3 sequences affected to a variable degree its ability to stimulate NFAT activity. Strikingly, deletion of 346 C-terminal residues augmented this activity, whereas removal of 20 additional residues abolished it. Coexpression of dominant negative Ras abrogated the basal or ionomycin-stimulated, 70Z/3-mediated NFAT activation, suggesting a functional Ras is required for this activation.

The c-cbl protooncogene is the cellular homologue of v-cbl, a transforming gene of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus. The v-cbl oncogene was generated as a result of a rearrangement between Cas-Br-M virus and a sequence encoding the 355 N-terminal residues of the c-cbl product. This oncogene induces pro-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias in mice (1Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Google Scholar). The 120-kDa product of c-cbl consists of a highly basic N-terminal region, a zinc Ring finger, multiple proline-rich sequences, and several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657Google Scholar). While the transforming v-cbl product can be detected both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, c-Cbl is exclusively cytosolic and lacks transforming activity (3Blake T.J. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 757-762Google Scholar). Another c-cbl mutant isolated from the murine 70Z/3 pre-B cell lymphoma encodes a protein with an internal deletion of 17 amino acids near the zinc Ring finger. This mutation (70Z/3) also activates the transforming potential of c-cbl, and the corresponding protein displays enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation (4Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y.

Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Google Scholar), in activated T cells. Furthermore, ZAP-70 causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in an Lck- and Fyn-dependent manner (30Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Google Scholar), indicating that Cbl may couple ZAP-70 to downstream signaling events during T cell activation. In order to begin to address the role of Cbl in TCR·CD3-mediated signaling, we evaluated the effects of wild-type or a mutated form (70Z/3) of Cbl on the transcriptional activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), using transient transfection assays in Jurkat T cells. NFAT is a transcription factor complex that plays a critical role in the induction of interleukin 2 (IL2) and other cytokine genes, and the two signal requirement for its activation mimicks the requirement for optimal proliferation and IL2 production in TCR·CD3-activated T cells (31Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Google Scholar, 32Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Google Scholar). NFAT-reporter gene activation in transiently transfected T cells has, therefore, been extensively used as a physiologically relevant assay for analyzing molecular events associated with T cell activation. We report that transient overexpression of 70Z/3 (but not wild-type Cbl) induces an increase in the basal activity of NFAT, which is further enhanced synergistically by calcium ionophore. This NFAT induction is dependent on both calcineurin and functional Ras. These results provide evidence that Cbl is involved in Ras-dependent T cell signaling pathways that lead to the transcriptional activation of cytokine genes. The anti-CD3∊ monoclonal antibody (mAb), OKT3, was purified from culture supernatants of the corresponding hybridoma by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Cbl antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAb and a rabbit anti-p85 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA; 12CA5) or anti-Grb2 mAbs were from Boehringer Mannheim and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragments were from Amersham Corp. The cDNAs encoding human c-Cbl, v-Cbl, or the homologue of murine 70Z/3 (representing an internal 17-amino acid deletion of Cbl) were subcloned from the pGEM-2z vector into a mammalian expression vector, pEFneo (33Liu Y.-C. Kawagishi M. Mikayama T. Inagaki Y. Takeuchi T. Ohashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8957-8961Google Scholar) at the EcoRI and XbaI sites to generate pEFneo-Cbl, pEFneo-v-Cbl, and pEFneo-70Z/3, respectively. A sequence encoding an HA tag epitope has been added to the 5′ end of the 70Z/3 cDNA by a standard polymerase chain reaction. A methionine to cysteine mutation at a potential PI3-K-binding motif in Cbl (Y731EAM) was introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a cDNA fragment encoding the Y731EAC mutation and ligation of the product into the TA cloning vector (InVitrogen). The sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing, and the cDNA fragment digested with SnaBI and XbaI was ligated into pEFneo-70Z/3 which has been digested with the corresponding enzymes to create the pEFneo-Y731EAC expression vector. To construct expression plasmids encoding 70Z/3 proteins with successive deletions of their 114, 176, 346, 366, or 456 C-terminal residues, internal restriction sites or a point mutation were used to generate plasmids δ1 (deletion of an EcoRV-XbaI fragment), δ2 (deletion of a SnaBI-XbaI fragment), δ3 (point mutation of the proline-560 codon to a stop codon by polymerase chain reaction), δ4 (deletion of a BglII-XbaI fragment), and δ5 (deletion of a SacI-XbaI fragment), respectively (see Fig. 5A). These deletions removed distinct proline-rich sequences of the protein. The deletion mutants were ligated into the pEFneo vector. The luciferase reporter plasmids, NFAT-Luc and IL2-Luc, were generous gifts from Dr. G. Grabtree; AP-1-Luc and NFκB-Luc were kindly provided by Dr. M. Karin. The dominant negative H-RasN17 plasmid in the pcDNA3 vector was obtained from Dr. H. Wang. Simian virus 40 T antigen (TAg)-transfected human leukemic Jurkat T cells (Jurkat-TAg) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), L-glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells in a logarithmic growth phase were transfected with the indicated amount (usually 10 μg) of Cbl plasmid DNA and 5 μg of the reporter plasmid by electroporation as described previously (22Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Yoshida H. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Google Scholar, 34Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Liu Y.-C. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Google Scholar). The cells were transferred to 24-well plate 24 h later and cultured in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fetal calf serum for 4-6 h. The transfected cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-CD3∊ mAb (OKT3; 10 μg/ml), ionomycin (100 ng/ml), and/or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 10 ng/ml) for another 8-10 h. In some experiments, the cells were treated in triplicate with cyclosporin A (50 ng/ml) for 10 min prior to stimulation. In order to assess the effect of dominant negative Ras, the cells were transfected with a mixture of 5 μg of pEFneo-70Z/3, 10 μg of RasN17, and 5 μg of reporter plasmid DNAs. Similar amounts of the corresponding empty vectors were used as controls in all transfection experiments. Transfected Jurkat-TAg cells were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mM KPO4, pH 7.8, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 min at room temperature. The lysates were then centrifuged (15,000 × g, 5 min), and their protein content was determined in an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Rad microassay. Aliquots of the lysates (30-50 μl) normalized to the same protein concentration were mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer (17.5 mM glycyl-glycine, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 0.135 mM coenzyme A, 0.235 mM luciferin). Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate and expressed as arbitrary units (AU). The standard deviation among triplicates was ≤10%, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and PI3-K enzymatic assays were performed as described previously (22Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Yoshida H. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Google Scholar, 34Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Liu Y.-C. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Google Scholar). To explore whether Cbl or 70Z/3 can transduce signals leading to IL2 gene transcription, we evaluated the effects of cotransfected Cbl or 70Z/3 cDNA on the transcriptional activity of an IL2 promoter-reporter plasmid (IL2-Luc), or reporters corresponding to defined response elements in the IL2 promoter, i.e., NFAT-Luc, NFκB-Luc or AP-1-Luc, in Jurkat-TAg cells. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity following culture in low serum-containing medium and stimulation with ionomycin and/or PMA. As shown in Fig. 1A, when the full-length Cbl was transfected into unstimulated Jurkat T cells, no increase (or a slight decrease) in NFAT activity was observed by comparison with the empty control vector. Similarly, Cbl did not activate NFAT in ionomycin- or PMA-stimulated cells. In contrast, transient overexpression of 70Z/3 induced a ∼3-4-fold increase of NFAT activity in unstimulated cells, and stimulation of the 70Z/3-transfected cells with ionomycin which was minimally active by itself (∼2-fold activation), but not with PMA, resulted in a synergistic effect (∼70-fold NFAT activation). Cbl or 70Z/3 did not cause detectable activation of AP-1, and 70Z/3 overexpression led to only a slight induction of the IL2 promoter and NFκB under unstimulated or stimulated conditions (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the observed difference between Cbl and 70Z/3 was due to different expression levels of the two proteins, we assessed protein expression by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-Cbl antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, transient transfection of Cbl or 70Z/3 increased the intracellular level of a 120-kDa protein which was recognized by anti-Cbl antibody to a similar degree. The 70Z/3 protein could also be detected with an anti-HA antibody, since an HA tag was added to its N terminus (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these results indicate that 70Z/3 is constitutively active in T cells in terms of its ability to induce NFAT-dependent transcription, and synergizes with a Ca2+-dependent signal in this regard. The former observation is consistent with the finding that 70Z/3 can transform fibroblasts (4Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Google Scholar). Calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin dependent phosphatase which plays a critical role in NFAT induction, is a major target for the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 (35O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Google Scholar, 36Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Google Scholar). To determine whether 70Z/3-induced NFAT activation is dependent on calcineurin, the cells were pretreated with cyclosporin A. As shown in Fig. 1C, cyclosporin A blocked the ionomycin-stimulated increase in NFAT activity in cells transfected with the empty vector, as well as the synergistic effect of 70Z/3 plus ionomycin. This suggests that functional calcineurin is required for the 70Z/3-mediated signal which leads to the transactivation of NFAT. Cbl was originally isolated as a product of a transforming viral oncogene (v-cbl). Since both v-Cbl (1Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Google Scholar) and 70Z/3 (4Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Google Scholar) possess transforming activity, we wished to determine whether v-Cbl shares with 70Z/3 the ability to activate NFAT. When cells expressing the NFAT-Luc reporter plasmid were cotransfected with 70Z/3, an increase of 3- and 60-fold in NFAT activity was detected in the absence or presence of ionomycin stimulation, respectively, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1. In contrast, cotransfection with the v-Cbl expression vector failed to stimulate the basal or ionomycin-induced NFAT activity (Fig. 2A). This difference was not due to different expression levels of 70Z/3 and v-Cbl, since immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody revealed similar expression levels of the two transfected proteins (Fig. 2B). Therefore, despite the fact that both v-Cbl and 70Z/3 display transforming activity, only 70Z/3 is capable of activating NFAT, suggesting that transformation by the two proteins involves different mechanisms. TCR·CD3 cross-linking causes rapid tyrosine phophorylation of Cbl which, in turn, leads to an association of Cbl with PI3-K in an activation-dependent manner (5Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar). PI3-K has been implicated in TCR·CD3- and or CD28-mediated signaling events leading to IL2 transcription (37Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Navavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Google Scholar, 38Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Google Scholar). Thus, we wished to address the possibility that an activation-induced Cbl/PI3-K association plays a role in the observed NFAT activation mediated by 70Z/3. Cbl contains two potential PI3-K-binding motifs (39Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar), i.e., Y371CEM and Y731EAM which may mediate binding to the SH2 domain of p85 (17Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Google Scholar). The first of these motifs is deleted in 70Z/3 (4Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Google Scholar). To examine whether the Y731EAM is essential for the interaction between Cbl and PI3-K and, if so, whether this association is required for the 70Z/3-mediated NFAT activation, we mutated the methionine residue in this motif of 70Z/3 to cysteine (Y731EAC). A similar methionine mutation was found to disrupt the association of the CD28 YXXM motif with PI3-K (37Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Navavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Google Scholar). The relative specificity of this point mutation is indicated by the findings that: first, it did not have a global effect on the basal or anti-CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z/3, as revealed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting of the corresponding immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3C); second, the mutation did not appear to have a gross effect on the integrity and/or conformation of the 70Z/3 protein since it could still associate in an activation-independent manner with Grb2 (Fig. 3D), which is known to constitutively associate with Cbl (5Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Google Scholar, 6Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 7Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Google Scholar, 8Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Miyake S Soltoff S. Reedquist K. Druker B. Shoelson S. Cantley L. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3187-3194Google Scholar). Jurkat-TAg cells were transiently transfected with the 70Z/3 expression vectors (or empty vector), and their association with endogenous PI3-K was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation using the anti-HA tag mAb. The results (Fig. 3A) demonstrate that 70Z/3 coimmunoprecipitated with p85 in unstimulated cells, and that the amount of coprecipitated p85 was markedly increased following anti-CD3 stimulation. The lower association in unstimulated cells most likely reflects the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. In contrast, very little association of Y731EAC with PI3-K was observed under the same conditions (panel A), although the expression levels of the two Cbl proteins were equivalent as revealed by anti-HA immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). This result was confirmed by performing an in vitro PI3-K enzymatic assay on the same immunoprecipitates. Thus, anti-HA immunoprecipitates from stimulated, Y731EAC-transfected cells contained a markedly lower PI3-K activity than their counterparts from 70Z/3-transfected cells (Fig. 3E). Together, these results suggest that the Y731EAM motif in 70Z/3 is largely responsible for the interaction with p85. Next, we determined the effect of the 70Z/3 Y731EAC mutation on the 70Z/3-mediated activation of NFAT. The mutant plasmid or 70Z/3 was cotransfected with the NFAT-Luc reporter plasmid into Jurkat-TAg T cells. As showed in Fig. 4A, cell lysates from Y731EAC-transfected cells showed 1.5 to 2 times higher luciferase activity both in resting and ionomycin-stimulated cells than that from 70Z/3-transfected cells. Similar results were consistently observed in a number of repeated experiments. The expression levels of the transfected plasmids were determined by immunoblotting and no apparent difference was detected between 70Z/3 and Y731EAC (Fig. 4B). These data strongly suggest that an optimal interaction between PI3-K and 70Z/3 is not required for NFAT activity induced by the latter. The Effects of C-terminal Deletions on 70Z/3-mediated NFAT Activation-In order to further define the region in 70Z/3 which is responsible for NFAT activation, we focused on the C-terminal region of the protein, since v-Cbl, which corresponds to the 361 N-terminal residues of human c-Cbl, lacked any NFAT-stimulating activity (Fig. 2). The C-terminal region of c-Cbl contains a proline-rich region and several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding 70Z/3 proteins with successive C-terminal deletions were generated (Fig. 5A) and assessed for their ability to activate NFAT in Jurkat-TAg cells by transient cotransfection assays (Fig. 5B). As shown earlier (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), 70Z/3 caused a ∼3-fold increase in the basal NFAT activity and stimulated it by ∼70-fold in the presence of ionomycin, whereas v-Cbl was inactive. Similarly, mutation of the major PI3-K-binding motif (Y731EAC) caused some increase in the corresponding activity. Deletion of 114 or 176 C-terminal residues (δ1 and δ2, respectively) reduced the activity by ∼50% relative to the untruncated 70Z/3. These results suggest that the C-terminal 114 amino acids of 70Z/3 contribute to maximal NFAT activation. Surprisingly, the δ3 construct, in which the 346 C-terminal 70Z/3 residues have been deleted, induced higher basal or ionomycin-stimulated NFAT activity than the untruncated 70Z/3 construct, and deletion of additional 20 (δ4) or 110 (δ5) residues essentially abolished this activity (Fig. 5B). The differences in biological activity among the distinct 70Z/3 constructs did not reflect differences in their expression levels since immunoblotting lysates of the transiently transfected cells with an anti-HA tag antibody revealed similar expression levels of the corresponding proteins (Fig. 5C). The finding that 70Z/3 synergizes with ionomycin to induce NFAT activation was reminiscent of the effect of constitutively active Ras which can also cooperate with ionomycin to induce NFAT or IL2 promoter activity (40Rayter S.I. Woodrow M. Lucas S.C. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 11: 4549-4556Google Scholar, 41Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Google Scholar, 42Baldari C.T. Heguy A. Telford J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8406-8409Google Scholar, 43Woodrow M.A. Rayter S. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3853-3861Google Scholar). To examine whether NFAT activation by 70Z/3 is dependent on functional Ras, we cotransfected Jurkat-TAg cells with combinations of 70Z/3 and/or a dominant negative Ras expression vector (or with the corresponding empty vectors), and assessed the degree of NFAT activation. The 70Z/3-induced NFAT activation was nearly completely inhibited by RasN17 in either resting or ionomycin-stimulated cells (Fig. 6A). The expression level of 70Z/3 was, however, similar in cells cotransfected with the control (pcDNA3) or RasN17 expression vector (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that functional Ras is required for the 70Z/3-mediated activation of NFAT. In the present study, we have demonstrated that 70Z/3, a mutated version of the Cbl protooncogene product, but not wild-type Cbl or v-Cbl, functions in a constitutively active manner to induce NFAT activation in Jurkat T cells and, furthermore, that 70Z/3 acts in synergy with calcium ionophore in this regard. Cyclosporin A, which selectively inhibits the function of calcineurin (35O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Google Scholar, 36Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Google Scholar), as well as dominant negative Ras, blocked both the basal and the ionomycin-stimulated induction of NFAT by 70Z/3. On the other hand, a mutation that markedly reduced the association of 70Z/3 with PI3-K did not impair the activation of NFAT and, in fact, seemed to increase it. These results suggest that Cbl is involved in the TCR·CD3-mediated signaling pathway(s) which ultimately lead to the activation of NFAT, one of the critical transcription factor complexes involved in induction of IL2 and other cytokine genes (31Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Google Scholar, 32Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Google Scholar). Optimal activation of NFAT and the IL2 promoter requires two signals which can be mimicked by agents that increase the free intracellular calcium concentration and activate the protein kinase C/Ras pathway in T cells, respectively (40Rayter S.I. Woodrow M. Lucas S.C. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 11: 4549-4556Google Scholar, 41Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Google Scholar, 42Baldari C.T. Heguy A. Telford J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8406-8409Google Scholar, 43Woodrow M.A. Rayter S. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3853-3861Google Scholar). Constitutively active calcineurin, which can replace the calcium signal, or ionomycin, can each synergize with phorbol ester or constitutively active Ras to induce NFAT activation (41Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Google Scholar, 42Baldari C.T. Heguy A. Telford J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8406-8409Google Scholar). Thus, calcineurin is a major target for the calcium signal involved in NFAT activation and IL2 gene transcription. Our finding that 70Z/3 synergized with ionomycin (but not with PMA) to induce NFAT activation, and that this effect was blocked by cyclosporin A pretreatment (Fig. 1), strongly suggest, therefore, that this constitutively active Cbl can cooperate with calcineurin to provide the requisite signals for NFAT activation. 70Z/3 mimicks in this respect the effects of constitutively active Ras (41Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Google Scholar, 42Baldari C.T. Heguy A. Telford J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8406-8409Google Scholar). The similarity with Ras also extends to the finding that, like Ras (41Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Google Scholar, 42Baldari C.T. Heguy A. Telford J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8406-8409Google Scholar), 70Z/3 synergized with ionomycin (Fig. 1), but not with an anti-CD3 mAb (data not shown), to activate NFAT. This connection between Cbl and the Ras signaling pathway is supported by our finding that dominant negative Ras inhibited almost completely the 70Z/3-induced activation of NFAT, indicating that functional Ras is necessary for NFAT induction in the context of 70Z/3. This finding does not allow us to conclude at present whether Ras acts downstream of 70Z/3, or in a parallel pathway which interacts with a Cbl-dependent pathway, to induce NFAT activation. Recent studies have indicated that, in hematopoietic (5Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Google Scholar, 6Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 17Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Google Scholar) and other (13Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Google Scholar) cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl recruits PI3-K, an interaction that may be mediated by tyrosine-containing YXXM motifs in Cbl and the SH2 domain of p85 (17Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Google Scholar). Since PI3-K may be involved in signaling pathways leading to IL2 production (37Cai Y.-C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Navavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Google Scholar, 38Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine whether PI3-K association with Cbl is required in order for 70Z/3 to activate NFAT. We found that a point mutation of methionine to cysteine in the Y731EAM motif of 70Z/3 reduced the association of 70Z/3 with PI3-K to a minimum, indicating that this motif is largely responsible for the interaction of 70Z/3 with PI3-K. However, this mutation increased the activation of NFAT by 70Z/3, suggesting that activation-dependent recruitment of PI3-K to Cbl is not required for the induction of NFAT. A striking observation in the present study is that the 70Z/3 δ3 mutant, from which 346 C-terminal amino acid residues were deleted, exhibited the highest NFAT-inducing transcriptional activity. Further deletion of only 20 additional amino acid residues (δ4) completely abrogated basal or ionomycin-stimulated NFAT induction. One potential explanation is that the region represented by residues 541-560 in 70Z/3 interacts directly or indirectly with an essential effector involved in NFAT activation, and that removal of more proximal residues (i.e. residues 561-906) facilitates this interaction, perhaps by abolishing other interactions with a negative regulator(s). Alternatively, differences in biological activity among the various constructs represent conformational changes in the structure of 70Z/3, in which case δ3 may have a more favorable conformation for mediating the effector function of Cbl. Since the 70Z/3 deletions remove distinct proline-rich sequences which have been implicated in binding to SH3 domains of other proteins (5Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S.

Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Google Scholar), it is possible that interactions with SH3-containing signaling proteins are a major target for the functional effects of these deletions. This possibility is currently being analyzed. What is the molecular mechanism by which the constitutively active Cbl mutant, 70Z/3, affects the transcriptional regulation of NFAT? The finding that 70Z/3, but not wild-type Cbl, can mediate this event suggests that amino acid residues 366-383 (which have been deleted in 70Z/3) regulate negatively the function of Cbl or its association with effector proteins, and that their removal unmasks the ability of Cbl to activate NFAT. This is compatible with the findings that the same deletion activates the transforming potential of Cbl (4Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Google Scholar). The notion of a negative regulatory activity associated with Cbl is supported by the recent finding that a Cbl homologue, Sli-1, negatively regulates vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans, a process which is known to be initiated by a homologue of the epidermal growth factor receptor via a tyrosine kinase- and Ras-dependent signaling pathway (45Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Google Scholar). The internal deletion may activate Cbl directly, or indirectly by abolishing an interaction between Cbl and a putative negative regulator that binds to the deleted region. It is possible that this activity can also be unmasked by an undefined physiological signal which leads to Cbl activation during T cell activation. In any event, recent findings that Cbl functions as an adapter protein and associates with many signaling proteins suggest that Cbl-associated proteins may act as intermediate effectors to transduce signals from Cbl which lead to induction of NFAT, and perhaps other transcriptional elements involved in T cell activation. Our findings open the way for further studies to directly investigate the mechanism by which Cbl acts to regulate signaling pathways initiated by immune recognition receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1515375727,"Reductive unfolding of disulfide-containing proteins can be experimentally dissected into two distinct stages. In the presence of denaturant and thiol catalyst, native proteins unfold by reshuffling their native disulfides and convert to a mixture of scrambled structures. Subsequent reduction of the disulfide bonds of scrambled proteins requires only mild concentration of reductant (0.2-0.5 mM reduced dithiothreitol) and undergoes intermediates that consist of highly heterogeneous disulfide isomers. These properties have been characterized with three cystine-containing proteins, namely hirudin, tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP), and bovine ribonuclease A. In the cases of hirudin and TAP, most intermediates observed during the oxidative folding were found to exist along the pathway of reductive unfolding as well.

Fiebig K.M. Yee D.P. Thomas P.D. Chan H.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 561-602Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). The challenge stems primarily from the difficulty of analyzing the transient intermediates involved in these pathways. For proteins containing disulfide bonds, unfolding and refolding are generally followed by reduction and oxidation of the native disulfides (8Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Scopus (5107) Google Scholar, 9Haber E. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1839-1844Google Scholar). Since breaking and formation of disulfide bonds can be chemically trapped and characterized (10Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 83-106Google Scholar), the disulfide unfolding and folding pathways can thus be constructed on the basis of the heterogeneity and structures of the trapped intermediates (11Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 411-431Google Scholar, 12Scheraga H.A. Konishi Y. Ooi T. Adv. Biophys. 1984; 18: 21-41Google Scholar, 13Creighton T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unfolding of a disulfide-containing protein can be achieved conventionally by either reduction of disulfide bonds in the absence of denaturant (reductive unfolding) (11Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 411-431Google Scholar, 15Li Y.-J. Rothwart D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Google Scholar, 16Creighton T.E.

Nature. 1992; 358: 302-307Google Scholar, 19Houry W.A. Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 495-503Google Scholar). In the latter case, the unfolded protein retains intact native disulfides. So far, the pathway of reductive unfolding has been investigated with limited numbers of proteins (11Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 411-431Google Scholar, 15Li Y.-J. Rothwart D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Google Scholar, 20Creighton T.E. Goldengerg D.P. J. Mol.

These data, however, were largely obtained from the reductive unfolding performed in the absence of denaturant (11Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 411-431Google Scholar, 15Li Y.-J. Rothwart D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Google Scholar). During our recent analysis of the properties of scrambled hirudins (24Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25661-25666Google Scholar), we have observed that denaturant and reductant can actually be applied in a two-step manner to unfold native protein. In an alkaline solution including strong denaturant and thiol catalyst, the native protein unfolds to form a mixture of scrambled species that admit mostly non-native disulfides but still retain the intact number of disulfide bonds. This is followed by reduction of the disulfides of scrambled proteins. This approach is distinguished from the conventional techniques described above. In this study, this new method was applied to characterize the unfolding pathways of three disulfide-containing proteins, namely hirudin (3 disulfides), tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) 1The abbreviations used are:TAPtick anticoagulant peptideRNase Aribonuclease AGdmClguanidine hydrochlorideDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. (3-disulfides), and ribonuclease A (RNase A) (4 disulfides). The disulfide folding pathways of hirudin and TAP have been analyzed in our laboratory (25Chatrenet B. Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Google Scholar, 26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar). Many well populated folding intermediates of hirudin and TAP were isolated and structurally characterized (26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar, 27Chang J.-Y. Schindler P. Chatrenet B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11992-11997Google Scholar). Demonstration of whether those folding intermediates exist as well along the unfolding pathway will be crucial to our understanding of the relative mechanism of their folding/unfolding. Most importantly, this two-stage mechanism offers a unique insight into the intertwining dependence of the disulfide bonds and non-covalent forces that stabilize the native structure. tick anticoagulant peptide ribonuclease A guanidine hydrochloride dithiothreitol high performance liquid chromatography. Hirudin (65 amino acids, CGP-39393) and tick anticoagulant peptide (60 amino acids, TAP) were recombinant proteins produced by Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In the case of hirudin, only the core domain, residues 1-49, was used for the study of unfolding and folding. The core domain of hirudin was prepared by selective removal of its C-terminal tail by chymotrypsin digestion (28Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22159-22166Google Scholar) Ribonuclease A (RNase A) was obtained from Sigma. GdmCl, reduced dithiothreitol, and β-mercaptoethanol were products of Merck with purity greater than 99%. The native protein (1 mg/ml) was incubated in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mMβ-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of GdmCl. The unfolding was carried out at 23°C for 16 h. Samples were then trapped by mixing with double volumes of 4% trifluoroacetic acid or by reaction with iodoacetic acid (0.2 M) for 20 min. Unfolded samples were analyzed by HPLC. End products contain a mixture of the native and scrambled species that exist in a state of equilibrium. Calculation of the equilibrium constant is based on the relative recoveries of scrambled proteins (collective) and the native protein. For hirudin and TAP, this can be readily determined from HPLC peak integration since the native hirudin and TAP are well separated from their scrambled isomers (see Fig. 1). The identity of native hirudin and TAP was also confirmed by their inhibitory activity as well as theromolysin-digested peptide mapping. In the case of RNase A, direct quantification was not possible due to the overlapping of the native and scrambled RNase A. This was overcome by additional experiments described in the following: unfolded samples of RNase A were removed from denaturant and β-mercaptoethanol by gel filtration (NAP-5 column, eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The samples were freeze-dried, reduced with 0.5 mM DTT in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.4) for 20 min, and subsequently analyzed by HPLC. Under this mild reducing condition, the native RNase A remained intact, but scrambled RNase A were quantitatively converted to the fully reduced species (see Fig. 4). The relative concentrations of the native and fully reduced (equals scrambled) RNase A can, therefore, be accurately determined for each unfolded sample.Fig. 4Reduction of scrambled RNase A in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.4) containing 0.5 mM of DTT. The reaction was performed at 23°C. HPLC conditions were as those described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Scrambled proteins, prepared by the method described above (stage I), were separated from the denaturant and β-mercaptoethanol by passing the sample through an NAP-5 column. Scrambled hirudin and TAP were further purified by HPLC. Reduction of scrambled proteins was performed at 23°C in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.4) containing varying concentrations of DTT (0.2-4 mM). The protein concentration was 1 mg/ml. The reaction was carried out both in the absence and presence of 6 M GdmCl. Reduced samples were trapped in a time course manner by mixing aliquots of the sample with 2 volumes of 4% trifluoroacetic acid. The native protein (1 mg/ml) was treated with different concentrations of DTT (5-200 mM) in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.4). Reduction was carried out at 23°C. Unfolding intermediates were trapped by mixing aliquots of the reaction sample with 2 volumes of 4% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by HPLC analysis. The disulfide content of scrambled proteins was determined by the dabsyl chloride pre-column derivatization method (29Chang J.-Y. Knecht R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 52-58Google Scholar), which permits direct quantification of the disulfide bonds of proteins. The MALDI mass spectrometer was a home-built time of flight (TOF) instrument with a nitrogen laser of 337 nm wavelength and 3 ns pulse width. The apparatus has been described in detail elsewhere (30Boernsen K.O. Schaer M. Widmer M. Chimia. 1990; 44: 412-416Google Scholar). The calibration was performed either externally or internally, by using standard proteins (hypertensin, M.W. 1031.19; synacthen, 2934.50, and calcitonin, 3418.91). The unfolding/folding intermediates were analyzed by HPLC using the conditions described in the legend of Fig. 1. In the presence of denaturant and trace concentration of thiol reagent (0.25 mMβ-mercaptoethanol), unfolding of the native protein was accompanied by reshuffling of the native disulfides, which led to the formation of scrambled structures. Under these conditions, β-mercaptoethanol functioned as a thiol catalyst instead of reducing agent, and the unfolded proteins retained negligible residues of free cysteine. An example of time course unfolding of hirudin in the alkaline solution containing 8 M GdmCl and β-mercaptoethanol (0.25 mM) is shown at the left column of Fig. 1. The unfolding reaction reached a plateau within about 4-5 h, and in this case, 85% of the native hirudin was unfolded and denatured. Prolonged incubation of up to 24 h or further replenishment of thiol catalyst neither altered the composition nor improved the yield of scrambled hirudins, suggesting that the native and scrambled hirudins had reached a state of equilibrium. Using this method, hirudin, TAP, and RNase A were unfolded in the presence of varying concentrations of GdmCl. The results are presented at the middle and right columns of Fig. 1. The extent of unfolding, and hence the equilibrium constant (Keq) between scrambled species and the native protein, was shown to be dependent upon the strength of denaturant (Table I). In addition, there exist narrow ranges of the concentration of denaturant in which native proteins precipitously unfold. For instance, in between 1 and 3 M GdmCl, the equilibrium constant of unfolding of RNase A increased from <0.05 to >100. The same phenomenon was observed with TAP at 3-5 M GdmCl. These critical concentrations of denaturant appear to resemble “melting point” at which forces of non-covalent interactions that stabilize the native proteins become abruptly nullified.Table I.Equilibrium constant of scrambled proteins and the native protein in the presence of various concentrations of GdmClGdmCl1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 MHirudin<0.01ND0.110.300.671.433.05.25TAPaND, not determined.ND<0.05<0.100.904.7516.028.0NDRNase A<0.011.0>100>100>100>100NDNDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab All scrambled proteins contain intact numbers of disulfide bonds. Free cysteines or mixed disulfides with β-mercaptoethanol have not been detected. These were confirmed by amino acid composition analysis and MALDI mass spectroscopic analysis of unfolded species that were treated with 0.1 M iodoacetic acid. The composition of scrambled proteins are heterogeneous. For hirudin and TAP that contain 3 disulfides, there exists 14 possible scrambled isomers. Eleven species of scrambled hirudins have been isolated and structurally characterized (27Chang J.-Y. Schindler P. Chatrenet B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11992-11997Google Scholar). Similar numbers of scrambled TAP were identified as well (26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar). In the case of RNase A, there are 104 possible scrambled isomers. Complete separation of these isomers will be a daunting task. It is not possible to estimate how many isomers of scrambled RNase A do exist since they are poorly separated by the HPLC conditions employed here. However, if the cases of hirudin and TAP are any indication, scrambled RNase A could be very heterogeneous as well. It is relevant to mention that the selection of 0.25 mMβ-mercaptoethanol has been concluded from a systematic study of unfolding performed at 6 M GdmCl and varied concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol. The end products (after 16 h of unfolding) were carboxymethylated, followed by amino acid composition analysis and molecular mass analysis. The results reveal that the optimized concentration of β-mercaptoethanol ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 mM. At higher concentration of β-mercaptoethanol, the disulfide bonds of proteins may become partially reduced (data not shown). The disulfide bonds of scrambled proteins were reduced with varying concentrations of DTT (0.2-4 mM). The reactions were trapped in a time-course manner, and intermediates that appeared along the course of reduction were analyzed by HPLC. The results obtained from the reduction of scrambled hirudins, both in the absence and presence of denaturant, are shown in Fig. 2. Using 0.5 mM DTT, complete reduction of scrambled hirudins was achieved within 20 min. The reaction undergoes complex intermediates that consist of 2- and 1-disulfide species. Judging from the HPLC pattern, the composition of these unfolding intermediates are indistinguishable from those found along the pathway of oxidative folding of hirudin (25Chatrenet B. Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Google Scholar, 31Chang J.-Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 643-6640Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate of reductive unfolding and the composition of unfolding intermediates are largely unaffected by the presence of 6 M GdmCl (Fig. 2), suggesting that 2- and 1-disulfide intermediates adopt minimal structural elements of non-covalent interactions that are sensitive to the denaturant. These data are consistent as well with that observed during the process of oxidative refolding of fully reduced hirudin in which the compositions of 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates are not affected by the presence of denaturant. Reduction of scrambled TAP also proceeds via heterogeneous 2- and 1-disulfide isomers. However, the patterns of 2- and 1-disulfide unfolding intermediates are visibly influenced by denaturant (Fig. 3), an indication that some of the 2- and 1-disulfide species of TAP must be stabilized by non-covalent interactions. Those stabilizing factors, however marginal, are also reflected by a roughly 2-fold increase of the rate of reduction when the reaction was carried out in the presence of 6 M GdmCl. Again, the composition of unfolding intermediates of scrambled TAP can not be distinguished from that observed along the course of oxidative folding of fully reduced TAP, both with or without the participation of denaturant (26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar). Scrambled RNase A could be similarly reduced and the unfolding intermediates also comprise highly heterogeneous species (Fig. 4) The most striking outcome is that disulfide bonds of three different sets of scrambled proteins exhibit very similar stability against DTT reduction. All of them could be fully reduced by 0.5-1 mM DTT within 10-20 min at room temperature (23°C). The stability of scrambled disulfides is also comparable with the inter-disulfide bond that cross-links two intact hirudin monomers (32Chang J.-Y. Grossenbacher H. Meyhack B. Märki W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 53-56Google Scholar). In the absence of denaturant, it needs high concentration of reducing agent to break the native disulfides. For example, complete reduction of the three native disulfides of hirudin requires incubation with 100 mM DTT for longer than 2 h. Thus, the native disulfides of hirudin are approximately 500-fold more stable against reduction than non-native disulfides of scrambled hirudins. However, unlike their scrambled counterparts, the stability of native disulfides varies substantially among these three proteins. Judging from the concentration of DTT required to achieve the same kinetics of full reduction, the native disulfides of RNase A were about 8-fold and 64-fold more stable than that of hirudin and TAP, respectively (Fig. 5). These differences apparently reflect the extent of contribution of non-covalent interactions of individual proteins. When the factors of non-covalent forces are largely abrogated, as in the state of scrambled structures, the stability of disulfide bonds (against reduction) become more or less indistinguishable. It is important to point out that the order of stability of native proteins exhibited by their resistance against reduction (RNase A > hirudin > TAP) (Fig. 5) differs from that measured against denaturant (hirudin > TAP > RNase A) (Table I). For instance, the native disulfide bonds of RNase A are about 64-fold more stable than those of TAP. On the other hand, complete denaturation of TAP requires double concentration of GdmCl (5-6 M) as compared with that needed for RNase A (3 M). This discrepancy is probably related to the nature of non-covalent interactions (e.g. the number of hydrogen bonds, etc.). While non-covalent interactions can be added up collectively to enforce the stability of a disulfide bond against reduction, their own stability in the presence of denaturant may not behave in the same fashion. Examination of time course-trapped samples shows that reduction undergoes an apparent all or none mechanism in which only trace amounts of partially reduced intermediates accumulate. This phenomenon was observed with all three proteins at DTT concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 mM. With hirudin and TAP, about 1-4% of 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates was indeed detectable (Fig. 5). In the case of RNase A, two fractions of intermediates comprising approximately 5-15% of the total protein were observed (Fig. 5). Molecular mass analysis of carboxymethylated derivative has revealed that these two minor fractions contain mostly 3-disulfide RNase A. These two intermediates may correspond to those observed by Scheraga and colleagues (15Li Y.-J. Rothwart D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the concentration of these intermediates is related to the efficiency of the trapping agent (15Li Y.-J. Rothwart D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, the level of their accumulation has not exceeded 15% of the total protein in repeated experiments despite the fact that acid trapping represents one of the most efficient methods in quenching the disulfide formation and rearrangement (16Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 305-329Google Scholar). An “all or none” mechanism suggests that the reduction of the first disulfide bond exists as a rate-limiting step. Following breakdown of the first disulfide, the remaining cystines become precipitously reduced. This phenomenon thus implies that disulfides of a protein are stabilized in a cooperative and concerted manner by the non-covalent forces of the folded structure. However, it must be emphasized that this mechanism does not represent a general property for disulfide-containing proteins. For large proteins or those consisting of multiple domains, it is most likely that stability of disulfides will reflect their local structures that are strengthened by varied degrees of non-covalent interactions. Many disulfide-containing proteins, even small proteins, are known to be reduced in a sequential manner (21Kuwajima K. Ikeguchi M. Sugawara T. Hiraoka Y. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8240-8249Google Scholar, 33Kress L.F. Laskowski Sr., M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4925-4929Google Scholar, 34Wan-kyng L. Meienhofer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 467-473Google Scholar, 35Hollecker M. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 409-437Google Scholar). The reality is that the pathway of disulfide reduction for most proteins probably lies in between the strict mode of all or none and sequential. The reduction of human antithrombin III is a typical example (36Sun X.-J. Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11288-11293Google Scholar). Even hirudin, demonstrated here, does not follow an absolute all or none mechanism because of the presence of approximately 2% of intermediates. Furthermore, the mode of reduction, either proceeding via a sequential manner or undergoing an all or none mechanism, bears crucial implications in interpreting the structure and function relationship of disulfide bonds. In searching for the functional role of disulfide bonds, proteins are generally treated with reducing agent in the absence of denaturant. Partially reduced proteins are irreversibly trapped by alkylation (e.g. carboxymethylation). The remaining biological activity of the modified protein is then correlated to the residual number of disulfides, conventionally determined by amino acid composition analysis. If the surviving numbers of disulfides and biological activity display a close to linear relationship, interpretation of the data will be dependent upon the mode of disulfide reduction. Take TAP as an example. It has been shown that reduction of one-third of the disulfide bonds of TAP results in a loss of approximately one-third of its biological activity (37Sardana M. Sardana V. Rodkey J. Wood T. Ng A. Vlasuk G.P. Waxman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13560-13563Google Scholar). In case that disulfide reduction proceeds sequentially, this data would suggest that the intactness of one specific disulfide bond accounts for one-third of the biological function of the protein. In case that reduction undergoes an all or none pathway, then it is obvious that the modified protein contains two-thirds of the intact species and one-third of the fully reduced species that lack inhibitory activity. The data obtained here together with those observed by Sardana et al. (37Sardana M. Sardana V. Rodkey J. Wood T. Ng A. Vlasuk G.P. Waxman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13560-13563Google Scholar) clearly indicate that TAP belongs to the latter case. Since the native protein can be fully reduced both in the absence and presence of denaturant, one important question is whether these two types of fully reduced proteins adopt the same extent of unfolding. Here, we have attempted to partly answer this question by comparing their refolding behaviors. These experiments were designed to examine whether the sample reduced without denaturant retains residual native-like, non-covalent structures that are not abrogated simply by the breakdown of disulfide linkages. If this is the case, one may expect it to refold with increased efficiency and decreased heterogeneity of intermediates, as compared with that unfolded in the presence of denaturant. Two types of fully reduced hirudins, that unfolded either by reduction alone (R) or by reduction in the presence of 6 M GdmCl (R), were allowed to refold in the same alkaline buffer both in the presence and absence of thiol catalyst. The mechanism of their folding was compared by characterizing acid-trapped intermediates. Analysis of the time course-quenched intermediates shows that folding of both reduced species (R and R) undergoes an initial stage of nonspecific disulfide formation that leads to the formation of scrambled 3-disulfide species as essential folding intermediates (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). When folding was carried out in the buffer alone (Fig. 6), about 70% of the sample became permanently trapped at scrambled structures and unable to convert to the native structure due to the lack of free thiol to catalyze the reshuffling of non-native disulfides. As folding was performed in the presence of thiol catalyst, the extent of accumulation of scrambled species significantly reduced along the pathway and the native hirudin was quantitatively recovered (Fig. 7). The data clearly demonstrate that both reduced hirudins refold with comparable efficiency and via the same complexity of intermediates. Indeed, the sample reduced in the absence of denaturant refolds at a slightly slower rate. This difference of kinetics was consistently observed with three repeated experiments. These results thus strongly indicate that the sample unfolded without denaturant adopts no unique element of structure that would facilitate its refolding. However, one can not rule out the possibility that some native-like interactions may be retained, but they need to be broken and remade during the process of refolding. This can well explain why it refolds slightly slower than that unfolded in the presence of denaturant.Fig. 7Quantitative analysis of various disulfide species along the folding pathways of fully reduced hirudins. a, refolding of R in the Tris-HCl buffer alone (original chromatograms are shown at the left column of Fig. 6). b, refolding of R in the Tris-HCl buffer alone (original chromatograms are shown at the right column of Fig. 6). c, refolding of R in the Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.25 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. d, refolding of R in the Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.25 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. ▪, N; □, III; ▵, I + II; ○, R.

This is then followed by disulfide reshuffling of scrambled species in the presence of thiol catalyst to attain the native structure (25Chatrenet B. Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Google Scholar, 26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar, 31Chang J.-Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 643-6640Google Scholar). This two-stage mechanism of oxidative folding can be experimentally reversed during the process of reductive unfolding, as demonstrated here. In the presence of denaturant and thiol catalyst, the native protein unfolds back to the state of scrambled structures. Subsequent reduction of scrambled protein generates the fully reduced species. Thus, both unfolding and folding are accomplished by a sequential abrogation (unfolding) or formation (folding) of the two major structures that stabilize the native protein, namely the non-covalent specific interactions and the disulfide bonds. The flow chart of folding and unfolding pathways of hirudin and TAP, and conditions that influence kinetics of these pathways are outlined in Fig. 8. Most intermediates observed during the oxidative folding exist along the pathway of reductive unfolding as well. Indeed, the composition of 1- and 2-disulfide species that appeared during the first stage of folding (✪ of Fig. 8) is indistinguishable from those found at the second stage of unfolding (❹ of Fig. 8). This holds for both hirudin and TAP. However, the composition of 3-disulfide scrambled intermediates is distinguishable along the two opposite pathways. These differences are shown in Fig. 9. Some scrambled species that are well-populated along the direction of folding become diminished along the route of unfolding. This is because unfolding that leads to the scrambled intermediates has to be performed in the presence of denaturant. Scrambled species that are denaturant-sensitive presumably adopt structural elements that are stabilized by non-covalent interactions. These structures still remain to be elucidated. Even if they are native-like, their existence appears to bear no direct link to the native disulfides since most denaturant-sensitive scrambled species do not contain any native disulfide (24Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25661-25666Google Scholar, 26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar). Species f (Fig. 9) of scrambled TAP is a vivid example. The concentration of species f decreases from 30% of the total scrambled TAP in the absence of denaturant (folding) to less than 3% in the presence of 6 M GdmCl (unfolding). Yet, species f contains three non-native disulfides (26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar). Disulfides are known to enforce the stability of native proteins (16Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 305-329Google Scholar, 38Villafranca J.E. Howell E.E. Voet D.H. Strobel M.S. Ogden R.C.

Sci. 1987; 12: 478-482Google Scholar). Most disulfide-containing proteins lose essentially all of their biological activity as well as their tertiary structures when disulfide bonds are ruptured by reduction (41Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Google Scholar). Even with exceptional cases (42Lehle K. Wrba A. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 276-284Google Scholar) in which partial activity remains after complete disulfide reduction, the stability of their native conformation usually becomes drastically diminished (43Lehle K. Kohnert U. Stern A. Popp F. Jaenicke R. Nature Biotechnology. 1996; 14: 476-480Google Scholar). Less certain is how disulfide bonds interact with non-covalent structures to stabilize the folded native conformation (40Wetzel R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 478-482Google Scholar, 44Pace N.C. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 3: 1-43Google Scholar). The data of reductive unfolding, together with those obtained from the oxidative folding of hirudin and TAP (25Chatrenet B. Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Google Scholar, 26Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Google Scholar), may have provided an important insight into the intertwining dependence of the disulfide bonds and non-covalent forces. These crossing dependences, based on those observed in the cases of hirudin and TAP, are summarized in the following. During the process of folding, 1) the non-covalent interactions do not actively drive or direct the folding until non-native scrambled disulfides are formed; and 2) on the other hand, conversion of scrambled disulfides to the native disulfides is driven and guided by the non-covalent interactions. Under conditions in which non-covalent interactions are abrogated (e.g. in the presence of strong denaturant), scrambled structures accumulate as the end products because they are unable to convert to the native structure. While during the process of unfolding, 3) nullifying the non-covalent interactions by denaturant, the native disulfides will collapse into a mixture of scrambled disulfides; and 4) breaking the native disulfides directly by reducing agent, the non-covalent interactions will be incapable of maintaining their native structure and will eventually disintegrate. These findings are fundamentally consistent with the hypothesis (40Wetzel R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 478-482Google Scholar, 45Johnson R.E. Adams P. Rupley J.A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1479-1484Google Scholar, 46Schulz G.E. Schrimer R.H. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1979: 27-65Google Scholar) that asserts that the primary role of disulfide bonds is to cross-link the protein at its unfolded state, to decrease and limit the entropy allowed to the unfolded structure, and thus help shift the unfolding/folding equilibrium to the favor of the native structure. For proteins like hirudin and TAP, the force of non-covalent interactions alone is apparently insufficient to drive the unfolded protein to cross the energy barrier and guide the way to attain the native conformation. Furthermore, once it assumes the native structure, it still needs the constant support of disulfide bonds. The author thanks Drs. T. Hawthorne and W. Maerki for supplying the recombinant TAP and support of this study."

In this study, we showed that the hemolysin interacted with immobilized phospholipids and cholesterol and formed oligomers in vesicles constituted from phospholipids alone with a stoichiometry identical to those produced in rabbit erythrocyte membrane. However, the hemolysin bound to glycoproteins with terminal β1-galactosyl residues and an association constant of 9.4 × 107M−1 was estimated for the hemolysin-asialofetuin complex by solid phase binding assay. Oligomerization of the hemolysin in lipid bilayer converted the sugar-binding monomer to a lectin with strong carbohydrate-dependent hemagglutinating activity accompanied by inactivation of hemolytic activity and loss in ability to interact with phospholipids. There was no evidence for erythrocyte surface carbohydrates playing an essential role in interaction of the hemolysin with the cell. However, specific glycoproteins inhibited hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes as well as interaction of the hemolysin with phospholipid. The results suggest (i) V. cholerae hemolysin is a monomer with distinct domains associated with specific binding to carbohydrates and interaction with lipids, (ii) the pore-forming property depends solely on the protein-lipid interaction with no evidence for involvement of sugars, and (iii) specific sugars can down-regulate the ability of the hemolysin to form pores in lipid bilayers.

Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium that produces cholera, a severe diarrheal disease of humans (1Kaper J.B. Morris Sr., J.G. Levine M.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 48-86Google Scholar). In addition to cholera toxin (1Kaper J.B. Morris Sr., J.G. Levine M.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 48-86Google Scholar), the critical enterotoxigenic factor of V. cholerae, the organisms generally express a protein that induces lysis of erythrocytes and other mammalian cells (2Honda T. Finkelstein R.A. Infect. Immun. 1979; 26: 1020-1027Google Scholar). The excreted form of this protein, the hemolysin, was purified and characterized as a monomer with a native molecular weight of 60,000 (3Yamamoto K. Al-Omani M. Honda T. Takeda Y. Miwatani T. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 192-196Google Scholar), cloned (4Goldberg S.L. Murphy J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 239-244Google Scholar), and sequenced (5Rader A. Murphy J.R. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1414-1419Google Scholar). The purified protein causes accumulation of fluid in a ligated rabbit ileal loop (6Ichinose Y. Yamamoto K. Nakasone N. Tanabe M.J. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1090-1093Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein is potentially capable of contributing to the enterotoxigenicity of V. cholerae (7Williams S.G. Attridge S.R. Manning P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 751-760Google Scholar). Experiments on the mode of action of V. cholerae hemolysin on the erythrocyte membrane indicated that the protein forms transmembrane anion-selective oligomeric channels with a diameter of 0.9-1.0 nm, leading to colloid osmotic swelling of the cell and lysis (8Krasilnikov O.V. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Zitzer A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 7-16Google Scholar, 9Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Google Scholar). A similar mechanism involving insertion of the monomeric cytolysin in the membrane lipid bilayer and lateral oligomerization by diffusion in the bilayer plane to a channel-like assembly with a hydrophobic outer and hydrophilic inner surface was earlier proposed for pore-forming cytolysins in general (10Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 225-228Google Scholar) and demonstrated for a wide range of cytolytic proteins such as Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (11Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Google Scholar). Since events leading to membrane permeabilization are reproduced in artificial lipid bilayers constituted from phospholipids alone (8Krasilnikov O.V. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Zitzer A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 7-16Google Scholar, 12Ikigai H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2156-2160Google Scholar), nonlipid constituents of the membrane such as proteins and carbohydrates do not appear to be critically involved in the process. However, there is evidence which indicates that glycoconjugates do affect pore-forming activity of cytolysins. For example, S. aureus α-toxin is inhibited by GM1-ganglioside (13Kato I. Naiki M. Infect. Immun. 1976; 13: 289-291Google Scholar) and band 3 anion transport glycoprotein of the erythrocyte membrane (14Maharaj I. Fackrell H.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1980; 26: 524Google Scholar), and Aeromonas hydrophila hemolysin is inactivated by erythrocyte membrane glycopeptides (15Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1662-1667Google Scholar). These observations suggest that specific carbohydrates might regulate the interaction of the cytolysins with membrane bilayers and their oligomerization behavior. However, the possible existence of a carbohydrate-dependent regulatory mechanism for a primarily lipid-mediated process has not been studied or even recognized. In this study, we have showed that V. cholerae hemolysin is a lectin-like protein with a preference for the terminal β1-galactosyl moiety of glycoproteins. Our results provided evidence that specific glycoconjugates can regulate the self-assembly of the hemolysin in the erythrocyte membrane and artificial lipid bilayers. V. cholerae strain V2 used for the isolation of the hemolysin was a clinical non-01 isolate, a generous gift from R. Sakazaki, Tokyo, Japan. Brain heart infusion (dehydrated medium) was from Difco. Glycoproteins, enzymes, lectins, and sugars were from Sigma. Chromatographic matrices, gel electrophoresis chemicals, and standard protein molecular weight markers were from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden. V. cholerae non-01 V2 was cultured in brain heart infusion broth at 37°C with shaking for 18 h. Bacteria were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the culture supernatant was concentrated 50-fold by filtration through a PM-10 membrane (Amicon). Lipid-protein vesicles in the ultrafiltrate were removed by sedimentation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was fractionated by 50% saturation with (NH4)2SO4, and the crude hemolysin was subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (38 × 1.6 cm) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6 (buffer A). The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of buffer A, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear 0-60% ethylene glycol gradient. Fractions with hemolytic activity eluted as a sharp peak at 30% ethylene glycol concentration and were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and applied on a Bio-Gel P-100 column (39 × 1.6 cm) equilibrated with 100 mM NaCl in buffer A. The elution volume of the hemolysin corresponded to a molecular weight of 60,000 as determined by calibrating the column with a mixture of bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, and lysozyme. Column eluates were monitored for protein concentration by absorbance at 280 nm and assayed for hemolytic activity. Homogeneity of the preparation was examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCphosphatidylcholinePBSphosphate-buffered salinePEphosphatidylethanolamineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. under native and denaturing conditions. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphatidylcholine phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylethanolamine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The oligomeric form of the hemolysin was isolated by incubating the purified hemolysin monomer (1 mg) with 5 ml of a suspension of phosphatidylcholine (PC)-cholesterol (1:1 by weight) vesicles showing a turbidity of 2.0 at 600 nm for 2 h at 25°C. The hemolysin that was not incorporated into lipid vesicles and remained free in aqueous solution was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The hemolysin oligomer entrapped in liposome was dispersed in 1% sodium deoxycholate in buffer A and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 (39 × 1.6 cm). The hemolysin oligomer eluted in the void volume and was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) for removal of the detergent. The hemolyic activity was assayed by monitoring spectrophotometrically the release of hemoglobin at 541 nm or the decrease in turbidity of the erythrocyte suspension at 650 nm (16Rowe G.E. Welch R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 657-666Google Scholar). The hemagglutinating activity was monitored visually. Rabbit erythrocytes were desialylated by incubating the cell suspension (10% v/v) in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 45 mM sodium acetate, 120 mM NaCl buffer, pH 6.0, with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (Sigma; 1 unit/ml) for 60 min at 37°C. Desialylated erythrocytes were washed and incubated in the same buffer with galactose oxidase (Sigma; 5 units/ml) for 2 h at 37°C (17Morrell A.G. Ashwell G. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 205-208Google Scholar). Desialylation of erythrocytes and subsequent degradation of cell surface galactose residues were confirmed by expected changes in agglutinability of cells with peanut agglutinin (18Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8518-8523Google Scholar). A mixture (1:1 by weight) of PC and cholesterol was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, dispersed in PBS, and sonicated for 10 min at 23 kHz (Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor, Microson, Secfroid). Multilamellar vesicles were centrifuged off at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein was estimated by a modified Folin-Ciocalteu method (19Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Beilur L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) in a 12.5% or 4-20% linear polyacrylamide gradient gel. Desialylation of glycoproteins was performed by incubation in 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM CaCl2 buffer, pH 5.5, with C. perfringens neuraminidase (1 unit/5 mg) for 1 h at 37°C and monitored by estimation of sialic acid by the thiobarbituric acid method (21Warren L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1971-1975Google Scholar). Periodate oxidation of asialofetuin was carried out by incubating the glycoprotein (10 mg) in 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, with 25 mM sodium metaperiodate at 4°C for 22 h in the dark followed by decomposition of the excess periodate by ethylene glycol (22Spiro R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 26-52Google Scholar). Antiserum to the purified hemolysin was raised by injecting male albino rabbits intramuscularly with 100 μg of the protein emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco) followed by three booster injections of 100 μg of protein alone at an interval of 10 days. Animals were bled 4 days after the last injection. Binding of the purified hemolysin to immobilized asialofetuin and lipids was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) described previously (23Saha N. Banerjee K.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 758-764Google Scholar). Wells of polystyrene microtiter plates (Corning) were coated in triplicate with glycoprotein (1 μg/100 μl of PBS) or lipids (1 μg/100 μl of methanol) by overnight incubation at 4°C. They were washed thrice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and free sites were blocked with 200 μl of defatted milk powder (3% in PBS), washed, and incubated with various concentrations of the hemolysin for 2 h at 25°C. Wells were decanted and washed as above. The hemolysin bound by the immobilized glycoprotein or lipids was estimated by sequential incubation with rabbit anti-hemolysin antiserum and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Nonspecific interaction was minimized by including in the incubation mixture defatted milk powder (1%). Color was developed with o-phenylenediamine and monitored at 492 nm. Wells coated with defatted milk powder served as blanks. Purified V. cholerae hemolysin induced 50% hemolysis of a 1% suspension of rabbit erythrocytes at a concentration of 33 ng/ml. As expected for a process dependent on self-aggregation of monomers (10Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 225-228Google Scholar), the equilibrium value of the percent hemolysis showed sigmoidal dependence on the hemolysin concentration and was sensitive to the amount of protein within a rather narrow concentration range from 30 to 40 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). The time course of hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes was relatively more sensitive to the concentration of the hemolysin, with a lag phase that increased sharply with decreasing hemolysin concentration (Fig. 1B). V. cholerae hemolysin showed erythrocyte species preference, although not very pronounced, with rabbit erythrocytes being 6- and 8-fold more sensitive than human and sheep cells, respectively. As reported by earlier workers (9Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Google Scholar), the hemolysin inserted itself in the rabbit erythrocyte membrane and formed oligomers that migrated in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 240,000 when incubated with SDS at 60°C (Fig. 1C). Insertion of the hemolysin in the membrane and subsequent oligomerization to an SDS-stable tetramer was also observed in PC-cholesterol (Fig. 1D, lane 6) as well as PC vesicles (Fig. 1D, lane 5). Since vesicles constituted from PC alone could effectively mimic the role of erythrocyte membrane in inducing oligomerization of the hemolysin, the process did not require participation of nonlipid constituents of the biomembrane. The interaction of hemolysin with immobilized cholesterol as determined by an ELISA-based assay (Fig. 1E) was significantly stronger than that with PC or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). However, the extent of difference did not suggest a marked discrimination of polar head groups of the lipids by the protein. The hemolysin oligomer formed in PC-cholesterol vesicles was isolated by solubilization of the protein-lipid complex in 1% sodium deoxycholate followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 in the presence of the detergent. The oligomer, unlike the monomer that was stable indefinitely at 4°C, tended to precipitate in aqueous solution in storage and showed polydispersity during size exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B (not shown), indicating nonstoichiometric aggregation of the oligomers. The oligomer had no hemolytic activity toward rabbit erythrocytes at a concentration as high as 1 mg/ml. Absence of hemolytic activity of the protein corresponded with complete loss of ability to interact with immobilized PC, PE, or cholesterol (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, the hemolysin oligomer agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes strongly at a concentration of 10 ng/ml and human or sheep erythrocytes at about a 200-fold higher concentration. Although monosaccharides such as mannose, glucose, galactose, L-fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine were noninhibitory at a concentration of 100 mM, fetuin and calf thyroglobulin, glycoproteins with multiple galactose-containing asparagine, and serine/threonine linked sugar units (25Sharon N. Lis H. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins.Academic Press. 1982; Vol. 5: 1-124Google Scholar) inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the oligomer (Table I). Ovalbumin or bovine pancreatic DNase, each of which contains a single oligomannosidic unit devoid of galactose (25Sharon N. Lis H. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins.Academic Press. 1982; Vol. 5: 1-124Google Scholar) did not inhibit the oligomer (Table I). Inhibitory activities of fetuin and thyroglobulin increased 10-20-fold by exposure of the penultimate β1-galactosyl moiety by desialylation (Table I). Treatment of asialofetuin with periodate, which selectively degrades the terminal galactose residue (26Spiro R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 26-52Google Scholar) led to complete loss of inhibitory activity (Table I). These observations demonstrated that agglutination of erythrocytes by the hemolysin oligomer involved binding to carbohydrate receptors, with the protein displaying a distinct preference for terminal β1-galactosyl residue of complex glycoconjugates. Oligomerization of the hemolysin to a hemagglutinating lectin suggested that the monomer, although incapable of agglutinating erythrocytes by cross-linking apposing cells apparently due to lack of multivalency, might itself be endowed with carbohydrate-binding activity. The hemolysin bound to asialofetuin with an association constant of 9.4 × 107M−1 as determined by the Scatchard plot (27Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 48: 270-299Google Scholar) of the ratio of the bound to the free hemolysin against bound hemolysin (Fig. 2A) but not to ovalbumin or periodate-treated asialofetuin, which lack terminal β1-galactosyl moiety (not shown). Further, binding of the hemolysin to asialofetuin was partially reversed by preincubation of the protein with galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine but not by mannose (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of immobilized asialofetuin with peanut agglutinin, a lectin specific for terminal β1-galactosyl moiety of glycoconjugates (18Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8518-8523Google Scholar), led to a significant decrease in binding to the hemolysin (Fig. 2C). Concanavalin A (28Goldstein I.J. Hollerman C.E. Smith E.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 876-883Google Scholar) did not affect the binding of asialofetuin to the hemolysin under similar conditions. Identification of the hemolysin as a lectin-like protein specific for glycoconjugates with terminal β1-galactosyl residues suggested that it might be capable of binding to erythrocyte surface carbohydrate receptors. In order to see whether this sugar-specific interaction was a prerequisite for induction of hemolysis the potential carbohydrate receptors for the hemolysin were blocked by the hemolysin oligomer as well as the peanut agglutinin. Although the time course of hemolysis was somewhat affected, as indicated by a marked shortening of the prelytic period, the equilibrium value of percent hemolysis was not affected (Fig. 3A) suggesting that binding of the hemolysin to carbohydrate receptors was not essential for insertion of the protein in the membrane bilayer and subsequent oligomerization to a channel. Neuraminidase-treated rabbit erythrocytes that possessed an increased surface density of glycoconjugates with terminal rather than penultimate β1-galactosyl residue were significantly less sensitive to the hemolysin than untreated cells in kinetics as well as equilibrium value of percent lysis (Fig. 3B). The sensitivity of neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes could be restored to that of the untreated cells by selective degradation of β1-galactosyl moiety (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that interaction of the hemolysin with its cell surface carbohydrate ligand was functionally unproductive. It seems, therefore, that cell surface carbohydrates contributed to the resistance of erythrocytes to the pore-forming action of the hemolysin. Although hemolysis did not require binding to cell surface carbohydrate receptors, specific glycoproteins inhibited the hemolytic activity of V. cholerae hemolysin. Asialofetuin and asialothyroglobulin, but not ovalbumin or periodate-treated asialofetuin, caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate of lysis (Fig. 3C), indicating that inhibition of hemolysis involved specific binding of the hemolysin to β1-galactosyl moiety of glycoproteins. Since the hemolysin preincubated with asialofetuin migrated in Sephacryl S-300 as a lytically active monomer, the inhibition by glycoproteins did not arise from sugar-induced oligomerization of the hemolysin to lytically inactive aggregates. The results seemed to imply that carbohydrates inhibited a process that did not require binding of the protein to carbohydrate receptors. That this was indeed so was clearly indicated by the inhibition of interaction of the hemolysin with immobilized PC by asialofetuin but not by periodate-treated asialofetuin (Fig. 3D). This result implied that glycoproteins with terminal β1-galactosyl moiety inactivated the hemolysin by inducing transition of the protein to a form incapable of interacting with lipid bilayers rather than by competing with cell surface carbohydrate receptors. In this communication, we showed that V. cholerae hemolysin is a lectin-like protein that binds to glycoproteins with terminal β1-galactosyl moiety. As observed with other pore-forming cytolysins (10Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 225-228Google Scholar), the hemolytic activity of the protein depends on its interaction with membrane lipids that lead to formation of oligomeric pores by lateral collision in the bilayer plane. Specific glycoproteins inhibit V. cholerae hemolysin by inducing conversion of the protein to a form incapable of inserting itself in lipid bilayers rather than by competing with erythrocyte surface carbohydrate receptors. Inhibition of hemolysis by glycoproteins is, therefore, mechanistically different from that of well characterized lectin-induced cellular events like agglutination of erythrocytes and mitogenesis of lymphocytes (29Nicolson G.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1974; 39: 89-190Google Scholar). While the biological function of a lectin is usually a sequel to its ability to interact specifically with cell surface sugars, the sugar-binding property of V. cholerae hemolysin appears to be involved in regulating a function not dependent on interaction of the protein with sugars. A regulatory rather than functional role for carbohydrates might also resolve the apparent inconsistency in the finding that, although S. aureus α-toxin was inactivated by the erythrocyte membrane band 3 glycoprotein (14Maharaj I. Fackrell H.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1980; 26: 524Google Scholar), the sensitivity of erythrocytes to lysis was not correlated with the amount of the band 3 glycoprotein in the membrane (30Harshman S. Bondurant M. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 114-118Google Scholar). A mechanistically similar regulation of the carbohydrate-independent interaction of concanavalin A with pure PC vesicles by methyl α-mannoside was reported earlier (31Boldt D.H. Speckhart S.F. Richards R.L. Alving C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 208-214Google Scholar) and was attributed to a sugar-induced conformational change in the protein (32Cuatrecasas P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1312-1323Google Scholar, 33Richardson C.E. Behnke W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 102: 441-451Google Scholar). The hemolysin oligomer that forms transmembrane diffusion channels in artificial lipid bilayers (8Krasilnikov O.V. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Zitzer A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 7-16Google Scholar) and erythrocyte membrane (9Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Google Scholar) aggregated in water to a polydisperse mixture and adsorbed to phenyl-Sepharose matrix with an affinity that could be neutralized at an ethylene glycol concentration of 80% 2N. Saha and K. K. Banerjee, unpublished observation. compared to 30% required for the desorption of the hemolysin monomer under similar conditions. Apparently, the presence of a lipid bilayer-spanning apolar domain in the hemolysin oligomer (10Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 225-228Google Scholar) contributed to the increased global hydrophobicity. However, the oligomer, in contrast to the monomer, failed to insert itself in the erythrocyte membrane or to bind to immobilized phospholipids (Fig. 1E). These observations would suggest that a relatively small domain of the hemolysin monomer was involved in mediating the interaction of protein with lipids. We have not characterized biochemically or genetically the site(s) of the hemolysin molecule involved in interaction with lipids and glycoproteins. They appear to be associated with distinct domains of the protein for the following reasons. (i) Oligomerization of the monomer abolished lipid-binding activity without essentially affecting the sugar-binding property, and (ii) it is unlikely from considerations of steric complementarity as well as types of noncovalent forces involved in binding of protein to sugars and lipids for the same molecular domain of the protein to interact with these two classes of compounds. These considerations suggest that lipids bind to the active or functional site of the hemolysin and glycoproteins to the regulatory site. Two classes of rabbit erythrocyte surface sites may likewise be distinguished, pore formation or hemolysis sites represented by exposed patches of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayer and agglutination sites represented by sugar moieties of glycoproteins or glycolipids. While the oligomeric form of the hemolysin binds to carbohydrate receptors only leading to agglutination, the monomeric form of the hemolysin is potentially capable of interacting with both these sites. Glycoprotein-induced conversion of the hemolysin to a lytically inactive form incapable of interacting with lipid bilayers suggested that cell surface sugars might contribute to the insensitivity of erythrocytes to the hemolysin by causing a decrease in the effective concentration of the hemolysin available for productive interaction with phospholipid cholesterol bilayer leading to pore formation. This contention was corroborated by the inverse correlation between susceptibility of rabbit erythrocytes to V. cholerae hemolysin and the surface density of glycoconjugates specifically recognized by the hemolysin (Fig. 3B). Similar considerations may explain the decrease in the rate of insertion of S. aureus α-toxin in phospholipid-GM1-ganglioside liposome with increasing glycolipid content (34Buckelew A.R. Colacicco G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 7-16Google Scholar). Although pore-formation process is facilitated by a high concentration of the inserted monomer in the membrane bilayer (Fig. 1B) (9Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Google Scholar, 10Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 225-228Google Scholar), kinetics of the overall process and especially the length of the lag phase are regulated primarily by membrane events that include diffusion of the monomer in the bilayer plane and self-aggregation by lateral collision (10Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 225-228Google Scholar, 12Ikigai H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2156-2160Google Scholar). These events are highly sensitive to parameters that affect the property of the membrane bilayer matrix as a diffusional medium (12Ikigai H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2156-2160Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that the shortening of the prelytic period of hemolysis on preincubation of erythrocytes with lectins (Fig. 3A) was due to perturbation of the membrane bilayer induced by cross-linking of glycoconjugate receptors by multivalent lectins (29Nicolson G.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1974; 39: 89-190Google Scholar), rather than due to suppression of an abortive interaction of the hemolysin with sugars. Biological relevance of the sugar-binding property of V. cholerae hemolysin has not been considered in this communication. Recent reports suggest that the lectin-like function of a protein does not necessarily determine its interaction with cell surface. For example, discoidin I, a galactose-specific lectin of cellular slime mold, binds to cells by a carbohydrate-independent mechanism similar to those mediated by fibronectin (35Springer W.R. Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Cell. 1984; 39: 557-564Google Scholar). The sugar-binding function of the protein is, however, involved in correct localization and exocytosis of the protein in the presence of specific oligosaccharides (36Barondes S.H. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins, Properties, Functions and Applications in Biology and Medicine.Academic Press. 1986; : 467-491Google Scholar). Export of proteins by Gram-negative bacteria to the extracellular milieu requires passage through lipid barriers of the outer and inner membranes. Since V. cholerae hemolysin is excreted in a monomeric, lytically active form, it must have evolved a mechanism to arrest premature self-aggregation to a lytically inactive form during exposure to lipid bilayers of bacterial membranes. This is, perhaps, true of pore-forming cytolysins in general. Recently, it has been found by genetic studies that an oligosaccharide sequence of the lipopolysaccharide mediates prevention of premature aggregation of Escherichia coli α-hemolysin (37Stanley P.L.D. Diaz P. Bailey M.J.A. Gygi D. Juarez A. Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 781-787Google Scholar), suggesting that specific bacterial glycoconjugates might mimic the role of molecular chaperones (38Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Google Scholar). Evidence from genetic studies also indicates that the membrane insertion and trimerization behavior of E. coli porins (39Sen K. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 926-928Google Scholar) and the localization of IcsA, an outer membrane protein responsible for intracellular spread of Shigella flexneri (40Sandlin R.C. Lampel K.A. Keasler S.P. Goldberg M.B. Stolzer A.L. Maurelli A.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 229-237Google Scholar), are regulated, by an unknown mechanism, by the oligosaccharide moiety of lipopolysaccharide. The observations suggest that these outer membrane proteins may have lectin-like functions that might serve, in the presence of appropriate glycoconjugates, as information necessary for targeting them to the correct destinations. Further study may elucidate the biological significance of sugar-binding motif of a protein that does not appear to be designed to mediate its cognitive interaction with cell surface carbohydrates."

To determine the domain of PKC-δ that is responsible for this isotype-specific function, cDNAs that encode reciprocal chimeras of PKC-δ and -∊ (PKC-δ∊ and PKC-∊δ) were constructed by exchanging regulatory and kinase domains using polymerase chain reaction technology. Both chimeras were stably expressed in 32D cells using the pLTR expression vector and displayed protein kinase activity upon TPA treatment.

The oxidative force of DsbA (E′0 = −125 mV) mainly results from the low pKa of 3.4 of its Cys30 thiol. To investigate the role of the kink and the electrostatic contribution of Glu37 and Glu38 to the redox properties of DsbA, we have characterized a series of DsbA variants (δ38-40, δ38-40/H41P, E37Q, E38Q, and E37Q/E38Q). In contrast to theoretical predictions, the redox potentials of the variants are almost unchanged, and the pKa values of Cys30 do not differ by more than 0.5 units from that of DsbA wild type. All variants show the same in vivo activity and dependence of redox potential on ionic strength as the wild type. The mutations have no influence on the polypeptide specificity of the protein, which is independent of the isoelectric point of the polypeptide substrate and most pronounced at acidic pH.

We conclude that neither the kink in the active-site helix nor Glu37 and Glu38 are critical for the physical properties of DsbA. DsbA is a soluble, monomeric 21.1-kDa protein (189 amino acids) that is required for efficient disulfide bond formation in the periplasm of Escherichia coli (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Google Scholar, 2Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Google Scholar). The enzyme contains a single, catalytic disulfide with the active-site sequence Cys30-Pro31-His32-Cys33. DsbA-catalyzed disulfide bond formation in the periplasm of E. coli involves two steps. First, the disulfide form of DsbA oxidizes reduced, folding substrate proteins. In the second step, DsbA becomes reoxidized by a disulfide exchange reaction with DsbB, a protein located in the inner E. coli membrane (3Bardwell J.C.A. Lee J.-O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D.

The three-dimensional x-ray structure of oxidized DsbA (7Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Google Scholar) has revealed that the enzyme possesses the thioredoxin fold, which is common to all known structures of disulfide oxidoreductases (8Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Google Scholar). In addition to its thioredoxin domain, DsbA possesses a second domain of 76 residues, which is inserted into the thioredoxin motif and exclusively consists of α-helices (7Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The biophysical characterization of DsbA has shown that the enzyme is the strongest known oxidant within the disulfide oxidoreductase family (12Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Google Scholar, 13Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Google Scholar) and oxidizes thiol compounds extremely rapidly (13Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Google Scholar, 14Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Google Scholar, 15Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5202-5211Google Scholar, 16Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3576-3587Google Scholar). In addition, DsbA specifically reacts with reduced, unfolded polypeptides, which can be explained by the presence of a polypeptide binding site (14Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Google Scholar, 15Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5202-5211Google Scholar, 16Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3576-3587Google Scholar, 17Frech C. Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 392-398Google Scholar). DsbA is thus ideally suited as final oxidant of protein disulfides in the periplasm. The physical properties of DsbA are linked to the pKa of the nucleophilic thiol of Cys30, which is extremely low and has a value of 3.5 compared with pKa values of about 9 for normal cysteine side chains (18Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Google Scholar). On the one hand, the low pKa of Cys30 can explain the fact that the oxidized form of DsbA is about 20 kJ/mol less stable than its reduced form at neutral pH (13Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Google Scholar, 19Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Google Scholar) when one assumes that the oxidation of DsbA is nothing but the removal of the negative charge on the Cys30 thiol (18Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Google Scholar). On the other hand, the low pKa explains the high rate constants of disulfide exchange reactions involving DsbA (18Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Google Scholar, 20Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Google Scholar). The interdependence of the redox potential, the stability difference, and the pKa value of Cys30 has recently also been demonstrated by Grauschopf et al. (21Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Google Scholar) for a series of DsbA variants with amino acid replacements in the dipeptide sequence between the active-site cysteines. In the known structures of disulfide oxidoreductases, the active-site disulfide is located at the amino terminus of an α-helix (8Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Google Scholar). Interestingly, no positively charged residue is located in the vicinity of the Cys30 side chain in the structure of DsbA that could explain its low pKa. It was therefore postulated that the helix dipole as well as the amino acid composition of the active-site helix may be responsible for stabilizing the negative charge on Cys30 (18Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Google Scholar, 22Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 799-812Google Scholar). In addition, electrostatic calculations suggested that the side chains of Glu37 and Glu38 as well as the backbone conformation of residues 38-40 have an influence on the redox properties and the low pKa value of the Cys30 thiol (23Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Google Scholar, 24Warwicker J. Gane P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 105-108Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of the active-site helices of DsbA, thioredoxin, and glutaredoxin shows that the active-site helix of glutaredoxin is straight, whereas the corresponding helices in DsbA and thioredoxin are kinked (Fig. 1, B and C). In DsbA, the kink is about 60° and appears to be caused by the insertion of the tripeptide Glu38-Val39-Leu40. The active-site helix of thioredoxin has a kink of about 30°, which is caused by a conserved proline residue at the corresponding position. In this study, we address the question of whether the residues that cause the kink in the active-site helix of DsbA are responsible for the unusual biophysical properties of the enzyme. For this purpose, we have constructed a DsbA variant in which the tripeptide insertion was deleted (δEVL), as well as a double variant, where His41 was additionally replaced by proline (δEVL/H41P) to mimic the active-site helices of glutaredoxin and thioredoxin, respectively. Since the kink in the active-site helix may also determine the orientation of the catalytic disulfide relative to the peptide binding site, we have investigated the influence of the mutations on the polypeptide specificity of DsbA. Since Glu37 and Glu38 may contribute electrostatically to the pKa of Cys30 and are part of an unusual acidic patch on the surface of DsbA (7Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Google Scholar), we replaced these residues by glutamines in another set of variants. 1,4-Dithio-DL-threitol (DTT), 1The abbreviations used are: DTT1,4-dithio-DL-threitolIPTGisopropyl-β-D-thiolgalactosideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidWTwild typeGdmClguanidinium chloride. reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), sodium succinate, amino acids, ampicillin, dithionitrobenzoic acid, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside, and polymyxin B sulfate were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and maltose were from ICN, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was from AGS GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany), DE52- and CM52-cellulose were purchased from Whatman (Maidstone, United Kingdom), and phenyl-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). All other chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and of highest purity available. The strain THZ2 was kindly provided by T. Zander (University of Regensburg, Germany). 1,4-dithio-DL-threitol isopropyl-β-D-thiolgalactoside 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid wild type guanidinium chloride. For construction and expression of the dsbA mutants, the phasmid pDsbA2 was used, where the dsbA gene is under control of the trc promotor and its periplasmic expression is inducible by IPTG. pDsbA2 was derived from the previously described expression plasmid pJW1717 (21Grauschopf U.

Single-stranded DNA was obtained after transformation of E. coli CJ236 and infection with the helper phage M13KO7 (25Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar, 27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) using the kit supplied by Bio-Rad.

Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Google Scholar) harboring the respective expression plasmids were grown in 2 × YT medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37°C. After induction with 1 mM IPTG at an optical density of 1.0 (546 nm), the cells were grown for 12 h at room temperature. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (10 mM MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mg/ml polymyxin-B-sulfate; 2 ml/g wet cells), stirred for 1 h at 4°C, and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (periplasmic extract) was dialyzed against buffer A (10 mM MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0) and applied to a DE52-cellulose column (15 ml). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml) from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in buffer A. Fractions containing DsbA were pooled, adjusted to 1.2 M ammonium sulfate and pH 8.0 by the addition of 4 M ammonium sulfate and 1 M Tris, respectively, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (15 ml). The column was washed stepwise with 1.2 and 0.8 M ammonium sulfate in buffer B (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM sodium chloride). The protein was eluted by a linear gradient (125 ml) from 0.8 M ammonium sulfate in buffer B to 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing DsbA were dialyzed against 10 mM acetic acid/NaOH, pH 4.5 (buffer C). The protein was applied to a CM52 column (15 ml) and eluted by a linear gradient (500 ml) from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in buffer C. Fractions containing pure DsbA were dialyzed against distilled water and stored at −20°C. The molecular mass of each variant was confirmed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (error ≤1 Da). The correct amino termini of the variants E37Q, E38Q, and E37Q/E38Q were also confirmed by Edman sequencing of residues 1-45. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (native, oxidized DsbA: ∊280 = 23,300 M−1 cm−1) (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). All purified DsbA variants were obtained in the oxidized form, as shown by the lack of free thiol groups (29Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Google Scholar). The dsbA mutants were tested for their ability to complement the phenotypes of E. coli dsbA− strains, namely the lack of motility (30Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Google Scholar) and the ability to express functional β-galactosidase in the periplasm (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Google Scholar). For all assays, E. coli THZ2 (see above; 21Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Google Scholar) was used. Motility assays were performed at 37°C on 0.3% agar plates containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and either rich medium (2 × YT) or minimal medium supplemented with all amino acids except cysteine and cystine (31Griffey R.H. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 817-822Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was tested at 37°C on indicator plates containing one of the above media, supplemented with 0.4% maltose, 0.004% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside, 1.5% agar, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Far- and near-UV CD spectra were measured at 25°C on a Jasco 710 CD spectropolarimeter in 0.02- and 1-cm quartz cuvettes, respectively. Protein concentrations of 35 μM in 1 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM sodium sulfate, pH 7.0, were used. Samples with reduced DsbA contained 100 μM DTT. For unfolding, proteins (50 μM in distilled water) were diluted 1:50 with degassed 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA containing different concentrations of GdmCl and incubated at 25°C for 3 days. In the case of reduced DsbA, DTT (1 mM) was included. For refolding experiments, DsbA was denatured at concentrations of 50 μM in 4 M GdmCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA (additionally containing 50 mM DTT in the case of reduced DsbA) for 1 h at room temperature prior to the 1:50 dilution. The transitions were followed by the fluorescence at 365 nm and at 327 nm for oxidized and reduced DsbA, respectively (excitation at 280 nm), using a Hitachi F-4000 spectrofluorimeter. Data were evaluated according to a two-state equilibrium with a six-parameter fit as described previously (19Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Google Scholar, 32Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar). The redox potentials were determined fluorimetrically by measuring the equilibrium constant between DsbA and glutathione, assuming no significant equilibrium concentrations of DsbA/glutathione mixed disulfides (12Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Google Scholar). DsbA (1 μM) was incubated under a nitrogen atmosphere with 0.1 mM GSSG and different concentrations of GSH (0.003-3 mM) in 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7, 1 mM EDTA for 20 h at 25°C. The relative amount of reduced DsbA at equilibrium (R) was measured using the specific DsbA fluorescence at 332 nm (excitation at 280 nm). The equilibrium constant (Keq) was determined by fitting the data to the equation, R = ([GSH]2/[GSSG])/(Keq+ ([GSH]2/[GSSG])). The redox potential was calculated using the Nernst equation and a value of −240 mV as the standard redox potential of glutathione (33Rost J. Rapoport S. Nature. 1964; 201: 185Google Scholar). The pKa values of the thiol group of Cys30 were measured by the increase in absorbance at 240 nm upon formation of the thiolate (18Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Google Scholar). Oxidized DsbA was used as a reference. For preparation of reduced DsbA, the protein (0.15 mM in distilled water) was reduced by incubation with DTT (0.5 mM) for several minutes. DTT was removed by gel filtration on a PD 10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 10 mM K2HPO4, 10 mM boric acid, 10 mM sodium succinate, 1 mM EDTA, and 200 mM potassium chloride (pH 8). The reference (oxidized DsbA) was subjected to the same gel filtration procedure. The pH titration was performed with an initial DsbA concentration of 20 μM and an initial volume of 2 ml. The pH was lowered by the stepwise addition of 20-50 μl of 0.1 M HCl, and A240 and A280 were recorded for 10 s, averaged, and corrected for the volume increase. Since A280 proved to be essentially independent of pH the value of (A240, red/A280, red)/(A240, ox/A280, ox) was used to measure the fraction of the thiolate anion. Data were fitted according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. As a measure of the peptide specificity of DsbA, we used the factor by which it oxidizes reduced hirudin and RNaseA faster than the small dithiol DTT. Reduced, unfolded RNaseA and hirudin were prepared essentially as described by Wunderlich et al. (14Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Google Scholar) and Otto and Seckler (34Otto A. Seckler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 67-73Google Scholar), except that gel filtration was performed in 1 mM HCl, 200 mM KCl. Oxidized DsbA (1 μM) was reacted with reduced, unfolded RNaseA, hirudin, or DTT (100 μM total concentration of free thiols, pseudo-first-order conditions) at 25°C in 20 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM boric acid, 20 mM sodium succinate, 200 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM EDTA (adjusted with HCl to pH 4-10). The reaction was followed by the increase in DsbA fluorescence (λex = 295 nm; λem≥ 305 nm) on a SX-17MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). In principle, the fluorescence increase of DsbA only detects the formation of the DsbA/substrate mixed disulfide, since previous investigations had shown that the mixed disulfide between glutathione and DsbA (at Cys30) exhibits the same fluorescence characteristics as reduced DsbA. 3M. Huber-Wunderlich and R. Glockshuber, manuscript in preparation. However, the intramolecular attack of the mixed disulfide is very rapid. Therefore, the measured apparent rate constants should be identical with the overall rate constant of DsbA reduction. As reported previously (14Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Google Scholar), the fluorescence increase upon reduction with DTT was fully consistent with a second-order reaction. This was verified by the linear dependence of the apparent pseudo-first-order rate constants on DTT concentration. In the case of reduced polypeptide substrates, we assumed identical reactivities of all thiols in the beginning of the reaction (0-20% of final signal change), since DsbA randomly oxidizes polypeptides (14Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Google Scholar). To avoid errors due to decreased reactivities of buried thiols in folding intermediates, the initial velocities were used to calculate the apparent second-order rate constants for the reaction with hirudin and RNaseA. We used the E. coli strain THZ2 lacking the chromosomal dsbA gene as host for expression and phenotypic characterization of the dsbA mutants. The in vivo activity of the dsbA mutants was tested in the absence of IPTG by the ability of the corresponding expression plasmids to complement the dsbA− phenotypes of E. coli THZ2. The strain THZ2 is immotile due to its inability to form disulfide bridges in the P-ring protein of the flagellar motor (30Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Google Scholar). Cells of E. coli THZ2 transformed with any of the plasmids containing dsbA mutants showed normal motility on soft agar comparable with the dsbA wild type gene. THZ2 also harbors a gene encoding the MalF-β-galactosidase 102 fusion protein that only results in a Lac+ phenotype in the absence of disulfide bond formation in the periplasm (1Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Google Scholar, 3Bardwell J.C.A. Lee J.-O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 21Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Google Scholar). All dsbA mutants also restored disulfide bond formation in the periplasm and caused inactivation of β-galactosidase. The in vivo activities of the dsbA mutants were not quantified further. The results of the assays were identical on rich medium and on minimal medium supplemented with all amino acids except cysteine and cystine. Hence, disulfide compounds of the growth medium can almost certainly be excluded as oxidants, and the DsbA variants are likely to be reoxidized by DsbB with an efficiency similar to the wild type. DsbA WT and its variants were purified from periplasmic extracts by anion exchange chromatography on DE52-cellulose, hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, and cation exchange chromatography on CM52-cellulose. The yields of the purified, oxidized protein varied from 13 to 19 mg of DsbA/liter of bacterial culture. UV absorbance spectra of native oxidized DsbA WT and all variants were identical and showed the same absorbance decrease at 280 nm upon denaturation in GdmCl. The characteristic fluorescence properties of DsbA were also unchanged by any of the amino acid replacements. All variants still showed a more than 3-fold fluorescence increase at 330 nm (λex = 295 nm) upon reduction of the active-site disulfide bridge and a shift in the emission maximum from 330 to 352 nm upon denaturation with GdmCl (12Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Google Scholar). All DsbA variants were also indistinguishable from DsbA WT with respect to their far-UV and near-UV CD spectra. As observed for DsbA WT (19Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Google Scholar), the variants show the same characteristic change in their near-UV CD spectra upon reduction (data not shown). Overall, the spectroscopic properties of all variants indicate that they are properly folded and that conformational changes due to the amino acid replacements do not influence the global structure. The influence of the amino acid replacements on protein stability (δGstab) was determined by GdmCl-induced unfolding/refolding experiments (Fig. 2, Table I), which were followed by fluorescence measurements. For DsbA WT and all variants, cooperative and fully reversible transitions were observed, which were evaluated according to the two-state model of folding (32Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar). Compared with DsbA WT, which is destabilized by its disulfide bond, replacement of Glu37 and/or Glu38 of the active-site helix by glutamine results in further destabilization of the oxidized form and stabilization of the reduced form. Hence, the energy difference between the oxidized and reduced form (δδGstab) is increased in these variants.Table IReversible unfolding/refolding of oxidized and reduced DsbA WT and DsbA variants in the presence of GdmClMidpoint of transitionCooperativityδGstabδδGstabM GdmClkJ/mol·M GdmClkJ/molkJ/molWT12.4 ± 5.5Oxidized1.8025.5 ± 1.6−46.0 ± 2.9Reduced2.3724.6 ± 1.1−58.4 ± 2.6E37Q20.6 ± 2.9Oxidized1.7921.8 ± 0.6−39.1 ± 1.2Reduced2.2526.6 ± 0.7−59.7 ± 1.7E38Q19.8 ± 3.2Oxidized1.8723.6 ± 0.6−44.2 ± 1.2Reduced2.4426.2 ± 0.8−64.0 ± 2.0E37Q/E38Q22.5 ± 2.8Oxidized1.7921.5 ± 0.5−38.5 ± 1.0Reduced2.3026.6 ± 0.8−61.0 ± 1.8δEVL13.3 ± 4.6Oxidized1.8223.6 ± 1.4−43.0 ± 2.6Reduced2.2425.2 ± 0.9−56.3 ± 2.0δEVL/H41P17.6 ± 4.6Oxidized1.7219.9 ± 0.9−34.3 ± 1.6Reduced2.1923.7 ± 1.3−51.9 ± 3.0 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, deletion of the tripeptide EVL does influence the stability of oxidized and reduced DsbA, but the additional exchange H41P also leads to an increase in δδGstab (Table I). The thermodynamic cycle involving native oxidized, denatured oxidized, denatured reduced, and native reduced DsbA implies a correlation between the values of δδGstab and the redox potentials of the variants (13Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Google Scholar, 19Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Google Scholar, 35Lin T.-Y. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5282-5287Google Scholar). Hence, all variants should be more oxidizing than DsbA WT by 5-52 mV. The redox properties of the DsbA variants were determined by measuring their redox equilibrium constants (Keq) with glutathione (12Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of the variants showed the expected decrease in Keq (Fig. 3, Table II). The variant E37Q is slightly more reducing than DsbA WT, whereas the redox potential of E38Q is increased by 11 mV. These effects are qualitatively additive in the double variant E37Q/E38Q. The redox potentials of δEVL and δEVL/H41P are decreased by 10 and 7 mV compared with DsbA WT, respectively.Table IIRedox properties and pKa values of the Cys30 thiol of DsbA WT and DsbA variantsKeqE0′ DsbApKa of Cys30 SHmMVWT0.126 ± 0.002−0.1253.40 ± 0.03E37Q0.144 ± 0.002−0.1263.69 ± 0.03E38Q0.055 ± 0.001−0.1143.52 ± 0.03E37Q/E38Q0.068 ± 0.001−0.1173.84 ± 0.02δEVL0.276 ± 0.007−0.1353.92 ± 0.02δEVL/H41P0.219 ± 0.006−0.1323.95 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Since negatively charged residues had been replaced by neutral residues in all these variants, the mutations may have led to a different electrostatic surrounding of the active-site disulfide. Therefore, the differences in their redox potential compared with DsbA WT should decrease upon increasing the ionic strength. In all cases, an increase in the sodium chloride concentration led to more reducing protein (Table III). The salt dependence of Keq is surprisingly low for DsbA WT and not changed in the variants. Therefore, we can exclude the possibility that negatively charged residues in the kink (Glu37, Glu38) have a large electrostatic effect on the active site of DsbA.Table IIIDependence on ionic strength of the redox equilibrium of DsbA WT and the DsbA variants with glutathioneSodium chloride concentration (M)00.20.51.0WTKeq (mM)0.148 ± 0.0020.213 ± 0.0020.273 ± 0.0040.369 ± 0.006Relative increase11.44 ± 0.031.85 ± 0.052.50 ± 0.06E37QKeq (mM)0.192 ± 0.0020.331 ± 0.0070.442 ± 0.0080.608 ± 0.008Relative increase11.72 ± 0.062.30 ± 0.073.17 ± 0.08E38QKeq (mM)0.067 ± 0.0010.102 ± 0.0010.132 ± 0.0010.184 ± 0.002Relative increase11.52 ± 0.031.97 ± 0.042.73 ± 0.06E37Q/E38QKeq (mM)0.082 ± 0.0010.157 ± 0.0020.236 ± 0.0030.348 ± 0.006Relative increase11.91 ± 0.042.87 ± 0.074.23 ± 0.12δEVLKeq (mM)0.329 ± 0.0080.510 ± 0.0100.793 ± 0.0211.027 ± 0.025Relative increase11.55 ± 0.072.41 ± 0.123.12 ± 0.15δEVL/H41PKeq (mM)0.306 ± 0.0070.452 ± 0.0090.689 ± 0.0190.943 ± 0.023Relative increase11.47 ± 0.072.25 ± 0.123.01 ± 0.15 Open table in a new tab To test whether the amino acids in the kink of the active-site helix have any influence on the pKa value of the Cys30 thiol, the pH dependence of the fraction of the Cys30 thiolate was determined by its absorbance at 240 nm (18Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Google Scholar). All variants show slightly higher pKa values of the Cys30 thiol compared with DsbA WT, with the largest change of 0.5 pH units in the variants δEVL and δEVL/H41P (Fig. 4, Table II). In general, all mutations had a stronger influence on the stability of oxidized and reduced DsbA compared with changes in the pKa of Cys30. The interdependence of thermodynamic stability, redox potential, and the pKa value of Cys30 thiol therefore does not seem to be that simple, since we would have expected a lowered pKa value for the variants E38Q and E37Q/E38Q due to their increased redox potentials. DsbA seems to be especially important for disulfide bond formation at acidic conditions, since it acts as oxidant even at pH 4 (14Wunde"
https://openalex.org/W1574276740,"Pancreatic lipase is characterized by increased activity against water-insoluble substrates and by dependence on another protein, colipase, for binding to the substrate interface. In most models of pancreatic lipase activity, colipase functions to anchor lipase on the substrate interface. Recent studies of the x-ray crystal structure of the complex between colipase and lipase suggest another function for colipase in maintaining the active conformation of lipase. We tested this hypothesis by introducing mutations into colipase at position 15, a residue that contacts the lid domain lipase in the open conformation. Multiple mutant colipases were expressed and shown to have decreased activity. To further investigate the function of the interaction between Glu15 of colipase and lipase, we examined one mutant, E15R, in detail. This mutant had 175-fold less activity compared with wild-type colipase. Although E15R had decreased activity, it was as effective as wild-type lipase in anchoring lipase to mixed emulsions of bile salt and tributyrin. The importance of the interaction with the lid domain was tested by determining the activity of E15R with lid deletion mutants of lipase. E15R was as active as wild-type colipase with these mutant lipases. These results indicate that Glu15 is critical for activity of the colipase-lipase complex at an interface and that colipase has a function in lipolysis in addition to anchoring lipase to an interface.

https://openalex.org/W1991395942,"DnaA protein, the initiator protein for initiation of Escherichia coli chromosomal replication, has been shown to repress its own expression from two dnaA promoters, 1P and 2P. The sequence-specific binding of DnaA protein to the DnaA box, located between the two promoters, results in subsequent oligomerization of DnaA protein. Upon increasing the concentration of DnaA protein, the oligomerization proceeds to both dnaA promoters from the DnaA box and inhibits RNA polymerase binding to both promoters. This results in the repression of transcription, suggesting that the extent of oligomerization of DnaA proteins over two dnaA promoters contributes to the autoregulation of expression of the dnaA gene. When the two dnaA promoters were bound and repressed by DnaA protein, the interaction of RNA polymerase with IciA protein, which is a specific inhibitor of initiation of in vitro E. coli chromosomal replication, appeared to dissociate the oligomerized DnaA proteins from the 1P promoter and allowed RNA polymerase to be loaded for its transcription."

Instead, single-chain t-PA exhibits very significant catalytic activity. Consequently, the zymogenicity, or ratio of the catalytic efficiencies of the mature, two-chain enzyme and the single-chain precursor, is only 3-9 for t-PA. Both we and others have previously proposed that Lys156 may contribute directly to this exceptional property of t-PA by forming interactions that selectively stabilize the active conformation of the single-chain enzyme. To test this hypothesis we created variants of t-PA in which Lys156 was replaced by a tyrosine residue. As predicted, the K156Y mutation selectively suppressed the activity of the single-chain enzyme and thereby substantially enhanced the enzyme's zymogenicity. In addition, however, this mutation produced a very dramatic increase in the ability of single-chain t-PA to discriminate among distinct fibrin co-factors. Compared with wild type t-PA, one of the variants characterized in this study, t-PA/R15E,K156Y, possessed substantially enhanced response to and selectivity among fibrin co-factors, resistance to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and significantly increased zymogenicity. The combination of these properties, and the maintenance of full activity in the presence of fibrin, suggest that the R15E,K156Y mutations may extend the therapeutic range of t-PA.

https://openalex.org/W2014508050,"In Cyanobacteria and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, substitution of valine for alanine at position 251 of the photosystem II D1 protein in the loop between transmembrane helices IV and V confers resistance to herbicides that reduce photosystem II function and increases sensitivity to photoinhibition. Using site-directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation in Chlamydomonas we have examined further the role of residue 251 in relation to D1 structure, function, and photosynthetic performance. Of the 12 different amino acid substitutions for Ala251 introduced at this position, five (Arg, Asp, Gln, Glu, and His) resulted in a nonphotosynthetic phenotype. Transformants with the Arg251 substitution synthesize a normal sized 32-kDa D1 protein with greatly reduced stability. The Gln, Glu, His, and Asp transformants make a 33-34-kDa form of the D1 protein of varying stability as well as an immunologically related polypeptide of 24-25 kDa corresponding to the N-terminal portion of D1 that is unstable and appears to be an aborted D1 translation product. All mutant forms of the D1 protein are intrinsic to the thylakoids. In contrast to previous studies in Cyanobacteria showing that residues in the IV-V loop can be mutated or deleted without loss of photosynthetic competence, our results suggest that Ala251 has a key role in the structure and function of the IV-V loop region.

Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Google Scholar). The rapidly turning over D1 protein continuously undergoes a cycle of damage, degradation, and replacement in response to photodamage from normal PSII photochemistry (2Critchley C. Russel A.W. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 92: 188-196Google Scholar). The D1 protein, encoded by the chloroplast psbA gene, is synthesized as a membrane associated 33.5-kDa precursor with a C-terminal extension. After processing to the 32-kDa mature form, D1 undergoes several posttranslational modifications postulated to facilitate translocation and proper assembly into PSII centers in the lipid bilayer (3Mattoo A.K. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1497-1501Google Scholar), where it binds chlorophyll, pheophytin, quinone, carotenoid, iron, and manganese (4Mattoo A.K. Marder J.B. Edelman M. Cell. 1989; 56: 241-246Google Scholar). D1 is thought to have five hydrophobic membrane-spanning helices, with its N terminus facing the chloroplast stroma and its C terminus projecting into the thylakoid lumen (5Sayre R.T. Andersson B. Bogorad L. Cell. 1986; 47: 601-608Google Scholar, 6Trebst A. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41c: 240-245Google Scholar). One stromally exposed region of D1, extending from the C terminus of helix IV through the N terminus of helix V (IV-V loop), participates in binding both QB, the second stable quinone acceptor in PSII, and several classes of herbicides that inhibit photosynthetic electron transport (6Trebst A. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41c: 240-245Google Scholar). The IV-V loop region includes a stromal helix thought to lie parallel to the membrane surface (6Trebst A. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41c: 240-245Google Scholar) that divides this loop into two parts, one thought to be involved in D1 degradation in vivo and the other functioning in herbicide and quinone binding (7Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Google Scholar, 8Perewoska I. Etienne A.-L. Miranda T. Kirilovsky D.

Phylogenetic conservation of the IV-V loop among Cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants (9Svensson B. Vass I. Styring S. Z. Naturforsch. 1991; 46c: 765-776Google Scholar) suggests that most of these amino acid residues should be essential. However, numerous deletions and amino acid substitutions in this region of D1 in Cyanobacteria do not abolish photosynthetic competence (10Erickson J.M. Pfister K. Rahire M. Togasaki R.K. Mets L. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 361-371Google Scholar, 11Przibilla E. Heiss S. Johanningmeier U. Trebst A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 169-174Google Scholar, 12Ohad N. Hirschberg J.

Substitution of Val for Ala251, in the putative membrane parallel helix between transmembrane helices IV and V, is reported to confer resistance to certain PSII herbicides and to increase sensitivity to photoinhibition in Cyanobacteria and in Chlamydomonas (8Perewoska I. Etienne A.-L. Miranda T. Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 235-245Google Scholar, 16Johanningmeier U. Bodner U. Wildner G.F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 221-224Google Scholar). This modification also affects the electron transfer reactions on both the acceptor and donor sides of PSII, resulting in a reduced electron transfer rate between QA and QB (17Crofts A.R. Baroli I. Kramer D. Taoka S. Z. Naturforsch. 1993; 48c: 259-266Google Scholar), a decrease of the affinity binding constant of QB for its site (7Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Google Scholar), and modification of the normal oscillatory pattern of oxygen evolution (8Perewoska I. Etienne A.-L. Miranda T. Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 235-245Google Scholar). Since these results pointed to a relationship between photosensitivity and an alanine-to-valine substitution at position 251 of the D1 protein, we have isolated and characterized homoplasmic chloroplast transformants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with 12 of the 19 possible alterations at Ala251 of D1. Our results show that the Cys, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, and Val mutants retain photosynthetic function to different levels and will be described in a forthcoming article, 2A. Lardans, B. Förster, O. Prasil, P. G. Falkowsky, C. B. Osmond, J. E. Boynton, and N. W. Gillham, manuscript in preparation. whereas the Arg, Asp, Gln, Glu, and His mutants are nonphotosynthetic. In this article, we describe the capacity of these nonphotosynthetic mutants with respect to D1 synthesis, accumulation, and degradation. The Arg mutant makes a mature sized 32-kDa D1 protein with greatly reduced stability, whereas the other four mutants synthesize and accumulate a 33-34-kDa form of D1 of varying stability as well as a very unstable 24-25-kDa peptide that appears to be an aborted D1 translation product. Our results suggest that Ala251 plays a key role in the overall tertiary structure of D1 and consequently in the function of PSII. The 900-bp KpnI-EcoRI chloroplast DNA fragment from wild-type psbA containing the fourth exon (18Erickson J.M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2753-2762Google Scholar) with adjacent intron sequences was subcloned into Bluescript KS− vector (Stratagene) from P-528 (19Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA prepared according to the method of Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was mutagenized with the 32-nucleotide-long oligonucleotides psbAArg (5′-CTTACGTAGCTCGTCATAAGTAAAAC-3′), psbAGl2Pr (5′-CTTACGTAGCT(C/G)(A/C)ACATAAGTAAAAC-3′) or psbAHisAsp (5′-CTTACGTAGCT(C/G)ACCATAAGTAAAAC-3′) using an oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system (version 2.1; Amersham Corp.). In addition to the mutations at position 251 (bold), a new SspI restriction site (underlined) was created by substituting a T for a C (bold) at position 247, which does not lead to an amino acid substitution (Fig. 1A). After transfection of XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene), bacterial colonies were screened by hybridization with the aforementioned radiolabeled oligonucleotides (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Alterations at D1 positions 247 and 251 were verified by sequencing (Life Technologies, Inc., double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing system; and [γ32P]ATP, DuPont NEN). Mutagenized 250-bp BstEII-EcoRI fragments covering the end of exon 4 and the beginning of intron 4 (Fig. 1A) were then inserted into P-528 to replace the corresponding wild-type sequence. The resulting plasmids, P-529 (Ala → Arg, A251R*), P-598 (Ala → Gln, A251Q*), P-599 (Ala → Glu, A251E*), P-601 (Ala → His, A251H*), and P-602 (Ala → Asp, A251D*), have amino acid alterations at position 251 and the SspI restriction fragment marker at position 247 (designated by the asterisk). The codons for the introduced amino acids at position 251 were chosen according to the codon usage of the D1 protein in Chlamydomonas and are therefore expected to be properly translated. The NP strain (CC-2835) of Lers et al. (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar) was used to create the mutant A251D*:NP by exchanging the last 180 bp of exon 5 from psbA of P-602 carrying the exon 4 Ala251 to Asp change with the same fragment generated from P-388 (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar), thus introducing the stop codon at Ser345 and the new AflII restriction fragment marker into the mutated psbA gene. The BsmI-BamHI fragment of P-602 was replaced by the BsmI-KpnI fragment of P-388, as explained below (see Fig. 1A). P-388 (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar) was digested with KpnI, and the overhanging ends were filled in using the Klenow reaction (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). P-602 (see above) was digested with BamHI and filled in using Klenow as well. Both linearized plasmids P-388 and P-602 were then digested at the unique BsmI restriction site located in the middle of the fifth exon of psbA (Fig. 1A). The 11-kilobase fragment obtained from P-602 was then ligated to the 500-bp fragment derived from P-388. The chimeric plasmid was transformed into XL1-Blue cells to generate P-653. The Ala251 to Asp and the Ser345 to stop codon changes (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar) were verified by sequencing. Each of the above plasmids carrying psbA mutations was introduced into wild-type strain CC-125 by cotransformation (22Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 510-536Google Scholar) together with P-228 (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar), which possesses a point mutation in the 16 S rRNA gene conferring spectinomycin resistance (Fig. 1A). A wild-type control strain carrying both the spectinomycin resistance marker and the restriction fragment marker at position 247 of psbA was also created by transforming CC-125 (19Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) with P-528 and P-228. After transformation, cells were respread on Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (19Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml spectinomycin and placed in very dim light (5 μmol/m2/s photosynthetically active radiation). Transformants resistant to spectinomycin were screened for the presence of the SspI restriction site in PCR DNA products obtained using primers pBr1 (5′-GCTGGTGTATTCGGTGG-3′) and pBr3 (5′-CTTGCGGGAAACTAACG-3′) (Fig. 1A). Transformants carrying the SspI site were single cell cloned, and homoplasmicity for this marker (and very likely for the closely linked A251 mutation) was verified by both restriction analysis of PCR products and Southern blots (Fig. 1B). The alteration at position 251 was established by DNA sequencing of PCR products using the primer pBr1. Isolation of total cell DNA from Chlamydomonas, Southern hybridizations, and PCR DNA amplifications were done as described by Lers et al. (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar). The mutant A251D*:NP in which psbA contains the Ala251 to Asp change and a stop codon at Ser345 was also created by cotransformation. Transformants resistant to spectinomycin were analyzed for the SspI and AflII restriction fragment markers, single cell cloned, and sequenced to verify that all mutations were present. Transformed cells were grown in liquid TAP medium at 25°C (19Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) bubbled with filtered air under low light (LL; 15 μmol/m2/s). For determination of the mutant strain autotrophic growth, cells were spotted at the same cell density on plates of TAP and minimal HS media (19Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) and incubated under medium light (300 μmol/m2/s). Resistance to metronidazole was assessed as described by Smith and Kohorn (23Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Google Scholar) under medium light. Cells were harvested in log phase, and thylakoid membranes were purified (24Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Google Scholar). Thylakoid association of the 24-25-kDa fragment was assessed using dissociating buffers, such as 2 M NaCl, 20 mM dithiothreitol, Na2CO3 (pH 11), and 6.8 M urea (24Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Google Scholar). Proteins from whole cells or thylakoid membranes were precipitated in ice-cold acetone for 1-2 h, pelleted at 12,000 × g for 20 min, washed in 80% ice-cold acetone (v/v), dried, and resuspended in 1 volume H2O and 1 volume lysis buffer (2% LDS (unless otherwise specified), 5 mM EDTA and 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Samples were boiled for 30 s to 3 min, and 1 volume sample buffer (Laemmli (25Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) containing LDS instead of SDS) was added, heated for an additional 5 min, and pelleted for 6 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were loaded on an equal protein basis (unless otherwise specified) onto denaturing (8 M urea) or nondenaturing 10-17.5% LDS-PAGE together with the Life Technologies 10-kDa protein ladder and run at a constant 100 V for 6 h at room temperature. For immunodetection, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) and detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence Renaissance kit (Dupont NEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using antisera at the following dilutions: D1, 1:1000; tubulin, 1:2000 and OEE1, 1:500. Immunoprecipitation with D1 antiserum using protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen) was carried out as described by Schmidt et al. (26Schmidt R.J. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1093-1099Google Scholar). Transformants were grown under LL at 25°C in liquid TAP medium in which the MgSO4 was replaced with an equimolar amount of MgCl2, and the acetate concentration was reduced by 3-fold (5.8 mM). Cells in early log phase (A750, 0.08-0.12) were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 6 min). Pelleted cells were resuspended at 0.2 A750 in TAP medium lacking sulfate and having further reduced acetate concentration (4.35 mM), which was found to decrease the background of nonspecific labeling. Five-ml aliquots of the cell suspension were placed in individual wells of a six-well microtiter plate (Falcon 3046) and agitated on an orbital shaker under LL at 25°C for 1 h to equilibrate. Anisomycin (Pfizer) was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 140 μg/ml to inhibit cytoplasmic protein synthesis. After a 15-min incubation, 25 μl of carrier-free H235SO4 (Dupont NEN) was added to a final concentration of 125 μCi/ml. At each time point (4, 8, 12, and 20 min), 0.5-ml aliquots were removed, injected into 6 ml of ice-cold acetone, and stored on ice for 1-2 h. Protein solubilization and gel electrophoresis were carried out as described above. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Bands were quantified using ImageQuant software, version 3.2, with backgrounds for representative areas in each lane subtracted manually. Labeled polypeptides were also detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. Five min after taking the last time point in the pulse experiment, 1.2 ml of TAP medium containing 200 mM Na2SO4 and 5.8 mM acetate was added to initiate the chase. After 15 min, the first aliquot (0.5 ml) was removed and considered as the 0 min time point of the chase. The other time points were taken at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. In most chases, anisomycin (final concentration, 140 μg/ml) and lincomycin (final concentration, 550 μg/ml) were added to inhibit cytoplasmic and chloroplast protein synthesis. Chlorophyll concentration was measured in 80% acetone extracts (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar). Photosynthetic O2 evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were determined as described by Lers et al. (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar), except that the measurements were carried out in TAP medium, and no bicarbonate was added to the chamber. Dark adapted (F0), maximum (Fm), and variable (Fv = Fm− F0) chlorophyll a fluorescence values were determined after the cells were dark adapted for at least 15 min to allow relaxation of fast fluorescence-quenching components. Mutated psbA genes encoding changes of D1 Ala251 to Ala (A251A*, codon GCT = wild-type control), Arg (A251R*, CGT), Gln (A251Q*, CAA), Glu (A251E*, GAA), His (A251H*, CAC) and Asp (A251D*, GAC) were introduced into wild-type C. reinhardtii strain CC-125 by cotransformation (22Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 510-536Google Scholar) with a selectable spectinomycin resistance marker in the 16 S rRNA (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Southern analysis of total cell DNA from transformant subclones demonstrated that all chloroplast genomes (∼70/plastid) carried the new SspI site closely linked to the mutation at position 251 (Fig. 1B). Fragments of about 300 and 500 bp were seen in SspI digests of total cell DNA probed with the pBr1-pBr3 PCR product when the SspI restriction fragment marker was present at position 247, whereas an 800-bp fragment occurred in wild-type DNA lacking the SspI restriction site (Fig. 1B). Substitutions of Arg, Gln, Glu, His, or Asp for Ala251 of the D1 protein result in transformants with a nonphotosynthetic phenotype that require an exogenous acetate carbon source for growth (Table I). They are light insensitive (up to 600 μmol/m2/s) and also grow in the presence of the suicide compound metronidazole (19Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). None of these mutants is capable of photosynthetic O2 evolution, suggesting that their PSII centers are inactive even after dark adaptation and exhibit the high fluorescence phenotype typical of strains impaired in PSII function (27Krause G.H. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 74: 566-574Google Scholar). All five mutants show an elevated level of dark adapted chlorophyll a fluorescence (F0) as well as a reduction in Fv/Fm (Table I), an indicator of the photochemical efficiency of PSII. Damage to PSII centers is known to result in the rise of the initial F0 level (27Krause G.H. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 74: 566-574Google Scholar), whereas differences in F0 and Fv/Fm between the mutants suggest that their PSII function is altered to various extents.Table I.Analysis of growth, O2 evolution (Pmax) and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters F0 and Fv/Fm of transformants homoplasmic for mutations at the Ala251 residueGenotypeGrowthaCells were either grown on minimal HS medium (autotrophic growth), on acetate-containing TAP medium (mixotrophic growth), or on TAP medium containing 20 mM metronidazole (MET) at different light intensities from 70 to 600 μmol/m2/s.PhotosynthesisbCells were pregrown in TAP medium at LL (15 μmol/m2/s).HSTAPMETPmax (μmol/mg Chl/h)F0 (arbitrary units)Fv/FmWT+c+, growth; −, no growth.+−12025.00.77A251R*−++051.50.24A251Q*−++053.00.23A251E*−++096.00.13A251H*−++061.00.46A251D*−++068.00.41a Cells were either grown on minimal HS medium (autotrophic growth), on acetate-containing TAP medium (mixotrophic growth), or on TAP medium containing 20 mM metronidazole (MET) at different light intensities from 70 to 600 μmol/m2/s.b Cells were pregrown in TAP medium at LL (15 μmol/m2/s).c +, growth; −, no growth. Open table in a new tab Immunoblot analysis of total cell extracts reveals that D1 accumulation in the mutants is perturbed to varying degrees with respect to wild type (Fig. 2, A and B). Antisera against the tubulin β subunit and OEE1, one of the three extrinsic proteins of the oxygen-evolving complex, were used as controls for equal loading. A251R* is the only mutant that accumulates nearly normal amounts (75%) of the 32-kDa mature form of the D1 protein (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the A251Q*, A251E*, A251H*, and A251D* mutants accumulate a slower migrating 33-34-kDa form of D1 (P33-34) (Fig. 2B) that is distinct from the D1 precursor. Indeed, a A251D* transformant that carries the NP preprocessed mutation (A251D*:NP mutant) lacking the C-terminal D1 extension (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar) still synthesizes P33-34 (Fig. 2D). Variations in D1 size were confirmed in a comparative pulse-labeling experiment (see below and Fig. 4B). Our inability to detect the P33-34 peptides by immunoblot analysis of deletion mutants in the psbA gene encoding D1 (CC-1078 and FUD 7; 19Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) proved that these peptides are not contaminant proteins recognized by the D1 antibody (data not shown) but, rather, variant forms of the D1 protein.Fig. 4Synthesis of D1 and D1 related proteins from the D1 residue 251 mutants and WT. Log phase cells grown in reduced sulfate- and acetate-containing medium at LL were equilibrated and preincubated in anisomycin to block cytoplasmic protein translation, and 5-ml aliquots were pulse labeled with 625 μCi of [35S]H2SO4, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Labeled proteins separated by 10-17.5% gradient 1% LDS-PAGE were visualized by autoradiography, and D1 and D1-related peptides were identified by their migration relative to immunoprecipitated D1 and D1-related proteins on LDS-PAGE.

B, longer term (1 h) labeling of D1 and related proteins in the A251 mutants and wild type compared with the NP mutant, which synthesizes a preprocessed D1 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The A251Q*, A251E*, A251H*, and A251D* mutants also accumulate varying amounts of a 24-25-kDa peptide (P24-25), which is recognized (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) and immunoprecipitated (data not shown) by the D1 antibody. When 1% LDS (final concentration) is used for protein solubilization, P24-25 is barely detectable, and a band migrating at the same position as the mature D1 protein can be seen (Fig. 2A). This latter band disappears, and P24-25 is intensified when the solubilization buffer contains 2% LDS, suggesting that accumulated P24-25 might be tightly associated with another small peptide of about 8-9 kDa (Fig. 2, compare A and B). Since we do not observe this association during pulse-chase labeling experiments, it must occur at a later time (see “Discussion”). The similar upshift of both P33-34 and P24-25 in the Glu and Asp mutants compared with the respective peptides in the Gln and His mutants is likely due to the negative charge of the amino acid introduced in the former mutants. P33-34 accumulates up to ∼45-50% of the wild-type D1 level in the A251H* and A251D* mutants but only reaches 9 and 15% of the wild-type D1 level in the A251Q* and A251E* mutants, respectively (Fig. 2C). P24-25 as well as P33-34 is found in purified thylakoids of these mutants (shown for the A251D* mutant in Fig. 3), demonstrating that it can assemble into the photosynthetic membrane. Furthermore, extraction of polypeptides from thylakoids by various treatments (see “Materials and Methods”) showed that P24-25 is intrinsic and as resistant to extraction as mature wild-type D1 and P33-34 from the other mutants (data not shown). Since our D1 antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide containing amino acids in the luminal loop between helices I and II of the D1 protein, we know that the 24-25-kDa peptides represent N-terminal fragments. To determine whether the reduced accumulation of the D1 protein in the Arg, Gln, Glu, His, and Asp mutants was due to a defect in synthesis or to a high turnover rate, Chlamydomonas transformants were pulse labeled with [35S]H2SO4 and subjected to a cold sulfate chase. Synthesis of D1 is impaired to varying degrees depending on the amino acid present at position 251 of the D1 protein (Fig. 4A). Comparison of the migration of labeled D1 protein from the mutants and wild type demonstrated that A251R* synthesizes mature sized D1, whereas A251Q*, A251H*, A251E*, and A251D* make the slower migrating P33-34 (Fig. 4A), as was observed on the immunoblot (see Fig. 2A). When migration of newly synthesized D1 proteins in the Glu, Gln, His, and Asp mutants was compared with those of wild-type and the preprocessed NP mutant (21Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Google Scholar) in which D1 is directly synthesized in its mature form, only the slower migrating form of D1 was detected (Fig. 4B). These experiments also provided information on the origin of P24-25. The A251H* and especially the A251E* and A251D* strains synthesize predominantly P24-25, whereas the A251Q* strain synthesizes a lesser amount of this peptide. A251Q* and A251H* synthesize a peptide migrating at 24 kDa, whereas the A251E* and A251D* mutants make a 25-kDa peptide. P24-25 is detected very early during the pulse-labeling experiment, before any P33-34 is seen, suggesting that it is probably not an N-terminal D1 degradation product. Furthermore, we never observed labeling"
https://openalex.org/W1970434178,"Melanoma formation in Xiphophorus is caused by overexpression of the Xmrk gene. The promoter region of the Xmrk oncogene differs strikingly from the corresponding proto-oncogenic sequences and was acquired in the course of a nonhomologous recombination with another gene locus, D. In order to identify regulatory elements leading to the strong transcriptional activation of Xmrk in melanoma tissue and to contribute to an understanding of the role the regulatory locus R might play in suppressing the tumor phenotype in wild-type Xiphophorus, we performed functional analysis of the Xmrk oncogene promoter. Transient transfections in melanoma and nonmelanoma cells revealed the existence of a potent positive regulatory element positioned close to the transcriptional start site. Contained within this promoter segment is a GC-rich sequence identical to the binding site described for human Sp1. In vitro binding studies and biochemical characterizations demonstrated the existence of GC-binding proteins in fish that share immunological properties with members of the human Sp family of transcription factors and appear to be involved in the high transcriptional activation of the Xmrk oncogene. Since the identified cis element is functional in both melanoma and nonmelanoma cells, additional silencer elements suppressing Xmrk expression in nonpigment cells must exist, thereby suggesting a negative regulatory function for the genetically defined R locus."
https://openalex.org/W1965572769,"During monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, the cellular content of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) increases more than 4-fold. We have shown previously that amplified expression of the B2 subunit of the V-ATPase occurs solely by increased transcription, and that the 5′-untranslated region of the B2 gene, containing multiple consensus binding sites for the transcription factors AP-2 and Sp1, is required for this expression. The present study demonstrates that AP-2 binding sequences are essential for increased transcription from the B2 promoter during monocyte-macrophage differentiation and that AP-2, expressed exogenously in THP-1 and other cells, activates transcription from the B2 promoter. In mobility shift assays, a nuclear factor from THP-1 and U-937 cells was identified that binds to several AP-2 response elements within the B2 promoter, but does not react with AP-2 antibodies, and has a DNA sequence binding affinity profile that differs from AP-2. These findings suggest that a novel AP-2-like transcription factor is responsible for V-ATPase B subunit amplification during monocyte differentiation.

The mammalian vacuolar H+ATPase, or V-ATPase, 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPasevacuolar H+ATPaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTPAtetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate. is a multisubunit complex that transports protons electrogenically across the membranes of intracellular endocytic and secretory compartments in all eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane in certain specialized cell types.

In the plasma membrane, the V-ATPase participates in transcellular transport of H+ and other ions and in defending cytosolic pH. vacuolar H+ATPase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate. The V-ATPase is similar in structure to the F0F1-ATPases (1Nelson N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 654-660Google Scholar, 2Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Google Scholar) and is composed of two distinct macrodomains. The transmembrane domain (V0) is composed of proteolipids and other integral membrane proteins and transmits protons through the lipid bilayer (3Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Google Scholar, 4Wang S.Y. Moriyama Y. Mandel M. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Danho W. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17638-17642Google Scholar, 5Supek F.

The cytosolic domain of the enyzme (V1) is composed of three copies each of the “A” subunit (70 kDa) and the “B” subunit (56-58 kDa), as well as a single copy of the “C” (42 kDa), “D” (33 kDa), “E” (31 kDa), and “F” (14 kDa) subunits (reviewed in 8Gluck S.L. Underhill D.M. Iyori M. Holliday L.S. Kostrominova T.Y. Lee B.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 427-445Google Scholar). The A subunit contains the site of catalytic ATP-binding site (9Arai H. Berne M.

Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar) and may have a regulatory role (12Wang Z.-Q. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21957-21965Google Scholar, 13Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Google Scholar). Two isoforms of the B subunit have been identified in mammals (14Sühdhof T.C. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Johnston P.A. Xie X.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They are encoded by different genes and differ in amino acid sequence at the amino and carboxyl termini, although no functional differences have yet been identified. Expression of the B1 isoform is restricted to only a few tissues; it is found at highest levels in kidney and placenta. The B2 isoform is ubiquitously expressed and is most abundant in kidney and brain. 2R. D. Nelson, D. M. Underhill, S. P. Hmiel, S. Bae, and S. L. Gluck, submitted for publication. Cells of the monocytic lineage, including monocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts, express V-ATPase with a B2 subunit both in intracellular compartments and on their plasma membranes (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar). Macrophages express the V-ATPase on their plasma membranes to aid in intracellular pH regulation when exposed to acidic environments such as abscessed tissue (19Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7645-7654Google Scholar, 20Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Sudsbury R.A. Rotstein O.D. Surgery. 1990; 108: 363-369Google Scholar); osteoclasts employ the V-ATPase in the ruffled membrane to generate an acidic microenvironment required for bone resorption (21Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S. Science. 1989; 245: 855-857Google Scholar). In prior studies, we showed that during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation the cellular content of V-ATPase subunits increases by as much as 5-fold in native monocytes and by 3-4-fold in the monocytic cell line THP-1 (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar). Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of amplification were observed among the different V-ATPase subunits examined (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar). The increased expression of the B2 subunit (approximately 3.5-fold) occurred solely by transcriptional activation. We isolated and characterized the proximal promoter region of the B2 gene and found that the DNA in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene was required for transcriptional activation during monocyte differentiation and that this region contained multiple binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2. AP-2 was first identified as a Mr = 52,000 transcription factor (22Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Google Scholar, 23Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Google Scholar) that had unique patterns of expression in different tissues during embryonic development (24Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Google Scholar). Isoforms of AP-2 were later identified that were products of alternative splicing of RNA from a single gene (25Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R.

Biol. 1995; 169: 1-14Google Scholar). Subsequently, Moser et al. (27Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Google Scholar) isolated murine genomic and cDNA clones for a homologue of AP-2, designated AP-2β, encoded by a second gene. cDNAs from the two genes share an overall identity of 76% at the amino acid level, with the strongest homology in the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain (85% identity, 92% similarity). Both AP-2β and the original AP-2 isolate (now designated AP-2α) bind to the DNA consensus sequence 5′-GCCNNNGGC-3′, although many variants of this sequence have been identified (28Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Google Scholar). The functional significance of the isoforms is unclear; both AP-2β and AP-2α activate transcription to an equal extent, and the patterns of expression of both genes are highly similar. In this report, we show that AP-2 binding sites in the promoter of the V-ATPase B2 gene are functional in vivo and are required for regulation of B2 expression during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. We identify a nuclear factor from human monocytic cell lines that binds to AP-2 consensus binding sites but is distinct from AP-2α and AP-2β as determined by DNA binding affinity and immunological reactivity. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma and were reagent grade. THP-1 and U-937 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, and were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT), 2 mML-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in a 5% CO2 incubator. THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate by addition of 160 nM tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as described previously (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar, 29Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was performed essentially as described (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar), with the exception that the noncoding strand of probe −338 to +84 was radiolabeled. The isolation and sequence of the B2 gene proximal promoter was described previously (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar). B2 promoter fragments were inserted at the 5′ end of the luciferase reporter gene in the vector pGL3 (Promega), with the exception of B2 fragment −317 to −52, which was subcloned into the vector pGL2 (Promega). The −317 to −124 site 1 mutant was created by using restriction enzymes to excise a portion of the wild-type promoter containing binding site 1 and then ligating in synthetic oligonucleotides containing the mutant site. In this manner, the core AP-2 binding sequence of site 1 was changed from 5′-GGTCTGGCC-3′ to 5′-AATATAAAA-3′. Recombinant human AP-2α was expressed from an SV40-derived promoter in the vector pSAP2 (a kind gift of M. Tainsky, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). Transfections of THP-1 cells were performed as described previously (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar, 30Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Google Scholar). For AP-2α co-transfection experiments, 5 μg of B2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid plus 2 μg of pRSVcat, a vector for expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) used to normalize luciferase activity for transfection efficiency, were co-transfected with 0-2 μg of pSAP2. Cloning vector pGEM-5Z was added to the DNA mixtures as needed to equalize the DNA concentration among transfections. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and prepared for luciferase and CAT assays. The experiments using transfection and subsequent differentiation of THP-1 cells were performed as described previously (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar). Luciferase and CAT assays were performed as described previously (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar, 32Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were induced with TPA for 24 h as described above. mRNA was isolated using the FastTrack messenger RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen; San Diego, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and subcloning into the λ vector Uni-ZAP were performed using a commercially available cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). For screening of this library, 1 × 106 plaques on nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) were probed with a 32P-labeled 361-base pair PstI cDNA fragment corresponding to a region within the DNA-binding domain of human AP-2α (spanning amino acid residues 278-399; EMBL/GenBank accession number Y00229. Following hybridization of the probe, filters were washed under final conditions of 42EC in 2 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS. Plaques were purified through multiple rounds of screening, and pBluescript plasmids containing the inserts of interest were excised from the Uni-ZAP vector using ExAssist interference-resistant helper phage (Stratagene). Nuclear extracts from dividing or differentiated THP-1 cells were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar), except nuclear proteins were further purified by precipitation with 55% saturated ammonium sulfate prior to dialysis. Nuclear extracts from other cell types were prepared by a modification of the method of Lee et al. (34Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Google Scholar) for small cell numbers. For gel mobility shift assays, double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The oligonucleotide pair containing the AP-2 binding sequence 5′-GATCGAACTGACC CCGT-3′ (core binding site underlined) from the human metallothionein IIa distal basal level element was purchased from Promega. The B2 promoter site 1 oligonucleotide was composed of the sequence 5′-CAAGCA CCAGCGGCGCG-3′ corresponding to −173 to −148 with respect to the start of translation. The site 5 oligonucleotide was composed of the sequences 5′-GCCTCG CGCCTT-3′ corresponding to −73 to −53. The oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 consensus binding sequence 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ was purchased from Promega. Purified recombinant Sp1 and AP-2α were obtained from Promega. Approximately 30 fmol of end-labeled oligonucleotides (5 × 104 Cerenkov counts) were mixed with 1-6 μg of nuclear extract in a buffer containing (final concentration) 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC). Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were separated in a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel, which was then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Supershift assays were performed by incubating 1-5 μg of antibody against AP-2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) with nuclear extract mixtures for 2 h at 4°C prior to addition of radiolabeled probe and gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide competition reactions were performed by preincubating the nuclear extract with unlabeled oligonucleotides for 10 min at room temperature prior to addition of the radioactive probe. Data on promoter activity are presented as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific; San Rafael, CA). A p value of 0.05 was used as the threshold criterion for statistical significance. In previous DNase I footprinting studies in which the coding strand of the B2 promoter was labeled (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar), we found that the 5′-untranslated region and proximal coding region of the B2 promoter contained five sequences capable of binding purified AP-2α in vitro. In the present study, we performed footprinting experiments in which the non-coding strand was labeled. We identified three additional potential AP-2 binding sites (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The five AP-2 binding sites noted previously are designated sites 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Of the three newly identified AP-2 binding sequences, two (sites 3 and 4), composed of the sequence 5′-GCCGRRGCC-3′ (where R indicates purine), were found embedded within Sp1 binding sites. The most proximal site (site 1) contained a near-perfect palindromic sequence 5′-GGTCTGGCC-3′. Purified AP-2α also bound at the G + C-rich region of transcriptional initiation, although this site would not be expected to be active in vivo due to interference from the basal transcription complex. Promoter deletion studies (Fig. 3, discussed below) show that this site does not mediate AP-2-enhanced transcription in vivo.Fig. 2AP-2 and Sp1 binding sites in the first exon of the V-ATPase B2 gene. The AP-2 binding sites are underlined and numbered in accordance with Fig. 1. Sp1 binding sites (GC boxes) are in bold type. The nucleotide sequence was reported previously (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M.

Fragments of the B2 promoter containing indicated numbers of AP-2 binding sites were ligated to the 5′ end of a luciferase reporter cDNA. The constructs were co-transfected into THP-1 monocytes with varying amounts of the AP-2α expression vector pSAP2 as shown, and with the plasmid pRSVcat as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity is expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity to CAT activity. At least four independent experiments were performed for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether AP-2 can bind to the B2 promoter in vivo and mediate induction of gene expression, we co-transfected into undifferentiated THP-1 cells up to 2 μg of the plasmid pSAP2, for exogenous expression of human AP-2α (35Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Google Scholar), with a plasmid containing one of several B2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. Five promoter constructs were used. 1) A fragment spanning from −317 to +30 containing AP-2 binding sites 1-8; 2) fragment −317 to −52 containing AP-2 binding sites 1-5; 3) fragment −317 to −124 containing site 1 only; 4) −317 to −199, containing no AP-2 binding sites except the sequence at the transcriptional start site; and 5) −317 to −124mut, containing a mutated AP-2 binding site 1. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Co-transfection of pSAP2 with the promoter constructs in THP-1 cells resulted in up to 4-fold greater luciferase activity than in cells transfected with control plasmid. The presence of at least one AP-2 binding site was required for this activation, since deletion or mutation of all sites abolished the effect of exogenous AP-2. Site 1 alone was sufficient to mediate an increase in transcriptional activity, although the magnitude of this increase was less than those mediated by longer constructs. For all constructs, luciferase activity increased with the concentration of pSAP2 in the range of 0-2 μg. With higher amounts, however, luciferase activity began to decrease (not shown), most likely due to self-interference of AP-2 transcriptional activation as described by Kannan et al. (35Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Google Scholar). Expression of exogenous AP-2α in the cell lines LLC-PK1 (a porcine kidney proximal tubule line), 293 (a human embryonic kidney fibroblast line), and HepG2 (a human hepatoma line) also resulted in increased activity of the B2 promoter, but higher concentrations of pSAP-2 plasmid were required for promoter activation in 293 and HepG2 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that AP-2α is capable of activating transcription from the V-ATPase B2 promoter in multiple cell lines. In a prior study (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar), we showed that sequences in the region between −96 and −199, containing three AP-2 binding sites, were required for transcriptional activation from the B2 promoter during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. To delineate further the segment of the gene required for transcriptional activation, we performed an analysis of additional deletions in this region. A luciferase construct was created with promoter sequences from −274 to −124 (containing only AP-2 site 1) and tested for the ability to enhance transcription during monocyte-macrophage differentiation (Fig. 4). The magnitude of activation with the −274 to −124 construct, although it did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.053), was less than those mediated by longer constructs, a result similar to that obtained by coexpression of exogenous AP-2 with this promoter fragment (see Fig. 3). These results suggest that site 1, or surrounding sequences, accounts for at least part of the transcriptional response to a differentiation stimulus. To determine whether deletion of site 1 abolished transcriptional activation during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, we examined the ability of construct −317 to −124mut, containing a mutation in site 1 (see Fig. 3 and “Experimental Procedures”), to enhance transcription during monocyte-macrophage differentiation. In THP-1 monocytes transfected with this construct, no increase in luciferase activity was observed following phorbol ester treatment (Fig. 4). This indicates that AP-2 binding sites have an essential role in induction of B2 expression during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. To identify monocytic nuclear proteins capable of binding AP-2 binding sites, we performed gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from undifferentiated or differentiated THP-1 cells. Nuclear extracts from both THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 macrophages contained a protein that bound to radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing AP-2 binding site 1 from the B2 promoter (Fig. 5A). Binding specificity was demonstrated by addition of either unlabeled probe or an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a different AP-2 binding site (from the human metallothionein IIa basal level element (28Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Google Scholar)), which abolished binding of the nuclear proteins to the labeled probe; addition of an irrelevant oligonucleotide, however (in this case, the binding sequence for Sp1, another G + C-rich sequence), did not abolish binding of the proteins to the labeled probe. The amount of site 1 oligonucleotide bound by nuclear extract was increased in THP-1 macrophages compared with THP-1 monocytes (Fig. 5A). To determine if the apparent increase in the AP-2-like factor in THP-1 macrophages was due to a more efficient extract preparation, we assayed the same extracts for Sp1 binding proteins. Studies in U-937 cells, another human monocytic leukemia cell line, have shown that the Sp1 content of monocytes does not change significantly during TPA-induced differentiation into macrophages (36Chen H.-M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Google Scholar). We found that the Sp1 content of THP-1 cell nuclear extract preparations exhibited a minor decrease during differentiation to macrophages (Fig. 5B), suggesting that greater recovery of transcription factors was not the reason for the increase in AP-2-like factor binding. The basis for the slight decrease in the Sp1 content of THP-1 cell nuclear extract is unclear but may have caused underestimation of the increase in AP-2-like factor binding. We next incubated THP-1 nuclear extracts, or purified AP-2α, with oligonucleotides containing different AP-2 binding sequences to determine whether any differences in binding affinity existed among several sequences of DNA capable of binding AP-2α (Fig. 6). The oligonucleotide probes included the following: 1) a commercially available AP-2 binding sequence (Promega) from the human metallothionein IIa distal basal level element (hMtIIa BLE; (28Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Google Scholar)); 2) the B2 promoter AP-2 binding site 1; and 3) the B2 promoter AP-2 binding site 5. Fig. 6 illustrates two significant differences between the THP-1 factor and recombinant AP-2α. First, the mobility of the THP-1 factor was consistently greater than that of AP-2α under the assay conditions. Second, the THP-1 factor and recombinant AP-2α exhibited different relative affinities for the probes tested. The hMtIIa BLE site oligonucleotide bound strongly to recombinant AP-2α, forming a single protein-DNA complex. When incubated with THP-1 extracts, the hMtIIa BLE site oligonucleotide formed multiple protein-DNA complexes. In contrast, the B2 site 1 and 5 oligonucleotide probes formed a single predominant protein-DNA complex in THP-1 nuclear extracts and bound to recombinant AP-2α weakly in comparison to the hMtIIa probe. Quantitation of the THP-1 factor (see Fig. 7, below) showed the concentration of this DNA-binding protein to be several hundred-fold less than that of AP-2α in the reactions. A second protein-DNA complex that migrated slightly ahead of the predominant complex was found occasionally in THP-1 extract preparations in some experiments (see site 1 probe, lane 3). This protein-DNA complex was not observed reproducibly and may represent a degradation product of the intact transcription factor. Although we found that site 1 bound to purified AP-2α in DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. 1), we were unable, in repeated experiments, to detect any protein-DNA complex formation between site 1 and purified AP-2α in the gel mobility shift assays. We were able, however, to inhibit completely binding of recombinant AP-2α to the hMtIIa BLE site by preincubating the factor with a >5000-fold excess of unlabeled site 1 oligonucleotide (data not shown).Fig. 7Determination of the concentration of the THP-1 factor by mobility shift assay. A, increasing amounts of radiolabeled site 5 probe were allowed to bind with 1 μl of THP-1 monocyte extract in a 10-μl reaction until saturation of the THP-1 factor was reached (lanes marked by asterisks). The intensity of the factor-DNA complex at saturation was compared with a standard curve of free site 5 probe at a known specific activity (B). The amount of probe bound in the saturated factor-DNA complexes was calculated at 0.12 nM. The position of the THP-1 factor of interest is marked with an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To compare the concentration of the THP-1 factor in these assays with that of AP-2α, we determined the concentration of the THP-1 factor using the gel mobility shift assay. A constant amount of THP-1 monocyte extract was incubated with increasing amounts of radiolabeled site 5 probe, and the amount of protein-DNA complex formed was assayed, allowing the number of moles of probe bound to be determined when all of the available THP-1 factor was complexed (Fig. 7A). The intensity of the factor-DNA complex at saturation was compared with a standard curve of free probe of known specific activity (Fig. 7B). Assuming a 1:1 molar ratio of factor to DNA in the complex, we estimated the concentration of THP-1 monocyte factor in our standard DNA-binding reactions (i.e. Fig. 6) to be 0.12 nM. In contrast, the concentration of recombinant AP-2α in the reactions shown in Fig. 6 was 40 nM. Thus, even at a concentration 330-fold greater than the THP-1 factor, AP-2α bound to the site 1 and 5 probes only weakly. Both the difference in the affinity of AP-2α and the THP-1 factor for different probes, and the differences in mobility of the protein-DNA complexes formed, strongly suggest that the two proteins are distinct. As an additional and independent method for determining whether the THP-1 nuclear factor was different from AP-2α, we analyzed the protein-DNA complexes using the antibody “supershift” method (37Roberts M.S. Boundy A. O'Hare P. Pizzorno M.C. Ciufo D.M. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4307-4320Google Scholar) to determine whether the factor is immunologically similar to AP-2 (Fig. 8). Antibody to the carboxyl terminus of human AP-2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubated with nuclear proteins prior to probe addition and electrophoresis, did not produce a mobility supershift of protein-DNA complexes from THP-1 cells (from either the monocytic or macrophage-like forms), but the antibody shifted the mobility of the entire AP-2α-oligonucleotide complex. Although the antibody was not tested directly in supershift assays for binding to AP-2β, it does detect AP-2β on immunoblots and should have caused a mobility supershift if the THP-1 factor were AP-2β (27Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Google Scholar). To determine whether other cells of the monocytic lineage have an AP-2 site-binding protein with properties similar to the factor in THP-1 cells, we performed mobility shift and supershift assays with nuclear extracts from the promonocytic cell line U-937 (Fig. 8). Like THP-1 cells, U-937 nuclear extracts contained a protein that formed complexes with AP-2 consensus binding sequences, but showed a higher mobility than AP-2α in gel mobility shift assays, and did not exhibit a mobility supershift with the anti-AP-2α antibody. The protein-DNA complexes from the THP-1 and U-937 nuclear extracts failed to show any mobility supershift with addition of as much as 5 μg of anti-AP-2 antibody (not shown). Because AP-2-like factors have not been well studied in monocytic cell lines, we examined the possibility that THP-1 cells express novel proteins with homology to AP-2 DNA-binding domains. A THP-1 macrophage library was created and screened at low stringency using a cDNA probe corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of AP-2α. Three plaques were isolated from approximately 1 × 106 screened plaques that exhibited a positive signal through three rounds of screening. All three recombinant phage plaques contained the same insert, which encoded portions of the DNA binding domain and 3′-untranslated region of AP-2α (nucleotides 1184-2103 relative to the start of transcription). Thus, THP-1 cells express AP-2α, even though the predominant DNA-binding protein in the mobility shift assays appeared to be a distinct factor. To address the possibility that the monocytic factor was indeed AP-2α, but was exhibiting altered mobility and immunoreactivity due to effects of the nuclear extract, we performed experiments in which recombinant AP-2α was added to THP-1 nuclear extracts, and the mixture was used to perform mobility shift and supershift assays (Fig. 9). When incubated with THP-1 nuclear extracts, AP-2α retained its original mobility and ability to react with the anti-AP-2α antibody, whereas the monocytic factor was unaffected (Fig. 9). These data, along with those shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8, indicate that the predominant factor in THP-1 nuclei that binds to AP-2 binding sites in the B2 promoter is distinct from AP-2. Leukemic cell lines of the myeloid lineage, such as THP-1, have served as excellent tools in studies of the terminal differentiation processes of hematopoietic cells (38Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 352-369Google Scholar). In this report, we have demonstrated that AP-2 binding sites are essential for amplification of V-ATPase B2 subunit transcription during macrophage differentiation. We have identified a nuclear factor in THP-1 cells that bind to these sites and whose binding activity increases following differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophages. Our results therefore suggest that a factor related to the AP-2 family of factors is involved in gene regulation during macrophage differentiation. The predominant protein from THP-1 cell nuclear extracts forming protein-DNA complexes with AP-2 binding sites, however, is a novel factor distinct from AP-2. Recent studies have implicated transcription factors from multiple gene families as critical for terminal differentiation of macrophages. These factors include members of the STAT (39Barahmand-Pour F. Meinke A. Kieslinger M. Eilers A. Decker T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 121-128Google Scholar) and C/EBP (40Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Google Scholar) families; Pu.1, a member of the ets family (41Simon M.C. Olson M. Scott E. Hack A. Su G. Singh H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 113-119Google Scholar); and Egr-1, a zinc finger transcription factor (42Krishnaraju K. Nguyen H.Q. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5499-5507Google Scholar), among others. Although the role of transcription factor AP-2 in terminal differentiation has been elucidated in other cell types, including neuroectodermal and epidermal cells (43Leask A. Byrne C. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7948-7952Google Scholar, 44Philipp J. Mitchell P.J. Malipiero U. Fontana A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 602-614Google Scholar), the role of AP-2 in monocytic differentiation and gene expression has been addressed in only a few studies that have used the U-937 cell model. AP-2 binding sites were found to be required for tumor necrosis factor α expression induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor but not by phorbol ester (45Rhoades K.L. Cai S. Golub S.H. Economou J.S. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 161: 125-131Google Scholar). AP-2 binding sequences were also found not to have any enhancer activity for transcription of downstream reporters during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of U-937 cells (46Adler V. Kraft A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 26-34Google Scholar). Although these findings appear to conflict with our results, we have shown that THP-1 cells closely mimic primary blood monocytes in their ability to express V-ATPase during differentiation, whereas U-937 cells do not (18Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Google Scholar). 3B. S. Lee and S. L. Gluck, unpublished results. The mechanisms that cause increased transcription of the B2 subunit in primary blood monocytes and phorbol ester-induced THP-1 cells therefore may not be functional in phorbol ester-treated U-937 cells. In support of this possibility, we found that the AP-2 site-binding activity was lower in nuclear extracts from phorbol ester-treated U-937 cells than from control U-937 promonocytes (data not shown). The promoter of the V-ATPase B2 subunit contains eight functional AP-2 binding sites, and at least one of these sites is necessary for increased expression from the B2 promoter during macrophage differentiation. We have not determined if site 1 is the only active site in the B2 promoter nor if other downstream sequences are active in vivo. Promoters containing site 1 alone (−317 to −124) showed transcriptional activity somewhat less than those containing additional AP-2 binding sites and an Sp1 site (−317 to −96; Fig. 3, Fig. 4), but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Four of the AP-2 binding sites (sites 2-5) are in such close proximity to Sp1-binding sites that interference, due to binding of Sp1, is likely to occur. We have tested this by performing gel mobility shift assays with an oligonucleotide probe that contains AP-2 binding sites 4 and 5 and the overlapping Sp1-binding site. When incubated with THP-1 monocyte or macrophage nuclear extracts, the only detectable protein-DNA complexes formed were with Sp1 (data not shown). These results suggest that Sp1 in the nuclear extracts interferes with the binding of the THP-1 factor to AP-2 sites 4 and 5. Competition by transcription factors for adjacent and overlapping binding sites has been noted previously for several promoters and is a mechanism by which the action of factors can be regulated (47Zinn K. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 45: 611-618Google Scholar, 48Lichtsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Google Scholar, 49Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17189-17196Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting of promoter using the nuclear extracts will be required, however, for a direct assessment of protein-DNA interactions in the B2 subunit promoter. The identity of the factor from THP-1 and U-937 cell nuclei identified here is unknown. A probe containing the conserved DNA binding domain of AP-2α that was used to screen a THP-1 cell cDNA library at low stringency hybridized only to a single gene product, AP-2α itself. Since AP-2α is expressed in these cells, it is unclear why it was not detected in the mobility shift assays. The most likely explanation is that the THP-1 factor binds AP-2 consensus sequences in the B2 promoter with a higher affinity than AP-2α, as shown in Fig. 6. When mobility shift assays were performed on THP-1 nuclear extracts using an oligonucleotide probe that binds strongly to purified AP-2α (the hMtIIa BLE site), several protein-DNA complexes were formed, one of which was nearly identical in size to the complex formed with recombinant AP-2α. In experiments using the site 1 or site 5 probes, a barely detectable protein-DNA complex was occasionally present with the same mobility as the AP-2α·hMtIIa BLE complex, but it was not observed reproducibly enough to allow determination of its identity. Although these studies have not excluded the possibility that AP-2α has a role in B2 transcription in vivo, our experiments suggest that the THP-1 factor identified here is the predominant activator of the B2 promoter in cells of the monocytic lineage. Preliminary studies indicate that a factor similar to the one described here is present in differentiated bone marrow and spleen cell cultures enriched for osteoclasts (data not shown). Efforts to purify this factor and determine its identity are in progress. The B2 isoform of the vacuolar H+-ATPase appears to be a “housekeeping” gene product, residing in the V-ATPases that acidify the intracellular membranes of vertebrate cells (8Gluck S.L. Underhill D.M. Iyori M. Holliday L.S. Kostrominova T.Y. Lee B.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 427-445Google Scholar, 16Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl.

Many housekeeping genes contain G + C-rich TATA-less promoters, similar to the B2 subunit promoter. In contrast to most housekeeping genes, however, the V-ATPase B2 subunit is highly expressed in a small population of cells that are specialized for proton secretion, such as macrophages, osteoclasts, and the renal proximal tubule, in cells that maintain high rates of endocytosis and exocytosis, including macrophages and proximal tubule cells, and in cells that require V-ATPase activity for solute transport, such as neurons. AP-2-like proteins may provide a mechanism by which amplified expression of the V-ATPase may occur in specific cell types. It is perhaps not coincidental that the kidney and brain, which express high levels of B2 mRNA, also express very high levels of AP-2 proteins during development and in adulthood. Our studies may have identified a unique transcription factor, binding to AP-2 sites, that confers the capacity for cells to maintain high levels of B2 expression. We thank Dr. Kenneth Murphy for use of the luminometer, K. Amanda Wilson for technical support, and Dr. Reinhard Buettner for helpful discussions."

The acrosomal reaction is a multifusion process that permits the release of hydrolytic enzymes, which are required for spermatozoa to penetrate the acellular layers surrounding the oocyte (24Yanagimachi R. Knobil Neill E. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1988: 135-186Google Scholar). Although several studies have been undertaken to characterize the PLA2 present in the spermatozoa and seminal plasma of various species (25Antaki P. Guérette P. Chapdelaine A. Roberts K.D. Biol.

Commun. 1991; 178: 1505-1511Google Scholar) so as to conclusively assign it to a particular PLA2 group. The enzyme was found to be a 14-kDa protein, identical to the synovial enzyme (32Hara S. Kudo I. Matsuta K. Miyamoto T. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 326-328Google Scholar), suggesting the same might be true of other mammalian species. In bovine seminal secretions, the enzyme was partially purified, but was not characterized enough to assign it to a particular PLA2 group (30Rönkkö S. Lahtinen R. Vanha-Perttula T. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 595-603Google Scholar). To determine the exact type(s) of PLA2 present in bovine seminal plasma and to assess the generality of the occurrence of sPLA2 in mammalian seminal plasma, we purified and characterized the major PLA2 activity from bovine seminal plasma. Sephacryl S-300, butyl-Sepharose Fast Flow, and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Baie d'Urfée, Québec, Canada). Electrophoresis reagents (including ampholytes) were obtained from Bio-Rad. Heparin, gossypol, and p-bromophenacyl bromide were from Sigma. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) (L-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl (specific activity of 55.6 mCi/mmol) and L-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl (specific activity of 52.6 mCi/mmol)) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (L-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl (specific activity of 55.6 mCi/mmol)) were obtained from New England Nuclear (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The scintillation fluid (Universol) was purchased from ICN (Montreal). Aluminum-backed silica gel TLC plates were from Whatman (Maidstone, United Kingdom). Recombinant PLA2 (porcine pancreatic and Crotalus atrox) were from Sigma. Dialysis membranes were from Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc. (Houston, TX). Ultrafiltration membranes were from Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers. Bovine semen was a generous gift from the Centre d'Insémination Artificiel du Québec (St.-Hyacinthe, Québec, Canada). Enzymatic activity was assayed using sn-2-radiolabeled 2-arachidonyl-PE unless specified otherwise. The substrate (20,000 cpm/tube, 1.7 μM) was evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4) containing 10 mM sodium deoxycholate. The substrate solution was vortexed and mixed for 20 min. Ten μl of substrate solution was added to each assay tube. A typical reaction mixture (final volume of 100 μl) consisted of 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM sodium deoxycholate in buffer A. After 30 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) containing 2 μg/ml fatty acid tracer and 50 μl of 4 M KCl. The assay tubes were then centrifuged, and the lower phase was applied onto a silica TLC plate, which was then developed in petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid (85:15:1). The fatty acids were visualized with iodine, and the stained spots were cut into scintillation vials. The scintillation fluid was then added, and the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Pools of bovine ejaculates were centrifuged at low speed (300 × g) to remove spermatozoa. The supernatant was then preserved at −20°C and used for purification within 2 weeks. Ten ml of frozen seminal plasma was thawed, adjusted to 0.1 M choline chloride, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded (2 ml/min) on a 2.5 × 10-cm butyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1 M choline chloride. The column was then washed at 7 ml/min with 700 ml of equilibration buffer followed by 350 ml of 5 M urea in buffer A (Fraction I). Fraction I was concentrated by ultrafiltration (pore size of 10,000; Amicon, Inc.) and applied to a 1.5 × 110-cm Sephacryl S-300 column (4°C) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.15 M choline and 0.15 M NaCl. Fractions (5.8 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The fractions under the activity peak were pooled and concentrated (Fraction II). Calibration of the column was performed under the same conditions by passing RNase A, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin. Fraction II was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (1 × 1 cm) coupled to a fast protein liquid chromatography system and equilibrated in buffer A (without NaN3) containing 0.2 M NaCl. The active fractions were eluted with a 0.2-1 M NaCl gradient in buffer A. Fractions (1 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A partially purified (190-fold) fraction, obtained by an alternative lower yield approach, was preserved at −20°C in 25% glycerol and used for all characterization studies unless otherwise specified. The substrate used was arachidonyl-PE unless specified otherwise. The following buffers were used for pH dependence studies: pH 4-5, 50 mM sodium acetate; pH 6.5-7, 50 mM MES; pH 7.5-8.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl; pH 9-10.5, 50 mM ethanolamine; and pH 11-11.5, 50 mM CAPS. The reaction was carried out at 22°C. Isoelectric focusing was performed at 22°C for 7000 V-h on a post Sephacryl S-300 aliquot adjusted to 5 M urea and 2% ampholytes. The gel rods (0.3 × 13 cm) consisted of 4% acrylamide, 2% ampholytes, pH 3-10, 2% Triton X-100, and 5 M urea. After completion of the electrophoresis, the gel rod was cut into 24 pieces, and proteins were eluted in 500 μl of H2O/piece at 4°C for 16 h on an orbital shaker. For inhibition studies, PLA2-containing fractions were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of inhibitor dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (pBPB and gossypol) or H2O (dithiothreitol (DTT)) for 3 h (pBPB) or for 30 min (gossypol or DTT) at 37°C in buffer A. The sample was diluted 10 times prior to the enzymatic assay so that the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the assay tube was 1%. During purification, protein concentration in each fraction was estimated by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. Protein content in pooled fractions was determined according to Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). PAGE was performed on a 6% gel according to Kramer et al. (35Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the various protein bands was determined with the low molecular mass calibration kit from Pharmacia Biotech. Proteins were visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (36Chen H. Cheng H. Bjerknes M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 295-296Google Scholar). Seminal plasma was first passed through a butyl-Sepharose resin (Fig. 1a). Extensive washing (14 column volumes) was required to remove all the weakly adsorbed proteins. The urea-desorbed fractions (Fraction I) contained most of the recovered activity. Fraction I was concentrated and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 gel sieving column (Fig. 1b). A single active peak was obtained whose elution position corresponded to the behavior of a 100-kDa protein as determined by calibration of the column. The active peak was then concentrated and applied onto a Q-Sepharose ion exchanger. The activity was again eluted in one major activity peak, which well overlapped the protein pattern (Fraction III). The purification results are summarized in Table I. This scheme resulted in a purification of 330-fold with a 45% recovery of the activity.Table IPurification summaryStepActivityProteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationunitsmgunits/mg%-foldSeminal plasma24,000730331001Butyl-Sepharose FF (I)28,0006.64,200120130Sephacryl S-300 (II)32,0003.98,200130250Q-Sepharose FF (III)11,0001.011,00045330 Open table in a new tab The active fractions from the successive purification steps were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) under reducing conditions. After a single purification step (Fraction I; lane 3), a main component at 60 kDa is visible. This component then persists throughout until the end of the purification procedure, where it is the only major band detectable by Coomassie Blue staining (Fraction III; lane 5). Fraction III was subjected to PAGE. Measurement of the activity eluted from the gel slices revealed that it was recovered at a position corresponding to the protein (Fig. 3). In a manner similar to most phospholipases characterized thus far, the enzyme was calcium-dependent and was maximally active at ∼2 mM calcium (Fig. 4a), while analysis of the pH dependence of the activity revealed a single activity maximum at pH 6.5 (Fig. 4b). Purified PLA2 was resistant to pBPB, whereas the two positive controls, porcine pancreatic and C. atrox PLA2, were inhibited (Fig. 5a). Seminal PLA2 was inhibited by gossypol at inhibitor concentrations higher than those required to inhibit crotal PLA2, but similar to those required to inhibit the porcine pancreatic enzyme (Fig. 5b). The porcine enzyme and seminal PLA2 also shared similar sensitivities to the thiol reagent DTT (Fig. 5c); the sensitivity of the crotal enzyme toward DTT was not investigated in this study. To determine the pI of PLA2, isoelectric focusing of a partially purified enzyme was performed (Fig. 6). The gel rod was cut into 24 pieces, which were then left to elute in H2O. The supernatants were assayed for PLA2 activity, and their pH was measured. Several (n = 8) such experiments revealed a single activity peak at pH 5.6 ± 0.07 (mean ± S.E.). Typical activity recoveries on the order of 10-20% were obtained. The true recovery is expected to be higher since the Triton X-100 concentration in the supernatants (∼0.001% final concentration) inhibited the activity of a partially purified fraction by ∼50% (data not shown). The substrate specificity was studied in the presence of phospholipid micelles consisting of either PC or PE and deoxycholate or Triton X-100. As summarized in Table II, PLA2 was 2 orders of magnitude more active toward the deoxycholate-containing substrate than toward the Triton X-100-containing substrate or vesicular substrate (data not shown). In the presence of deoxycholate, the enzyme discriminated between the sn-2-fatty acid as it was less active toward PC carrying linoleoyl (1111 ± 98) than arachidonyl (1716 ± 73). For a given sn-2-side chain, no selectivity was observed between PE/deoxycholate- or PC/deoxycholate-containing micelles as both substrates were hydrolyzed at similar rates, suggesting that the enzyme shows little, if any, head group specificity in this assay system. When micelles comprising Triton X-100 were used, however, head group specificities were observed. The ethanolamine phospholipid was cleaved more efficiently than the corresponding choline phospholipid (56 ± 5.8 versus 17 ± 1.5), although the total amount hydrolyzed remained much lower than when deoxycholate was present. Interestingly, the side chain specificity observed with deoxycholate-containing micelles was reversed when Triton X-100 micelles were used, as linoleyl was then preferred over arachidonyl (48 ± 1.7 versus 17 ± 1.5).Table IISubstrate specificityPhospholipidEnzymatic activityDeoxycholate (1 mM)Triton X-100 (0.01%)Arachidonyl-PE2,000 ± 3256 ± 5.8Arachidonyl-PC1,700 ± 7317 ± 1.5Linoleoyl-PC1,100 ± 9848 ± 1.7 Open table in a new tab The seminal PLA2 activity bound specifically to the butyl-Sepharose resin, thus permitting a 130-fold purification in a single step. Choline had to be included throughout this step to prevent the heparin-binding proteins, the main component of bovine seminal plasma (37Manjunath P. Soubeyrand S. Chandonnet L. Roberts K.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 121-128Google Scholar), from strongly binding to the resin. Rechromatography of the unadsobed fraction did not permit further binding of the activity, thus suggesting the presence of another form of PLA2, which was not further investigated in this study. Chromatography on both gel filtration and ion-exchange resins (Fig. 1, b and c) resulted in activity and protein absorbance patterns that eluted closely together, indicating that the major protein (absorbance at 280 nm) was also responsible for the activity. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, a major 60-kDa band was visible in both chromatographic runs (Fig. 2). Further confirmation that the 60-kDa band was responsible for the activity was obtained by PAGE. Fractions that consisted of eluates of gel slices were assayed for PLA2 activity, and again, the band intensity and the corresponding enzymatic activity variations matched closely (Fig. 3). Gel filtration revealed that the activity behaved as a 100-kDa protein (Fig. 1b), whereas SDS-PAGE analysis showed a 60-kDa band (Fig. 2). This discrepancy might be attributed to dimerization of the 60-kDa enzyme. This dimer appears stable since moderately stringent conditions (0.1% deoxycholate or 5 M urea) failed to shift the elution position of PLA2 (data not shown). Since the omission of 2-mercaptoethanol did not change its behavior on SDS-PAGE (data not shown), it appears that the interaction is noncovalent. Consistent with the dimer hypothesis, the enzyme behaves on native PAGE as a much larger protein than bovine serum albumin despite a very similar pI (Fig. 3). Binding to Q-Sepharose at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1c) as well as isoelectric focusing (Fig. 6) indicate that the enzyme is acidic. In comparison, most mammalian sPLA2 are neutral to basic proteins, with one notable exception (10Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Google Scholar). cPLA2, on the other hand, possess pI values similar to those of the seminal enzyme (Fig. 6) (8Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Google Scholar, 35Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Google Scholar). Besides this similarity, however, the seminal enzyme shares little in common with cPLA2. Using two different assay systems, the seminal enzyme did not show the characteristic specificity for arachidonylphospholipids found in high molecular mass PLA2. In the Triton X-100 assay system, the seminal plasma PLA2 activity toward sn-2-arachidonyl was ∼3-fold lower than the activity toward linoleyl, whereas cPLA2, in a similar assay system, displayed a 3-fold higher activity (5Clark J.D. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7708-7712Google Scholar). Moreover, while cPLA2 is inhibited by deoxycholate micelles relative to sonicated vesicles (4Kim D.K. Bonventre J.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 261-270Google Scholar), the reverse is observed for the seminal enzyme (data not shown). The resistance of the enzyme to pBPB supports the view that this enzyme is novel. pBPB inactivates sPLA2 by alkylating a histidine residue located in the active site of the enzyme (38Volwerk J.J. Pieterson W.A. de Haas G.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1446-1454Google Scholar). It also inactivates cPLA2 (39Winkler J.D. McCarte-Roshak A. Huang L. Sung C.-M. Bolognese B. Marshall L.A. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1994; 10: 315-330Google Scholar) by an unknown mechanism, which is likely to be quite different from sPLA2 since cPLA2 does not possess an active-site histidine (3Sharp J.D. White D.L. Chiou X.G. Goodson T. Gamboa G.C. Mclure D. Burget S. Hoskins J. Skatrud P.L. Sportsman J.R. Becker G.W. Kang L.H. Roberts E.F. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14850-14853Google Scholar). At the pBPB concentrations used, both enzyme types should be inactivated, and yet, the seminal enzyme is unaffected. As expected, the two PLA2 controls, the type I porcine pancreatic and the type II C. atrox enzymes, were inactivated (Fig. 5a). The greater resilience of the crotal enzyme is most likely due to its tendency to shield its active site through dimerization (40Brunie S. Bolin J. Gewirth D. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9742-9749Google Scholar, 41Renetseder R. Brunie S. Dijkstra B.W. Drenth J. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11627-11634Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that seminal PLA2 possesses a histidine or some other susceptible residue in its active site, which would be completely shielded from the environment in the absence of substrate and/or Ca2+. Despite this resistance, some common structural features between pancreatic and seminal PLA2 are suggested by the inhibition patterns of DTT and gossypol. The pancreatic enzyme is inhibited by gossypol at concentrations very close to those required to inhibit the porcine enzyme (Fig. 5b). Although the precise structural modifications induced by gossypol are unknown, the similar concentrations required to inhibit pancreatic PLA2 and the seminal enzyme suggest some common structural elements. This resemblance appears to be quite specific as the inhibition pattern of the crotal enzyme, which shares strong structural homologies with the pancreatic enzyme (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Google Scholar, 2Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 53-88Google Scholar), is completely different. The shared DTT sensitivities (Fig. 5c) further support the view that common features between mammalian sPLA2 and seminal PLA2 exist. Biochemical characterization revealed that seminal PLA2 shows catalytic properties common to most sPLA2 identified so far: the enzyme is Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 4a) and is optimally active in the neutral to alkaline pH range (Fig. 4b) (42Mayer R.J. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Google Scholar). The substrate selectivity profile of purified PLA2 is also reminiscent of mammalian sPLA2 (43Kinkaid A.R. Wilton D.C. Biochem J. 1995; 308: 507-518Google Scholar, 44Borgström B. Lipids. 1993; 28: 371-375Google Scholar). For instance, these enzymes are activated by the introduction of negative charges (as with deoxycholate versus Triton X-100) in the lipid substrate, most likely due to the accumulation of positive charges near the phospholipid-binding site (45Scott D.L. Mandel A.M. Sigler P.B. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 493-504Google Scholar). In the absence of deoxycholate, for a given acyl side chain, they are more active toward the anionic phospholipid PE than toward the zwitterionic phospholipid PC (43Kinkaid A.R. Wilton D.C. Biochem J. 1995; 308: 507-518Google Scholar). Beside these catalytic similarities, major structural differences appear to exist between these enzymes. For instance, mammalian sPLA2 are low molecular mass (14-20 kDa) and mostly basic proteins, whereas the seminal enzyme possesses a 60-kDa mass and an acidic pI. Pancreatic PLA2 and the human seminal/synovial enzyme demonstrate affinity for heparin (46Nakamura H. Kim D.K. Philbin D.M. Peterson M.B. Debros F. Koski G. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1062-1070Google Scholar, 47Rönkkö S. Räsänen M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 987-992Google Scholar, 48Hara S. Kudo I. Chang H.W. Matsuta K. Miyamoto T. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 395-399Google Scholar), while bovine seminal PLA2 does not (data not shown). Moreover, sPLA2 are resistant to acidic conditions as relatively good recoveries are routinely obtained following chromatography performed under acidic conditions (49Bennett C.F. McCarte A. Crooke S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1047: 271-283Google Scholar, 50Minami T. Tojo H. Shinomura Y. Matsuzama Y. Okamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 125-130Google Scholar, 51Nakaguchi K. Nishijima J. Ogawa M. Mori T. Tojo H. Yamano T. Okamoto M. Enzyme (Basel). 1986; 35: 2-12Google Scholar), whereas the major PLA2 activity found in seminal plasma is acid-labile (data not shown). The seminal enzyme displays a specific activity (under suboptimal conditions) of ∼0.01 μmol/min/mg, which is rather low compared with that of low molecular mass PLA2 (for instance, ∼40 and 1500 μmol/min/mg for bovine pancreatic and Naja naja venom PLA2, respectively) or with that of cPLA2 (∼0.6 μmol/min/mg) (4Kim D.K. Bonventre J.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 261-270Google Scholar). The activity range of these well characterized PLA2 thus covers 5 orders of magnitude. The resistance of seminal PLA2 to pBPB (Fig. 5a) might indicate that it acts via a different, less efficient catalytic mechanism than the established enzymes. The lower catalytic efficiency of bovine seminal PLA2 could be required for its proper function in seminal plasma. Alternatively, it could possess some yet undetermined advantages over other types of PLA2 that would render it better suited to the particularity of the bovine reproductive physiology. These results differ significantly from those reported previously concerning bovine (30Rönkkö S. Lahtinen R. Vanha-Perttula T. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 595-603Google Scholar) or human (28Wurl M. Kunze H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 834: 411-418Google Scholar, 29Kunze H. Nahas N. Wurl M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 348: 35-44Google Scholar, 31Takayama K. Hara S. Kudo I. Inoue K. Biochem.

Gamete Res. 1988; 19: 305-314Google Scholar) seminal plasma PLA2. The major human seminal plasma PLA2 has been found to be identical to the synovial enzyme (31Takayama K. Hara S. Kudo I. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1505-1511Google Scholar, 32Hara S. Kudo I. Matsuta K. Miyamoto T. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 326-328Google Scholar). A minor form that was not recognized by the anti-synovial PLA2 antibody was also reported (31Takayama K. Hara S. Kudo I. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1505-1511Google Scholar). In the bovine species, the preliminary characterization of the enzyme published previously (30Rönkkö S. Lahtinen R. Vanha-Perttula T. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 595-603Google Scholar) did not permit any definitive conclusions to be drawn as to the nature of the seminal enzyme. Two different enzymatic activities were partially purified from seminal vesicle secretions. SDS-PAGE of the most purified fraction showed a doublet migrating as 14-16-kDa proteins. This enzyme may represent a minor PLA2 form. The human prostate enzyme has also been partially purified and characterized (53Rönkkö S. Prostate. 1993; 22: 265-276Google Scholar). Overall, its biochemical properties appear to be quite distinct from those of bovine seminal plasma PLA2. The activities found in bovine, ram, and porcine seminal plasma amount to ∼1, 10, and 0.03%, respectively, of the human seminal plasma PLA2 activity (29Kunze H. Nahas N. Wurl M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 348: 35-44Google Scholar), suggesting that qualitative differences might exist between the PLA2 types found in these species. The structural characterization of the enzyme that is currently underway should reveal the reasons behind these differences. We are grateful to Dr. Kenneth D. Roberts for proofreading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2047937300,"Abstract We have investigated the neutral and basic amino acid transporter (NBAT)-induced transport of L-histidine in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Transport of L-histidine (pH 7.5) was electrogenic and Na+-dependent with a 14-fold increase in L-histidine- (1 mM) evoked current (IHis = −14.7 ± 1.5 nA) in NBAT-expressing oocytes compared with native (water-injected or uninjected) oocytes (−1.0 ± 0.2 nA); the Na+-dependent histidine transport showed a stoichiometry of 1:1 (histidine:sodium). IHis was stereospecific at pH 7.5 and saturable in both NaCl and tetramethylammonium chloride media. L-Histidine (1 mM) at pH 8.5, at which histidine is uncharged, evoked an Na+-independent outward current (11 ± 1.2 nA) in NBAT-expressing oocytes. The total inward 0.1 mM IHis increased from −9 ± 0.8 nA at pH 7.5 to −19 ± 2.6 nA at pH 6.5, at which histidine is predominantly cationic. The increase in IHis from pH 7.5 to 6.5 was found to be almost entirely due to the Na+-independent component. At pH 7.5, L-histidine weakly inhibited the Na+-independent L-arginine uptake; however, this inhibition was much stronger (>90%) at pH 6.5. L-Histidine transport, at pH 7.5, is stimulated by NBAT expression, but unlike L-phenylalanine or L-arginine transport, L-histidine transport is Na+-dependent and stereoselective. The induction of Na+-dependent L-histidine transport in NBAT-expressing oocytes provides new evidence that NBAT stimulates functionally distinct amino acid transporters including Na+-dependent L-histidine and Na+-independent L-arginine and L-phenylalanine transporters. The parallel induction of two different mechanisms argues that NBAT is not an amino acid transporter itself but, instead, is a transport-activating protein for a range of amino acid translocases."
https://openalex.org/W2058202322,"The interaction of GroEL with urea-unfolded dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been studied in the presence of DHFR substrates by investigating the ability of GroES to release enzyme under conditions where a stable GroES-GroEL-DHFR ternary complex can be formed. In these circumstances, GroES could only partially discharge the DHFR if ADP was present in the solution and approximately half of the DHFR remained bound on the chaperonin. This bound DHFR could be rescued by addition of ATP and KCl into the refolding mixture. The stable ternary complex did not show any significant protection of bound DHFR against proteolysis by Proteinase K. These results are in contrast to those observed with the GroEL-DHFR complex formed by thermal inactivation of DHFR at 45°C in which GroES addition leads to partial protection of bound DHFR. Thus, the method of presentation influences the properties of the bound intermediates. It is suggested that the ability of GroES to bind on the same side of the GroEL double toroid as the target protein and displace it into the central cavity depends on the way the protein-substrate is presented to the GroEL molecule. Therefore, the compact folding intermediate formed by thermal unfolding can be protected against proteolysis after GroES binds to form a ternary complex. In addition, structural changes within GroEL induced by the experimental conditions may contribute to differences in the properties of the complexes. The more open urea-unfolded DHFR binds on the surface of chaperonin and can be displaced into solution by the tighter binding GroES molecule. It is suggested that the state of the unfolded protein when it is presented to GroEL determines the detailed mechanism of its assisted refolding.

The chaperonin GroEL, 1The abbreviations used are:GroELmolecular chaperone 60GroESmolecular chaperone 10DHFRbovine dihydrofolate reductaseH2FdihydrofolateβME2-mercaptoethanol. together with the co-chaperonin GroES, has been shown to facilitate protein folding (1Ellis R.J. Van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial step of the chaperonin-assisted folding cycle is interaction of the unfolded polypeptide with GroEL (2Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 20: 13044-13049Google Scholar). The mechanism of the subsequent release of the bound protein from the complex has been studied intensively (3Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 633-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L.

GroEL is an oligomer in which its 14 identical subunits are arranged as two, stacked, 7-membered rings to form a cylindrical structure with a central cavity. It has been shown that during the chaperonin cycle two distinct types (cis and trans) of the GroEL-GroES-protein substrate complex can be formed (4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In case of the trans complex, unfolded polypeptide is bound to the GroEL ring opposite to the ring occupied by GroES. Release and rebinding of GroES during the chaperonin cycle results in formation of a cis complex in which the GroES is bound on the same GroEL ring occupied by the protein-substrate (4Weissman J.S.

When this cis complex is formed, it has been suggested that the unfolded polypeptide is displaced into the central cavity which is capped by the bound GroES, thus placing the previously bound protein in a protected space. It has been suggested that final release of the protein-substrate occurs from the cis complex only (4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 7Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These studies have used unfolded proteins that have high affinity for GroEL and require for successful folding the complete chaperonin system including co-chaperonin GroES, ATP, and KCl. There are several proteins that are able to at least partially dissociate from their complexes with GroEL without ATP hydrolysis (8Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Corrales F.J. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins generally display low affinity for GroEL. It has been suggested that both GroES and the target proteins use linked binding sites on the surface of GroEL (11Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Assuming that the strength of GroEL-GroES interaction does not depend on the nature of the protein-substrate, one can suggest that the diverse proteins that bind to GroEL represent a spectrum of binding affinities for GroEL relative to the binding affinity for GroES. Further, a single protein may fold (or misfold) through multiple states that have different affinities for GroEL. In the present study, possible differences in the mechanisms of chaperonin interactions for weak and tight binding proteins have been explored by comparing interactions of urea- and heat-unfolded bovine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). molecular chaperone 60 molecular chaperone 10 bovine dihydrofolate reductase dihydrofolate 2-mercaptoethanol. GroEL was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (12Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Bovine DHFR, Proteinase K, dihydrofolate (H2F), NADPH, ATP, and ADP were purchased from Sigma. DHFR was unfolded by dialyzing against 8 M urea (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mMβME) for at least 2 h at room temperature. Protein concentration of DHFR was determined spectrophotometrically based on the extinction coefficient at 280 nm reported as 27,280 cm−1M−1 (13Kaufman B.T. Kemerer V.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Urea-unfolded DHFR was rapidly diluted into buffer A (50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mMβME, 0.1 mM H2F, and 0.075 mM NADPH, pH 7.8) with or without GroEL and nucleotide as described in the individual figure legends. Final concentrations of the enzyme varied from 0.24 to 0.3 μM. The concentration of the GroEL was varied from 0 to 1.2 μM, and the final urea concentration did not exceed 0.5 M. The solution was mixed, and, after a 1-min incubation at room temperature, enzyme activity was analyzed by the decrease in the NADPH concentration detected spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. In some experiments, GroES (final concentration varied from 0 to 1.2 μM) was added to the refolding solution after 30 s of incubation. The enzyme activity was detected as above after an additional 30-s incubation. Resulting data were analyzed in terms of the initial rate of the reaction. Urea-unfolded DHFR was rapidly diluted to buffer A (50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mMβME, pH 7.8) with or without GroEL. Final concentrations of the proteins were: 0.24 μM DHFR and 0.277 μM GroEL. The final concentration of urea did not exceed 0.6 M. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was applied on a Superose 12 gel filtration column (1.5 × 30 cm, flow rate 1 ml/min) equilibrated with buffer A without βME. Fractions containing GroEL were collected, pooled, and concentrated using Ultrafree-MC concentration units with 30,000 cutoff (Millipore). SDS Laemmli gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the presence of DHFR in these fractions. GroES was added to some solutions to a final concentration of 0.7 μM. ADP was added to all solutions to give a final concentration of 2 mM. Proteinase K was then added to 0.2% of the total protein (w/w), and the solution was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, after which the reaction was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 3 mM. Solutions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, boiled, and analyzed on the 12% SDS Laemmli gel system. Protein was visualized by silver staining (14Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). The density of the protein bands was analyzed using NIH Image software. Bovine DHFR was unfolded in 8 M urea. Dilution of the unfolded material to the buffer, containing no denaturant, results in fast unassisted refolding, detected as an appearance of enzymatic activity of the native protein. The kinetics of NADPH oxidation by dihydrofolate, catalyzed by native DHFR, have been used in this study to analyze the amount of successfully folded enzyme in solution. As shown in Fig. 1, introduction of GroEL to the refolding solution results in a decrease of the enzyme activity. A similar result has been reported for the mouse DHFR whose refolding can be completely arrested upon binding to GroEL (8Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that almost 80% of DHFR can be captured at 1:1 ratio of GroEL to the unfolded DHFR whether or not ADP is present in solution. The GroEL-DHFR complex slowly dissociates (data not shown and 8Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Under conditions when enzyme substrates (NADPH and dihydrofolate) are present in the solution, considerable dissociation was detected after 1 h of incubation (data not shown). The mouse DHFR-GroEL complex has been reported to completely dissociate after 3 h of incubation under similar conditions (8Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the enzyme exists in dynamic equilibrium between free and bound states. As with several other proteins, the addition of ATP alone can lead to the release of fully active bovine DHFR from its complex with GroEL. These weakly bound proteins contrast with the class of tightly bound proteins, like rhodanese (2Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 20: 13044-13049Google Scholar), 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase (15Brandsch R. Bichler V. Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ornithine transcarbamylase (16Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These latter proteins require the presence of the complete chaperonin system, including the co-chaperonin GroES, in order to be successfully released. The presence of GroES, although not required, does facilitate dissociation of DHFR from the GroEL-DHFR complex (8Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that GroEL can arrest approximately 72% of the spontaneous folding of DHFR (open squares, Fig. 2). Addition of GroES to the preformed GroEL-DHFR complex results in partial discharge of the active enzyme (closed squares, Fig. 2). The amount of the released protein increases up to about 1:1 the ratio of GroES to GroEL-DHFR complex. Subsequent addition of GroES does not result in any considerable change of the free enzyme concentration. The maximum level of DHFR released (65%) represents about 50% of the total protein that had been captured by GroEL (Fig. 2). The remaining half of the captured enzyme could be released upon addition of ATP and KCl, producing a 95% yield of active protein. As a control, a similar titration of GroES to the GroEL-DHFR complex with no nucleotide present in the solution was carried out. Since the GroEL-GroES interaction is not possible under this condition (data not shown and 4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), no significant discharge of the DHFR over a control sample was observed within the time of this experiment. The presence of a nucleotide is not required for the binding of an unfolded protein-substrate to GroEL (Fig. 1; 2Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 20: 13044-13049Google Scholar). Therefore, a random distribution of the bound nucleotide (ADP) relative to the site of the unfolded polypeptide binding on two GroEL toroids can result in two distinct types of GroES-GroEL interactions (4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Thus, GroES binding can occur on the same toroid (cis) where protein-substrate is bound or on the opposite site (trans) of the GroEL oligomer. These two complexes can be distinguished by using protease digestion analysis as was reported earlier (4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In the present study, two different methods were used to form the GroEL-DHFR complex. In the first case, DHFR was unfolded in 8 M urea for 15 h before dilution in the presence of GroEL. In the second case, the complex was formed by heating together GroEL and native DHFR at 45°C for 10 min as reported earlier (7Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Complexes were purified using size exclusion chromatography, and fractions containing GroEL were collected and concentrated. Solutions were supplemented with ADP and GroES (when needed). Digestion analysis was performed using Proteinase K (final concentration 0.2% w/w). Two different results were observed. While unfolded DHFR can be partially (42 ± 5%) protected by GroEL-GroES interaction if the GroEL-DHFR complex was preformed by heat denaturation (Fig. 3, lane 7), no protection could be detected if the complex was formed by addition of urea-unfolded protein (Fig. 3, lane 3). The positive controls, containing GroEL-DHFR complexes, formed by using urea or heat-denatured enzyme and consequently treated with ADP and GroES, but not Proteinase K, are shown in lanes 1 and 6, respectively. These results suggest that, due to the considerable differences in the protein conformation between chemically and thermally unfolded protein, the resulting GroEL-protein complexes have different properties, leading to the different mechanism of the GroES-facilitated protein release. Several different mechanisms have been suggested for the function of the GroEL-GroES system (4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 6Clarke A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The release of the bound polypeptide from its complex with GroEL is one of the central steps that such a mechanism must address. Several aspects of these mechanisms are based on the ability to form relatively stable complexes involving GroEL in the presence of ADP. It was demonstrated (7Mayhew M. da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) that ternary complexes containing DHFR, GroEL, and GroES could be formed by thermal denaturation and that a significant fraction of the bound DHFR was protected against Proteinase K digestion. This was taken to imply that GroES could bind in one of two ways to the complex. First, GroES could bind over the central cavity of GroEL on the same toroid as DHFR (cis), thus capping the complex and ejecting the DHFR into the chamber formed from the central cavity in the GroEL toroid and the overlying GroES dome; or second, GroES could bind on the toroid opposite to the bound DHFR (trans) leaving the DHFR on the surface. In this model, the DHFR in the cis complex is protected from Proteinase K, while that in the trans complex can be proteolyzed. The present results are consistent with the observations for the thermally denatured protein, but the results are quite different for the urea-unfolded DHFR. While nearly 50% of DHFR can be protected by GroEL-GroES interaction in the former case, no protection was detected in the case of urea-unfolded protein-substrate (Fig. 3). Thus, it is clear that the complexes formed in these different ways have different characteristics. In contrast to the thermally produced complex, the urea complex can be partially discharged by GroES, and the undischarged part of the bound DHFR is sensitive to Proteinase K digestion. The considerable conformational differences between heat- and chemically unfolded protein can explain this phenomenon. DHFR in 8 M urea is likely to be fully unfolded, and the collapsed states that form on dilution could bind extensively to the binding sites on one of the two GroEL toroids. These extensive surfaces and the rapid collapse of the DHFR on dilution would favor binding close to the surface of the chaperonin. This surface location would be favored by the fact that the protein is introduced to a relatively unperturbed GroEL molecule. Since protein binding and GroES binding appear to involve the same or similar sites, peripheral binding of DHFR would lead to a weak complex in which cis GroES binding could release DHFR into the bulk solution by direct displacement. The trans ternary complex would be relatively stable in the presence of ADP. Thus, urea-unfolded DHFR would form a complex with GroEL, and GroES would release 50% by direct displacement and leave 50% as a trans complex that is susceptible to Proteinase K. Thermally produced DHFR-GroEL complexes are different from complexes formed using urea-denatured DHFR. Thermal experiments that demonstrate the complex are performed by heating DHFR together with GroEL at 45°C, so that thermal effects on both DHFR and GroEL must be considered. Bovine DHFR has a thermal transition with a midpoint at ∼50°C (17Sasso S. Protasevich I. Gilli R. Makarov A. Briand C. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1995; 12: 1023-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), so the 45°C incubation does not lead to fully heat-denatured protein. In addition, many proteins, even after complete thermal denaturation, still contain significant ordered structures that can be unfolded further (18Aune K.C. Slahuddin A. Zarlengo M.H. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4486-4489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, GroEL itself has been reported to undergo two thermal transitions between 25 and 35°C (19Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6286-6289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so that temperature-induced formation of complexes influences the structure of GroEL. This suggestion is supported by the observation that there are proteolytic bands that must come from GroEL after proteolytic treatment of the thermally induced complexes (Fig. 3). It is possible, then, that heating DHFR in the presence of GroEL results in small, partially unfolded structures that can bind inside of the perturbed GroEL cavity. Then, the subsequent addition of GroES can result in forming a capped cis complex as described previously. The heating together of DHFR and GroEL is important, since the control experiments that have been carried out in the present study showed that no complexes between GroEL and DHFR can be formed when GroEL is preheated at 45°C for 10 min and then added to native DHFR at 25°C (data not shown). When DHFR was heated in the absence of GroEL, a precipitate formed, and the protein that remained in the solution could not be captured by GroEL at 25°C. The present data support the concept that the ability of the unfolded polypeptide to form a stable complex with GroEL at different steps of its folding pathway can influence the detailed mechanism of its assisted refolding. This would be in keeping with suggestions that chaperonin-facilitated folding can be modulated by the properties of both the protein-substrate and the GroEL (20Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J.

We have previously derived two retroviruses, T6 and NM1, coding for oncogenic Gag-insulin receptor and Gag-insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFR) fusion proteins, respectively.

To identify sequences affecting dimerization and the effect of dimerization on signaling and biological functions, we generated recombinants exchanging the extracellular and transmembrane sequences among the three fusion receptors.

Typically, these receptors are characterized by an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a cytoplasmic domain containing the PTK catalytic sequence. Ligand binding results in receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, kinase activation, and phosphorylation of cellular substrates leading to gene activation and ultimately proliferation or differentiation of cells. For most receptor PTKs the immediate event upon ligand binding is the dimerization of the receptors, which are predominantly monomeric in their inactive state.

Studies with a truncated EGFR lacking the extracellular domain have shown that it is capable of forming heterodimers with the full-length receptor (9Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Google Scholar) as well as homodimers (10Kwatra M.M. Bigner D.D. Cohn J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 178-181Google Scholar), indicating that the extracellular domain is not necessary for dimerization. It has also been shown that ligand-independent dimerization of EGFR is sufficient for the activation of its kinase activity (11Spaargaren M. Defize L.H.K. Boonstra J. de Laat S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1733-1739Google Scholar, 12Sorokin A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1531-1540Google Scholar). In addition, studies of the oncogenic ErbB2, an EGFR-related receptor PTK, have shown that a point mutation, Glu664 to Val664, in the TM domain results in the stabilization of homodimers and constitutive activation of the receptor (13Bargmann C.L. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Google Scholar, 14Gullick W.J. Bottomly A.C. Lofts F.J. Doak D.G. Mulvey D. Newman R. Crumpton M.J. Sternberg M.J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 43-48Google Scholar). Coexpression of several short ErbB2 transmembrane polypeptides with the native receptor were shown to inhibit dimerization and function of the full-length receptor, suggesting that the TM domain of ErbB2 is involved in its dimerization (15Lofts F.J. Hurst H.C. Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2813-2820Google Scholar). Certain sequences in the TM domains of ErbB2 and a variety of other receptor PTKs have been implicated in mediating dimerization (16Brandt-Rauf P.W. Monaco R. Pincus M.R. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 33-40Google Scholar, 17Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 245-248Google Scholar). The c-Ros, insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR) are three closely related receptor PTKs. In its inactive state, c-Ros, like most receptor PTKs, is monomeric, but it is unknown in which form the activated receptor exists. The avian sarcoma virus UR2 codes for the oncogenic v-Ros, which is a fusion protein of viral Gag and truncated c-Ros (18Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 879-884Google Scholar, 19Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2117-2125Google Scholar). The Gag-Ros fusion receptor is a 68-kDa monomeric protein with the Gag portion protruding extracellularly (20Jong S.-M.J. Wang L.-H. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 7-21Google Scholar). IR and IGFR, however, in the absence of their ligands exist as a heterotetrameric receptor complex consisting of two α and two β subunits linked by disulfide bonds. It is thought that binding of ligand to the α-subunit leads to intermolecular phosphorylation of the opposite β-subunit and activation of its kinase activity (21Lee J. O'Hare T. Pilch P.F. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4092-4098Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that N-terminal truncation of IR or IGFR and fusion of the truncated receptors to retroviral Gag sequences activates their cell-transforming and tumorigenic potential. The retroviruses coding for the highly oncogenic Gag-IR and Gag-IGFR fusion receptors were named T6 and NM1, respectively (22Poon B. Dixon D. Ellis L. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 877-881Google Scholar, 23Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Google Scholar). Both receptors, essentially, have Gag fused to the extracellular boundary of the TM domains of IR and IGFR. Unlike UR2 Gag-Ros, NM1-encoded Gag-IGFR exists as a dimerized transmembrane receptor like the native IGFR. The physical status of T6-encoded Gag-IR is unclear. One of the major differences between the dimeric Gag-IGFR and monomeric Gag-Ros is the length of the Gag sequence fused to the respective receptors. The UR2 Gag-Ros contains 150 amino acids of Gag fused to the seventh amino acid upstream from the TM domain of v-Ros (18Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 879-884Google Scholar). The NM1 Gag-IGFR, on the other hand, has only 48 amino acids of Gag fused to the extracellular boundary of the IGFR TM domain (23Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Google Scholar). This raises a possibility that the Gag sequences in conjunction with the linked respective TM domains may determine the dimeric or monomeric status of the fusion receptors. Whereas the requirement of dimerization for the function of a native RPTK is well established, such a requirement for their oncogenic counterparts remain elusive. Oncogenic Met, in which the Tpr (translocated promoter region) sequence has been directly fused to the Met kinase domain, dimerizes through a leucine zipper motif in the Tpr. Mutation of the leucine zipper motif in the Tpr abolishes dimerization and the oncogenic activity of Met (24Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Google Scholar). Oncogenic Fms and ErbB2 form dimers on the cell surface (13Bargmann C.L. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Google Scholar, 25Roussel M.F. Dull T.J. Rettenmier C.W. Ralph P. Ullrich A.

Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1175-1183Google Scholar). No oncogenic monomeric forms of these receptors have been reported. To determine the signaling specificity and transforming function of monomeric versus dimeric Ros, IR, and IGFR fusion receptors, chimeras among the three have been generated in which the Gag and TM domains are exchanged among them. In addition, deletions of the 3′ Gag of two Gag-IR-derived receptors, so as to render their extracellular sequences similar to that of NM1 Gag-IGFR, were engineered to assess the effect of the Gag sequence on dimerization. Our study has identified the sequences affecting dimerization, signal transduction, and biological function of those oncogenic fusion receptors. The preparation and maintenance of primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) and colony-forming assays were done as described previously (30Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 318-325Google Scholar). The construction of the UR2/NM1 recombinant was done using two DNA fragments obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using pUR2 (31Zong C.S. Poon B. Chen J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6453-6462Google Scholar) as a template, a 5′ oligonucleotide containing a BglII site and a 3′ oligonucleotide coding for the C terminus of the UR2 TM domain and containing a HgaI site were used to clone the Gag and TM domains of UR2 Gag-Ros. To obtain the cytoplasmic region of NM1 Gag-IGFR, a 5′ oligonucleotide coding for a HgaI site and a 3′ oligonucleotide containing a SphI site were used with pNM1 (23Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Google Scholar) as a template. Those two fragments were digested with HgaI and then ligated to generate the UR2/NM1 chimeric DNA. This chimeric fragment was used as the template in a second PCR with the 5′ BglII and 3′ SphI terminal oligonucleotides for amplification. The chimeric DNA was cloned back into pNM1 using the BglII and SphI sites replacing the corresponding fragment. The recombinant receptor plasmid was named pUN. The other recombinants were generated in a similar manner using oligonucleotides designed for each specific chimera. The T6/UR2 and NM1/UR2 chimeric DNAs were individually cloned back into pUR2 using XmaI and EcoRI to give rise to pTU and pNU, respectively. The UR2/T6 and NM1/T6 chimeric DNAs were individually cloned into pT6 (22Poon B. Dixon D. Ellis L. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 877-881Google Scholar) using XmaI and XhoI to generate pUT and pNT, respectively. To delete the 3′ region of Gag, pT6 and pTU were each digested with BamHI to free a 315-base pair fragment, and the remaining plasmid DNAs were recircularized using T4 DNA ligase. The PCR-derived DNAs for all of the constructs were sequenced to confirm the parental sequences and to detect possible PCR errors. For preparation of the rabbit polyclonal anti-IR serum, a polypeptide including the entire catalytic domain of human IR produced in baculovirus and obtained from Ron Kohanski (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) was used. Rabbit polyclonal anti-IGFR and anti-Ros sera have previously been described (32Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 374-385Google Scholar, 33Jong S.-M.J. Zong C.S. Dorai T. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4909-4918Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Shc and recombinant anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (RC20) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal anti-MAP kinase (TR10) was a gift from Michael Weber (University of Virginia). Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (31Zong C.S. Poon B. Chen J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6453-6462Google Scholar). Primary CEFs were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/6-cm dish and incubated for 18-20 h at 37°C. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing 10% calf serum. 50 μl of 2.5 M CaCl2 was added to 450 μl of sterile H2O containing 10 μg each of transforming viral plasmid DNA and SacI-digested UR2AV helper viral DNA (31Zong C.S. Poon B. Chen J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6453-6462Google Scholar). This solution was slowly added to 500 μl of 2 × Hepes-buffered saline (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 280 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, and 12 mM dextrose) that was being aerated. This solution was allowed to sit for 15 min at room temperature and then added to the cells along with chloroquine at a final concentration of 100 μM. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 h, after which they were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with fresh medium. At confluence, the cells were transferred to 10-cm dishes and overlaid with soft agar the next day to select for transformed cells. Culture media were harvested 7-21 days post-transfection as virus stocks. [35S]Methionine metabolic labeling, in vitro kinase, and PI 3-kinase assays were done as described previously (23Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Google Scholar). Tunicamycin treatment and assessment of glycosylation followed those described previously (32Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 374-385Google Scholar). Western analyses were done as before (22Poon B. Dixon D. Ellis L. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 877-881Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, the gel was placed directly onto an electroblotting apparatus and transferred without pretreatment of the gel with transfer buffer (25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, and 20% methanol). The gel was transferred at 100 V for 1 h with an ice block as a cooling chamber. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS-Tween (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 1% Tween 20), the filters were probed with antibody in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The filters were washed in TBS-Tween three times for 20 min at room temperature. If a secondary antibody was required, blocking and binding was repeated as above. After extensive washing to remove nonspecific bound antibodies, the filter was developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 100 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. Alternatively, instead of colorimetric detection, the filter was radiolabeled with 125I-protein A and visualized by autoradiography. Chimeric receptor dimerization was assayed using two methods. In the first method, cells were metabolically labeled as above and extracted with RIPA (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Trasylol) containing 10 mM iodoacetamide. The lysates were immunoprecipitated and processed as before and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, dried, and detected by autoradiography. In the second method, the similarly labeled cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with a mixture of three chemical cross-linkers, disulfosuccinimidyl tartarate, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, and ethylene glycolbis-(sulfosuccinimidyl succinate) (Sulfo-DST, BS3, and Sulfo-EGS with spacer arms of 6.5, 11.4, and 16.1 å, respectively; Pierce), at a concentration of 1 mM each in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37°C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Extractions, immunoprecipitations, separation of proteins, and detection were done as above. Protein extracts were prepared as above and immunoprecipitated with an anti-MAP kinase serum (TR10) overnight at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with RIPA and twice with MAP kinase buffer (10 mM Hepes, 10 mM MgAc). 20 μl of myelin basic protein (2 mg/ml) and 20 μl of reaction mix (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mM MgAc, 150 μM ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added to the immunoprecipitates and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. After pelleting the agarose beads, the supernatant was taken for detection of the phosphorylated myelin basic protein by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Earlier studies have implicated the TM domain in mediating receptor dimerization (14Gullick W.J. Bottomly A.C. Lofts F.J. Doak D.G. Mulvey D. Newman R. Crumpton M.J. Sternberg M.J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 43-48Google Scholar, 15Lofts F.J. Hurst H.C. Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2813-2820Google Scholar, 16Brandt-Rauf P.W. Monaco R. Pincus M.R. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 33-40Google Scholar). The NM1 Gag-IGFR is dimerized, whereas Gag-Ros is not, and the physical state of Gag-IR is not known. To determine the sequence that may account for this difference and to investigate the role of dimerization on signal transduction and cell-transforming function of these three oncogenic RPTKs, various recombinants among the three receptors were constructed (Fig. 1). In those recombinants the Gag and TM domains among the receptors have been swapped. Those chimeras were named UN (UR2/NM1), UT (UR2/T6), NU (NM1/UR2), NT (NM1/T6), and TU (T6/UR2). UN6 and UN7 are parallel clones of the UN recombinant; however, subsequent sequencing of the PCR-derived DNA fragments revealed Y950F and F951S mutations in the IGFR juxtamembrane region in UN7. Comparisons of the extracellular sequences of UR2 and NM1 Gag-RPTK fusion proteins have led to our speculation that multiple cysteines in the Gag sequence may inhibit dimerization of the fusion receptor, since monomeric UR2 Gag-Ros (also the T6 Gag-IR) has a longer Gag and multiple cysteines, whereas dimerized NM1 Gag-IGFR has only 48 amino acids of Gag including two cysteine residues, but they are only 4 amino acids apart. Multiple cysteine residues could favor formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds and preclude intermolecular dimerization. Therefore, deletion mutants removing the 3′ 105 amino acids of Gag p19 in T6 and TU were made to give rise to δgT6 and δgTU, respectively (Fig. 1). Wild type pUR2, pT6, pNM1, or their chimeric recombinants, which are replication-defective, were individually co-transfected with helper virus UR2AV DNA into primary CEFs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The morphological appearance of monolayer cultures was monitored. Virus stocks were collected 7-21 days post-transfection for the subsequent infection of cells. Colony assay were performed using virus-infected cells (Fig. 2). Most of the recombinant chimeras were as potent as their parentals in transforming activity, as reflected in the morphological appearance of the transformed cells in monolayer culture (data not shown) and their ability to form colonies in soft agar (Fig. 2). The exceptions were UN7 and UT, which were essentially unable to promote colony formation, and the infected cells exhibited a flat spindle morphology as opposed to an elongated fusiform morphology characteristic of the cells transformed by their parental viruses, NM1 and T6. UN7 harbors the Y950F and F951S mutations, which may account for its impaired transforming ability. While UN7-infected cells behaved like normal CEF, cells infected with UT, despite their inability to form colonies in soft agar, appeared to grow much faster than normal CEF. A comparison of the growth rates among normal CEF and UT- and T6-infected cells revealed that in F10 medium containing 5% serum, UT- and T6-infected cells grew equally well and about 60% faster than CEF; in 0.5% serum, UT- and T6-infected cells grew 4 and 6 times faster than CEF, respectively (Fig. 3). Therefore, replacing the Gag and TM sequences of T6 with those of UR2 differentially affects the mitogenic versus transforming activity of the Gag-IR fusion receptor. This result implicates strongly the role of the TM domain in the function of a RPTK, since UT differs from T6 essentially in only the swapping of the TM domain. To assess the physical configuration of those fusion receptors, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with their respective antisera and denatured with or without β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer to detect the existence of intermolecular disulfide linkages (Fig. 4A). Chimeric receptors containing the Gag and TM domains of NM1, namely NT and NU, were able to form dimers, while their parentals, T6 and UR2 proteins, were unable to. Conversely when the UR2 Gag and TM domains were used to replace those of NM1, the resulting UN receptors were not able to dimerize. Swapping the Gag and TM domains between T6 and UR2, generating TU and UT recombinants, had no effect on their monomeric status. However, when 3′ Gag sequence was deleted from T6 and TU chimeric receptors, they were able to form dimers. These results strongly suggest that the 3′ Gag containing a cysteine residue prevents the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Since β-mercaptoethanol will only affect disulfide-linked dimerization and may not necessarily disrupt other possible molecular interactions, an alternative method of assessing dimerization was also used (Fig. 4B). Cells were labeled as before, and the surface proteins were chemically cross-linked in situ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three cross-linkers with spacer arms of different lengths were used to detect a wide variety of possible interactions. The immunoprecipitated receptors were subjected to heat denaturation in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Our results confirmed those described above; namely, only NM1 and chimeras with either NM1-derived extracellular and TM sequences or 3′ Gag deletions form dimers. The intensity of signals representing the dimers is generally less than those in Fig. 4A. This was most likely due to low cross-linking efficiency. Our result suggests that the 3′ region of p19 Gag prevents the dimerization of the Gag fusion receptors. There are three cysteine residues at positions 12, 16, and 111 of the Gag in the UR2 and T6 fusion receptors and some of the recombinant receptors derived from them. Among the three cysteine residues, cysteine 111 is located within the region found to inhibit dimerization. A plausible explanation is that the cysteine 111 forms an intramolecular disulfide bond with either cysteine 12 or 16, thereby precluding the intermolecular disulfide bond linkage not only because it occupies the S-S linkage but because it may also interfere sterically with the association between monomers. One of the post-translational modifications of receptor PTKs is glycosylation, which may affect the function and stability of the protein. The UR2 and NM1 Gag fusion receptors are not glycosylated (23Liu D. Rutter W.J. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 9-18Google Scholar, 34Zong C.S. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10982-10986Google Scholar), whereas preliminary data indicate that the T6 Gag-IR is. However, a UR2 mutant TM1, deleting the 3-amino acid insertion in the TM domain of the UR2 protein, is glycosylated, indicating that the TM domain may affect glycosylation (34Zong C.S. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10982-10986Google Scholar). To determine if this was the case in our recombinant chimeras, virus-infected cells were labeled in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, and immunoprecipitated receptors were resolved in SDS-PAGE gels. None of the chimeric receptors except those encoded by UT and its parental T6 were glycosylated (Fig. 5). The TU protein appeared as multiple forms on SDS-PAGE; they were, however, not due to glycosylation. Although there appeared to be a decrease in the higher molecular weight forms of the TU protein, this was apparently due to an overall lower level of protein in the tunicamycin-treated cells. Repeated experiments showed that tunicamycin had no effect on the TU receptor protein. The results with T6, UR2, TU, and UT indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of the T6 protein dictates the glycosylation, provided that sites are available in the extracellular Gag sequence, since only those receptors with the T6 cytoplasmic domain are glycosylated. NT and δgT6 receptors were not glycosylated, most likely due to their lack of the 3′ Gag sequence containing the glycosylation site(s). To assess the kinase activity of the receptors, their ability to autophosphorylate in vitro and intracellularly was determined (Fig. 6). All of the receptors exhibited high autophosphorylation activity both in vitro and in vivo, including the UN7 and UT mutants, despite their greatly reduced transforming ability. Although all of the recombinants exhibited a high autophosphorylation level, the dimeric NT and δgT6 proteins have a significantly higher level of in vitro and in vivo activity than the monomeric UT and T6 chimeras, despite the fact that they all have the same IR cytoplasmic domain, including the PTK region. This suggests that although the monomeric Gag-IR is capable of autophosphorylation, the dimeric forms are more efficient. This phenomenon was not observed for the IGFR- or Ros-derived recombinants. However, the difference in autophosphorylation does not appear to affect their ability to phosphorylate cellular substrates (see below) or their transforming ability (Fig. 2). The UT and UN7 proteins, the two nontransforming chimeras, are expressed at a similar level and are as stable as the others (as judged by metabolic labeling and steady state level (Figs. 4, 5, 6)). Labeling of intact cell surface proteins demonstrated that UT and UN7 fusion receptors were localized on the cell surface as abundantly as the T6 and UR2 proteins (data not shown). The pattern of phosphorylation of cellular proteins reflects a receptor PTK activity as well as its affinity and specificity toward substrates in vivo. To determine any quantitative or qualitative effect of receptor dimerization on the phosphorylation of cellular substrates, total cellular lysates from various virus-infected cells were analyzed for protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7). All the chimeras induced dramatically higher tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins over normal CEF. No major difference of substrate patterns were noticed among them except for variation in the extent of receptor protein autophosphorylation. The UN7 and UT proteins, despite their greatly reduced transforming capability, were able to phosphorylate cellular proteins as efficiently as their transforming counterparts. This is consistent with the observation of their in vitro and in vivo autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 6"

Previous authors (Nilsson, T., Copeland, R. A., Smith, P. A., and Chan, S. I. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8254-8260) have interpreted this type II copper center as a modified version of the CuA site. By using electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy, it is found that the CuA proton and nitrogen resonances remain present in the SB-12 heat-treated enzyme and that three new nitrogen resonances appear having hyperfine coupling constants consistent with histidine ligation. These hyperfine coupling constants correlate well with those recently found for the CuB histidines from the cytochrome aa3-600 quinol oxidase from Bacillus subtilis (Fann, Y.

In addition, the total EPR-detectable copper concentration per enzyme molecule approximately doubles upon SB-12 heat treatment. Finally, the observed type II copper EPR spectrum is virtually indistinguishable from the EPR spectrum of CuB of the as-isolated cytochrome bo3 complex from Escherichia coli. These data indicate that the type II copper species that appears results from a breaking of the strong antiferromagnetic coupling of the heme a3-CuB binuclear center.

Electrons from ferrocytochrome c are input into the CcO complex at the CuA center; electron transfer to heme a or the heme a3-CuB binuclear site quickly follows electron input. The highly exergonic reduction of dioxygen to water at the heme a3-CuB binuclear center is coupled to the pumping of protons against an electrochemical gradient (1Musser S.M. Stowell M.H.B. Chan S.I.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 70-74Google Scholar) that the CuA site actually is a mixed-valence, binuclear copper center. The recent crystal structures of the CcO complex have confirmed a binuclear configuration with two bridging thiolates (9Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K.

Shaw R.W. Hansen R.E. Hartzell C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 458-470Google Scholar)) of the enzyme (12Nilsson T. Copeland R.A. Smith P.A. Chan S.I.

Elsevier, New York1979: 177-188Google Scholar). A scheme which describes the perturbations to the CuA site under these various conditions has been postulated by Li et al. (14Li P.M. Morgan J.E. Nilsson T. Ma M. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7538-7546Google Scholar). The ligand rearrangements proposed by these workers must be re-evaluated, however, because they are based on a mononuclear structure for the CuA site. As type II signals certainly can arise from CuB under appropriate conditions, it should be noted that it has not been demonstrated definitively which copper ions are EPR-detectable as a result of these various modification procedures. The possibility exists that CuB becomes visible under one set of conditions, whereas the CuA site is modified under a different set of conditions. Also, perturbations to both copper sites can occur concurrently either by independent means or through allosteric interactions between the two copper sites. Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy can be used to interpret ligand rearrangement reactions much more accurately than EPR and absorption spectroscopies. Thus, it was thought prudent to examine whether the type II signals that appear in the above modification experiments are accompanied by loss of the strongly coupled cysteinyl protons in the ENDOR spectrum associated with the CuA site. A change in the nitrogen ENDOR of the CuA center is certainly expected as well.Proton and nitrogen ENDOR (35 GHz) are reported here for the bovine CcO complex after short, mild heat treatment in the zwitterionic detergent sulfobetaine 12 (SB-12), a procedure which results in a type II copper EPR signal that is very similar to that observed for the as-isolated Escherichia coli cytochrome bo3 complex, a structurally related ubiquinol oxidase complex. Special emphasis is placed on double integration of the first derivative 9.2-GHz EPR signals obtained. Integration of EPR signals is important for two reasons. 1) The model of a mixed-valence, binuclear CuA center makes possible a scenario in which modification of this center leads to oxidation of the cuprous copper. An increase in EPR intensity would result if the magnetic coupling between the two copper ions is broken; a decrease in EPR intensity is expected if the magnetic coupling remains. 2) Uncoupling of the heme a3-CuB binuclear center as a result of the SB-12 heat treatment procedure would make CuB EPR-detectable. The second explanation is most consistent with the data gathered in this study.DISCUSSIONThe appearance of a type II copper species as a consequence of SB-12 heat treatment of the CcO complex has been reported previously by Nilsson et al. (12Nilsson T. Copeland R.A. Smith P.A. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8254-8260Google Scholar). In addition, p-HMB treatment or incubation with AgNO3 has been found to cause the appearance of this type II species (13Gelles J. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3963-3972Google Scholar, 15Chan S.I. Bocian D.F. Brudvig G.W. Morse R.H. Stevens T.H. Dutton P.L. Leigh Jr., J.S. Scarpa A. Frontiers of Biological Energetics.

Elsevier, New York1979: 177-188Google Scholar). In terms of EPR characterization, the type II copper species we report here appears to be identical to the one described by these authors. This type II species has been interpreted to result from modification of the CuA site of the CcO complex. In the scheme of Li et al. (14Li P.M. Morgan J.E. Nilsson T. Ma M. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7538-7546Google Scholar), CuA is assumed to be mononuclear with two nitrogen and two cysteine ligands. Mild heat treatment in DDM results in loss of one of the cysteine ligands thereby yielding a type I (blue) copper center. Heat treatment with SB-12 or treatment with p-HMB or AgNO3 causes deligation of the second cysteine and the ligation of at least one more histidine to produce a type II copper center. The multifrequency EPR work of Kroneck and co-workers (2Scott R.A. Zumft W.G. Coyle C.L. Dooley D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4082-4086Google Scholar, 3Antholine W.E. Kastrau D.H.W.

Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar), biophysical data on overexpressed subunit II fragments, and the recent crystal structures of the CcO complex indicate, however, that the CuA center is actually a mixed-valence, binuclear copper center with two bridging thiolates (Fig. 7). The CuA modification scenario of Li et al. (14Li P.M. Morgan J.E. Nilsson T. Ma M. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7538-7546Google Scholar) obviously conflicts with these more recent data.The explanation for the appearance of the type II signal upon SB-12 heat treatment must be re-evaluated in light of the binuclear nature of the CuA center and the data presented here. There are two possibilities. The first is that the SB 12 heat treatment procedure causes disruption of the CuA site; the approximate doubling of the copper EPR intensity arises from full oxidation of the two copper ions. The second possibility is that the CuA site remains in a native configuration and the magnetic coupling of the heme a3-CuB binuclear center is broken making CuB EPR-visible. In this scenario, the extra EPR-visible copper, all of which appears to be in a type II configuration, is CuB. The strongest evidence in support of the first explanation is the diminution in the 830 nm absorption intensity, which is believed to arise predominantly from the CuA center (11Beinert H. Shaw R.W. Hansen R.E. Hartzell C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 458-470Google Scholar), upon SB-12 heat treatment of the enzyme. It has been found here, however, that the type II EPR signal can be created without any apparent loss in the 830 nm absorption intensity (Fig. 2). In addition, 1H and 14N ENDOR spectroscopy reveals that the CuA resonances are present when a stoichiometric amount of the type II copper species is EPR-detectable. Instead, three additional 14N ENDOR resonances are detected (Fig. 6). The seven-line hyperfine pattern in the g∥ region of the EPR spectrum (Fig. 3) is consistent with three approximately equivalent nitrogen ligands. The excellent agreement between the hyperfine coupling constants of the type II center described here and those for the CuB center of the cytochrome aa3-600 ubiquinol oxidase complex of B. subtilis (Table II), which does not contain a CuA center, allows confident assignment of the three new nitrogen ENDOR resonances as CuB histidines. Finally, the EPR spectrum of the as-isolated UQO complex contains the identical type II copper species that results upon SB-12 heat treatment of the CcO complex. As the UQO complex does not contain a CuA center but is otherwise structurally similar to the CcO complex (1Musser S.M. Stowell M.H.B. Chan S.I. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1995; 71: 79-208Google Scholar), and, in this particular sample, the heme o3-CuB binuclear center is magnetically uncoupled, these data provide strong confirmation that the type II signals that appear as a result of the various CcO treatments discussed here do indeed arise from CuB. The changes in the resonance Raman spectrum of heme a3 when the type II copper signal is apparent in the CcO EPR spectrum are now more easily understood (12Nilsson T. Copeland R.A. Smith P.A. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8254-8260Google Scholar, 24Larsen R.W. Ondrias M.R. Copeland R.A. Li P.M. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6418-6422Google Scholar). The perturbations that uncouple the heme a3-CuB binuclear center and make CuB EPR-detectable also disrupt the heme a3 pocket.Given that the type II EPR signal seen arises predominantly from CuB, it is important to question to what extent the structural integrity of the CuB redox site is preserved. Cline and co-workers (25Cline J. Reinhammar B. Jensen P. Venters R. Hoffman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5124-5128Google Scholar) report an EPR spectrum of CuB obtained by full reduction of the enzyme, flushing with O2, and quick freezing in liquid N2. This spectrum is characterized by a g∥ of about 2.28 and an A∥ of about 100 G. Photolysis and freezing of the fully reduced CO-bound CcO complex in the presence of oxygen has been found to yield a type II copper signal with a g∥ of 2.26-2.28 and an A∥ of 102-137 G (26Reinhammar B. Malkin R. Jensen P. Karlsson B. Andréasson L.-E. Aasa R. Vänngård T. Malmström B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5000-5003Google Scholar, 27Blair D.F. Witt S.N. Chan S.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 7389-7399Google Scholar). High pH causes the appearance of a type II species with a g∥ of 2.30 and and A∥ of 136 G (28Carithers R.P. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7967-7976Google Scholar). Addition of cyanide to the Thermus thermophilus cytochrome ba3 complex produces a type II copper species with a g∥ of 2.28 and an A∥ of about 140 G (29Surerus K.K. Oertling W.A. Fan C. Gurbiel R.J. Einarsdóttir ó. Antholine W.E. Dyer R.B. Hoffman B.M. Woodruff W.H. Fee J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3195-3199Google Scholar, 30Oertling W.A. Surerus K.K. Einarsdóttir ó. Fee J.A. Dyer R.B. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3128-3141Google Scholar). These spectra contrast with the type II signal obtained by SB-12 heat treatment which has a larger A∥ (∼190 G) and a smaller g∥ (∼2.19). As harsher treatments tend to result in larger A∥ values, the indication is that the structural integrity of the CuB site has been perturbed in the experiments described here. A small perturbation to the heme a3-CuB site clearly must have occurred to break the magnetic coupling in this binuclear center. Both the SB-12 heat-treated CcO and the cytochrome aa3-600 complexes contain a proton with an A∥ of about 10 MHz (Fig. 5). In the case of the cytochrome aa3-600 complex, this proton is solvent-exchangeable and has been tentatively assigned as arising from a bound hydroxide anion (23Fann Y.C. Ahmed I. Blackburn N.J. Boswell J.S. Verkhovskaya M.L. Hoffman B.M. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10245-10255Google Scholar). A hydroxide anion could certainly be the fourth ligand for the type II copper site reported here.The finding that SB-12 heat treatment makes CuB EPR-detectable raises the issue of which copper ions give rise to the type II signals seen upon AgNO3 or p-HMB treatment (13Gelles J. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3963-3972Google Scholar, 15Chan S.I. Bocian D.F. Brudvig G.W. Morse R.H. Stevens T.H. Dutton P.L. Leigh Jr., J.S. Scarpa A. Frontiers of Biological Energetics. Academic Press, New York1978: 883-888Google Scholar, 16Chan S.I. Bocian D.F. Brudvig G.W. Morse R.H. Stevens T.H. King T.E. Orii Y. Chance B. Okunuki K. Cytochrome Oxidase. Elsevier, New York1979: 177-188Google Scholar). Since ENDOR experiments have not been attempted on such enzyme samples, a definitive conclusion cannot be made here. It is certainly possible that these treatments affect the CuA site exclusively since they are thiol-specific reagents. Gelles and Chan (13Gelles J. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3963-3972Google Scholar) observed an approximate 40% increase in copper EPR intensity upon p-HMB treatment of the enzyme. This observation is consistent with a scenario where the type II copper signals arise from CuB due to perturbations similar to those caused by SB-12 heat treatment. On the other hand, disruption of the CuA center and oxidation of the cuprous copper would also result in a similar increase in the integrated EPR intensity.While the ENDOR data reveal the presence of native CuA resonances in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of type II copper, the possibility that a substoichiometric population of CuA sites has been perturbed cannot be ruled out. The creation of a small amount of a type II copper species from severe disruption of the CuA ligation structure would be undetectable in the EPR and ENDOR spectra due to the strong signals arising from the CuB center. The diminution in the 830 nm absorption intensity and the slightly larger than stoichiometric increase in the integrated intensity of the copper EPR signals are consistent with this possibility.On the other hand, less drastic perturbations to the CuA site could occur. Li et al. (14Li P.M. Morgan J.E. Nilsson T. Ma M. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7538-7546Google Scholar) found that heat treatment in DDM results in substoichiometric populations of both type I and type II copper species. Zickermann et al. (31Zickermann V. Verkhovsky M. Morgan J. Wikström M. Anemüller S. Bill E. Steffens G.C.M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 686-693Google Scholar) have recently found that mutation of the weakly coordinating methionine of the binuclear CuA center to isoleucine results in a type I copper EPR spectrum (g∥ = 2.18, A∥ = 61 G) and loss of 830 nm absorption intensity. This type I species could arise in the native enzyme upon dissociation of the weak Met-Cu bond and lengthening of one of the Cu-S bonds as shown in Fig. 7. As a result of this conformational rearrangement, one of the copper atoms would have a type I-like structure (one His, one Cys, one carbonyl, and a long Cu-S bond). The other copper atom would have a high reduction potential due to the two strongly coordinating cysteines and, therefore, would become completely reduced with the electron initially shared by the two atoms. As only the type I-like copper would be EPR-visible, the EPR integration would remain constant. The loss in 830 nm absorption intensity reported here for some samples may result from a CuA rearrangement of this type. The associated type I EPR signals are likely to be difficult to detect in the presence of strong type II signals and need not be identical to those resulting from the methionine mutation structure (31Zickermann V. Verkhovsky M. Morgan J. Wikström M. Anemüller S. Bill E. Steffens G.C.M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 686-693Google Scholar). The well-known interaction potentials in the CcO complex (1Musser S.M. Stowell M.H.B. Chan S.I. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1995; 71: 79-208Google Scholar) indicate the presence of conformational interactions between redox centers. Therefore, the disruption of the heme a3-CuB binuclear site that produces a type II signal could potentially, under some conditions, perturb the methionine of the CuA center resulting in loss of 830 nm absorption intensity. In fact, during enzyme turnover, the CuA reduction potential could be modulated through allosteric interactions between the heme a3-CuB binuclear site and the CuA methionine.To summarize, the CuB center undergoes a small structural modification and becomes EPR-detectable as a type II copper species upon SB-12 heat treatment. The thiol-specific reagents AgNO3 and p-HMB, both of which cause the appearance of a type II copper species, are not expected to affect the CcO complex in the same manner. However, it is feasible that the type II species resulting from treatment with these reagents also is a perturbed heme a3-CuB center and not a drastically modified CuA site. It remains possible that SB-12 heat treatment perturbs a small population of CuA sites since this procedure results in a decrease in the 830 nm absorption intensity of the enzyme, perhaps through allosteric interactions with the methionine of the CuA site. It has been demonstrated, however, that, under some conditions, CuB of the fully oxidized CcO complex is EPR-detectable in the form of a type II copper center.

Electrons from ferrocytochrome c are input into the CcO complex at the CuA center; electron transfer to heme a or the heme a3-CuB binuclear site quickly follows electron input. The highly exergonic reduction of dioxygen to water at the heme a3-CuB binuclear center is coupled to the pumping of protons against an electrochemical gradient (1Musser S.M. Stowell M.H.B. Chan S.I.
