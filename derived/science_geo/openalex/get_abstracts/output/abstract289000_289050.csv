https://openalex.org/W2131477567,"Greenland ice-core data have revealed large decadal climate variations over the North Atlantic that can be related to a major source of low-frequency variability, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Over the past decade, the Oscillation has remained in one extreme phase during the winters, contributing significantly to the recent wintertime warmth across Europe and to cold conditions in the northwest Atlantic. An evaluation of the atmospheric moisture budget reveals coherent large-scale changes since 1980 that are linked to recent dry conditions over southern Europe and the Mediterranean, whereas northern Europe and parts of Scandinavia have generally experienced wetter than normal conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2000689052,The potential dependence of resonance conditions for the excitation of surface plasmons was exploited to obtain two-dimensional images of the potential distribution of an electrode with high temporal resolution. This method allows the study of spatiotemporal patterns in electrochemical systems. Potential waves traveling across the electrode with a speed on the order of meters per second were observed in the bistable regime of an oscillatory electrochemical reaction. This velocity is close to that of excitation waves in nerve fibers and is far greater than the velocity of reaction-diffusion waves observed in other chemical systems.
https://openalex.org/W1970166654,"The observed equilibrium shapes of phospholipid vesicles of topological genus 2 (shapes with two holes) are found to be in agreement with theoretical predictions on the basis of a minimization of the elastic curvature energy for fluid membranes under the constraints of constant area, volume, and area difference (between the inner and outer layers of the membrane). For some particular geometrical characteristics, the shapes of the vesicles change continuously and randomly on a slow time scale (tens of seconds) and thus exhibit conformal diffusion. This phenomenon is a reflection of the conformal degeneracy of the elastic curvature energy. Its observation sets a limit (three constraints) on the number of physical constraints relevant to the determination of the shapes of vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1991020527,"High-resolution optical spectroscopic observations of unidentified emission bands from the unusual biconical nebula known as the Red Rectangle are reported. The peak wavelengths and the widths of prominent bands near 5799, 5853, and 6616 angstroms decrease with increasing offset from the central A0-type star HD 44179 and, in the limit of large distance from the star, are shown to converge toward the known values for some of the narrower diffuse interstellar absorption bands at 5797, 5850, and 6614 angstroms. The same carriers give rise to both Red Rectangle emission and corresponding diffuse interstellar absorption bands, and these particular bands arise from electronic transitions in gas-phase molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2033103112,"Interstitial cell-stimulating (luteinizing) hormone was isolated from swine pituitary glands. This protein hormone, having a molecular weight of about 90,000 and an isoelectric point of pH 7.45, was shown to be pure by tests in the electrophoresis apparatus of Tiselius and in the ultracentrifuge as well as by its constant solubility. The hormone stimulated the interstitial tissue of the testis or ovary and caused the formation of corpora lutea provided that maturing follicles were present. Under the conditions described, its minimal effective total dose in hypophysectomized immature male rats was about 1 microgram of nitrogen or 6.7 micrograms of hormone. Extracts of swine pituitary with purely follicle-stimulating effects did not cause oestrus in immature hypophysectomized female rats unless luteinizing hormone was also administered."

https://openalex.org/W2058824374,A long effort to link slight fluctuations in solar output with climate on Earth may finally be succeeding. A cycle of temperature changes in much of the middle and low atmosphere matches the 11 year sunspot cycle over much of the Northern Hemisphere. The findings were reported at the International Union of Geodesy and Gophysics meeting in Colorado. This article discusses the evidence and the modeling which has been done to reveal this possible connection. 1 fig.

https://openalex.org/W1981364976,"This article discusses the research reactor FRM at Munich`s Technoical University and its replacement as it reaches the end of its useful life. The project for a new FRM-II reactor has become engulfed in politics that may strain relations between Germany and the USA. The reason is that the Garching experts designed the reactor to use `bomb grade` uranium as fuel. Topics examined in the article include the fueling controversy, the need for neutrons and the support of the neutron-scattering researchers, and the problems and possibilities of redesign."
https://openalex.org/W1971472016,"This article discusses a budget approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee which funds the fusion program even lower than the drastically reduced level the House approved in July. Work on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) would continue but the Tokamak Physics Experiment would be halted. At the same time, the Senate bill allots money to start work on the National Ignition Facility (NIF)."
