https://openalex.org/W1633206839,"Pharmacophore mapping of the ligand binding domain of the β-adrenergic receptor has revealed specific molecular interactions which are important for agonist and antagonist binding to the receptor. Previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that the binding of amine agonists and antagonists to the receptor involves an interaction between the amine group of the ligand and the carboxylate side chain of Asp113 in the third hydrophobic domain of the receptor (Strader, C. D., Sigal, I. S., Candelore, M. R., Rands, E., Hill, W. S., and Dixon, R. A. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 10267–10271). We have now identified 2 serine residues, at positions 204 and 207 in the fifth hydrophobic domain of the β-adrenergic receptor, which are critical for agonist binding and activation of the receptor. These serine residues are conserved with G-protein-coupled receptors which bind catecholamine agonists, but not with receptors whose endogenous ligands do not have the catechol moiety. Removal of the hydroxyl side chain from either Ser204 or Ser207 by substitution of the serine residue with an alanine attenuates the activity of catecholamine agonists at the receptor. The effects of these mutations on agonist activity are mimicked selectively by the removal of the catechol hydroxyl moieties from the aromatic ring of the agonist. The data suggest that the interaction of catecholamine agonists with the β-adrenergic receptor involves two hydrogen bonds, one between the hydroxyl side chain of Ser204 and the meta-hydroxyl group of the ligand and a second between the hydroxyl side chain of Ser207 and the para-hydroxyl group of the ligand."

The purification method utilized extraction of the bone-inducing activity with 6 M urea, followed by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Sephacryl S-200. Active fractions were further purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis without reduction. Osteogenin activity was localized in a zone between 30 and 40 kDa. The amino acid sequences of a number of tryptic peptides of the gel-eluted material were determined. Reduction and alkylation of purified osteogenin in 7 M guanidine hydrochloride resulted in the total loss of biological activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa."

We demonstrate that this oncogene inhibits expression of the muscle regulatory factors MyoD1 and myogenin. Expression of retroviral-encoded MyoD1 in ras-transformed myoblasts leads to the re-expression of both terminal differentiation markers and lineage markers expressed in proliferating myoblasts (including endogenous MyoD1 and myogenin), suggesting that ras inhibits myogenic differentiation in a manner dependent on the loss of MyoD1 expression. In addition, we show that fos transformation of myoblasts inhibits muscle differentiation by a similar mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1488283633,"The rat somatic cytochrome c promoter is resolved into a mosaic of cis-acting upstream and intron elements required for maximal activity. Mutations in each diminished cytochrome c promoter activity and eliminated the specific binding of cognate nuclear factors. Among these is the recognition sequence for a nuclear factor designated NRF-1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1) also found in the upstream regions of several other nuclear genes whose products function in the mitochondria. The NRF-1 site was tightly coupled to a second functionally independent element (region I), and together these sites constitute a major determinant of cytochrome c expression. In addition to these novel sequence elements, the promoter also contained recognition sites for the common transcriptional activators ATF and Sp1. A potent promoter element within the first intron consisted of two adjacent Sp1 binding sites. Point mutations in the first site eliminated the promoter activity of the element as well as Sp1 binding to both sites. An ATF recognition sequence in the upstream promoter was identical to an authentic cyclic AMP (cAMP) responsive element in stimulating promoter activity and in conferring a cAMP response upon a heterologous promoter. These promoter elements and their cognate nuclear factors likely contribute to the housekeeping function of cytochrome c and to the coordinate modulation of respiratory gene expression according to cellular energy demands."
https://openalex.org/W2018937303,"Each of the six C. elegans vulval precursor cells (VPCs) has three potential fates (1 degree, 2 degrees, or 3 degrees). The fate of each VPC depends on two types of signals: a graded inductive signal that acts at a distance and a short-range lateral signal among the VPCs. We describe interactions among mutations that cause different misspecifications of VPC fates. Particular combinations of mutations cause all six VPCs to have a single fate independent of their positions. Our results suggest that specification of the three VPC fates is accomplished by two binary decisions, each effected by one of the two signaling pathways. The gene lin-12 acts in the lateral signaling pathway and specifies 2 degrees. The ""vulvaless"" and ""multivulva"" genes act in the inductive signaling pathway and specify 1 degree independently of lin-12 and 2 degrees via lin-12. We describe a model for the regulatory circuitry underlying VPC determination that includes a role for lin-12 in both autocrine and paracrine VPC signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1520196478,"Single cell [Ca2+], studies were performed in chicken and rat osteoclasts loaded with fura-2 and exposed to a variety of treatments. Under resting conditions, basal [Ca2+]i, was 79.2 +/- 47.3 and 84.3 +/- 65.7 nM (averages +/- S.D.; n = 141 and 126) in the osteoclasts of the two species, respectively. Basal [Ca2+]i was stable in all rat and in approximately 80% of chicken osteoclasts. In the remaining 20%, spontaneous, irregular [Ca2+], fluctuations were observed (amplitude range: 50-200 nm over basal values). Increase of [Ca2+]o over the concentration of the Krebs-Ringer incubation medium (2 mM) induced rises of [Ca2+] in almost all cells investigated. [Ca2+] rises were already appreciable with 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o additions and reached high values with 4 mM additions: 390 +/- 113 and 364 +/- 214 nM [Ca2+], in rat and chicken osteoclasts, respectively (n = 122 and 101). Qualitatively, the responses to [Ca2+]o additions consisted of discrete [Ca2+]i transients, biphasic (an initial spike followed by a plateau), or monophasic (either the spike or the plateau). In a few chicken osteoclasts, the [Ca2+]i increase occurring after [Ca2+]o addition consisted of multiple, irregular fluctuations, similar to those observed in 20% of these cells under resting conditions. In individual osteoclasts subsequently exposed to multiple [Ca2+]o increase pulses, the type of the [Ca2+]i transient (mono- or biphasic) was maintained, and the size was dependent on the magnitude of the [Ca2+]o additions. Effects similar to those of [Ca2+]o were induced by the addition of Cd2+ or Ba2+ (but not La3+ or Mg2+) into the medium. The Cd2+ effect was maintained in part even in a Ca2+-free medium. Of various hormones and factors, parathormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and prostaglandin E2 were inactive. In contrast, calcitonin was active in rat osteoclasts (which express numerous receptors). [Ca2+]i increases were small (19 +/- 17.9 nM; n = 21) when the hormone was administered alone; they were synergistic (severalfold potentiation) when the hormone was administered before or after [Ca2+]o. The [Ca2+]i effects of calcitonin were mimicked by 8Br-cAMP (31 +/- 26 nM; n = 12) when the nucleotide was administered alone; marked synergism when it was administered in combination with [Ca2+]o. This paper demonstrates for the first time that changes of [Ca2+]i are induced in osteoclasts by treatments with [Ca2+]o and calcitonin and can therefore be involved in intracellular mediation of the physiological effects of these two extracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W1965057731,"Two principal models have been invoked to explain transcriptional stimulation of RNA polymerase II genes by enhancers/upstream promoter elements: in one, upstream regulatory sequences directly interact with proximal promoter elements via proteins bound to the DNA (""looping"" model); in the other, RNA polymerase II (or a transcription factor) binds to distal sequences and then scans along the DNA until it reaches the promoter (""scanning"" or ""entry site"" model). So far, it has been reported that enhancers or upstream promoter elements transmit their effect on a gene only via covalently closed DNA, i.e., in a cis configuration. The looping model predicts, however, that the effect can be transmitted also in certain trans configurations. Here we demonstrate that an enhancer from SV40 or cytomegalovirus can stimulate transcription in vitro even when noncovalently attached to the beta-globin promoter via the proteins streptavidin or avidin. These findings are consistent with the looping model rather than the scanning model. In addition, stimulation of transcription in trans, as shown by our experiments, may be found in nature in phenomena such as transvection, where one chromosome affects gene expression in the paired homolog."
https://openalex.org/W1514747902,"Much current work on the mechanism of neurosecretion has focused on proteins specific to neural secretory vesicles (synaptic vesicles). We report a calcium-stimulated lipid kinase that co-purifies with rat brain synaptic vesicles. This enzyme activity is found only in membrane fractions that contain synaptic vesicle markers. Based on identification of the lipid product as ceramide 1-phosphate and on the finding that ceramide kinase activity co-purifies with synaptic vesicles, the enzyme is proposed to be a ceramide kinase. Kinase activity is stimulated by micromolar concentrations of calcium. Calcium increases the apparent Vmax of the reaction with little effect on the Km for ceramide. The vesicular localization of this enzyme, the requirement for ATP, and the stimulation of enzyme activity by micromolar calcium suggest that ceramide phosphorylation may be associated with neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W1571942380,"Abstract In mouse Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II activates a calcium-permeable cation channel through a cell surface IGF-II receptor (Kojima, I., Nishimoto, I., Iiri, T., Ogata, E., and Rosenfeld, R. G. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 154, 9-19; Matsunaga, H., Nishimoto, I., Kojima, I., Yamashita, N., Kurokawa, K., and Ogata, E. (1988) Am. J. Physiol. 255, C442-C446). In the action of IGF-II, a pertussis toxin (or islet-activating protein; IAP)-sensitive GTP-binding protein (G protein) is inferred to be involved (Nishimoto, I., Hata, Y., Ogata, E., and Kojima, I. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12120-12126). In the present study, we examined the direct coupling of the IGF-II receptor with G proteins. In broken Balb/c3T3 cell membranes, 10 nM IGF-II rapidly attenuated the IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a 40-kDa protein in a manner requiring magnesium ion. The IGF-II-mediated attenuation in the IAP substrate activity was 80% recovered after washing off IGF-II and inhibited by coexisting guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), while either aluminum fluoride solution (10 mM NaF plus 100 microM AlCl3) or 100 microM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) reproduced the action of IGF-II. When purified IAP substrate G proteins (Gi1, Gi2, G0) were incubated with IGF-II in the presence of membranes from IAP-treated Balb/c3T3 cells, the attenuation in the IAP substrate activity was evident in Gi2, but not in Gi1 or G0. On the other hand, 10 nM insulin had no effect on the modification of the 40-kDa IAP substrate in Balb/c3T3 cell membranes, whereas 10 nM IGF-I elicited a slow onset of the IAP sensitivity attenuation from the 40-kDa protein. However, the specific involvement of the IGF-II receptor in the modification of the IAP substrate induced by low concentrations of IGF-II was suggested by the observations that (i) IGF-I receptor-lacking cell membranes were effective for the Gi2 modification by IGF-II, (ii) the ability of membranes to mediate the action of IGF-II was markedly attenuated in IGF-II receptor-lacking cell membranes, and (iii) agonistic anti-IGF-II receptor antibody mimicked the action of IGF-II on the 40-kDa protein in Balb/c3T3 cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner similar to that observed in the antibody-induced blocking of membrane IGF-II binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1623233150,"Abstract To identify the protein kinase that is responsible for catalyzing phosphorylation of actin-binding protein (ABP) in platelets, we have examined the effects of protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase on this process. We found that purified platelet protein kinase C from platelets was unable to phosphorylate ABP in vitro. However, a crude platelet kinase preparation phosphorylated ABP in the presence of cAMP, but not in the presence of Ca2+/phosphatidylserine. Fresh platelet plasma membranes incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP phosphorylated ABP in the presence of cAMP and the process was blocked by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor; ABP phosphorylation induced by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) appeared to be reduced by the subsequent addition of thrombin. These results strongly suggest that in situ ABP is phosphorylated by activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase when platelet function is inhibited by PGE1. Furthermore, in the PGE1-treated platelets, ABP was proteolyzed at a slower rate than in control platelets when they were lysed with Triton in the absence of EGTA. Partially purified ABP was proteolyzed by calpain in vitro at a slower rate as well. It was demonstrated that ABP from PGE1-treated platelets recovered its sensitivity to calpain after ABP was incubated with a protein phosphatase that had been purified from platelets. We postulate that ABP is stabilized against proteolysis in response to cAMP-elevating agents and that this blocks cytoskeleton reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W1582177361,"The mechanism of regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression by cAMP was investigated in rat hepatoma cells (HTC). Incubation of HTC cells with the cAMP-inducing agent, forskolin, caused a significant increase in the levels of both [3H]dexamethasone binding capacity and GR mRNA by about 2- to 2.4-fold within 4 h. Incubation of HTC cells with the cAMP analogue, 8-bromo-cAMP, also increased the GR mRNA level to a similar degree in a concentration-dependent manner. The increase in GR mRNA did not require ongoing translation or transcription. Determination of GR mRNA stability in 8-bromo-cAMP-induced cells showed that the message had a half-life of approximately 10 h, which is about 2.5 times longer than the GR mRNA half-life in nontreated cells (t1/2 = 4 h). These results indicate that the increased steady state level of GR mRNA induced by cAMP analogue is, at least in part, caused by increased GR mRNA stability. In both forskolin-pretreated and nontreated HTC cells, dexamethasone caused an approximately 70% down-regulation of GR protein levels. However, since forskolin induced the GR level 2- to 2.4-fold, the relative amount of GR protein remaining in cells treated with both forskolin and dexamethasone was about 2- to 2.4-fold higher compared to cells treated with dexamethasone alone. This increased GR level correlated well with the increase in inducibility of two glucocorticoid regulated genes, the endogenous tyrosine aminotransferase and the stably integrated mouse mammary tumor virus. These data suggest that relatively small changes in GR levels are reflected in parallel changes in cellular response to glucocorticoid hormones. This also implicates a limiting nature of the GR protein in determining the biological response."
https://openalex.org/W2018084623,"A purified 64 kd protein, consisting of four identical subunits of the 16 kd SecB, binds to the signal sequence of preproteins prior to their translocation across inverted vesicles (INV) derived from the E. coli plasma membrane. The purified SecB tetramer competes with canine signal recognition particle (SRP) in signal sequence binding and thus behaves as a prokaryotic equivalent of SRP. As shown by cell fractionation and immunoblot analysis with anti-SecB antibodies, SecB is a cytosolic protein. An E. coli supernatant depleted of SecB after passage through an anti-SecB Sepharose column retains full translation activity but is unable to support translocation into added INV. Translocation into InV is fully restored by readdition of purified SecB."
https://openalex.org/W2113460448,"Embryonic inductions appear to be mediated by the concerted action of different inducing factors that modulate one another's activity. Such modulation is likely to reflect interactions between the signal transduction pathways through which the inducing factors act. We tested this idea for the induction of neural tissue. We report that both adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP concentration increase substantially in induced neuroectoderm during neural induction. The enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity requires protein kinase C (PKC) activation, indicating cross-talk between these two signal transduction pathways. This cross-talk appears to be essential for neural induction. Whereas cAMP analogs alone were not neural inducers, they had a synergistic inducing effect if ectoderm was first incubated with TPA (12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate), a PKC activator. These results strongly suggest that at least two signals mediate neural induction. The first signal activates PKC and the second signal then activates the cAMP pathway effectively."
https://openalex.org/W1509579025,"We have individually replaced all 7 of the arginine residues in bacteriorhodopsin by glutamine. The mutants with substitutions at positions 7, 164, 175, and 225 showed essentially the wild-type phenotype in regard to chromophore regeneration, chromophore lambda max, and proton pumping, although the mutant Arg-175----Gln showed decreased rate of chromophore regeneration. Glutamine substitutions of Arg-82, -134, and -227 affected proton pumping ability, and caused specific alterations in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle. Finally, electrostatic interactions are proposed between Arg-82 and -227, and specific carboxylic acid residues in helices C and G, which regulate the purple to blue transition and proton transfers during the photocycle."
https://openalex.org/W1564751246,"Abstract Bacteriorhodopsin contains 8 tryptophan residues distributed across the membrane-embedded helices. To study their possible functions, we have replaced them one at a time by phenylalanine; in addition, Trp-137 and -138 have been replaced by cysteine. The mutants were prepared by cassette mutagenesis of the synthetic bacterio-opsin gene, expression and purification of the mutant apoproteins, renaturation, and chromophore regeneration. The replacement of Trp-10, Trp-12 (helix A), Trp-80 (helix C), and Trp-138 (helix E) by phenylalanine and of Trp-137 and Trp-138 by cysteine did not significantly alter the absorption spectra or affect their proton pumping. However, substitution of the remaining tryptophans by phenylalanine had the following effects. 1) Substitution of Trp-86 (helix C) and Trp-137 gave chromophores blue-shifted by 20 nm and resulted in reduced proton pumping to about 30%. 2) As also reported previously (Hackett, N. R., Stern, L. J., Chao, B. H., Kronis, K. A., and Khorana, H. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9277-9284), substitution of Trp-182 and Trp-189 (helix F) caused large blue shifts (70 and 40 nm, respectively) in the chromophore and affected proton pumping. 3) The substitution of Trp-86 and Trp-182 by phenylalanine conferred acid instability on these mutants. The spectral shifts indicate that Trp-86, Trp-182, Trp-189, and possibly Trp-137 interact with retinal. It is proposed that these tryptophans, probably along with Tyr-57 (helix B) and Tyr-185 (helix F), form a retinal binding pocket. We discuss the role of tryptophan residues that are conserved in bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and the related family of opsin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1507039901,"Abstract Agonist-promoted down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA was investigated in S49 mouse lymphoma variants with mutations in elements of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase. In wild-type cells steady-state levels of beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA were established by DNA-excess solution hybridization to be 1.72 +/- 0.08 (n = 8) amol/microgram total cellular RNA. Receptor mRNA levels declined 35-45% in response to stimulation by the beta-adrenergic agonist (-)isoproterenol or forskolin as described previously in DDT1 MF-2 cells (Hadcock, J. R., and Malbon, C. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 5021-5025). Agonist-promoted cAMP accumulation and down-regulation of receptor mRNA were analyzed in three variants with mutations in Gs alpha (H21a, unc, cyc-) and a single variant lacking cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (kin-). H21a (Gs alpha coupled to receptor, but not to adenylate cyclase), unc (Gs alpha uncoupled from receptor), and cyc- (lacking Gs alpha) variants accumulated cAMP and down-regulated beta AR mRNA in response to forskolin. In unc and cyc- cells isoproterenol failed to stimulate cAMP; accumulation and down-regulation of receptor mRNA was not observed. H21a cells, in contrast, displayed agonist-promoted regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA but only basal levels of cAMP accumulation in response to isoproterenol. The kin- cells displayed cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin as well as to isoproterenol but no down-regulation of receptor mRNA or receptor expression. Taken together these data demonstrate several features of agonist-promoted down-regulation of mRNA: (i) cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity is required for down-regulation of mRNA (kin-), although elevated cAMP accumulation is not (H21a); (ii) functional receptor-Gs coupling is required (H21a), and clones lacking Gs alpha (cyc-) or receptor Gs coupling (unc) lack the capacity to down-regulate mRNA in response to agonist; and (iii) in the presence of basal levels of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, functional receptor-Gs coupling (H21a) to some other effector other than adenylate cyclase may be propagating the signal."
https://openalex.org/W1581111389,"Abstract To study their role in the structure and function of bacteriorhodopsin, three prolines, presumed to be in the membrane-embedded alpha-helices, have been individually replaced as follows: Pro-50 and Pro-91 each by Gly and Ala and Pro-186 by Ala, Gly, and Val. The mutants of Pro-50 and Pro-91 all showed normal chromophore and proton pumping. However, the rates of regeneration of the chromophore in Pro-50----Ala, Pro-91----Ala and ----Gly with all-trans-retinal were about 30-fold slower than that in the wild-type, whereas the chromophore regeneration rate in Pro-50----Gly was 10-fold faster than in the wild-type. While, Pro-186----Ala regenerated the wild-type chromophore, the mutants Pro-186----Val and Pro-186----Gly showed large blue shifts (about 80 nm) in the chromophore regenerated with all-trans-retinal and showed no apparent dark-light adaptation. Pro-186----Gly first regenerated the wild-type chromophore with 13-cis-retinal which was thermally unstable and rapidly converted to the blue-shifted chromophore obtained with all-trans-retinal. High salt concentration restored the wild-type purple chromophore in the Pro-186----Gly mutant. Thus, in this mutant, the protein interconverts between two conformational states. Pro-186----Ala and Pro-186----Gly showed about 65%, whereas Pro-186----Val showed 10-20% of the normal proton pumping."
https://openalex.org/W2064609779,"We used in vitro mutagenesis and cDNA cloning to identify new Suppressor-mutator (Spm) transposable element genes. Frameshift mutations in the ORFs of the tnpA gene's first intron markedly reduce Spm activity in transgenic tobacco, indicating that intron sequences encode essential gene products. Evidence is given that Spm encodes large alternatively spliced transcripts, designated tnpB (4.9 kb), tnpC (5.7 kb), and tnpD (5.8 kb), comprising all of the tnpA exons, most of the tnpA intron 1 ORF1 sequence, and either none, part, or all of the intron 1 ORF2 sequence. Two alternative splice donor sites were identified at the end of exon 1, and the structure of the different exon 1 sequences suggests that Spm employs a novel mode of translational regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1540222273,"In Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells, expression of steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase (11 beta-OHase) is stimulated by cAMP following a delay of 4-6 h. Our results demonstrate that a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) within the 11 beta-OHase promoter region is a major determinant of this induction. The 5'-flanking sequences from the mouse 11 beta-OHase gene were placed in front of a human growth hormone reporter gene and transfected into Y1 cells. Treatment of transfected cells with 8-bromo-cAMP increased expression directed by the 11 beta-OHase 5'-flanking region by 3.8-fold. In 5'-deletion analyses, 123 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequences were sufficient for cAMP induction, whereas cAMP treatment did not affect expression of a plasmid with only 40 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence. Within these 123 base pairs, a region from -56 to -49 matched 7 of 8 bases comprising the consensus sequence for the CRE. 11 beta-OHase 5'-flanking sequences from -65 to -42, including the CRE-like sequence, conferred cAMP inducibility to promoters from the thymidine kinase and chorionic gonadotropin alpha-subunit genes. DNase I footprinting and Southwestern blotting analyses demonstrated that the protein which interacted with the CRE in the 11 beta-OHase promoter region was similar to the CRE-binding protein associated with other cAMP-regulated genes. Together, these results suggest that an interaction between the 11 beta-OHase CRE and CRE-binding protein mediates cAMP induction of the 11 beta-OHase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1520082200,"Abstract The heptapeptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) is a synthetic construct of a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK). In this work we show that Kemptide has all the properties of a cytophilic substrate, i.e. it is a molecule preserving cell membrane intactness when added to cultured cells. Kemptide thus satisfies the prerequisites for employment in assays for cell surface-located ecto-PK activity. Different types of intact cells catalyze the phosphorylation of Kemptide in the presence of extracellular ATP and cAMP with Km values of 3-4 microM for Kemptide. Kemptide phosphorylation was influenced by PKI, the inhibitory protein specific for cAMP-PK. The results of comparative experiments with intact cells and with cell extracts demonstrate the ectoenzyme nature of this cAMP-PK. Further, the possibility was ruled out of a transfer of enzyme activity from damaged cells to the surface of intact cells. The anchorage of the surface cAMP-PK activity to the plasma membrane appears to be relatively stable since (i) cell supernatants, obtained after preincubation of intact cells with cAMP or Kemptide, did not show Kemptide phosphorylation, and (ii) the cAMP-dependent PK activity remained with cells even after five consecutive washes with cAMP or Kemptide. This is in contrast to the ecto-cAMP-independent phosvitin/casein type PK (Kubler, D., Pyerin, W., Burow, E., and Kinzel, V. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 4021-4025) which is released from intact cells through the addition of substrate. Data are presented which show that both ectokinase activities are exhibited independently. In conjunction with published evidence for an active export of cAMP from cells as well as for the appearance of extracellular ATP the demonstration of an ecto-cAMP-PK further supports the potential of PK for intercellular regulation. The potential of ecto-cAMP-PK is demonstrated by its ability to phosphorylate biologically active forms of atrial natriuretic peptide, the atrial natriuretic peptide, which possesses the specific sequence for a cAMP-PK-catalyzed phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1538429608,"Abstract The alpha subunit of the rat brain sodium channel is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro and in situ at multiple sites which yield seven tryptic phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptides 1-4 and 7 are derived from phosphorylation sites between residues 554 and 623 in a single large CNBr fragment from the cytoplasmic segment connecting homologous domains I and II of the alpha subunit (Rossie, S., Gordon, D., and Catterall, W. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17530-17535). In the present work, antibodies were prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 676-692 (AbSP15), which contain one additional potential phosphorylation site at Ser686-Ser687 in a different predicted CNBr fragment of this same intracellular segment. AbSP15 recognizes native and denatured sodium channels specifically and immunoprecipitates phosphorylated CNBr fragments of low molecular mass that contain a new site phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Comparison of tryptic phosphopeptides derived from intact alpha subunits with those derived from the phosphorylated CNBr fragments isolated by immunoprecipitation with AbSP15 indicates that the two previously unidentified phosphopeptides 5 and 6 derived from the intact alpha subunit arise from phosphorylation of the site containing Ser686-Ser687. These results identify a new cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site and show that the major cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites of the rat brain sodium channel, which are phosphorylated both in vitro and in intact neurons, are all located in a cluster between residues 554 and 687 in the intracellular segment between domains I and II."
https://openalex.org/W1583861109,"Abstract Substantial loading of rat liver mitochondrial and microsomal membranes with D-alpha-tocopherol was achieved by dietary supplementation with no adverse effects of this loading being apparent, e.g. on treadmill exercise endurance. The tocopheroxyl radical was readily detected by ESR in the enriched microsomes and mitochondria. Continuous enzymatic oxidation with horseradish peroxidase and a hydrophilic phenol, to favor selective oxidation of tocopherol without the involvement of lipid peroxidation, allowed the tocopheroxyl radical to be observed for up to 1 h in liposomes of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and for about 15 min in the subcellular membranes. Total alpha-tocopherol decreased throughout this period, but a significant residual fraction remained after all the ESR signal of tocopheroxyl had disappeared. Decay kinetics of the tocopheroxyl radical ESR signal produced by a burst of intense UV irradiation consisted of a rapid initial phase and a slower exponential decay. A more narrow and more persistent ESR signal, not yet chemically identified, was observed after the tocopheroxyl radical had disappeared under prolonged oxidation. Ascorbic acid prevented formation of the tocopheroxyl radical until the ascorbyl radical ESR signal had decayed, whereas uric acid, up to saturating concentration in phosphate buffer, had no effect."
https://openalex.org/W1519694171,"Abstract cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE) has been directly photolabeled with [32P]cGMP using UV light. Sequence analysis of peptide fragments obtained from partial proteolysis or cyanogen bromide cleavage indicate that two different domains are labeled. One site, on a Mr = 36,000 chymotryptic fragment located near the COOH terminus, has characteristics consistent with it being close to or part of the catalytic site of the enzyme. This peptide contains a region of sequence that is highly conserved in all mammalian cyclic nucleotide PDEs and has been postulated to contain the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The other site, on a Mr = 28,000 cyanogen bromide cleavage fragment located near the middle of the molecule, probably makes up part of the allosteric site of the molecule. Labeling of the enzyme is concentration dependent and Scatchard analysis of labeling yields a biphasic plot with apparent half labeling concentrations of about 1 and 30 microM consistent with two types of sites being labeled. Limited proteolysis of the PDE by chymotrypsin yields five prominent fragments that separate by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at Mr = 60,000, 57,000, 36,000, 21,000, and 17,000. Both the Mr = 60,000 and 57,000 apparently have blocked NH2 termini suggesting that the Mr = 57,000 fragment is a subfragment of the Mr = 60,000 fragment. Primary sequence analysis indicates that both the Mr = 21,000 and 17,000 fragments are subfragments of the Mr = 36,000 fragment. Autoradiographs of photolabeled then partially proteolyzed enzyme show labeled bands at Mr = 60,000, 57,000, and 36,000. Addition of 5 microM cAMP prior to photolabeling eliminates photolabeling of the Mr = 36,000 fragment but not the Mr = 60,000 or 57,000 fragments. The labeled site not blocked by cAMP is also contained in a Mr = 28,000 cyanogen bromide fragment of the enzyme that does not overlap with the Mr = 36,000 proteolytic fragment. Limited chymotryptic proteolysis also increases basal activity and eliminates cGMP stimulation of cAMP hydrolysis. The chymotryptic fragments can be separated by either ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase monoclonal antibody treatment. A solid-phase monoclonal antibody against the cGMP-stimulated PDE removes the Mr = 60,000 and 57,000 labeled fragments and any intact, unproteolyzed protein but does not remove the Mr = 36,000 fragment or the majority of activity. Ion exchange HPLC separates the fragments into three peaks (I, II, and III). Peaks I and II contain activity of approximately 40 and 100 units/mg, respectively. Peak II is the undigested or slightly nicked native enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1587683482,"Immunological techniques were utilized to detect 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) receptor levels and to characterize physical/chemical changes in receptors in human promyelocytic leukemic cells (HL-60) during continuous exposure to hormone. The monoclonal antibody (IVG8C11) raised against the porcine intestinal 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor immunoprecipitated quantitatively 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in nuclear extracts from HL-60 cells. The highly enriched immunoprecipitated receptors were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were probed with 125I-labeled IVG8C11. The basal receptor from the cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 2 h was detected as a single form at 53 kDa. Moreover, receptors were shown to be up-regulated at 12 h and down-regulated at 48 and 72 h in the continuous presence of hormone as evidenced by the ratio of density of the bands, 1.0 (2 h):4.2 (12 h):1.2 (48 h):0.9 (72 h), as measured by laser scanning densitometry. The up- and down-regulated receptors were also detected as single forms and had the same molecular mass as the basal receptor. Therefore, the data presented here strongly support the hypothesis of homologous regulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in intact human target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555297725,"Abstract The melanotropin (MSH) receptor of mouse B16-F1 melanoma cells was characterized by photoaffinity cross-linking, using a potent alpha-MSH photolabel, [norleucine4, D-phenylalanine7, 1'-(2-nitro-4-azidophenylsulfenyl)-tryptophan9]-alpha-melanotropin (Naps-MSH). Its monoiodinated form, 125I-Naps-MSH, displayed a approximately 6.5-fold higher biological activity than alpha-MSH. Scatchard analysis of the saturation curves with 125I-Naps-MSH revealed approximately 20,000 receptors/B16-F1 cell and an apparent KD of approximately 0.3 nM. Analysis of the cross-linked MSH receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that a photolabeled band of approximately 45 kDa occurs in B16-F1, B16-F10, and Cloudman S91 mouse melanoma, as well as in human D10 and 205 melanoma but not in non-melanoma cells. The labeled 45-kDa protein had an isoelectric point of 4.5-4.9 as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Treatment of the labeled 45-kDa protein of B16-F1 cell membranes by neuraminidase shifted the band to approximately 42 kDa. A similar band of about 42 kDa was also observed after receptor labeling of B16-W4 cells, a cell line with a decreased number of terminal N-linked neuraminyl residues. These results indicate that the labeled 45-kDa glycoprotein contains terminal sialic acid residues, explaining the low pI of this protein, and that it is characteristic for melanoma cells and hence part of the MSH receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1566015590,"Abstract Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a hematopoietic cytokine which produces diverse biological effects in target cells of myeloid origin. GM-CSF enhances the production of superoxide anion (O2-) by mature neutrophils in response to chemotactic peptides such as formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), but alone it has no effect on this system. This process has been termed priming. fMLP activates neutrophils via a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein, leading to the rapid production of the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate, via phosphatidylinositol turnover, and arachidonic acid (AA) by a presumptive phospholipase A2-mediated mechanism. All three second messengers may lead to the generation of O2-. We investigated the effect of priming of GM-CSF on these systems. GM-CSF had no effect on fMLP-stimulated DAG and inositol trisphosphate levels, nor did it amplify the response to exogenously added phorbol ester (to mimic the action of DAG) or calcium ionophore. Neutrophils primed with the cytokine showed a small, but significant, enhancement of fMLP-stimulated AA release. Compared with unprimed controls, primed neutrophils also showed a significant increase in O2- production when stimulated with either AA or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP-gamma-S. The magnitude of enhanced O2- production was similar to that observed after fMLP treatment of primed cells. All of these effects, including the increased sensitivity to AA treatment, were inhibited by pertussis toxin. These data show that GM-CSF primes neutrophils by modulating the activity of at least one pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein coupled to a metabolic pathway that mobilizes and utilizes arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1580827737,"The primosome is a mobile multiprotein DNA replication-priming apparatus that requires seven Escherichia coli proteins (replication factor Y (protein n′), proteins n and n″, and the products of the dnaB, dnaC, dnaT, and dnaG genes) for assembly at a specific site (termed a primosome assembly site) on single-stranded DNA binding protein-coated single-stranded DNA. Two of the protein components of the primosome have intrinsic DNA helicase activity. The DNA B protein acts in the 5′→3′ direction, whereas factor Y acts in the 3′→5′ direction. The primosome complex has DNA helicase activity when present at a replication fork in conjunction with the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. In this report, evidence is presented that the multiprotein primosome per se can act as a DNA helicase in the absence of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The primosome DNA helicase activity can be manifested in either direction along the DNA strand. The directionality of the primosome DNA helicase activity is modulated by the concentration and type of nucleoside triphosphate present in the reaction mixture. This DNA helicase activity requires all the preprimosomal proteins (the primosomal proteins minus the dnaG-encoded primase). Preprimosome complexes must assemble at a primosome assembly site in order to be loaded onto the single-stranded DNA and act subsequently as a DNA helicase. The 5′→3′ primosome DNA helicase activity requires a 3′ single-stranded tail on the fragment to be displaced, while the 3′→5′ activity does not require a 5′ single-stranded tail on the fragment to be displaced. Multienzyme preprimosomes moving in either direction are capable of associating with the primase to form complete primosomes that can synthesize RNA primers."
https://openalex.org/W1562515718,"Abstract Ligand binding studies demonstrated that isolated rat Kupffer cells possess high affinity binding sites for platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, AGEPC). AGEPC binding reached saturation within 10 min at 25 degrees C and was reversible. A Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of AGEPC receptors numbering about 10,600 sites/cell and possessing a dissociation constant of 0.45 nM. Similar values for the dissociation constant for AGEPC (0.12 and 0.34 nM) were obtained independently by kinetic analysis of specific AGEPC binding. AGEPC binding was stereospecific and was inhibited by Zn2+ and AGEPC receptor antagonists including BN52021 and U66985. The AGEPC receptor was functionally active since it was shown to mediate arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid production in Kupffer cells, and these events were inhibited by AGEPC receptor antagonist BN52021. The receptor-mediated arachidonic acid release was extracellular calcium-dependent and was abolished by calcium channel blocker prenylamine and by [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, indicating that calcium influx through a receptor-regulated calcium channel in the plasma membrane is involved in the AGEPC-induced arachidonic acid release. It is suggested that rat Kupffer cells have specific and functionally active AGEPC receptors which are involved in signaling mechanisms which govern the production of several other autacoid-type mediators in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1519271287,"In adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II (AII) rapidly stimulates the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and causes marked long-term changes in the levels of highly phosphorylated inositols. Glomerulosa cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol for 48 h and exposed to AII for 10 min showed prominent increases in inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4,5-P4) and smaller increases in two additional tetrakisphosphates, Ins-1,3,4,6-P4 and another (Ins-3,4,5,6-P4) eluting in the position of Ins-3,4,5,6-P4 and its stereoisomer, Ins-1,4,5,6-P4, on anion exchange liquid chromatography. A concomitant decrease in InsP5 indicates that an increase in Ins-1,4,5,6-P4, the breakdown product of InsP5, is probably responsible for the initial rise in Ins-3,4,5,6-P4 during 10 min stimulation by AII. During prolonged stimulation by AII, Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 began to decline from its high, stimulated level after the first hour but the level of Ins-1,3,4,6-P4 remained elevated for several hours. There were also progressive increases in the levels of Ins-3,4,5,6-P4 and InsP5 during stimulation for up to 16 h with AII. Treatment of adrenal cells for 16 h with the cyclic AMP-mediated secretagogue, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), slightly increased basal levels of Ins-1,3,4,6-P4, Ins-3,4,5,6-P4, and InsP5, and enhanced the subsequent AII-stimulated increases in the two additional tetrakisphosphate isomers but not of inositol trisphosphates or Ins-1,3,4,5-P4. This change in the pattern of the higher inositol phosphate response to AII was manifested within 2 h after exposure to ACTH, and was mimicked by treatment with 8-bromo cyclic AMP or forskolin. Treatment with 50 microM cycloheximide abolished the ACTH-induced increases in inositol polyphosphate responses during AII stimulation, but had no effect on the responses of untreated cells to AII. The conversion of [3H]Ins-1,3,4-P3 to [3H]Ins-1,3,4,6-P4, a reaction linking the receptor-mediated InsP3 response to higher inositol phosphates, was enhanced in permeabilized cells that were pretreated for 16 h with either ACTH or AII. These results demonstrate that the reactions by which Ins-1,3,4,6-P4 and Ins-3,4,5,6-P4 are formed and converted to InsP5 are influenced by agonist-stimulated regulatory processes that include both calcium-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent mechanisms of target cell activation. They also reveal changes consistent with agonist-induced conversion of InsP5 to its dephosphorylated metabolite, Ins-1,4,5,6-P4, during short-term stimulation by AII."
https://openalex.org/W1496187814,"We measured time-dependent concentration changes of human interferon-alpha 2a (IFN) and human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) bound at the plasma membrane and internalized by human lung alveolar carcinoma A549 cells in the presence of excess free ligand. Concentration changes for these two ligands were substantially different. We modified our compartmental kinetic model encompassing receptor synthesis and receptor loss (Myers, A. C., Kovach, J. S., and Vuk-Pavlovic, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6494-6499) to include receptor recycling. We solved analytically the equations of three variants of the model of receptor recycling. All parameters (rate constants) were identifiable when the data sets consisted of time-resolved concentrations of IFN and TNF at the cell surface and internalized by cells. By least squares fitting we derived the best fit values for the first order rate constants for internalization of the ligand-receptor complex, receptor recycling, turnover of free receptors, elimination of the ligand from cells, and the rate of insertion of free receptors into the membrane. The best fit to data for interactions of cells with IFN was obtained without inclusion of the term for recycling of receptors to the membrane. The simplest model including receptor recycling was necessary and sufficient for the fit to the respective data for TNF. These results demonstrate that the contribution of receptor recycling to the metabolism of the ligand and the receptor can be quantitated by compartmental modeling. Receptor recycling does not contribute to the kinetics of Type I IFN receptor in A549 cells. In contrast, recycling contributes significantly to endocytosis mediated by the TNF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1572632194,"Abstract The distribution of binding sites for the calcium-mobilizing second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) was investigated in subcellular fractions of bovine adrenal cortex. The [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding capacity was enriched in the microsomal fraction, which contained a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd of 21.6 +/- 3.0 nM. The specific [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding appeared to be sharply pH dependent and was inhibited by millimolar concentrations of ATP. Upon fractionation of microsomes on sucrose density gradient there was a clearcut separation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor-containing fractions from those enriched in specific endoplasmic reticulum markers such as sulfatase C activity or RNA content. The microsomes enriched in Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding sites were of lower density than the endoplasmic reticulum and co-purified partly with the plasma membrane. In addition, Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive 45Ca2+ uptake into the microsomes was maximal in the lighter fractions. This distinction between Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding sites and endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes was confirmed upon fractionation according to their electrophoretic mobilities by free flow electrophoresis. These results indicate that in adrenal cortical cells, the source of Ca2+ mobilized by Ins(1,4,5)P3 upon stimulation with an agonist is not located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our data support the hypothesis that a specialized vesicular organelle, distinct from endoplasmic reticulum and in close apposition with the plasma membrane, is involved in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1573304738,"Abstract Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate the structure and environment of the heme group in bovine liver catalase compound II. Both Soret- and Q-band excitation have been employed to observe and assign the skeletal stretching frequencies of the porphyrin ring. The oxidation state marker band v4 increases in frequency from 1373 cm-1 in ferricatalase to 1375 cm-1 in compound II, consistent with oxidation of the iron atom to the Fe(IV) state. Oxidation of five-coordinate, high-spin ferricatalase to compound II is accompanied by a marked increase of the porphyrin core marker frequencies that is consistent with a six-coordinate low-spin state with a contracted core. An Fe(IV) = O stretching band is observed at 775 cm-1 for compound II at neutral pH, indicating that there is an oxo ligand at the sixth site. At alkaline pH, the Fe(IV) = O stretching band shifts to 786 cm-1 in response to a heme-linked ionization that is attributed to the distal His-74 residue. Experiments carried out in H218O show that the oxo ligand of compound II exchanges with bulk water at neutral pH, but not at alkaline pH. This is essentially the same behavior exhibited by horseradish peroxidase compound II and the exchange reaction at neutral pH for both enzymes is attributed to acid/base catalysis by a distal His residue that is believed to be hydrogen-bonded to the oxo ligand. Thus, the structure and environment of the heme group of the compound II species of catalase and horseradish peroxidase are very similar. This indicates that the marked differences in their reactivities as oxidants are probably due to the manner in which the protein controls access of substrates to the heme group."
https://openalex.org/W1598507095,"Abstract The subcellular localization of the membrane-associated CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase was determined in Chinese hamster ovary cells in which the phospholipid composition had been altered by growth in the presence of N-methylethanolamine or treatment with phospholipase C. Cell homogenates were fractionated on Percoll density gradients, and marker enzyme activities were used to determine the location of the cellular membrane fractions. The peak of cytidylyltransferase activity occurred in the gradient at a density intermediate to that of the peaks of endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane markers. The profile of cytidylyltransferase activity most closely resembled that of the Golgi membrane marker; however, upon sucrose gradient centrifugation, the profile of the Golgi apparatus was very different from that of cytidylyltransferase. Differential centrifugation suggested a nuclear membrane association of the enzyme. Cytidylyltransferase was associated with a membrane fraction that sedimented when subjected to very low speed centrifugation (65 x g, 5 min). From Percoll gradient fractions, nuclei were identified by microscopy, and they migrated with cytidylyltransferase activity. The data are consistent with a localization of cytidylyltransferase in the nuclear membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1590562493,"Interleukin 2 production by activated Jurkat T cells is markedly decreased by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The target of PGE2 action has been investigated in the present study. Among the biochemical events occurring after CD3.TCR triggering by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, phosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins, pp21 and pp23, was strongly inhibited by PGE2, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP, whereas anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-induced CD3.TCR modulation and Ca2+ influx were not affected. The inhibition of both pp21 and pp23 phosphorylation and interleukin 2 synthesis by PGE2 can be largely reversed by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, N-[2-(methylamino)-ethyl-1]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide. Together with the demonstration of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in Jurkat T cells, these results are consistent with the participation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediating the inhibitory action of PGE2, probably through the inhibition of pp21 and pp23 phosphorylation. Thus, it appears that the modulation of the phosphorylation of these cytosolic proteins represents an essential step in the regulation of T lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1592384272,"Two soluble cAMP-dependent protein kinases were purified from the cytoplasm of Paramecium tetraurelia. Both kinases consisted of a 40-kDa catalytic subunit and a 44-kDa regulatory subunit. The two forms of the enzyme were separated by anion-exchange chromatography. Affinity chromatography on cAMP-Sepharose separated the regulatory subunit (retained by the column) from the cAMP-independent catalytic subunit (not retained). Four classes of monoclonal antibodies were generated. One class was specific for the catalytic subunit of both cAMP-dependent protein kinases, and three classes recognized the regulatory subunit of both forms of the enzyme. Subunits of 40 and 44 kDa were detected on immunoblots of purified cilia and of crude cell extracts. In addition, one class of antibodies specific for the regulatory subunit detected a ciliary protein with a molecular mass of 48 kDa. The monoclonal antibodies did not recognize type I or type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase from rabbit muscle nor did they cross-react with proteins from several unicellular eucaryotes, with one exception: antibodies specific for the catalytic subunit recognized a 40-kDa protein of Tetrahymena pyriformis."
https://openalex.org/W128009703,"Cross-linking of the high affinity Fc receptor for human immunoglobulin G1 (Fc gamma RI) on U937 cells triggered superoxide anion (O-2) release. This was accomplished by the binding of an Fc gamma RI-specific monoclonal antibody, mAb 32, followed by cross-linking of the mAb on the cell with anti-mouse IgG F(ab')2 by Fc gamma RI-specific mAbs 32 and 22 used as an equimolar mixture or by Fc gamma RI-specific mAb 197 (a murine IgG2a and thus a multivalent ligand for Fc gamma RI) alone. At subsaturating concentrations of the Fc gamma RI-cross-linking ligands, O2- generation was continuous over relatively long intervals. However, saturating concentrations triggered an often substantial but always transient O2- burst. This transient burst of oxidase activity ceased with maximal ligand accumulation on the cell. Cells in which oxidase activity had ceased could be restimulated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or aggregated human IgG1, indicating that cessation of O2- generation was not due to a generalized exhaustion or inhibition of the NADPH oxidase pathway. Cells incubated in subsaturating concentrations of cross-linking antibodies continued to release O2- until binding of the ligand ceased. In addition, the rates of O2- production and ligand accumulation were the same. Thus, continuous O2- production appeared to be dependent upon continuous de novo formation of cross-linked and activated Fc gamma RI. Furthermore, the mol of O2- released in response to Fc gamma RI cross-linking by the multivalent ligand mAb 197 were directly proportional to the mol of mAb bound over a range of saturating and subsaturating concentrations. This evidence suggests a quantal relationship between each Fc gamma RI activated (cross-linked) and the resultant oxidase activity and supports a rate model for the activation of this response. Thus, each Fc gamma RI entering the pool of activated receptors probably makes a unitary contribution to the signal. An additional finding showed that cross-linked Fc gamma RI became associated with the cell cytoskeleton and that this association was also transient. Dissociation of Fc gamma RI from its cytoskeletal attachment occurred well after cessation of O2- production."
https://openalex.org/W1528250997,Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) causes an acute decrease in the high affinity binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to cell surface receptors and an increase in the phosphorylation state of the EGF receptor at threonine654. The hypothesis that PDGF action to regulate the EGF receptor is mediated by the activation of protein kinase C and the subsequent phosphorylation of EGF receptor threonine654 was tested. The human receptors for PDGF and EGF were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack expression of endogenous receptors for these growth factors. The heterologous regulation of the EGF receptor by PDGF was reconstituted in cells expressing [Thr654]EGF receptors or [Ala654]EGF receptors. PDGF action was also observed in phorbol ester down-regulated cells that lack detectable protein kinase C activity. Together these data indicate that neither protein kinase C nor the phosphorylation of EGF receptor threonine654 is required for the regulation of the apparent affinity of the EGF receptor by PDGF.
https://openalex.org/W1479874532,"Abstract A unique reaction for type II DNA topoisomerase is its cleavage of a pair of DNA strands in concert. We show however, that in a reaction mixture containing a molar excess of EDTA over Mg2+, or when Mg2+ is substituted by Ca2+, Mn2+, or Co2+, the enzyme cleaves only one rather than both strands. These results suggest that the divalent cations may play an important role in coordinating the two subunits of DNA topoisomerase II during the strand cleavage reaction. The single strand and the double strand cleavage reactions are similar in the following aspects: both require the addition of a protein denaturant, can be reversed by low temperature or high salt, and a topoisomerase II molecule is attached covalently to the 5' phosphoryl end of each broken DNA strand. Furthermore, the single strand cleavage sites share a similar sequence preference with double strand cleavage sites. There is, however, a strand bias for the single strand cleavage reaction. We show also that under single strand cleavage conditions, topoisomerase II still possesses a low level of double strand passage activity: it can introduce topological knots into both covalently closed or nicked DNA rings, and change the linking number of a plasmid DNA by steps of two. The implication of this observation on the sequential cleavage of the two strands of the DNA duplex during the normal DNA double strand passage process catalyzed by type II DNA topoisomerases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528656680,"Abstract Purified Mr 46,000 mannose 6-phosphate-specific receptor (MPR 46) lost its ligand-binding activity after reductive alkylation and after enzymatic deglycosylation. Deglycosylated MPR 46 did not assemble to homodimers. Therefore, we investigated the role of N-glycosylation, intrasubunit disulfide bonds, and subunit assembly for the acquisition of ligand-binding activity during in vitro synthesis of MPR 46. Up to 21% of MPR 46 synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate supplemented with dog pancreas microsomes acquired ligand-binding activity provided that 1-5 mM glutathione was present during translation and during a chase following translation. Acquisition of ligand-binding activity after cotranslational membrane insertion and core glycosylation depended on formation of intrasubunit disulfide bonds and a conformational change. Formation of intrasubunit disulfide bonds was not sufficient for ligand-binding activity and is likely to precede the conformational change, which resulted in increased resistance toward trypsin, formation of highly antigenic epitopes, and association to dimers, concomitant with the acquisition of ligand-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1573059745,"Abstract A general structure for the atrial natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (ANP C-receptor) has been proposed based on hydropathicity analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of this membrane protein (Fuller, F., Porter, J.G., Arfsten, A., Miller, J., Schilling, J., Scarborough, R.M., Lewicki, J.A., and Schenk, D.B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9395-9401). The ANP C-receptor is believed to possess a large amino-terminal extracellular domain (436 amino acids), a single hydrophobic transmembrane anchor (23 amino acids), and a short cytoplasmic tail (37 amino acids). As a means of testing the structure and proposed cellular orientation of this protein, we have employed the technique of in vitro mutagenesis to prepare a receptor mutant (anc-) lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Expression of this mutant in mammalian cells using a vaccinia virus vector results in secretion of a truncated soluble form of the ANP C-receptor which binds native ANP and synthetic ANP analogs with a specificity similar to that of the native ANP C-receptor. In contrast to the native ANP C-receptor that exists predominantly as a homodimer on the cell surface, the secreted receptor exists as a monomeric species. The results are consistent with the proposed structure of this receptor with the amino-terminal domain containing the ANP-binding site oriented extracellular to the plasma membrane. In addition, these data demonstrate that the receptor does not require association with the plasma membrane or its native dimeric configuration in order to bind ANP ligands with high affinity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1537169897,"Abstract In Escherichia coli, the reversible phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is catalyzed by a bifunctional protein: IDH kinase/phosphatase. Although both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase require ATP, the amino acid sequence of IDH kinase/phosphatase contains a single sequence that matches the consensus for ATP binding sites. A mutation that converted the invariant lysine (residue 336) of this consensus sequence to a methionine reduced the activities of both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase by factors of greater than 500, to levels below the detection limits of the assays. The apparent elimination of both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase by this mutation is consistent with the proposal that these activities share a common ATP binding site and that these reactions may occur at the same active site. Although conversion of Lys336 to a methionine eliminated detectable IDH kinase activity as measured in vitro, the mutant allele retained the ability to complement an aceK deletion mutation, restoring the ability of these cells to grow on minimal acetate medium. Complementation apparently resulted because the mutant protein retained sufficient activity to phosphorylate IDH in vivo. To determine whether the enzymatic assays performed in vitro had correctly reflected the activity of the mutant protein in vivo, we measured the rates at which mutant and wild-type cultures could incorporate [32P]inorganic phosphate into IDH. The wild-type culture achieved maximal incorporation in less than 3 min. In contrast, 32P incorporation was only barely detectable after 30 min in the mutant culture, indicating that the activity of the mutant protein is, indeed, greatly reduced in vivo. The ability of the mutant allele to complement an aceK null mutation thus suggests that IDH kinase/phosphatase levels in wild-type cells are in great excess over what is required for steady-state growth on acetate medium."

https://openalex.org/W1584481165,"Four proteins of molecular mass 102, 87, 45, and 38 kDa were isolated from plasma membrane preparations by affinity chromatography. The 102-, 87-, and 38-kDa proteins were shown to be collagen receptors involved in the adhesion of HeLa cells to a gelatin substratum. All four proteins were eluted by high salt from affinity columns made of either types I or IV collagen or type I gelatin. Generally, a total of six major proteins were found in the high salt eluates, although the relative amounts of each varied among experiments. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and limited peptide mapping indicated that the 102-kDa protein was most sensitive to proteolysis leading to the formation of proteins of molecular mass 58 and 54 kDa. Even in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors the 58-kDa fragment was usually the more abundant species. Lectin binding indicated that the 102-, 87-, and 38-kDa proteins contain carbohydrate. Phase-partitioning with Triton X-114 and the need to solubilize the proteins in Triton X-100 indicated that the 102-, 87-, 45-, and 38-kDa proteins have a hydrophobic domain. The 87-kDa protein partitioned exclusively with the detergent-rich phase, suggesting that it is the most hydrophobic. Cell surface labeling with 125I indicated that the four proteins have an extracellular domain. Four criteria were used to determine which of the four proteins are collagen receptors mediating cell-substrate adhesion: 1) during HeLa cell adhesion, proteins with Mr values similar to all four proteins or their peptide fragments were cross-linked to a gelatin substratum derivatized with a photoactivatable probe; 2) a pentapeptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp cell recognition sequence eluted the same four proteins as those found by high salt elution of collagen affinity columns; 3) monospecific antibodies to the 102-, 87-, and 38-kDa proteins, but not the 45-kDa protein, inhibited the spreading of HeLa cells on a gelatin substratum; 4) monospecific antibodies to the 102-, 87-, and 38-kDa proteins, but not the 45-kDa protein, bound to culture dishes substituted for gelatin in mediating the spreading of HeLa cells. Taken together, the data suggest that the 102-, 87-, and 38-kDa proteins are collagen receptors involved in HeLa cell adhesion. Although the 45-kDa protein has two of the characteristics of a collagen receptor defined here, it does not fit the criteria for one involved in cell-substratum adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1506876742,"Abstract Subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase is a mitochondrially encoded protein required for cellular respiration. A respiration-deficient yeast strain has been isolated and shown genetically to carry a mutation in the subunit II structural gene COX2. The respiration-deficient strain produces no subunit II polypeptide and is missing two major transcripts of the subunit II gene. The mutation, first mapped by rho- recombinational rescue to the 5' end of the gene, has been localized precisely, by DNA sequencing, 58 nucleotides upstream of the COX2 ATG initiation codon. The mutant strain carries a single nucleotide change (A to T) relative to the wild type sequence. This mutation occurs in a sequence with substantial homology to a previously identified yeast mitochondrial promoter consensus sequence. These results provide the first in vivo evidence for the importance of the consensus sequence for promoter function."
https://openalex.org/W1571356676,"We have previously shown that glucocorticoids suppress the proliferation of Fu5 hepatoma cells and have selected subclones which are either hypersensitive (BDS1) or resistant (EDR3) to the antiproliferative effects of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid. BDS1 cells externalize a glucocorticoid suppressible mitogenic activity (denoted GSM) which stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in quiescent, serum-starved Balb/c 3T3 cells. Glucocorticoid treatment of BDS1 cells reduced the secreted levels of GSM activity by approximately 20-fold in comparison to untreated cells. The GSM activity was constitutively secreted from a glucocorticoid receptor minus variant (EDR3) demonstrating that the suppression of this mitogenic activity is a new glucocorticoid hormone response which required a functional receptor. GSM activity was sensitive to sulfhydryl reducing agents or trypsin, stable to heat and acid treatments and fractionated in gel filtration columns with a native molecular weight of approximately Mr 30,000. The persistence of this size for mitogenic activity after electrophoretic fractionation in nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gels suggested that the GSM activity is comprised of a single protein. Total secreted protein isolated from untreated BDS1, but not dexamethasone-treated BDS1, stimulated 3T3 cells to grow in transformed-appearing large colonies in soft agar and to display multiple layering and elongated spindle-like morphology on solid substratum. The addition of both insulin and EGF to conditioned medium protein isolated from glucocorticoid-treated BDS1 cells restored full induction of 3T3 cell anchorage-independent growth while insulin restored full and EGF partial mitogenic stimulation of these fibroblasts. These results suggest that the GSM activity acts in a pathway common to that of insulin or EGF in fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W1566425029,"Bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase promoters have been classified as class II and class III on the basis of their relative location in T3 DNA as well as on the function of the protein products encoded by the messages transcribed from them. In the present work, the efficiency of utilization of several class II and class III promoters by bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase was compared with regard to (a) rate of initiation of transcription as determined by [32P]PPi exchange with GTP; (b) complex formation between polymerase and promoters in the presence of GTP; and (c) competition between different promoters for T3 RNA polymerase in a standard transcription assay. The results of these experiments indicated that the class II promoters at 1.05 and 22.8 T3 map units, whose promoter sequences are remarkably similar to the consensus class III promoter sequences, are nearly as strong as typical class III promoters. In contrast, the class II promoter at 14.3 T3 map units, whose promoter sequence differs from the consensus class III promoter sequence by having a C:G base pair instead of a usual A:T base pair at the −1 position, was considerably weaker than the class III promoter. When the C:G base pair at this position was changed to A:T using site-directed mutagenesis, the rate of initiation of RNA synthesis from the mutant promoter was similar to that of a typical class III promoter. In agreement with this observation, it was observed that changing the A:T base pair at the −1 position of a strong class II promoter, at 1.05 T3 map units, to C:G decreased the rate of RNA synthesis from this promoter by about 65%. These observations indicate that the nucleotide residues at the −1 position play a critical role in determining the efficiency of promoter utilization by T3 RNA polymerase. The two termination sites recognized in vitro by bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase on the T3 genome have been cloned, sequenced, and mapped. Analysis of the DNA nucleotide sequence surrounding the termination site at 59.7 map units indicated that the putative RNA transcript arising from this region can be arranged into a GC-rich stem-loop structure followed by a U-rich 3′ tail. However, a major fraction of T3 RNA polymerase molecules read through this terminator in vitro to transcribe regions of T3 DNA beyond this terminator. In contrast to termination at 59.7 map units, termination of transcription at 100 T3 map units does not occur in response to any putative terminator structure or sequence. Rather, T3 RNA polymerase transcribes through the terminal repeat region to the end of T3 DNA molecules to yield run-off transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1672102069,"The role of subunit VII, the ubiquinone-binding protein of the cytochrome b-c1 complex, in electron transfer reactions was investigated in yeast mitochondria. Preincubation of submitochondrial particles with specific antibody against subunit VII prior to addition of either succinate, NADH, or the reduced form of the decyl analogue of ubiquinol resulted in an approximately 40% increase in the extent of cytochrome c1 reduction compared with controls containing preimmune serum. Addition of antimycin, an inhibitor of center i, to submitochondrial particles resulted in a 21% decrease in the rate and a 36% decrease in the extent of cytochrome c1 reduction by succinate. Preincubation of submitochondrial particles with the antibody against subunit VII prior to addition of antimycin resulted in an increase in both the rate and extent of cytochrome c1 reduction to the levels observed in the control without inhibitor. The addition of myxothiazol (an inhibitor of center o), myxothiazol plus antimycin, or alkyl hydroxynaphthoquinone (an inhibitor analogue of ubiquinone) resulted in an almost complete inhibition in both the rate and extent of cytochrome c1 reduction; however, preincubation with the antibody against subunit VII prior to addition of these inhibitors resulted in a significant increase in cytochrome c1 reduction. These results confirm our previous report (Japa, S., Zhu, Q. S., and Beattie, D. S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5441–5444) that subunit VII is involved in electron transfer reactions at center o of the b-c1 complex. We suggest that the binding of antibody to subunit VII inhibits the transfer of electrons to cytochrome b-566. Consequently, two electrons are transferred to the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 through an antimycin-insensitive pathway. Moreover, the antibody may change the conformation of subunit VII, such that the myxothiazol and hydroxynaphthoquinone binding sites are partially blocked thus permitting electron flow to cytochrome c1."
