https://openalex.org/W2911430788,"Most brain functions involve interactions among multiple, distinct areas or nuclei. For instance, visual processing in primates requires the appropriate relaying of signals across many distinct cortical areas. Yet our understanding of how populations of neurons in interconnected brain areas communicate is in its infancy. Here we investigate how trial-to-trial fluctuations of population responses in primary visual cortex (V1) are related to simultaneously recorded population responses in area V2. Using dimensionality reduction methods, we find that V1-V2 interactions occur through a communication subspace: V2 fluctuations are related to a small subset of V1 population activity patterns, distinct from the largest fluctuations shared among neurons within V1. In contrast, interactions between subpopulations within V1 are less selective. We propose that the communication subspace may be a general, population-level mechanism by which activity can be selectively routed across brain areas."

We propose a model, called the feature fusion long short-term memory-convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN) model, that combines features learned from different representations of the same data, namely, stock time series and stock chart images, to predict stock prices. The proposed model is composed of LSTM and a CNN, which are utilized for extracting temporal features and image features. We measure the performance of the proposed model relative to those of single models (CNN and LSTM) using SPDR S&P 500 ETF data. Our feature fusion LSTM-CNN model outperforms the single models in predicting stock prices. In addition, we discover that a candlestick chart is the most appropriate stock chart image to use to forecast stock prices. Thus, this study shows that prediction error can be efficiently reduced by using a combination of temporal and image features from the same data rather than using these features separately."
https://openalex.org/W2951277388,"Summary Vault RNAs (vtRNA) are small non-coding RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III found in many eukaryotes. Although they have been linked to drug resistance, apoptosis, and viral replication, their molecular functions remain unclear. Here, we show that vault RNAs directly bind the autophagy receptor sequestosome-1/p62 in human and murine cells. Overexpression of human vtRNA1-1 inhibits, while its antisense LNA-mediated knockdown enhances p62-dependent autophagy. Starvation of cells reduces the steady-state and p62-bound levels of vault RNA1-1 and induces autophagy. Mechanistically, p62 mutants that fail to bind vtRNAs display increased p62 homo-oligomerization and augmented interaction with autophagic effectors. Thus, vtRNA1-1 directly regulates selective autophagy by binding p62 and interference with oligomerization, a critical step of p62 function. Our data uncover a striking example of the potential of RNA to control protein functions directly, as previously recognized for protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications."

Understanding how these sexually dimorphic behaviors are regulated at the level of circuits and transcriptomes will provide insights into neural mechanisms of sex-specific behaviors. Here, we uncover a sexually dimorphic role of the medial amygdala (MeA) in governing parental and infanticidal behaviors. Contrary to traditional views, activation of GABAergic neurons in the MeA promotes parental behavior in females, while activation of this population in males differentially promotes parental versus infanticidal behavior in an activity-level-dependent manner. Through single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we found that molecular sex differences in the MeA are specifically represented in GABAergic neurons. Collectively, these results establish crucial roles for the MeA as a key node in the neural circuitry underlying pup-directed behaviors and provide important insight into the connection between sex differences across transcriptomes, cells, and circuits in regulating sexually dimorphic behavior."

Because errors incorporated during translesion synthesis (TLS) opposite UV lesions would generate these mutations, TLS mechanisms are presumed to underlie cancer development. To address the role of TLS in skin cancer formation, we determined which DNA polymerase is responsible for generating UV mutations, analyzed the relative contributions of error-free TLS by Polη and error-prone TLS by Polθ to the replication of UV-damaged DNA and to genome stability, and examined the incidence of UV-induced skin cancers in Polθ-/-, Polη-/-, and Polθ-/- Polη-/- mice. Our findings that the incidence of skin cancers rises in Polθ-/- mice and is further exacerbated in Polθ-/- Polη-/- mice compared with Polη-/- mice support the conclusion that error-prone TLS by Polθ provides a safeguard against tumorigenesis and suggest that cancer formation can ensue in the absence of somatic point mutations."

Research design and methods Findings were pooled from 5 population-based cohorts: the Framingham Heart Study, the Rotterdam Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, the Aging Gene-Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES) and the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). Differences between users and non-users of insulin, metformin and sulfonylurea were assessed in each cohort for cognitive and brain MRI measures using linear regression models, and cognitive decline and dementia/AD risk using mixed effect models and Cox regression analyses, respectively. Findings were then pooled using meta-analytic techniques, including 3,590 individuals with diabetes for the prospective analysis. Results After adjusting for potential confounders including indices of glycemic control, insulin use was associated with increased risk of new-onset dementia (pooled HR (95% CI) = 1.58 (1.18, 2.12);p = 0.002) and with a greater decline in global cognitive function (β = -0.014±0.007;p = 0.045). The associations with incident dementia remained similar after further adjustment for renal function and excluding persons with diabetes whose treatment was life-style change only. Insulin use was not related to cognitive function nor to brain MRI measures. No significant associations were found between metformin or sulfonylurea use and outcomes of brain function and structure. There was no evidence of significant between-study heterogeneity. Conclusions Despite its advantages in controlling glycemic dysregulation and preventing complications, insulin treatment may be associated with increased adverse cognitive outcomes possibly due to a greater risk of hypoglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2913616282,"The kinesin-3 family member KIF1A plays a critical role in site-specific neuronal cargo delivery during axonal transport. KIF1A cargo is mislocalized in many neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that KIF1A's highly efficient, superprocessive motility along axonal microtubules needs to be tightly regulated. One potential regulatory mechanism may be through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of axonal microtubules. These PTMs often occur on the C-terminal tails of the microtubule tracks, act as molecular traffic signals helping to direct kinesin motor cargo delivery, and include C-terminal tail polyglutamylation important for KIF1A cargo transport. KIF1A initially interacts with microtubule C-terminal tails through its K-loop, a positively charged surface loop of the KIF1A motor domain. However, the role of the K-loop in KIF1A motility and response to perturbations in C-terminal tail polyglutamylation is underexplored. Using single-molecule imaging, we present evidence that KIF1A pauses on different microtubule lattice structures, linking multiple processive segments together and contributing to KIF1A's characteristic superprocessive run length. Furthermore, modifications of the KIF1A K-loop or tubulin C-terminal tail polyglutamylation reduced KIF1A pausing and overall run length. These results suggest a new mechanism to regulate KIF1A motility via pauses mediated by K-loop/polyglutamylated C-terminal tail interactions, providing further insight into KIF1A's role in axonal transport."
https://openalex.org/W2913266568,"Introduction Disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners can help HIV prevention efforts and enable HIV positive people to receive social support, as well as increasing access and adherence to treatment. This study was conducted to determine the rate, processes, outcomes, and correlates of HIV status disclosure to sexual partners among HIV positive individuals. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted between September and November 2015 at two HIV outpatient clinics in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data were collected using an interviewer- administered semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic analysis was used to determine the independent correlates of serostatus disclosure. Results Of 742 participants, (371 men and 371 women), 727 (98%) were on antiretroviral therapy and 676 (91.1%) had at least one sexual partner since their HIV diagnosis, of whom 558 (82.5%) had disclosed their HIV status to their most recent sexual partner. Of those who reported having disclosed their status to their most recent sexual partner, 82 (14.7%) had at least one unprotected sexual encounter with the partner, after HIV diagnosis but prior to disclosure. The most commonly reported initial outcome of disclosure was gaining emotional and/or financial support. Some (11.3%) also reported that their disclosure immediately initiated their partner for HIV testing. Negative outcomes to disclosure, such as stigma and discrimination, were more common among females (26.2%) compared to males (12.7%). In the multiple regression analysis, disclosure was associated with greater condom use, greater social support, knowing the partner’s HIV status, having a good relationship with the partner, and cohabiting with the partner. Conclusion HIV disclosure was common amongst participants, although sometimes delayed, with possible consequences for onward transmission. Fear of negative outcomes, such as verbal abuse and physical violence, were major barriers to disclosure. Efforts to support disclosure have the potential to contribute to HIV control and prevention by encouraging safer sexual practice, initiating partners for HIV testing, and enhancing support for people living with HIV."

However, whether this is the only signaling mode mediating lateral inhibition remains unclear. Here we show that in zebrafish oogenesis, a group of cells within the granulosa cell layer at the oocyte animal pole acquire elevated levels of the transcriptional coactivator TAZ in their nuclei. One of these cells, the future micropyle precursor cell (MPC), accumulates increasingly high levels of nuclear TAZ and grows faster than its surrounding cells, mechanically compressing those cells, which ultimately lose TAZ from their nuclei. Strikingly, relieving neighbor-cell compression by MPC ablation or aspiration restores nuclear TAZ accumulation in neighboring cells, eventually leading to MPC re-specification from these cells. Conversely, MPC specification is defective in taz−/− follicles. These findings uncover a novel mode of lateral inhibition in cell fate specification based on mechanical signals controlling TAZ activity.

Conversely, MPC specification is defective in taz−/− follicles. These findings uncover a novel mode of lateral inhibition in cell fate specification based on mechanical signals controlling TAZ activity. For a single cell to acquire a different developmental fate from its surrounding cells typically involves a mechanism commonly known as lateral inhibition (Perrimon et al., 2012Perrimon N. Pitsouli C. Shilo B.-Z. Signaling mechanisms controlling cell fate and embryonic patterning.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005975Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In lateral inhibition, first a group of cells is collectively determined to acquire a certain fate. The subsequent interaction between these initially equipotent cells leads to one dominant cell being singled out to acquire the primary cell fate, whereas the remaining cells of the group will eventually take on a secondary cell fate. For the dominant cell to be singled out, it needs to prevent primary fate acquisition in its direct neighbors via an inhibitory signal. Seminal studies on neurogenesis in both flies and vertebrates have identified Notch signaling as the inhibitory signal by which the dominant cell suppresses primary cell fate acquisition in neighboring cells (Lai, 2004Lai E.C. Notch signaling: control of cell communication and cell fate.Development. 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). However, whether Notch is the sole signal mediating lateral inhibition remains unclear. YAP and TAZ signaling has emerged as a major determinant of cell fate specification in development (Yu et al., 2015Yu F.-X. Zhao B. Guan K.-L. Hippo Pathway in Organ Size Control, Tissue Homeostasis, and Cancer.Cell. 2015; 163: 811-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). During mammalian pre-implantation development, for instance, YAP and TAZ signaling activity determines whether cells become part of the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm (Nishioka et al., 2009Nishioka N. Inoue K. Adachi K. Kiyonari H. Ota M. Ralston A. Yabuta N. Hirahara S. Stephenson R.O.

Cell. 2009; 16: 398-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Several biochemical signals, most prominently components of the Hippo signaling pathway, have been implicated in modulating YAP and TAZ signaling activity by regulating their nuclear localization (Halder et al., 2012Halder G.

When in the nucleus, YAP and TAZ function as transcriptional co-activators, regulating the expression of a large number of target genes involved in cell fate specification, proliferation, and morphogenesis (Porazinski et al., 2015Porazinski S.

Not only biochemical but also mechanical signals, such as shear stress, extracellular matrix rigidity, and cell and/or nucleus deformation, have been shown to control YAP and TAZ activity (Dupont et al., 2011Dupont S.

How those mechanical signals exert their effects on YAP and TAZ nuclear localization is not yet entirely understood, but mechanosensation at cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion sites is thought to translate into changes of the actomyosin network, which again affect YAP and TAZ nuclear localization (Dupont et al., 2011Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Le Digabel J. Forcato M. Bicciato S. et al.Role of YAP/TAZ in mechanotransduction.Nature. 2011; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3305) Google Scholar). In zebrafish oogenesis, the granulosa cell layer surrounding the maturing oocyte triggers formation of the chorion, an acellular eggshell surrounding the developing oocyte (Selman et al., 1993Selman K. Wallace R.A. Sarka A. Qi X. Stages of oocyte development in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.J. Morphol. 1993; 218: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The chorion contains a particular structure, the micropyle, which, during fertilization, functions as a channel to guide sperm from the outside to the mature oocyte (Yanagimachi et al., 2013Yanagimachi R. Cherr G. Matsubara T. Andoh T. Harumi T. Vines C. Pillai M. Griffin F. Matsubara H. Weatherby T. Kaneshiro K. Sperm attractant in the micropyle region of fish and insect eggs.Biol. Reprod. 2013; 88: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Micropyle formation has been traced back to a single cell within the granulosa cell layer, the micropyle precursor cell (MPC) (Selman et al., 1993Selman K. Wallace R.A. Sarka A. Qi X. Stages of oocyte development in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.J. Morphol. 1993; 218: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar; see also Figure 1A for a schematic representation of the MPC and surrounding tissue during oogenesis). Moreover, MPC specification has previously been linked to animal-vegetal polarization of the oocyte, with the MPC being located above the animal pole of the oocyte (Marlow and Mullins, 2008Marlow F.L. Mullins M.C. Bucky ball functions in Balbiani body assembly and animal-vegetal polarity in the oocyte and follicle cell layer in zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2008; 321: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MPC specification within the granulosa cell layer during oocyte maturation remain unknown. Previous studies have identified a single MPC within the granulosa cell layer surrounding the oocyte in stage III ovarian follicles (Selman et al., 1993Selman K. Wallace R.A. Sarka A. Qi X. Stages of oocyte development in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.J. Morphol. 1993; 218: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar; see also Figure 1A). To obtain insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MPC fate determination, we analyzed the ultra-structural composition of the MPC in late stage II follicles using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Consistent with previous observations (Selman et al., 1993Selman K. Wallace R.A. Sarka A. Qi X. Stages of oocyte development in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.J. Morphol. 1993; 218: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), we found the MPC to be considerably bigger than its immediate neighbors and to be directly connected to the underlying oocyte via a large protrusion containing microtubule-like structures (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Interestingly, we also found cytoskeletal elements resembling intermediate filaments specifically accumulating in the MPC (Figures 1C and 1D), suggesting that intermediate filaments might be involved in MPC differentiation. To test this possibility, we analyzed the expression of Cytokeratin18 (Krt18), one of the most commonly expressed intermediate filaments (Pan et al., 2013Pan X. Hobbs R.P. Coulombe P.A. The expanding significance of keratin intermediate filaments in normal and diseased epithelia.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2013; 25: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), in the MPC at different stages of follicle maturation using immunohistochemistry. Taking advantage of oocytes that express GFP-tagged Bucky ball (Buc) to mark the vegetal pole (Bontems et al., 2009Bontems F. Stein A. Marlow F. Lyautey J. Gupta T. Mullins M.C. Dosch R. Bucky ball organizes germ plasm assembly in zebrafish.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 414-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we observed elevated expression of Krt18 but not other Keratins such as Krt4 (Figure S1C), in a single granulosa cell located close to the animal pole of the oocyte from early oogenesis (early-middle stage II) onward (Figures 1E). This cell—judged by its position (Figure S1D), fast growth, and unique morphology (Figures 1E and 1F)—appeared to be the MPC. Interestingly, this MPC-like cell also expressed elevated levels of phospho-S6 (Figures S1E and S1F), a characteristic marker for activation of the mTOR pathway, previously associated with cell growth (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017Saxton R.A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR Signaling in Growth, Metabolism, and Disease.Cell. 2017; 168: 960-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). To confirm whether the Krt18-expressing cell identified indeed is the MPC, we turned to buc mutants, which had previously been shown to form multiple MPCs within the ovarian follicle because of failed animal-vegetal polarization of the oocyte (Dosch et al., 2004Dosch R. Wagner D.S. Mintzer K.A. Runke G. Wiemelt A.P. Mullins M.C. Maternal control of vertebrate development before the midblastula transition: mutants from the zebrafish I.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Marlow and Mullins, 2008Marlow F.L. Mullins M.C. Bucky ball functions in Balbiani body assembly and animal-vegetal polarity in the oocyte and follicle cell layer in zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2008; 321: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In stage II–III follicles of buc mutants, there were multiple single granulosa cells distributed over the entire granulosa cell layer that displayed the characteristic morphology of MPCs and expressed high levels of Krt18 (Figures S1G and S1H). This supports the notion that Krt18 expression is an early marker for MPC differentiation. Importantly, although we found several single Krt18-positive MPCs in buc mutants, we never observed multiple MPCs that were located directly adjacent to each other (Figures S1G and S1H). This points to the intriguing possibility that MPC specification may involve some form of lateral inhibition, preventing immediate neighbors from acquiring the same fate. To address this possibility, we first determined how the MPC interacts with its neighboring cells during follicle maturation using high-resolution confocal imaging and 3D SEM images. We found that, from stage II onward, granulosa cells directly neighboring the MPC became increasingly compacted and adopted a deformed shape indicative of mechanical compression by the expanding MPC (Figures 1G–1K and S1I). Analyzing shape changes of the MPC and its neighbors during stage II revealed two concomitant morphogenetic processes leading to this arrangement: first, the MPC grew bigger, increasing its volume more than four times (Figures 1E–1G); second, the neighboring granulosa cells kept their volume constant and became more compacted and deformed relative to the expanding MPC (Figures 1G–1K and S1I). This combination of events is consistent with a model where differential growth between the MPC and its surrounding granulosa cells generates pushing forces emanating from the growing MPC and compressing its immediate neighboring granulosa cells. To directly test this model, we used a krt18:krt18-GFP transgenic line allowing us to identify and monitor the MPC in live follicles (Figure S1J). Using this line, we then performed UV laser ablation of cell-cell junctions between granulosa cells in the vicinity of the MPC at late stage II to reveal tension distribution within the granulosa cell layer. We reasoned that if there would be pushing forces generated by the differential growth between the MPC and its surrounding granulosa cells, then tension should decrease at neighboring granulosa cell-cell junctions that are oriented perpendicular to the MPC surface and that this effect should be more evident close to the MPC than farther away. For analyzing junctional tension, we made use of a UV laser cutting setup and determined the recoil velocity of junctions after UV laser cutting as a readout of their tension (Behrndt et al., 2012Behrndt M. Salbreux G. Campinho P. Hauschild R. Oswald F. Roensch J. Grill S.W. Heisenberg C.-P. Forces driving epithelial spreading in zebrafish gastrulation.Science. 2012; 338: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that tension at junctions oriented orthogonal to the MPC between granulosa cells directly adjacent to the MPC was significantly smaller than between granulosa cells located farther away from the MPC (Figures 1L and 1M). Altogether, these findings support the notion that the expanding MPC mechanically compresses its neighboring granulosa cells. Given that the differentiation of a single MPC coincided with the expanding MPC mechanically compressing its neighboring cells, it is conceivable that the MPC suppresses MPC specification in its immediate neighbors by eliciting a mechanosensitive response in those cells. YAP and TAZ signaling has previously been implicated in mechanosensation (Dupont et al., 2011Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Le Digabel J. Forcato M. Bicciato S. et al.Role of YAP/TAZ in mechanotransduction.Nature. 2011; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3305) Google Scholar), and we thus asked whether YAP and TAZ might also be involved in MPC specification. Taking advantage of an antibody specifically detecting TAZ in zebrafish (Miesfeld et al., 2015Miesfeld J.B. Gestri G. Clark B.S. Flinn M.A. Poole R.J. Bader J.R. Besharse J.C. Wilson S.W. Link B.A. Yap and Taz regulate retinal pigment epithelial cell fate.Development. 2015; 142: 3021-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; Figure S2A), we analyzed TAZ localization in granulosa cells of stage II follicles. We found that, at early stage II, a small group of granulosa cells (2–5) at the animal pole began to express higher levels of TAZ than their immediate neighbors (Figures 2A and 2B ). This was specific to the animal pole because no such group of cells could be identified in other positions of the oocyte, such as the vegetal pole (Figures S2B and S2C). Shortly after (early to middle stage II), this elevated nuclear localization of TAZ became restricted to a single granulosa cell at the animal pole, that displayed the characteristic morphology of the MPC (Figure 2A). Notably, granulosa cells neighboring the MPC showed even less TAZ nuclear localization than granulosa cells farther away from the MPC (Figure 2A), giving rise to a pattern of TAZ nuclear localization at the animal pole of early to middle stage II oocytes where the MPC displaying very high levels of nuclear TAZ was surrounded by 1–3 rows of granulosa cells showing very low levels of nuclear TAZ that, again, were surrounded by granulosa cells further away from the MPC showing slightly higher levels of nuclear TAZ (Figures 2A and 2B). Moreover, comparing deformation of granulosa cells surrounding the MPC at middle stage II with their TAZ nuclear localization showed a close inverse relationship between the degree of granulosa cell deformation by the MPC and their level of nuclear TAZ accumulation (Figure S2D).Figure 2TAZ Nuclear Localization in the MPC and Surrounding Granulosa CellsShow full caption(A) Confocal images of cells at the animal pole of stage I–II follicles stained for the cell cortex by Phalloidin-Rhodamine-labeled F-actin, cell nuclei by DAPI, Krt18 (top 3 rows), and TAZ (bottom two rows) by immunohistochemistry.

Data are from 4 follicles for late stage I (120–140 μm), 6 for early stage II (140–170 μm), 11 for early stage II (170–200 μm), 10 for middle stage II (200–240 μm), 8 for middle stage II (240–270 μm), and 16 for late stage II (270–340 μm); follicles were collected from 6 animals. For each follicle, around 80 cells were analyzed. See also Figures S2 and S3. The selection of a single MPC showing very high levels of nuclear TAZ from early to middle stage II appeared to be a stepwise process, where an increasingly smaller number of cells were showing an increasingly higher level of nuclear TAZ; eventually, this led to one single granulosa cell displaying very high levels of TAZ, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of TAZ nuclear localization in the neighboring cells (Figures S3A and S3B). Interestingly, this evolution of nuclear TAZ level in granulosa cells at the animal pole of oocytes from early-to-middle stage II follicles was closely mirrored by changes in granulosa cell size and Krt18 expression, where the granulosa cells displaying increasingly high levels of nuclear TAZ also showed a tendency to increase their size and expression of Krt18 (Figures S3A–S3C). Collectively, these observations point to the possibility that TAZ signaling is involved in MPC specification and further suggest a model whereby the expanding MPC might inhibit TAZ nuclear localization and, thus, MPC specification in neighboring cells by mechanically compressing them. To test whether mechanical compression by the expanding MPC indeed represents the critical signal regulating TAZ nuclear localization in neighboring cells, we ablated the MPC cell in late stage II follicles using a UV laser. Remarkably, shortly (6 h) after MPC ablation, neighboring granulosa cells not only appeared less deformed and compacted than before (Figures 3A and 3B ) but also displayed clearly increased levels of nuclear TAZ when compared not only with their levels before ablation but also with granulosa cells farther away from the ablated MPC (Figures 3A and 3C). This suggests that neighboring granulosa cells after MPC ablation regain elevated levels of nuclear TAZ localization, indicative of early stages of MPC specification. To exclude that the effect of MPC ablation on nuclear TAZ localization is due to interference with biochemical signals from the MPC directly controlling TAZ nuclear localization in its neighboring cells, we also directly relieved compression of the neighboring granulosa cells and analyzed the resultant changes in nuclear TAZ localization. For relieving neighboring granulosa cell compression, we stretched the granulosa cell layer by either aspirating the MPC and surrounding granulosa cells into a micropipette (Figures 3D and 3E; note that both the MPC and surrounding granulosa cells had to be aspirated to effectively relieve compression of granulosa cells by the MPC) or ablating a few granulosa cells next to the MPC (Figures S4A and S4B). Similar to the MPC ablation experiments, the neighboring granulosa cells in both the granulosa cell ablation and aspiration experiments not only became less deformed and compacted but also showed clearly elevated levels of TAZ in their nuclei, indicative of early stages of MPC specification (Figures 3E, 3F, S4B, and S4C).Figure S4Granulosa Cell Ablation Relieves Remaining Granulosa Cells Compaction and Restores Nuclear TAZ Accumulation, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Confocal images (left and right column) and image segmentation (middle column) of cells at the animal pole of late stage II follicles after laser ablation of several granulosa cells directly adjacent to the MPC.

To determine whether neighboring cells regaining elevated levels of nuclear TAZ after MPC ablation would be able to form a new MPC, as expected for a lateral inhibition process underlying MPC specification, we followed the fate of these cells over 4 days in culture. Remarkably, we found that a similar selection process leading to MPC specification was activated in these cells, as observed in granulosa cells at the animal pole at early to middle stage II (Figures 2 and S3). First, a small group of granulosa cells surrounding the ablation site began to display increasingly higher levels of TAZ in their nuclei, eventually leading to one granulosa cell showing very high levels of TAZ in its nucleus, and the cells directly surrounding it showing reduced TAZ nuclear localization (Figures 4A and 4B ). The “winning” cell not only showed very high levels of nuclear TAZ but also displayed all features typically associated with an MPC, such as its characteristic size and shape, with a large protrusion marked by elevated levels of acetylated tubulin and F-actin, which was in direct contact with the underlying oocyte (Figures 4A–4F). Moreover, this cell, much like the original MPC before ablation, expressed strongly elevated levels of marker proteins delineating MPC specification and differentiatio"

Maintaining seed dryness throughout supply chain (The Dry Chain) prevents seed germination and quality losses. Ambient relative humidity (RH) and temperature affect seed moisture and thereof seed moisture isotherm. Present study was conducted to compare the moisture adsorption isotherms of wheat, maize, cotton and quinoa seeds packed in hermetic Super Bag and traditional packaging materials including paper, polypropylene (PP), jute and cloth bags. Seeds were incubated at 60, 70, 80 and 90% static RH. Nearly straight line moisture isotherms for all crop seeds were obtained in Super Bag. Seed moisture contents increased in traditional packaging materials with increasing RH. At higher level of RH, moisture contents increased slightly (1–2%) in Super Bag, whereas this increase was much higher in traditional packaging materials (≈9% higher than original SMC at 90% RH). In second study, seeds were dried to 8 and 14% initial seed moisture contents using zeolite drying beads and were stored in hermetic and conventional packaging materials for a period of 18 months. For all crop seeds, germination was severely affected in all packaging materials both at 8 and 14% initial SMC except storage in Super Bag at 8% SMC. Wheat seed stored in Super Bag at 8% SMC almost maintained initial germination while germination of cotton, maize and quinoa seeds declined 7%, 14% and 30% respectively in Super Bag at 8% SMC. Seed storage in Super Bag can help to prevent the significant increase in seed moisture at higher RH as is evident from moisture isotherm study, thus helps to preserve quality of maize, wheat, cotton and quinoa seeds by maintaining The Dry Chain throughout the storage period."
https://openalex.org/W2913661813,"Variable region analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences is the most common tool in bacterial taxonomic studies. Although used for distinguishing bacterial species, its use remains limited due to the presence of variable copy numbers with sequence variation in the genomes. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequences, obtained from completely assembled whole genome and Sanger electrophoresis sequencing of cloned PCR products from Serratia fonticola GS2, were compared. Sanger sequencing produced a combination of sequences from multiple copies of 16S rRNA genes. To determine whether the variant copies of 16S rRNA genes affected Sanger sequencing, two ratios (5:5 and 8:2) with different concentrations of cloned 16S rRNA genes were used; it was observed that the greater the number of copies with similar sequences the higher its chance of amplification. Effect of multiple copies for taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA gene sequences was investigated using the strain GS2 as a model. 16S rRNA copies with the maximum variation had 99.42% minimum pairwise similarity and this did not have an effect on species identification. Thus, PCR products from genomes containing variable 16S rRNA gene copies can provide sufficient information for species identification except from species which have high similarity of sequences in their 16S rRNA gene copies like the case of Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus. In silico analysis of 1,616 bacterial genomes from long-read sequencing was also done. The average minimum pairwise similarity for each phylum was reported with their average genome size and average “unique copies” of 16S rRNA genes and we found that the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes showed the highest amount of variation in their copies of their 16S rRNA genes. Overall, our results shed light on how the variations in the multiple copies of the 16S rRNA genes of bacteria can aid in appropriate species identification."

It is not known how cattle removal from beef cattle backgrounding operation affects the persistence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. We investigated the effect of cessation of beef cattle backgrounding operation on the persistence and distribution of ARGs in the beef cattle backgrounding environment. The study was conducted at a pasture-feedlot type beef cattle backgrounding operation which consisted of feeding and grazing areas that were separated by a fence with an access gate. Backgrounding occurred for seven years before cattle were removed from the facility. Soil samples (n = 78) from 26 georeferenced locations were collected at the baseline before cattle were removed, and then one year and two years after cattle were removed. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from the soil samples and total bacterial population (16S rRNA), total Enterococcus species and class 1 integrons (intI1), and erythromycin (ermB and ermF), sulfonamide (sul1 and sul2) and tetracycline (tetO, tetW and tetQ) resistance genes were quantified. Concentrations of total bacteria, Enterococcus spp., class 1 integrons, and ARGs were higher in the feeding area and its immediate vicinity (around the fence and the gate) followed by a gradient decline along the grazing area. Although the concentrations of total bacteria, Enterococcus spp., class 1 integrons and ARGs in the feeding area significantly decreased two years after cattle removal, their concentrations were still higher than that observed in the grazing area. Higher concentrations over two years in the feeding area when compared to the grazing area suggest a lasting effect of confined beef cattle production system on the persistence of bacteria and ARGs in the soil."
https://openalex.org/W2911943575,"Planktivorous fish predation directly affects zooplankton biomass, community and size structure, and may indirectly induce a trophic cascade to phytoplankton. However, it is not clear how quickly the zooplankton community structure and the cascading effects on phytoplankton recover to the unaffected state (i.e. resilience) once short-term predation by fish stops. The resilience has implications for the ecological quality and restoration measures in aquatic ecosystems. To assess the short-term zooplankton resilience against fish predation, we conducted a mesocosm experiment consisting of 10 enclosures, 6 with fish and 4 without fish. Plankton communities from a natural lake were used to establish phytoplankton and zooplankton in the mesocosms. High biomasses (about 20 g wet mass m-3) of juvenile planktivorous fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis) were allowed to feed on zooplankton in fish enclosures for four days. Thereafter, we removed fish and observed the recovery of the zooplankton community and its cascading effect on trophic interactions in comparison with no fish enclosures for four weeks. Short-term fish predation impaired resilience in zooplankton community by modifying community composition, as large zooplankton, such as calanoids, decreased just after fish predation and did not re-appear afterwards, whereas small cladocerans and rotifers proliferated. Total zooplankton biomass increased quickly within two weeks after fish removal, and at the end even exceeded the biomass measured before fish addition. Despite high biomass, the dominance of small zooplankton released phytoplankton from grazer control in fish enclosures. Accordingly, the zooplankton community did not recover from the effect of fish predation, indicating low short-term resilience. In contrast, in no fish enclosures without predation disturbance, a high zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio accompanied by low phytoplankton yield (Chlorophyll-a:Total phosphorus ratio) reflected phytoplankton control by zooplankton over the experimental period. Comprehensive views on short and long-term resilience of zooplankton communities are essential for restoration and management strategies of aquatic ecosystems to better predict responses to global warming, such as higher densities of planktivorous fish."
https://openalex.org/W2913217748,"X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) is a rare X-linked dermatological condition arising from deficiency for the enzyme steroid sulfatase (STS). STS is normally expressed in the brain, and males with XLI exhibit personality differences from males in the general population, and are at increased risk of developmental and mood disorders. As the STS gene escapes X-inactivation, female carriers of XLI-associated genetic mutations have reduced STS expression/activity relative to non-carrier females, and could manifest similar behavioural phenotypes to males with XLI. Additionally, as STS activity normally increases in female tissues towards late pregnancy and into the puerperium, carrier females could theoretically present with increased rates of postpartum psychopathology. Using a worldwide online survey comprising custom-designed demographic questionnaires and multiple validated psychological questionnaires, we collected detailed self-reported information on non-postpartum and postpartum behaviour in confirmed adult (>16yrs) female carriers of genetic mutations associated with XLI (n = 94) for statistical comparison to demographically-matched previously-published normative data from female controls (seven independent studies, 98≤n≤2562), adult males with XLI (n = 58), and to newly-obtained online survey data from a general population sample of mothers from the United Kingdom and United States of America (n = 263). The pattern of results in carrier females relative to controls was remarkably similar to that previously observed in males with XLI, with evidence for increased rates of developmental and mood disorders, and elevated levels of inattention, impulsivity, autism-related traits and general psychological distress. Carrier females exhibited a significantly elevated rate of postpartum mental health conditions (notably mild depression) relative to controls which could not be accounted for by social factors. Our data confirm the psychological profile associated with XLI-associated mutations, and suggest that female carriers may be at increased risk of psychopathology, including in the postpartum period. These findings are relevant to families affected by XLI, to clinicians involved in the care of these families, and to genetic counsellors."

The mechanism underlying development of CRPC with NED, however, remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we explored and characterized the functional role of neurotensin (NTS) in cell line and animal models of CRPC with NED. NTS was acutely induced by androgen deprivation in animal models of prostate cancer (PCa) and activated downstream signaling leading to NED through activation of neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) and neurotensin receptor 3 (NTSR3), but not neurotensin receptor 2 (NTSR2). Our findings also revealed the existence of a CK8+/CK14+ subpopulation in the LNCaP cell line that expresses high levels of both NTSR1 and NTSR3, and displays an enhanced susceptibility to develop neuroendocrine-like phenotypes upon treatment with NTS. More importantly, NTSR1 pathway inhibition prevented the development of NED and castration resistance in vivo. We propose a novel role of NTS in the development of CRPC with NED, and a possible strategy to prevent the onset of NED by targeting the NTS signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2914541321,"Cholesterol's effects on Na+,K+-ATPase reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles have been extensively studied. However, previous studies have reported both cholesterol-mediated stimulation and inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Here, using partial reaction kinetics determined via stopped-flow experiments, we studied cholesterol's effect on Na+,K+-ATPase in a near-native environment in which purified membrane fragments were depleted of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD). The mβCD-treated Na+,K+-ATPase had significantly reduced overall activity and exhibited decreased observed rate constants for ATP phosphorylation (ENa3+ → E2P, i.e. phosphorylation by ATP and Na+ occlusion from the cytoplasm) and K+ deocclusion with subsequent intracellular Na+ binding (E2K2+ → E1Na3+). However, cholesterol depletion did not affect the observed rate constant for K+ occlusion by phosphorylated Na+,K+-ATPase on the extracellular face and subsequent dephosphorylation (E2P → E2K2+). Thus, partial reactions involving cation binding and release at the protein's intracellular side were most dependent on cholesterol. Fluorescence measurements with the probe eosin indicated that cholesterol depletion stabilizes the unphosphorylated E2 state relative to E1, and the cholesterol depletion-induced slowing of ATP phosphorylation kinetics was consistent with partial conversion of Na+,K+-ATPase into the E2 state, requiring a slow E2 → E1 transition before the phosphorylation. Molecular dynamics simulations of Na+,K+-ATPase in membranes with 40 mol % cholesterol revealed cholesterol interaction sites that differ markedly among protein conformations. They further indicated state-dependent effects on membrane shape, with the E2 state being likely disfavored in cholesterol-rich bilayers relative to the E1P state because of a greater hydrophobic mismatch. In summary, cholesterol extraction from membranes significantly decreases Na+,K+-ATPase steady-state activity."

https://openalex.org/W2914097005,"One response of cells to growth factor stimulus involves changes in morphology driven by the actin cytoskeleton and actin associated proteins which regulate functions such as cell adhesion, motility and in neurons, synaptic plasticity. Previous studies suggest that Huntingtin may be involved in regulating morphology however, there has been limited evidence linking endogenous Huntingtin localization or function with cytoplasmic actin in cells. We found that depletion of Huntingtin in human fibroblasts reduced adhesion and altered morphology and these phenotypes were made worse with growth factor stimulation, whereas the presence of the Huntington’s Disease mutation inhibited growth factor induced changes in morphology and increased numbers of vinculin-positive focal adhesions. Huntingtin immunoreactivity localized to actin stress fibers, vinculin-positive adhesion contacts and membrane ruffles in fibroblasts. Interactome data from others has shown that Huntingtin can associate with α-actinin isoforms which bind actin filaments. Mapping studies using a cDNA encoding α-actinin-2 showed that it interacts within Huntingtin aa 399–969. Double-label immunofluorescence showed Huntingtin and α-actinin-1 co-localized to stress fibers, membrane ruffles and lamellar protrusions in fibroblasts. Proximity ligation assays confirmed a close molecular interaction between Huntingtin and α-actinin-1 in human fibroblasts and neurons. Huntingtin silencing with siRNA in fibroblasts blocked the recruitment of α-actinin-1 to membrane foci. These studies support the idea that Huntingtin is involved in regulating adhesion and actin dependent functions including those involving α-actinin."
https://openalex.org/W2913220806,"We address gene selection and machine learning methods for cancer classification using microarray gene expression data. Due to the high dimensionality of microarray data, traditional gene selection algorithms are filter-based, focusing on intrinsic properties of the data such as distance, dependency, and correlation. These methods are fast but select far too many genes to use for the classification task. In this work, we present a new hybrid filter-wrapper gene subset selection algorithm that is an improved modification of our prior algorithm. Our proposed method employs interaction information to rank candidate genes to add into a gene subset. It then conditionally adds one gene at a time into the current subset and verifies whether the resultant subset improves the classification performance significantly. Only significant genes are selected, and the candidate gene list is updated every time a gene is added to the subset. Thus, our gene selection algorithm is very dynamic. Experimental results on ten public cancer microarray data sets show that our method consistently outperforms prior gene selection algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, while requiring a small number of selected genes."

RV infections are the leading cause of infantile diarrhea and severe gastroenteritis, resulting in around 215,000 deaths annually worldwide (15Tate J.E. Burton A.H. Boschi-Pinto C. Parashar U.D.

Similar to those of influenza virus and orthoreovirus, RV gene segments have to be precisely organized and packaged into newly synthesized icosahedral virus particles during genome assembly (16Long C.P. McDonald S.M. Rotavirus genome replication: some assembly required.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 (28426777): e100624210.1371/journal.ppat.1006242Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A previous study of a highly-related bluetongue virus and recent studies of RV suggest that the smaller RV RNA segments may be sorted into the newly forming virion particles first, and then the larger RNA segments enter the particle via RNA–RNA interactions in a sequential and NSP2-dependent manner (17Fajardo Jr, T.

For bacteriophages and large DNA viruses like herpesvirus and poxviruses, a central component of the packaging motor that drives viral genome assembly is the ATPase subunit, provided by the viruses themselves (23Hilbert B.J.

Here, we employed a novel and powerful technique named RNA-Protein Interaction Detection (RaPID), recently developed to study RNA–protein interactions (28Ramanathan M. Majzoub K. Rao D.S. Neela P.H. Zarnegar B.J. Mondal S. Roth J.G. Gai H. Kovalski J.R. Siprashvili Z. Palmer T.D. Carette J.E. Khavari P.A. RNA–protein interaction detection in living cells.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 (29400715): 207-21210.1038/nmeth.4601Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), to comprehensively profile the host factors that bind to a stretch of conserved sequences within 3′UTR of group A RV genomes. Surprisingly, we identified ATP5B, an integral part of the mitochondrial F1–F0-ATPase complex (29von Ballmoos C. Cook G.M. Dimroth P. Unique rotary ATP synthase and its biological diversity.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37 (18573072): 43-6410.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.130018Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), as a cellular component that co-precipitated and co-localized with RV dsRNA during infection. Functional dissection using small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown and a panel of small-molecule pharmacological inhibitors suggested that ATP5B assists RV genome replication and virion assembly. Thus, our study systematically interrogated the host proteins that interact with the RV 3′ terminus and revealed a tractable method to rapidly identify host proteins that bind to viral RNA sequences of interest in living cells. For group A human and animal RVs, the last seven nucleotides within the mRNA 3′UTR, 5′-UGUGACC-3′, are highly conserved in all 11 gene segments (30Chen D. Patton J.T. De novo synthesis of minus strand RNA by the rotavirus RNA polymerase in a cell-free system involves a novel mechanism of initiation.RNA. 2000; 6 (11073221): 1455-146710.1017/S1355838200001187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Patton J.T.

This short sequence forms a cis-acting signal that contributes to the efficient synthesis of minus strand RNA and is also conducive to viral gene expression in the host cells through interaction with RV protein NSP3 (33Patton J.T.

However, the nature and identity of host factors that bind to this important RNA region remain unknown. To comprehensively identify host proteins that interact with RV 3′UTR consensus sequence, we took advantage of a new screening approach, named RaPID, that detects, with high sensitivity, any protein in the vicinity of the target RNA molecule (28Ramanathan M. Majzoub K. Rao D.S. Neela P.H. Zarnegar B.J. Mondal S. Roth J.G. Gai H. Kovalski J.R. Siprashvili Z. Palmer T.D. Carette J.E. Khavari P.A. RNA–protein interaction detection in living cells.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 (29400715): 207-21210.1038/nmeth.4601Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In brief, biotin–protein ligase BirA (36Roux K.J. Kim D.I. Raida M. Burke B. A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 (22412018): 801-81010.1083/jcb.201112098Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar) is N-terminally fused to a 22-amino acid λN peptide that recognizes bacteriophage λ BoxB stem-loops with high affinity (37Austin R.J. Xia T. Ren J. Takahashi T.T. Roberts R.W. Designed arginine-rich RNA-binding peptides with picomolar affinity.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124 (12224929): 10966-1096710.1021/ja026610bCrossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), flanking both 5′ and 3′ ends of an RNA of interest (Fig. 2A). Thus, BirA ligase is brought in close proximity to and biotinylates all proteins that directly or indirectly associate with target RNA. We then perform immunoprecipitation with streptavidin beads and used MS and bioinformatics analysis to identify interacting protein partners. As a proof of principle, we first tested the interaction between a pair of positive controls: a 15-nucleotide UG–rich EDEN15 motif (UGUUUGUUUGUUUGU) that is reported to bind to the CUG triplet repeat RNA-binding protein 1 (CUG-BP1) (38Graindorge A. Le Tonquèze O. Thuret R. Pollet N. Osborne H.B. Audic Y. Identification of CUG-BP1/EDEN-BP target mRNAs in Xenopus tropicalis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (18267972): 1861-187010.1093/nar/gkn031Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As expected, specific immunoprecipitation of endogenous CUG-BP1 was only observed with EDEN15 and not with the negative control scrambled sequences (Fig. 2B). Next, we examined the well-documented interaction between the conserved RV 3′UTR and an RV nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3). Consistent with previous reports (34Poncet D. Laurent S. Cohen J. Four nucleotides are the minimal requirement for RNA recognition by rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP3.EMBO J. 1994; 13 (8076612): 4165-417310.1002/j.1460-2075.1994.tb06734.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we detected strong binding of the UGUGACC sequence with either ectopically expressed GFP-tagged NSP3 or endogenous NSP3 expressed during RV infection (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that this technique is well-suited to interrogate the host protein–binding partners of the RV 3′UTR sequences. In addition to examining binding proteins of 3′UTR RV monomers, we further tested whether a pentamer of RV 3′UTRs with two adenosine spacers between monomers would increase the sensitivity for detecting host protein binding to NSP3. However, our results indicated that a monomer was equally effective for pulling down NSP3 (data not shown). Therefore, for the rest of the study, we used the monomeric probes to reduce the possibility of creating artificial secondary structures. By comparing a scrambled sequence (AUAGGCGUC) to an authentic conserved RV 3′UTR probe (GAUGUGACC) in the presence or absence of RV infection, we were able to identify host proteins that specifically immunoprecipitated with the 3′UTR consensus sequences (Table S1). We then used CRAPome filtering analysis (39Mellacheruvu D. Wright Z. Couzens A.L. Lambert J.P. St-Denis N.A. Li T. Miteva Y.V. Hauri S. Sardiu M.E. Low T.Y. Halim V.A. Bagshaw R.D. Hubner N.C.

Our analysis identified three high-confidence “hits”: the mitochondrial F1 complex β-polypeptide ATP5B; the RAS oncogene family member RAB1A; and the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase IARS as interacting partners to the RV 3′UTR consensus sequences (Fig. 2E and Table S2). Of note, ATP5B, an ATP synthase β subunit (29von Ballmoos C. Cook G.M. Dimroth P. Unique rotary ATP synthase and its biological diversity.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37 (18573072): 43-6410.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.130018Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was found to be enriched at 100-fold in its interaction with 3′UTR probe over control (Fig. 2E). ATP5B was previously reported to promote human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication and chikungunya virus infection (40Zhou H. Xu M. Huang Q. Gates A.T. Zhang X.D. Castle J.C. Stec E. Ferrer M. Strulovici B. Hazuda D.J. Espeseth A.S.

Importantly, we also detected two other pivotal components of the ATP synthase complex, ATP5A1 and ATP5O, in the pulldown of 3′UTR sequence during RV infection (Fig. 2F). It is worth noting that all three ATP synthase subunits were found to interact with the RV 3′UTR probe only in the context of RV infection (Fig. 2F). Taken together, this new assay technique to detect host RNA-binding proteins allowed us to identify several novel proteins, including several ATP synthase subunits that had previously not been known to interact with viral RNA. We next carried out a set of experiments to validate the association between ATP5B and the conserved RV 3′UTR sequences. Using streptavidin beads to directly pull down biotinylated host proteins in mock- or RV-infected cells, we observed strong binding of endogenous ATP5B with an RV 3′UTR probe, but only very weak interaction was detected with the scrambled probe (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the ATP5B–3′UTR interaction was observed exclusively during active RV infection (Fig. 3A), suggesting that such interaction might be regulated by other host factors, viral factors, or virus-induced cellular changes. We hypothesize that to physically interact with RV RNA, ATP5B is likely to co-localize with viral RNA in infected cells. We first determined ATP5B localization in the presence or absence of RV infection. In mock-infected cells, almost all ATP5B was found at the mitochondria (Fig. 3B, upper panel), consistent with previous reports (42Yang W. Nagasawa K. Münch C. Xu Y. Satterstrom K. Jeong S.

However, in RV-infected cells, we observed a significant condensation of mitochondrial organization in viral antigen VP6–positive cells (Fig. 3B, lower panel), recently noted by Green and Pelkmans (1Green V.A. Pelkmans L. A systems survey of progressive host-cell reorganization during rotavirus infection.Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 (27414499): 107-12010.1016/j.chom.2016.06.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well. To examine the subcellular localization of ATP5B relative to viral RNA, we designed specific fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes that detect RV RNA with high resolution. Our RV FISH probes were highly specific for viral RNA and only observed within the viroplasm, the distinct punctate viral factories that are positive for the nonstructural protein NSP2 (Fig. 3C). Importantly, viral RNA signal was also seen, at least partially, to overlap with ATP5B localization during infection (Fig. 3D and inset). In contrast, minimal co-localization was observed between RV RNA with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) (Fig. 3D). Therefore, data from both immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments are consistent with our screening results indicating that ATP5B is a bona fide RV 3′UTR–interacting protein. Having established ATP5B–rotaviral RNA interaction, we next sought to examine the functional role of ATP5B during RV infection. Because genetic depletion of ATP5B induces lethality (43Blomen V.A. Majek P. Jae L.T. Bigenzahn J.W. Nieuwenhuis J. Staring J. Sacco R. van Diemen F.R. Olk N. Stukalov A. Marceau C. Janssen H. Carette J.E. Bennett K.L. Colinge J. Superti-Furga G. Brummelkamp T.R. Gene essentiality and synthetic lethality in haploid human cells.Science. 2015; 350 (26472760): 1092-109610.1126/science.aac7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), we utilized siRNA to knock down ATP5B expression levels. All three top candidates identified in our proteomics screen, ATP5B, RAB1A, and IARS, were effectively silenced with their specific siRNAs and examined by their mRNA levels by quantitative PCR (Fig. 4A). Both ATP5B and IARS siRNA also led to a marked reduction of respective protein levels, although the decrease was more significant with IARS than ATP5B (Fig. 4B). Importantly, in a multiple-round infection assay, at 24 h post-infection, knockdown of ATP5B led to 40% reduction in the mRNA levels of NSP5, an RV gene transcript representative of intracellular RV RNA synthesis (Fig. 4C), and we also observed an ∼40% decrease in the amount of infectious RVs in the supernatant of the ATP5B knockdown cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that ATP5B facilitates RV replication in host cells. Given that all group A RVs share consensus sequences of the ATP5B-binding site at their 3′UTR ends (Fig. 1), we next examined whether the pro-RV role of ATP5B is conserved across different RV strains. Consistent with our hypothesis, the infectivity of a panel of cell culture adapted group A human and animal RVs was inhibited by siRNA depletion of ATP5B (Fig. 4E). In contrast, the replication of several other RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus and two strains of influenza A viruses, which do not possess 3′-UGUGACC sequences, was not affected by ATP5B knockdown (Fig. 4, F and G). ATP5B knockdown also did not influence the replication of Salmonella typhimurium, an intracellular bacterial pathogen or even reovirus, another Reoviridae family member with many properties similar to RVs (Fig. 4, H and I), thereby in support of a highly-specific pro-RV role of ATP5B. To mechanistically determine at which step in the RV replication cycle in which ATP5B is involved, we undertook a series of experiments to target various molecular processes within a single RV replication cycle. First, initial viral adsorption and subsequent endocytosis, assayed by input viral RNA levels 4 and 37 °C post-incubation, respectively, and using EDTA wash as a negative control, were not affected by ATP5B siRNA, when compared with control siRNA (Fig. 5, A and B). These two pieces of experimental evidence strongly suggest that early events in RV infection are not perturbed by the loss of ATP5B. Next, we measured viral RNA by quantitative PCR and protein levels using polyclonal antibody that recognizes RV double-layered particles (44Feng N. Vo P.T. Chung D. Vo T.V. Hoshino Y. Greenberg H.B. Heterotypic protection following oral immunization with live heterologous rotaviruses in a mouse model.J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175 (9203654): 330-34110.1093/infdis/175.2.330Cros"
https://openalex.org/W2913720755,"Habitat heterogeneity of tropical forests is thought to lead to specialization in plants and contribute to the high diversity of tree species in Amazonia. One prediction of habitat specialization is that species specialized for resource-rich habitats will have traits associated with high resource acquisition and fast growth while species specialized for resource-poor habitats will have traits associated with high resource conservation and persistence but slow growth. We tested this idea for seven genera and for twelve families from nutrient-rich white-water floodplain forest (várzea) and nutrient-poor black-water (igapó) floodplain forest. We measured 11 traits that are important for the carbon and nutrient balance of the trees, and compared trait variation between habitat types (white- and black-water forests), and the effect of habitat and genus/family on trait divergence. Functional traits of congeneric species differed between habitat types, where white-water forest species invested in resource acquisition and productive tissues, whereas black-water forest species invested in resource conservation and persistent tissues. Habitat specialization is leading to the differentiation of floodplain tree species of white-water and black-water forests, thus contributing to a high diversity of plant species in floodplain forests."

The contribution of reinfection and relapse to TB incidence, and the factors associated with each are unknown. We aimed to quantify and describe cases attributable to relapse or reinfection, and identify associated risk factors in order to reduce recurrence. We categorised recurrent TB cases from notifications in London (2002–2015) as relapse or reinfection using molecular (MIRU VNTR strain type) and epidemiological information (hierarchical approach using time since notification, site of disease and method of case finding). Factors associated with each outcome were determined using logistic regression in Stata Version 13.1 (2009–2015 only). Of 43,465 TB cases, 1.4% (618) were classified as relapse and 3.8% (1,637) as reinfection. The proportion with relapse decreased from 2002 (2.3%) to 2015 (1.3%), while the proportion of reinfection remained around 4%. Relapse was more common among recent migrants (<1 year, odds ratio (OR) = 1.99, p = 0.005), those with a social risk factor (OR = 1.51, p = 0.033) and those with central nervous system, spinal, miliary or disseminated TB (OR = 1.75, p = 0.001). Reinfection was more common among long term migrants (>11 years, OR = 1.67, p = <0.001), those with a social risk factor (OR = 1.96, p = <0.001) and within specific areas in London. Patients with social risk factors were at increased risk of both relapse and reinfection. Characterising those with relapsed disease highlights patients at risk and factors associated with reinfection suggest groups where transmission is occurring. This will inform TB control programs to target appropriate treatment and interventions in order to reduce the risk of recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2914282665,"Global investments in online advertising rise quickly but internet users often avoid looking at ads due to established banner blindness. Demographic targeting is expected to overcome this tendency by attracting users' attention to more self-relevant ad content. However, little is known about the effect of demographically targeted versus non-targeted ads on users' actual attention allocation during exposure to webpages. The present study aimed to further fill this empirical gap by clarifying whether demographic targeting attracts visual attention and to exploratively examine whether it also affects brand attitude and website evaluation, as suggested by previous studies. Eye tracking data revealed that demographic targeting can have medium- to large-sized effects on several eye movement parameters when internet users are in a free-viewing mode. In contrast, demographic targeting did not influence brand attitude and website evaluation. We conclude that attention for personally relevant advertisement can be strong. However, attention, although being a necessary condition for subsequent judgment formation according to the model of human information processing, is not sufficient to elicit positive effects at the level of subjective judgments."

These included 799 in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), 486 in the 3′ UTR, and 266 non-synonymous, 189 coding synonymous, six nonsense, and six stop-gained SNPs. Results and discussion In silico tools (SIFT, SNAP, PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, I-Mutant, PROVEAN, SNPs&GO, mCSM, and PhD-SNP) predicted the five most-deleterious nsSNPs: rs61742690, rs62142605, rs17028351, rs115666026, and rs74987258. Molecular dynamic simulation and homology modelling of the mutated proteins (S783N, D643N, G451S, K670R, and M313L) of the most deleterious nsSNPs revealed their functional and structural impact. nsSNP rs61742690 was predicted to be the most deleterious, as supported by eight of the nine in silico tools. Conclusions Complete failure in the protein–protein interactions with functional partners (KLF1 and others) and significant changes (±100% variation) in the interface energy revealed that rs61742690 (S783N) in the zinc-finger domain is a suitable target for disrupting BCL11A-mediated foetal-to-adult globin switching."

Yellowing was caused by photolytic degradation and haze formation was induced by combined effects of photolytic and hydrolytic degradation. The formation of light absorbing chromophores and bleaching of the UV stabilizer additive were recorded through optical spectroscopy. Chain scission and crystallization were found to be common mechanisms under both photolytic and hydrolytic conditions, based on the infrared absorption of the carbonyl (C = O) band and the trans ethylene glycol unit, respectively. The degradation mechanisms determined from these evaluations were then used to construct a set of degradation pathway network models using the network structural equation modeling (netSEM) approach. This method captured the temporal evolution of degradation by assessing statistically significant relationships between applied stressors, mechanistic variables, and performance level responses. Quantitative pathway equations provided the contributions from mechanistic variables to the response changes."
https://openalex.org/W2912300910,"Background Patient groups represent the interest of their members when it comes to drug funding. Many patient groups receive grants from pharmaceutical companies that make products being considered for funding. This research examines whether there is an association between the positions that Canadian groups take about the products and conflicts of interest with the companies. Methods The Common Drug Review (CDR) and panCanadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) make recommendations to Canadian provincial and federal drug plans about funding particular drug-indications. Both utilize input from patient groups in making their recommendations. Patient group submissions are available from both organizations and these submissions contain statements about conflicts of interest. Views of the patient groups, with and without a conflict with the company making the drug under consideration and without any conflicts at all, were assessed and then compared with the recommendations from CDR and pCODR. Results There was a total of 222 reports for drug-indications. There were 372 submissions from 93 different patient groups. Groups declared a total of 1896 conflicts with drug companies in 324 (87.1%) individual submissions. There were 268 submissions where groups declared a conflict with the company making the product or said they had no conflict. Irrespective of whether there was a conflict, the views of patient groups about the drug-indications under consideration were the same. There was no statistically significant difference between views of patient groups and the recommendations from CDR and/or pCODR. Conclusions The large majority of patient groups making submissions about funding of particular drug-indications had conflicts with the companies making the products and their views about the products were almost always positive. This association between funding and views needs to be further investigated to determine if a true cause and effect exists."

Recent evidence suggests that optimally functioning teams (teamwork, communication and decision making) are major prerequisites to conduct efficient TB meetings. The aims of this study were i) to use a readily published tool as a template for the development of a teamwork perspective extended assessment tool and ii) to evaluate the tool in a feasibility study by clinical and non-clinical observers.A systematic literature search in four databases revealed the ""Metric for the Observation of Decision-making (MODe)"" to be consistently used. MODe served as a template for the clinical evaluation, additional, notably teamwork items were integrated, and the resulting tool was tested in a feasibility study in TBs by clinical and non-clinical observers. The percentage of agreement between observers was assessed in a two-step approach: first, agreement of raters on discussion of items by TB members, and second, agreement of raters based on ordinal scale.In total, 244 patients were discussed in 27 TB sessions, thereof 136 (56%) fast track cases and 108 (44%) complex cases. In 228 (93%) of all cases an agreement for recommendation of a treatment plan was reached. Observers showed in general high agreement on discussion of the items. For the majority of items, the percentage of agreement between the different pairs of rater was similar and mostly high.A newly developed TB team performance tool using MODe as a template was piloted in a German-speaking country and enabled the assessment of specialized multidisciplinary teams with a special focus on teamwork patterns. The developed assessment tool requires evaluation in a larger collective for validation, and additional assessment whether it can be applied equally by non-clinicians and clinicians."

Thus, a detailed molecular characterization of the chromophore-binding pocket of these receptors is critical to understanding the differences in the photochemistry of vision between rods and cones. Unlike for rhodopsin (Rh), the crystal structures of cone opsins remain to be determined. To obtain insights into the specific chromophore–protein interactions that govern spectral tuning in human visual pigments, here we harnessed the unique binding properties of 11-cis-6-membered-ring-retinal (11-cis-6mr-retinal) with human blue, green, and red cone opsins. To unravel the specificity of the chromophore-binding pocket of cone opsins, we applied 11-cis-6mr-retinal analog-binding analyses to human blue, green, and red cone opsins. Our results revealed that among the three cone opsins, only blue cone opsin can accommodate the 11-cis-6mr-retinal in its chromophore-binding pocket, resulting in the formation of a synthetic blue pigment (B6mr) that absorbs visible light. A combination of primary sequence alignment, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis experiments revealed the specific amino acid residue 6.48 (Tyr-262 in blue cone opsins and Trp-281 in green and red cone opsins) as a selectivity filter in human cone opsins.

Under certain abiotic and biotic stressors, pore closure is initiated through anionic flux, with calcium (Ca2+) playing a central role. The aluminum-activated malate transporter 12 (ALMT12) is a malate-activated, voltage-dependent member of the aluminum-activated malate transporter family that has been implicated in anionic flux from guard cells controlling the stomatal aperture. Herein, we report the characterization of the regulatory mechanisms mediating channel activities of an ALMT from the grass Brachypodium distachyon (BdALMT12) that has the highest sequence identity to Arabidopsis thaliana ALMT12. Electrophysiological studies in a heterologous cell system confirmed that this channel is malate- and voltage-dependent. However, this was shown to be true only in the presence of Ca2+. Although a general kinase inhibitor increased the current density of BdALMT12, a calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor reduced the Ca2+-dependent channel activation. We investigated the physiological relevance of the CaM-based regulation in planta, where stomatal closure, induced by exogenous Ca2+ ionophore and malate, was shown to be inhibited by exogenous application of a CaM inhibitor. Subsequent analyses revealed that the double substitutions R335A/R338A and R335A/K342A, within a predicted BdALMT12 CaM-binding domain (CBD), also decreased the channels' ability to activate. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and CBD-mimetic peptides, as well as CaM-agarose affinity pulldown of full-length recombinant BdALMT12, we confirmed the physical interaction between the CBD and CaM. Together, these findings support a co-regulatory mechanism of BdALMT12 activation by malate, and Ca2+/CaM, emphasizing that a complex regulatory network modulates BdALMT12 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2912843929,"Sixty barrows (Body Weight–BW- range: 23.9–160 kg) were allotted to two experimental groups (6 pens of 5 pigs each): the control group was kept at a space allowance of 1m2/head; the second group was kept at 1.3m2/head. Behaviour, growth parameters, carcass and meat quality were assessed, as well as fat and cured ham quality. Results showed that pigs raised at 1.3m2/head spent more time laying (particularly in lateral recumbency, P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively) compared to pigs kept at lower space allowance. They also reduced the aimless exploration of the slatted pen floor (P<0.001) and increased overall expression of other, mainly active, behaviors (e.g., drinking, walking and standing, P<0.01). Pigs raised at 1.3m2/head showed higher final BW (P = 0.02), more favourable Average Daily Gain (ADG) and gain-to-Feed ratio (G:F) both during the last period of the trial (P<0.05 for both parameters) and over the entire trial (P = 0.01 for both parameters). No significant difference was observed between groups for carcass traits and the main meat quality attributes. Subcutaneous fat from green hams had higher α-linolenic acid content (P<0.01) in the group reared at greater space allowance. Green hams from this group lost less weight at trimming (P<0.01) and the resulting cured hams received better sensory evaluations (P<0.05). No difference was observed in fatty acid composition and unsaturation levels of the subcutaneous fat from cured hams. Our data suggest that heavy pigs intended for Parma ham would benefit from the adoption of higher individual floor space allowances, both in terms of animal welfare (increased possibility to rest) and of productive parameters, without having any detrimental effect on the suitability of the thighs for dry-curing or on the quality of the final product."
https://openalex.org/W2913166506,"Fasting glucose (FG) and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) perform sub-optimally in people of African origin, especially in individuals with sickle-cell trait (SCT). The purpose of this study was to compare the relationships between HbA1c, FG, and fructosamine in individuals from Senegal with and without SCT. HbA1c, FG, and fructosamine were measured in 203 adults from Senegal (100 control: 45 with type 2 diabetes (T2D); 103 SCT: 51 with T2D). Significant, positive correlations were observed between HbA1c and FG, fructosamine and FG, and fructosamine and HbA1c in both groups. The limits of agreement were inappropriately large in both groups for the Bland-Altman plots of HbA1c and FG (control: -95.97 to 83.97%; SCT: -115.9 to 91.52%), fructosamine and FG (control: -100.6 to 99.89%; SCT: -105.6 to 100.6%), and fructosamine and HbA1c (control: -52.03 to 38.98%; SCT: -88.04 to 71.41%). In both groups, the greatest proportion of subjects were considered above the clinical cut-point for hyperglycemia when fructosamine was used as the criterion (control: 33%; SCT: 44.6%), and the lowest percentage of subjects were classified as over the clinical cut-point when HbA1c was used as the criterion (control: 21%; SCT: 27.7%).Substantial disparities between HbA1c, FG, and fructosamine were observed in both groups, and these differences were exaggerated in the SCT group. Therefore, these three biomarkers should not be considered to be interchangeable measures of glycemic control. These biomarkers should be used thoughtfully, and special care should be taken when using them in individuals with SCT."
https://openalex.org/W2914184806,"Tumour heterogeneity plays a large role in the response of tumour tissues to radiation therapy. Inherent biological, physical, and even dose deposition heterogeneity all play a role in the resultant observed response. We here implement the use of Haralick textural analysis to quantify the observed glycogen production response, as observed via Raman spectroscopic mapping, of tumours irradiated within a murine model. While an array of over 20 Haralick features have been proposed, we here concentrate on five of the most prominent features: homogeneity, local homogeneity, contrast, entropy, and correlation. We show that these Haralick features can be used to quantify the inherent heterogeneity of the Raman spectroscopic maps of tumour response to radiation. Furthermore, our results indicate that Haralick-calculated textural features show a statistically significant dose dependent variation in response heterogeneity, specifically, in glycogen production in tumours irradiated with clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation. These results indicate that Haralick textural analysis provides a quantitative methodology for understanding the response of murine tumours to radiation therapy. Future work in this area can, for example, utilize the Haralick textural features for understanding the heterogeneity of radiation response as measured by biopsied patient tumour samples, which remains the standard of patient tumour investigation."

Here, we examined the graph-theoretical findings of the gray matter network in IGE using anatomical covariance methods.We recruited 33 patients with IGE and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Gray matter images were obtained by 3.0-T 3D T1-weighted MRI and were normalized using the voxel-based morphometry tools of Statistical Parametric Mapping 12. The normalized images were subjected to graph-theoretical group comparison using the Graph Analysis Toolbox with two different parcellation schemes. Initially, we used the Automated Anatomical Labeling template, whereas the Hammers Adult atlas was used for the second analysis.The resilience analyses revealed significantly reduced resilience of the IGE gray matter networks to both random failure and targeted attack. No significant between-group differences were found in global network measures, including the clustering coefficient and characteristic path length. The IGE group showed several changes in regional clustering, including an increase mainly in wide areas of the bilateral frontal lobes. The second analysis with another region of interest (ROI) parcellation generated the same results in resilience and global network measures, but the regional clustering results differed between the two parcellation schemes.These results may reflect the potentially weak network organization in IGE. Our findings contribute to the accumulation of knowledge on IGE."
https://openalex.org/W2913686728,"This paper formulates a support vector machine with quantile hyper-spheres (QHSVM) for pattern classification. The idea of QHSVM is to build two quantile hyper-spheres with the same center for positive or negative training samples. Every quantile hyper-sphere is constructed by using pinball loss instead of hinge loss, which makes the new classification model be insensitive to noise, especially the feature noise around the decision boundary. Moreover, the robustness and generalization of QHSVM are strengthened through maximizing the margin between two quantile hyper-spheres, maximizing the inner-class clustering of samples and optimizing the independent quadratic programming for a target class. Besides that, this paper proposes a novel local center-based density estimation method. Based on it, ρ-QHSVM with surrounding and clustering samples is given. Under the premise of high accuracy, the execution speed of ρ-QHSVM can be adjusted. The experimental results in artificial, benchmark and strip steel surface defects datasets show that the QHSVM model has distinct advantages in accuracy and the ρ-QHSVM model is fit for large-scale datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2914121011,"It has been hypothesized that force can be transmitted between adjacent muscles. Intermuscle force transmission violates the assumption that muscles act in mechanical isolation, and implies that predictions from biomechanical models are in error due to mechanical interactions between muscles, but the functional relevance of intermuscle force transmission is unclear. To investigate intermuscle force transmission between human flexor pollicis longus and the index finger part of flexor digitorum profundus, we compared finger flexion force produced by passive thumb flexion after one of three conditioning protocols: passive thumb flexion-extension cycling, thumb flexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), and thumb extension stretch. Finger flexion force increased after all three conditions. Compared to passive thumb flexion-extension cycling, change in finger flexion force was less after thumb extension stretch (mean difference 0.028 N, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.051 N), but not after thumb flexion MVC (0.007 N, 95% CI -0.020 to 0.033 N). As muscle conditioning changed finger flexion force produced by passive thumb flexion, the change in force is likely due to intermuscle force transmission. Thus, intermuscle force transmission resulting from passive stretch of an adjacent muscle is probably small enough to be ignored."

Near-infrared optical imaging of fluorescently labeled antibodies and matrix metalloproteinase activity were measured and quantified in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We successfully labeled, imaged and quantified the fluorescence signal of antibodies that localized to the central nervous system of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Fluorescently labeled anti-heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 antibodies persisted in the central nervous system of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, colocalized with matrix metalloproteinase activity, correlated with clinical disease and shifted rostrally within the spinal cord, consistent with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis being an ascending paralysis. The fluorescent antibody signal also colocalized with matrix metalloproteinase activity in brain. Previous imaging studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis analyzed inflammatory markers such as cellular immune responses, dendritic cell activity, blood brain barrier integrity and myelination, but none assessed fluorescently labeled antibodies within the central nervous system. This data suggests a strong association between autoantibody localization and disease. This system can be used to detect other antibodies that might contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system including multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2913748483,"In Florida, resource use patterns by Armases cinereum (Armases), a highly abundant crab in coastal habitats, may serve as important indicators of habitat condition. Here we investigated feeding patterns of Armases in coastal palm scrub forest to intertidal mangrove forest transition zones (transitions) as well as the relationship between habitat disturbance and Armases' trophic position across three pairs of geographically separated populations in Tampa FL, USA. Each pair of sites represented an unmodified ""natural"" location as well as a ""disturbed"" location lacking upland terrestrial palm scrub forested habitat. Laboratory experiments established a baseline understanding of feeding preference of Armases offered strictly mangrove material as well as sources abundant at the transition. In-situ feeding behavior was examined using MixSIAR mixing models with δ13C and δ15N stable isotope tracers. Armases showed a strong preference for consuming partially-decomposed mangrove material from Avicennia germinans and an equally strong preference for Iva frutescens. Armases also displayed predatory behavior under laboratory conditions, confirming omnivory in the presence of mangrove material. Stable isotopes revealed a pattern of elevated trophic position of Armases in disturbed habitats over paired natural locations. Diet reconstruction provided coarse resolution of in-situ feeding and results show high spatial variation: in natural habitats, Armases appears to rely heavily upon upland plant material compared to disturbed habitats where it may consume more animal prey. Combined, these findings support that Armases trophic position and diet may indicate habitat quality in mangrove transitions in the southeastern United States."

Desirable properties of an ideal host protein are known structure, insertional tolerance proximal to active site, simple enzymatic readout, elevated thermostability, and ease of recombinant production. The Escherichia coli multi-copper oxidase CueO displays many of these criteria but has not been validated as a host scaffold. CueO plays an important role in copper homeostasis by oxidation of toxic cuprous ions to cupric ions (20Djoko K.Y. Chong L.X. Wedd A.G. Xiao Z.

A further Cu(I)-binding site, termed the substrate copper (sCu) site or T4 lies proximal to T1, and its occupancy is linked to oxidation of proximally bound polyphenols, metal ions, and aromatic polyamines (24Roberts S.A.

A four-electron transfer between these sites couples substrate oxidation to reduction of dioxygen bound to the trinuclear site, with commensurate production of water. A distinguishing feature of CueO is a partially structured 45-amino acid segment (residues 356–404) capping the entrance to the T1/sCu copper-binding sites (25Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Grass G.

Mutagenesis studies indicate this methionine-rich segment (MRS) to be important for both Cu(I) binding and regulation of substrate specificity (26Singh S.K. Roberts S.A. McDevitt S.F. Weichsel A.

Notably, complete deletion of the MRS (with replacement by a minimal dipeptide linker) does not abrogate function, instead leading to emergence of altered/novel substrate specificities (27Kataoka K.

MDM2 engagement with the scaffolded peptides resulted in an increase in enzyme activity that could be abrogated by small-molecule and peptidic MDM2 inhibitors. Insertion of antigenic peptides resulted in an antibody-dependent abrogation of enzymatic activity. To help rationalize these opposing analyte-dependent phenotypes, we solved the structures of free and MDM2 (residues 6–125)-bound CueO. Our results validate CueO as robust host protein for use in biosensing and drug-screening applications. A panel of CueO variants was generated with differing modifications in the MRS (Fig. 1A). These included insertion of the parental MDM2-binding peptide sequence present in the N-terminal domain of p53 along with a higher-affinity derivative (peptide 12.1) (35Böttger V. Böttger A.

C-terminal residues in the MRS were further deleted in the latter construct to generate CueO-12.1Δ. These MDM2-binding peptides comprise obligate Phe, Trp, and Leu residues (underlined) essential for high affinity binding (36Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain.Science. 1996; 274 (8875929): 948-95310.1126/science.274.5289.948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). A further triple point mutant (CueO-FWL) was constructed with these residues introduced into the α5 helix in the same register observed for the MDM2-binding peptides. Peptide 12.1 and a control peptide with the Phe, Trp, and Leu residues mutated to alanine were also inserted in the intrinsically disordered region of the MRS (linking helices α6 and α7) to yield variants CueO-12.1 and CueO-12.1CON, respectively. Mutational tolerance was assayed by in vitro translation coupled to a rapid colorimetric readout of oxidase activity using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) substrate. All variants displayed readily observable enzymatic activity, highlighting the robustness of the CueO scaffold (Fig. 1B). We next assayed the engineered CueO panel by pulldown assay, using MDM2 as bait and measuring residual bead-bound enzyme activity. The results showed interaction with MDM2 only for the CueO-12.1 variant, where the 12.1 peptide replaced residues 384–394 in the intrinsically disordered region of the MRS (Fig. 1C). Having delineated the MRS subregion suitable for introduction of peptide sequences, we produced two additional constructs (CueO-PMI and CueO-PM2) (Fig. 1A) using previously identified higher-affinity MDM2 binding peptides (32Pazgier M.

The affinity of these variants for recombinant MDM2 (residues 6–125 comprising the p53 binding domain) was first measured by fluorescence polarization. Both variants showed high affinity to MDM2 (apparent Kd 28 ± 1 and 25 ± 1.5 nm, respectively), comparable with affinities of their unmodified linear and stapled versions (Table 1) (Fig. S1).

Open table in a new tab Enzymatic activity of CueO-PM2 after incubation with MDM2 (10 μm) was next assayed at varying concentrations of syringaldazine substrate (12.5–100 μm). Clear MDM2-dependent potentiation of CueO-PM2 activity was observed, with maximal signal differentiation (with or without MDM2) observed visually using 25 μm syringaldazine (Fig. 2A). This concentration was used for all subsequent experiments. Titration of MDM2 indicated dose-responsive enhancement of CueO-PM2 activity, with spectroscopic and visual limits of detection around 750 nm and 3 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C).

We therefore focused on recapitulating antibody–peptide interactions in the context of a CueO-scaffolded antigenic peptide. The human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was incorporated into the MRS and CueO-HA activity assayed in the presence of anti-HA or nonspecific (anti-Myc) antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). Only specific antibody resulted in clear dose-responsive reduction of enzyme activity, with an ∼60 nm limit of detection. Incorporation of the FLAG epitope (CueO-FLAG) led to detection of anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4C), further highlighting modularity of the CueO scaffold. To understand the opposing signal readouts generated upon MDM2 and antibody binding, we compared enzymatic activities of CueO, CueO-PM2, and CueO-HA in the absence of protein analytes. Whereas the activities of CueO and CueO-HA were similar, CueO-PM2 showed ∼2-fold reduced activity (Fig. 5A), indicating auto-inhibition by the PM2 peptide that is relieved upon MDM2 interaction. Kinetics data indicated that insertions into the MRS primarily affected kcat for syringaldazine oxidation, with no marked influence on affinity (Table 2). This was most pronounced for the 12.1 and PM2 peptide insertions, reducing kcat ∼2.2- and 2.8-fold, respectively. In the case of CueO-PM2, co-incubation with MDM2 resulted in ∼1.6-fold increased kcat (and no change in Km). Notably, the kcat value for CueO-12.1 was ∼1.6-fold lower than the control CueO-12.1CON, implicating one or more of the Phe, Trp, and Leu residues present in 12.1 (and also PMI/PM2) as being responsible for the inhibitory phenotype. No marked difference in affinity for syringaldazine was observed between these two proteins. Perturbation of copper (Cu) binding at the T1 site could account for the observed kcat deficits in the absence of analyte binding. In agreement, Cu occupancy at the T1 site as measured by absorbance at 610 nm (40Kataoka K. Hirota S. Maeda Y. Kogi H. Shinohara N. Sekimoto M. Sakurai T.

The asymmetric unit for the MDM2-bound form comprised a single binary complex with the scaffolded PM2 peptide adopting its prototypical α-helical conformation (Fig. 6A). The three key signature residues (Phe, Trp, and Leu) projecting from the outer face of the helix are accommodated by discrete pockets in a prolonged hydrophobic cleft of MDM2.

The adjacent MRS residues Met-396 and Asn-397 extend the PM2 α-helix to more fully occupy the MDM2 binding groove. The PM2 conformation is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between residues on its inner face (Leu-393 and Tyr-390) and Ile-358 and Met-361 on the α5 helix. In addition to a polar contact between side chains of Lys-94 of MDM2 and Gln-365 in the α5 helix, these interactions likely drive ordering of the MRS linker residues abutting PM2 that are highly mobile in native CueO (25Roberts S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2912363038,"Many contemporary neuroscience experiments utilize high-throughput approaches to simultaneously collect behavioural data from many animals. The resulting data are often complex in structure and are subjected to systematic biases, which require new approaches for analysis and normalization. This study addressed the normalization need by establishing an approach based on linear-regression modeling. The model was established using a dataset of visual motor response (VMR) obtained from several strains of wild-type (WT) zebrafish collected at multiple stages of development. The VMR is a locomotor response triggered by drastic light change, and is commonly measured repeatedly from multiple larvae arrayed in 96-well plates. This assay is subjected to several systematic variations. For example, the light emitted by the machine varies slightly from well to well. In addition to the light-intensity variation, biological replication also created batch-batch variation. These systematic variations may result in differences in the VMR and must be normalized. Our normalization approach explicitly modeled the effect of these systematic variations on VMR. It also normalized the activity profiles of different conditions to a common baseline. Our approach is versatile, as it can incorporate different normalization needs as separate factors. The versatility was demonstrated by an integrated normalization of three factors: light-intensity variation, batch-batch variation and baseline. After normalization, new biological insights were revealed from the data. For example, we found larvae of TL strain at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) responded to light onset much stronger than the 9-dpf larvae, whereas previous analysis without normalization shows that their responses were relatively comparable. By removing systematic variations, our model-based normalization can facilitate downstream statistical comparisons and aid detecting true biological differences in high-throughput studies of neurobehaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2913404933,"In this study, we utilized a stainless steel (SUS304) plate for measuring the Raman scattering spectra of body fluid samples. Using this stainless steel plate, we recorded the Raman scattering spectra of 99.5% ethanol and human serum samples by performing irradiation with 785- and 1064-nm lasers. Raman scattering spectra with intensities equal to or greater than those reported previously were obtained. In addition, the Raman scattering spectra acquired using the 1064-nm laser were less influenced by autofluorescence than those obtained via use of the shorter-wavelength laser. Moreover, the shapes of the spectra did not show any dependence on integration time, and denaturation of the samples was minimal. Our method, based on 1064-nm laser and the stainless steel plate, provides performance equal to or better than the methods reported thus far for the measurement of Raman scattering spectra from liquid samples. This method can be employed to rapidly evaluate the components of serum in liquid form without using surface-enhanced Raman scattering."

Twenty-eight health workers at seven intervention health facilities used the Tanzania Health Information Technology (T-HIT) system during a 3-month period from February 23, 2015, through May 23, 2015, to capture antenatal, delivery, and postnatal patient visits.T-HIT was designed for use on tablets with the goal to improve reporting, surveillance and monitoring of HIV rates and care delivery in the remote and rural settings. Health workers successfully recorded 2,453 visits. Of these, 1,594 were antenatal visits, 484 deliveries were recorded, and 375 were postnatal visits. Within the antenatal visits, 96% of women had a single visit (1474). Healthcare workers were unable to test 6.7% of women antenatally for HIV.The T-HIT pilot demonstrated the feasibility for implementing an mHealth integrated solution in a rural, low-resource setting that links tablet-based surveillance, health worker capacity-building and patient reminders into a single robust and responsive system. Although the implementation phase was only three months, the pilot generated evidence that T-HIT has potential for improving patient outcomes by providing more comprehensive, linked, and timely PMTCT care data at the individual and clinic levels."

https://openalex.org/W2914852644,"It remains unclear whether daily physical activity is associated with DNA damage. This cross-sectional study examined the association between leisure-time physical activity and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage, or urinary 7-methylguanine (m7Gua), a biomarker of methylating DNA damage.Participants included 501 workers (294 men and 207 women), aged 20-65 years, from municipal offices in Japan. Urinary 8-OH-dG and m7Gua were measured using column-switching HPLC. Physical activity was evaluated using a self-reported questionnaire. The associations between leisure-time physical activity and urinary DNA damage markers were assessed by multiple linear regression analysis, with stratification by occupational physical activity.After adjusting for covariates, leisure-time physical activity showed a suggestive inverse correlation with urinary 8-OH-dG levels (P for trend = 0.06), and a significant inverse association with urinary m7Gua levels (P for trend = 0.03). In analysis stratified by occupation, inverse correlations were observed in sedentary workers (walking < 30 min/day at work: P for trend = 0.06 and = 0.03 for urinary 8-OH-dG and m7Gua, respectively), but not in physically active workers (walking ≥ 30 min/day at work). In analysis for each intensity of leisure-time physical activity, light-intensity exercise was associated with lower levels of urinary 8-OH-dG (P for trend = 0.03), whereas moderate-to-high-intensity exercise was associated with lower levels of urinary m7Gua (P for trend = 0.02).Our results suggest that high levels of leisure-time physical activity are associated with decreased levels of DNA damage in individuals with low physical activity at work."

https://openalex.org/W2912783207,"Multiple studies have shown action to affect perception of motion. The speed intended in the generation of a motion by action affects the apparent speed of the motion. However, it was unclear whether action with no intention of speed affects the apparent speed of a motion. In Experiment 1, we investigated the apparent speed of a motion following a key press action. We manipulated the delay from the action to the consequent motion for shifting the timing of efference copy and found the apparent speed decreasing with increases in the delay. This could be because it is known that speed irrelevant action caused expansion of perceived duration of the consequent stimulus and it might have influenced the result in Experiment 1, we investigated the apparent duration of the action consequent static (Ex. 2-1) and motion (Ex. 2-2) stimulus. We found that the apparent duration was not changed with delay. Moreover, the apparent speed and duration had different characteristics on delay. These results were discussed in terms of the sense of agency."
https://openalex.org/W2913891835,"Excessive iodine intake is a major public health problem in the Saharawi refugee camps in Algeria, where animal milk is an important source of iodine. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between iodine concentrations in locally produced animal milk and in animal drinking water and further to assess the risk of exceeding European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) tolerable upper intake level for iodine (600 μg/d) among Saharawi women. In 2009 and 2010, 202 milk samples from goats and sheep and 52 milk samples from camel were collected. Iodine in milk was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In addition, iodine in 56 water samples from the general water system and 54 water samples from wells, was determined by modified Sandell-Kolthoff reaction. Animal milk is generally consumed mixed with water. The median (min, max) iodine intake from goat/sheep milk mixed with water in camps with high iodine content in human drinking water was 284 (57, 2889) μg/d and 19% of participants exceeded EFSA upper intake level for iodine. The median (min, max) iodine intake from camel milk mixed with water in all camps was 2100 (210, 11100) and 47% of participants exceeded the EFSA upper intake level. The median (min, max) iodine content in goat/sheep milk from camps with moderate and high iodine content in water was 507 (101, 4791) μg/L and 1612 (487, 9323) μg/L, respectively (p < 0.001). The iodine content in goat/sheep milk was positively associated with iodine content in animal drinking water (regression coefficient, B 5.71, 95% CI 4.03, 7.39). In conclusion, consumption of camel milk and living in camps with high water iodine content increased the risk of exceeding the EFSA upper intake level for iodine. We suggest that purified water for both human and animal consumption should be provided."
