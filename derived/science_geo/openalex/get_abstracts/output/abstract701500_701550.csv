https://openalex.org/W4298006419,"The conversion of polyolefins to monomers would create a valuable carbon feedstock from the largest fraction of waste plastic. However, breakdown of the main chains in these polymers requires the cleavage of carbon–carbon bonds that tend to resist selective chemical transformations. Here, we report the production of propylene by partial dehydrogenation of polyethylene and tandem isomerizing ethenolysis of the desaturated chain. Dehydrogenation of high-density polyethylene with either an iridium-pincer complex or platinum/zinc supported on silica as catalysts yielded dehydrogenated material containing up to 3.2% internal olefins; the combination of a second-generation Hoveyda-Grubbs metathesis catalyst and [PdP( t Bu) 3 (μ-Br)] 2 as an isomerization catalyst selectively degraded this unsaturated polymer to propylene in yields exceeding 80%. These results show promise for the application of mild catalysis to deconstruct otherwise stable polyolefins."
https://openalex.org/W4298006543,"Gain-of-function mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in human cancers result in the production of d -2-hydroxyglutarate ( d -2HG), an oncometabolite that promotes tumorigenesis through epigenetic alterations. The cancer cell–intrinsic effects of d -2HG are well understood, but its tumor cell–nonautonomous roles remain poorly explored. We compared the oncometabolite d -2HG with its enantiomer, l -2HG, and found that tumor-derived d -2HG was taken up by CD8 + T cells and altered their metabolism and antitumor functions in an acute and reversible fashion. We identified the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a molecular target of d -2HG. d -2HG and inhibition of LDH drive a metabolic program and immune CD8 + T cell signature marked by decreased cytotoxicity and impaired interferon-γ signaling that was recapitulated in clinical samples from human patients with IDH1 mutant gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W4297995912,"Hydrocarbon separation relies on energy-intensive distillation. Membrane technology can offer an energy-efficient alternative but requires selective differentiation of crude oil molecules with rapid liquid transport. We synthesized multiblock oligomer amines, which comprised a central amine segment with two hydrophobic oligomer blocks, and used them to fabricate hydrophobic polyamide nanofilms by interfacial polymerization from self-assembled vesicles. These polyamide nanofilms provide transport of hydrophobic liquids more than 100 times faster than that of conventional hydrophilic counterparts. In the fractionation of light crude oil, manipulation of the film thickness down to ~10 nanometers achieves permeance one order of magnitude higher than that of current state-of-the-art hydrophobic membranes while retaining comparable size- and class-based separation. This high permeance can markedly reduce plant footprint, which expands the potential for using membranes made of ultrathin nanofilms in crude oil fractionation."
https://openalex.org/W4297498067,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life, but the functions of OPCs are not limited to oligodendrogenesis. Here we show that OPCs contribute to thalamocortical presynapse elimination in the developing and adult mouse visual cortex. OPC-mediated synapse engulfment increases in response to sensory experience during neural circuit refinement. Our data suggest that OPCs may regulate synaptic connectivity in the brain independently of oligodendrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4297995910,"Because nonopioid analgesics are much sought after, we computationally docked more than 301 million virtual molecules against a validated pain target, the α 2A -adrenergic receptor (α 2A AR), seeking new α 2A AR agonists chemotypes that lack the sedation conferred by known α 2A AR drugs, such as dexmedetomidine. We identified 17 ligands with potencies as low as 12 nanomolar, many with partial agonism and preferential G i and G o signaling. Experimental structures of α 2A AR complexed with two of these agonists confirmed the docking predictions and templated further optimization. Several compounds, including the initial docking hit ‘9087 [mean effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 52 nanomolar] and two analogs, ‘7075 and PS75 (EC 50 4.1 and 4.8 nanomolar), exerted on-target analgesic activity in multiple in vivo pain models without sedation. These newly discovered agonists are interesting as therapeutic leads that lack the liabilities of opioids and the sedation of dexmedetomidine."
https://openalex.org/W4298006610,"Graphene moiré superlattices show an abundance of correlated insulating, topological, and superconducting phases. Whereas the origins of strong correlations and nontrivial topology can be directly linked to flat bands, the nature of superconductivity remains enigmatic. We demonstrate that magic-angle devices made of twisted tri-, quadri-, and pentalayer graphene placed on monolayer tungsten diselenide exhibit flavor polarization and superconductivity. We also observe insulating states in the tril- and quadrilayer arising at finite electric displacement fields. As the number of layers increases, superconductivity emerges over an enhanced filling-factor range, and in the pentalayer it extends well beyond the filling of four electrons per moiré unit cell. Our results highlight the role of the interplay between flat and more dispersive bands in extending superconducting regions in graphene moiré superlattices."
https://openalex.org/W4298006471,"Flaring is widely used by the fossil fuel industry to dispose of natural gas. Industry and governments generally assume that flares remain lit and destroy methane, the predominant component of natural gas, with 98% efficiency. Neither assumption, however, is based on real-world observations. We calculate flare efficiency using airborne sampling across three basins responsible for &gt;80% of US flaring and combine these observations with unlit flare prevalence surveys. We find that both unlit flares and inefficient combustion contribute comparably to ineffective methane destruction, with flares effectively destroying only 91.1% (90.2, 91.8; 95% confidence interval) of methane. This represents a fivefold increase in methane emissions above present assumptions and constitutes 4 to 10% of total US oil and gas methane emissions, highlighting a previously underappreciated methane source and mitigation opportunity."
https://openalex.org/W4298089163,"DNA variants that modulate life span provide insight into determinants of health, disease, and aging. Through analyses in the UM-HET3 mice of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), we detected a sex-independent quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 12 and identified sex-specific QTLs, some of which we detected only in older mice. Similar relations between life history and longevity were uncovered in mice and humans, underscoring the importance of early access to nutrients and early growth. We identified common age- and sex-specific genetic effects on gene expression that we integrated with model organism and human data to create a hypothesis-building interactive resource of prioritized longevity and body weight genes. Finally, we validated Hipk1, Ddost, Hspg2, Fgd6, and Pdk1 as conserved longevity genes using Caenorhabditis elegans life-span experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4297498204,"Humans and other animals effortlessly generalize prior knowledge to solve novel problems, by abstracting common structure and mapping it onto new sensorimotor specifics. To investigate how the brain achieves this, in this study, we trained mice on a series of reversal learning problems that shared the same structure but had different physical implementations. Performance improved across problems, indicating transfer of knowledge. Neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) maintained similar representations across problems despite their different sensorimotor correlates, whereas hippocampal (dCA1) representations were more strongly influenced by the specifics of each problem. This was true for both representations of the events that comprised each trial and those that integrated choices and outcomes over multiple trials to guide an animal's decisions. These data suggest that prefrontal cortex and hippocampus play complementary roles in generalization of knowledge: PFC abstracts the common structure among related problems, and hippocampus maps this structure onto the specifics of the current situation."
https://openalex.org/W4297937001,"The Arctic Ocean has experienced rapid warming and sea ice loss in recent decades, becoming the first open-ocean basin to experience widespread aragonite undersaturation [saturation state of aragonite (Ωarag) < 1]. However, its trend toward long-term ocean acidification and the underlying mechanisms remain undocumented. Here, we report rapid acidification there, with rates three to four times higher than in other ocean basins, and attribute it to changing sea ice coverage on a decadal time scale. Sea ice melt exposes seawater to the atmosphere and promotes rapid uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering its alkalinity and buffer capacity and thus leading to sharp declines in pH and Ωarag. We predict a further decrease in pH, particularly at higher latitudes where sea ice retreat is active, whereas Arctic warming may counteract decreases in Ωarag in the future."

https://openalex.org/W4297498015,"Neural activity in the sensory cortex combines stimulus responses and ongoing activity, but it remains unclear whether these reflect the same underlying dynamics or separate processes. In the present study, we show in mice that, during wakefulness, the neuronal assemblies evoked by sounds in the auditory cortex and thalamus are specific to the stimulus and distinct from the assemblies observed in ongoing activity. By contrast, under three different anesthetics, evoked assemblies are indistinguishable from ongoing assemblies in the cortex. However, they remain distinct in the thalamus. A strong remapping of sensory responses accompanies this dynamic state change produced by anesthesia. Together, these results show that the awake cortex engages dedicated neuronal assemblies in response to sensory inputs, which we suggest is a network correlate of sensory perception."
https://openalex.org/W4297995889,"The samarium-146 (146Sm)-neodymium-142 (142Nd) short-lived decay system (half-life of 103 million years) is a powerful tracer of the early mantle-crust evolution of planetary bodies. However, an increased 142Nd/144Nd in modern terrestrial rocks relative to chondrite meteorites has been proposed to be caused by nucleosynthetic anomalies, obscuring early Earth's differentiation history. We use stepwise dissolution of primitive chondrites to quantify nucleosynthetic contributions on the composition of chondrites. After correction for nucleosynthetic anomalies, Earth and the silicate parts of differentiated planetesimals contain resolved excesses of 142Nd relative to chondrites. We conclude that only collisional erosion of primordial crusts can explain such compositions. This process associated with planetary accretion must have produced substantial loss of incompatible elements, including long-term heat-producing elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium."
https://openalex.org/W4297991568,"There is evidence in the literature that green HRM practices improve environmental profitability. On the other hand, existing research has failed to explain how GHRM can support the development of a green culture and green innovation influence the firm’s environmental performance and long-term growth. This study investigates the relationship between GHRM, green culture, green innovation, and a firm’s environmental performance. In addition, the study examines the mediating role of green culture and green innovation in the relationship between GHRM and environmental performance. This research conducts a large-scale study of 290 employees from Manufacturing firms in Malaysia. The research results provide managers with a better knowledge of how GHRM helps develop sustainable culture and green innovation and how these elements contribute to the improvement of environmental performance inside the organization. This study also makes a significant contribution in terms of novelty and research relevance by demonstrating that green culture and green innovation positively mediate the relationship between GHRM and environmental performance in a sustainable manner. Managers will understand the GHRM required to develop an ecologically conscious culture and promote green innovation among environmentally conscious employees. Finally, we highlighted the importance of this study for top management in the sense of mediating the role of green culture and green innovation and the consequences for future generations of responsible managers who will acquire this knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W4297990882,"Environmental oxidative stress threatens cellular integrity and should therefore be avoided by living organisms. Yet, relatively little is known about environmental oxidative stress perception. Here, using microfluidics, we showed that like I2 pharyngeal neurons, the tail phasmid PHA neurons function as oxidative stress sensing neurons in C . elegans , but display different responses to H 2 O 2 and light. We uncovered that different but related receptors, GUR-3 and LITE-1, mediate H 2 O 2 signaling in I2 and PHA neurons. Still, the peroxiredoxin PRDX-2 is essential for both, and might promote H 2 O 2 -mediated receptor activation. Our work demonstrates that C . elegans can sense a broad range of oxidative stressors using partially distinct H 2 O 2 signaling pathways in head and tail sensillae, and paves the way for further understanding of how the integration of these inputs translates into the appropriate behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4297991655,"Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain could be a key diagnostic and research tool for understanding the neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19. For maximum impact, multi-modal MRI protocols will be needed to measure the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain by diverse potentially pathogenic mechanisms, and with high reliability across multiple sites and scanner manufacturers. Here we describe the development of such a protocol, based upon the UK Biobank, and its validation with a travelling heads study. A multi-modal brain MRI protocol comprising sequences for T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (swMRI), and arterial spin labelling (ASL), was defined in close approximation to prior UK Biobank (UKB) and C-MORE protocols for Siemens 3T systems. We iteratively defined a comparable set of sequences for General Electric (GE) 3T systems. To assess multi-site feasibility and between-site variability of this protocol, N = 8 healthy participants were each scanned at 4 UK sites: 3 using Siemens PRISMA scanners (Cambridge, Liverpool, Oxford) and 1 using a GE scanner (King’s College London). Over 2,000 Imaging Derived Phenotypes (IDPs), measuring both data quality and regional image properties of interest, were automatically estimated by customised UKB image processing pipelines (S2 File). Components of variance and intra-class correlations (ICCs) were estimated for each IDP by linear mixed effects models and benchmarked by comparison to repeated measurements of the same IDPs from UKB participants. Intra-class correlations for many IDPs indicated good-to-excellent between-site reliability. Considering only data from the Siemens sites, between-site reliability generally matched the high levels of test-retest reliability of the same IDPs estimated in repeated, within-site, within-subject scans from UK Biobank. Inclusion of the GE site resulted in good-to-excellent reliability for many IDPs, although there were significant between-site differences in mean and scaling, and reduced ICCs, for some classes of IDP, especially T1 contrast and some dMRI-derived measures. We also identified high reliability of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) IDPs derived from swMRI images, multi-network ICA-based IDPs from resting-state fMRI, and olfactory bulb structure IDPs from T1, T2-FLAIR and dMRI data. Conclusion These results give confidence that large, multi-site MRI datasets can be collected reliably at different sites across the diverse range of MRI modalities and IDPs that could be mechanistically informative in COVID brain research. We discuss limitations of the study and strategies for further harmonisation of data collected from sites using scanners supplied by different manufacturers. These acquisition and analysis protocols are now in use for MRI assessments of post-COVID patients (N = 700) as part of the ongoing COVID-CNS study."
https://openalex.org/W4297936983,"Rapid melting of ice sheets and glaciers drives a unique geometry, or fingerprint, of sea level change. However, the detection of individual fingerprints has been challenging because of sparse observations at high latitudes and the difficulty of disentangling ocean dynamic variability from the signal. We predict the fingerprint of Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) melt using recent ice mass loss estimates from radar altimetry data and model reconstructions of nearby glaciers and compare this prediction to an independent, altimetry-derived sea surface height trend corrected for ocean dynamic variability in the region adjacent to the ice sheet. A statistically significant correlation between the two fields ( P &lt; 0.001) provides an unambiguous observational detection of the near-field sea level fingerprint of recent GrIS melting in our warming world."
https://openalex.org/W4297991096,"Uterine fibroid is one of the most prevalent benign tumors in women, with high socioeconomic costs. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci associated with uterine fibroid risks, they could not successfully interpret the biological effects of genomic variants at the gene expression levels. To prioritize uterine fibroid susceptibility genes that are biologically interpretable, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) by integrating GWAS data of uterine fibroid and expression quantitative loci data. We identified nine significant TWAS genes including two novel genes, RP11-282O18.3 and KBTBD7, which may be causal genes for uterine fibroid. We conducted functional enrichment network analyses using the TWAS results to investigate the biological pathways in which the overall TWAS genes were involved. The results demonstrated the immune system process to be a key pathway in uterine fibroid pathogenesis. Finally, we carried out chemical-gene interaction analyses using the TWAS results and the comparative toxicogenomics database to determine the potential risk chemicals for uterine fibroid. We identified five toxic chemicals that were significantly associated with uterine fibroid TWAS genes, suggesting that they may be implicated in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroid. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis covering the broad application of bioinformatics approaches. Our study may provide a deeper understanding of uterine fibroid etiologies and informative notifications about potential risk chemicals for uterine fibroid."
https://openalex.org/W4298006560,"Protein synthesis generally starts with a methionine that is removed during translation. However, cytoplasmic actin defies this rule because its synthesis involves noncanonical excision of the acetylated methionine by an unidentified enzyme after translation. Here, we identified C19orf54, named ACTMAP (actin maturation protease), as this enzyme. Its ablation resulted in viable mice in which the cytoskeleton was composed of immature actin molecules across all tissues. However, in skeletal muscle, the lengths of sarcomeric actin filaments were shorter, muscle function was decreased, and centralized nuclei, a common hallmark of myopathies, progressively accumulated. Thus, ACTMAP encodes the missing factor required for the synthesis of mature actin and regulates specific actin-dependent traits in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4297946165,"Background Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common intrauterine congenital infection in humans. Worldwide seropositive rates of CMV are considerably high among women of childbearing age. There is currently no optimal drug treatment nor a vaccine for congenital CMV infection and therefore the best available program to date of prevention is practicing standard hygienic measures. The success of this program relies on women’s knowledge of CMV modes of transmissions, and risk and preventative behaviors. Objective The current study aims to assess the awareness and knowledge of CMV infection among women in Saudi Arabia. Method In this cross-sectional study, an online self-administered questionnaire was distributed to women 18 years of age or older residing in all regions of Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included questions to assess awareness of CMV, knowledge of symptoms, transmission, and preventative measures of CMV infection. Results Out of the 1004 women who completed the questionnaire, self-reported knowledge of CMV was considerably low with only 82 women (8.17%) having heard of CMV infection. Most women reported learning about CMV from the internet and university. In binary logistic analyses, women pursuing studies in healthcare and those working in health professions, as well as those with undergraduate and graduate college degrees were significantly associated with higher knowledge of CMV. Urban area of residence was significantly associated with lower levels of knowledge of CMV. Among women who reported they had heard of CMV, their knowledge of CMV modes of transmission, symptoms, and preventative measures was considerably low. Regarding the transmission route, 23% reported no knowledge of modes of transmission, 59.75% reported mother-to-child transmission, 48.78% reported sexual intercourse, and 45% reported contact with body fluids of an infected person. Regarding knowledge of symptoms of congenital CMV, mental retardation and death were the most commonly reported clinical presentations. Conclusion The current study showed that the overall knowledge of CMV is very low among women in Saudi Arabia. Working in the healthcare field and higher education levels were significantly associated with better knowledge of CMV. It is crucial that women are provided with information regarding CMV-associated complications and preventative measures against mother-to-fetus transmission of CMV."
https://openalex.org/W4297990919,"Background Obstetric hemorrhage is defined as active bleeding of more than 500 ml in vaginal delivery or 1000ml following cesarean delivery. It is the leading cause of maternal death, which contributes to up to 50% of maternal deaths in Ethiopia. This study aims to assess the relationships between adverse maternal health exposure (personal and medical factors) and delay in health care (hesitancy in opting to seek care, lag in reaching a health facility, and wait in receiving health care at the facility) and adverse outcomes of obstetric hemorrhage among reviewed maternal deaths in Ethiopia. Methods This study utilizes 4530 reported maternal death surveillance data obtained from Ethiopian maternal death surveillance and response (MDSR) system between 2013 to 2020. Latent class analysis was applied to identify underlying patterns of adverse maternal health exposures. Furthermore, the associations between latent classes and adverse outcomes of obstetric hemorrhage were analyzed using multilevel logistics regression model adjusted for clustering within reporting provinces. Results Nearly 56% of the reviewed maternal deaths were due to the adverse outcome of obstetric hemorrhage, among which nearly 75% died during the postpartum period. The study identified six separate sub-groups of women based on their vulnerability to adverse maternal health conditions. The six subgroups identified by this study are 1) women who travelled for a long duration to reach a health care provider, 2) those who had no access to a health facility (HF) within a 5Km radius, 3) those who failed to decide to go to a health facility: 4) those with multiparity,5) those who were injured during delivery with history of coagulopathy, and 6) those who got injured during delivery and failed to decide to go to a health facility. Women in the class of grand multipara have demonstrated the highest risk of death due to the adverse outcomes of obstetric hemorrhage (β = 1.54, SE = 0.09, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions The study has attempted to identify women that are at a higher risk for the adverse outcomes of obstetric hemorrhage. Henceforth, targeted intervention should be taken on women of reproductive age group, and those identified as at a higher risk, to reduce the high rate of maternal death due to obstetric hemorrhage."
https://openalex.org/W4297991547,"Potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) is one of the major risk factors of adverse drug events in elderly patients. Pharmacotherapy assessment criteria may help reduce the instances of PIP among geriatric patients. This study aimed to verify the applicability of selected tools designed to assess prescribing appropriateness in elderly and to identify PIP in the study population. Based on pharmacist-led medication reviews that were performed among patients attending senior day-care centers based in Poland, aged 65 years and over, the following tools were applied for assessing the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy: PILA (patient-in-focus listing approach): STOPP/START v.2 and Amsterdam tool, DOLA (drug-oriented listing approach): PRISCUS list, and DOLA+: Beers criteria v.2019 and the EU(7)-PIM list–the criteria oriented on medications requiring indications. Fifty patients participated in the study. The prevalence of prescribing issues in the study population was very high and ranged from 28% to 100%, depending on the criteria applied. The highest number of PIP cases was identified based on the PILA criteria: STOPP/START v.2 (171, a mean of 3.4 PIP cases per patient), and the Amsterdam criteria (124, a mean of 2.5 PIP cases per patient). The lack of protective vaccinations against pneumococci identified using the START criterion was found to be the most common PIP (identified in 96% of the patients). Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) were identified as the most problematic group of medications. The STOPP, EU(7)-PIM and Beers criteria revealed cases of inappropriate prolonged PPI use, whereas the Amsterdam tool identified cases where PPIs should have been prescribed but were not. The highest number of PIP cases in the study population were identified with the PILA tools, and on this basis the most comprehensive assessment of pharmacotherapy appropriateness in geriatric patients was conducted. Further studies should be designed, covering a larger group of patients across different healthcare settings (inpatient and outpatient), with access to comprehensive patient data."

https://openalex.org/W4297991064,"Adrenal Vein Sampling (AVS) is the gold standard for categorizing primary aldosteronism (PA). However, catheterization of the right adrenal vein (RAV) is challenging due the small size and variable location. This study aims to explore the relationship between the RAV orifice and the right kidney contour (RKC) on fluoroscopy, thus evaluating the potential of use the RKC as an anatomic marker for localizing RAV. Imaging data of 107 PA patients with successful bilateral AVS were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the body mass index (BMI), all patients were divided into the Normal Group (BMI < 24 kg/m2), Overweight Group (24 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m2) and Obese Group (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2). At the anterior view, the height level of RAV orifice was determined relative to vertebral bodies and disks. The distance from the RAV orifice to the upper edge of RKC was measured manually. The RAV orifice height level was mainly distributed from vertebral T11 to T12 (90.6%), and tended to be higher in patients with a larger BMI. The mean distance from the RAV orifice to the upper edge of RKC was 13.9±7.8mm, and had no difference among Normal group (n = 53, 14.1±8.2mm), Overweight group (n = 39, 13.7±8.0mm), and Obese group (n = 15, 13.9±5.5mm) (p = 0.981). Based on these findings, the RKC might be used as a landmark for localizing RAV on fluoroscopy, which is conductive to narrow down the exploration range and increase the success rate of RAV catheterization."
https://openalex.org/W4297991244,"This research examines how tourism development has impacted economic growth in a global city–Hong Kong. A large body of research has investigated national tourism-led growth in developed and developing countries. However, many such studies have overlooked how policies aimed at fostering the development of tourism affect the local economic development of global cities. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments liberalized their visa policies with the launch of the Individual Visit Scheme in 2003. Such liberalization has led to significantly more tourist arrival from China. Our autoregressive distributed lag model of tourism-related data from 2003 to 2019 provides strong evidence that more tourism can spur short-run economic growth. Yet, such tourism can lead to uncertain effects on local economic development in the longer run. Hong Kong’s transient tourism-led growth has almost entered the stagnation stage of the Tourism Area Life Cycle model. During such stagnation, jurisdictions like Hong Kong can expect limited long-term economic growth from their tourist sector. Our findings thus sound a warning for global cities looking to tourism to sustain longer-term economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W4297991377,"Background Alcohol use disorders (AUD) associate with structural and functional brain differences, including impairments in neuropsychological functions; however, review level research (largely cross-sectional) is inconsistent with regards to recovery of such functions following abstinence. Such recovery is important, as these impairments associate with treatment outcomes and quality of life. Objective(s) To assess neuropsychological function recovery following abstinence in individuals with a clinical AUD diagnosis. The secondary objective is to assess predictors of neuropsychological recovery in AUD. Methods Four electronic databases (APA PsycInfo, EBSCO MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection) will be searched between 1999–2022, with search strategies adapted for each source. Study reporting will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis, study quality will be assessed using the JBI Checklist for Cohort Studies. Eligible studies are those with a longitudinal design that assessed neuropsychological recovery following abstinence from alcohol in adults with a clinical diagnosis of AUD. Studies will be excluded if participant group is defined by another or co-morbid condition/injury, or by relapse. Results This is an ongoing review. As of July 2022, the review protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022308686), searches have been conducted, and screening is in progress. Results are predicted to be complete by October 2022. Conclusions Comparing data on neuropsychological recovery from AUD will improve understanding of the impact of alcohol on the brain, and the relationship between AUD recovery and quality of life/treatment outcomes. It may provide information that could one day inform aspects of treatment and aftercare (e.g., options for cognitive training of functions that do not improve on their own)."
https://openalex.org/W4297991384,"Valid and reliable anthropometric indicator is useful for early detection and treatment for under nutrition. Although, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) is used for screening of children with moderate acute malnutrition in Ethiopia, its performance for the different ethnic groups has not been evaluated.To determine the diagnostic performance of MUAC for determination of moderate wasting among children of different ethnic background and develop optimal cut-off.A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among under five children of the three regions namely: Somalia, Amhara and Gambella Regions. The diagnostic performance of MUAC was validated using weight for height Z-score< -2 as a gold standard binary classifier. Test variable is mid upper arm circumference (MUAC< 12.5cm) and weight for height Z-Score (WHZ) is standard variable. ROC analysis performed based on the assumptions of MUAC value lower the cut-off point indicates the undernutrition. Area under the curve and validity measures (sensitivity and specificity) was generated as parameter estimated. The results were presented using tables and ROC curves.Except in the Gambella region, there was fair agreement between MUC<12.5cm and Weight for Height Z score<-2 in diagnosing wasting in Somali (Sensitivity = 29.3%, Kappa = 0.325, P<0.001) and in Gambella regions (Sensitivity = 16.7%, Kappa = 0.19, P<0.001). In Amhara region there was fair agreement between the two measures in diagnosing moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) (Sensitivity = 16%, Kappa = 0.216). For the Overall sample, the sensitivity of MUAC<12.5cm was 20.6% (Kappa = 0.245, P<0.001. Based on ROC analysis, the optimal cutoff value of MUAC for diagnosing moderate acute malnutrition for the two regions namely for Gambella and Amhara was 13.85cm with sensitivity of 0.99 and 1.00, respectively. However, for Somali Region the optimal cut was 13.75cm (Sensitivity = 0.98 cm and specificity = 0.71).Findings revealed that the inter reliability of measurement for MUAC< 12.5cm and WHZ<-2 for diagnosing MAM was low among different ethnic groups with the cut-off varying in each region. The existing cutoff point is less sensitive for diagnosis of MAM. As Ethiopia is home of diverse ethnic groups with different body frame and environmental conditions, the new cut off points developed for each region recommended to be used for screening moderate acute malnutrition to prevent relapse of MAM and reduce chronic malnutrition."

Events between different coding vocabularies were not mapped code-to-code; for each data source, code lists of labels were curated at the entity/event level. A study team of epidemiologists, clinicians, informaticists, and data scientists were included within the validation of each component.Applying the CDM to the DISCOVER CKD retrospective cohort, secondary data from 1,857,593 patients with CKD were harmonized from five data sources, across three countries, into a discrete database for rapid real-world evidence generation.This flexible CDM approach facilitates evidence generation from real-world data within the DISCOVER CKD retrospective cohort, providing novel insights into the epidemiology of CKD that may expedite improvements in diagnosis, prognosis, early intervention, and disease management. The adaptable architecture of this CDM approach ensures scalable, fast, and efficient application within other therapy areas to facilitate the combined analysis of different types of secondary data from multiple, heterogeneous sources."

To test the PDT efficiency of HNP-PS conjugates, pathogenic S . aureus cell cultures were treated with perovskite (Barium Titanate) Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) nanoparticles conjugated to photosensitizers (PS) (we compared both FDA approved Protoporphyrin IX and Curcumin) and subjected to a femtosecond pulsed Near-Infrared (NIR) laser (800 nm, 232–228 mW, 12–15 fs pulse width at repetition rate of 76.9 MHz) for 10 minutes each. NIR PDT using Barium Titanate (BT) conjugated with Protoporphyrin IX as HNP-PS conjugate reduced the viability of S . aureus cells by 77.3 ± 9.7% while BT conjugated with Curcumin did not elicit any significant effect. Conventional PSs reactive only to visible spectrum light coupled with SHG nanoparticles enables the use of higher tissue penetrating NIR light to generate an efficient photodynamic effect, thereby overcoming low light penetration and tissue specificity of conventional visible light PDT treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4297991586,"The COVID-19 pandemic created the need for large-scale testing of populations. However, most laboratories do not have sufficient testing capacity for mass screening. We evaluated pooled testing of samples, as a strategy to increase testing capacity in Lao PDR. Samples of consecutive patients were tested in pools of four using the Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay. Positive pools were confirmed by individual testing, and we describe the performance of the test and savings achieved. We also diluted selected positive samples to describe its effect on the assays CT values. 1,568 patients were tested in 392 pools of four. 361 (92.1%) pools were negative and 31 (7.9%) positive. 29/31 (93.5% (95%CI 77–99%) positive pools were confirmed by individual testing of the samples but, in 2/31 (6.5%) the four individual samples were negative, suggesting contamination. Pools with only one positive sample had higher CT values (lower RNA concentrations) than the respective individual samples, indicating a dilution effect, which suggested an increased risk of false negative results with dilutions &gt;1:10. However, this risk may be low if the prevalence of infection is high, when pools are more likely to contain more than one positive sample. Pooling saved 67% of cartridges and substantially increased testing capacity. Pooling samples increased SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity and resulted in considerable cartridge savings. Given the need for high-volume testing, countries may consider implementation of pooling for SARS-CoV-2 screening."
https://openalex.org/W4297991608,"Identifying differentially expressed genes is difficult because of the small number of available samples compared with the large number of genes. Conventional gene selection methods employing statistical tests have the critical problem of heavy dependence of P -values on sample size. Although the recently proposed principal component analysis (PCA) and tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) has often outperformed these statistical test-based methods, the reason why they worked so well is unclear. In this study, we aim to understand this reason in the context of projection pursuit (PP) that was proposed a long time ago to solve the problem of dimensions; we can relate the space spanned by singular value vectors with that spanned by the optimal cluster centroids obtained from K-means. Thus, the success of PCA- and TD-based unsupervised FE can be understood by this equivalence. In addition to this, empirical threshold adjusted P -values of 0.01 assuming the null hypothesis that singular value vectors attributed to genes obey the Gaussian distribution empirically corresponds to threshold-adjusted P -values of 0.1 when the null distribution is generated by gene order shuffling. For this purpose, we newly applied PP to the three data sets to which PCA and TD based unsupervised FE were previously applied; these data sets treated two topics, biomarker identification for kidney cancers (the first two) and the drug discovery for COVID-19 (the thrid one). Then we found the coincidence between PP and PCA or TD based unsupervised FE is pretty well. Shuffling procedures described above are also successfully applied to these three data sets. These findings thus rationalize the success of PCA- and TD-based unsupervised FE for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W4297991619,"Invertebrates are becoming increasingly popular models for research on the immune system. The innate immunity possessed by insects shows both structural and functional similarity to the resistance displayed by mammals, and many processes occurring in insect hemocytes are similar to those that occur in mammals. However, the use of insects as research models requires the development of methods for working with hemocytes. The aim of this study was to develop a protocol for intracellular cytokine detection in Galleria mellonella larvae hemocytes based on flow cytometry. It describes the anticoagulant composition of the buffer, the optimal conditions for hemocyte permeabilization and fixation, as well as the conditions of cell centrifugation to prevent cell disintegration. A key element is the selection of staining conditions, especially the length of the incubation time with the primary antibody, which turned out to be much longer than recommended for mammalian cells. The development of these individual steps allowed for the creation of a reproducible protocol for cytokine detection using flow cytometry in wax moth hemocytes. This will certainly facilitate the development of further protocols allowing for wider use of insect cells in immunological research."
https://openalex.org/W4297991628,"Collecting information on sustainability of immune responses after infection or vaccination is crucial to inform medical decision-making and vaccination strategies. Data on how long-lasting antibodies against SARS-COV-2 could provide a humoral and protective immunity and prevent reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 or its variants is particularly valuable. This study presents a novel method to quantitatively measure and monitor the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody profiles over time.Serum samples from two groups were used in this study: Samples from 20 naturally infected subjects (followed for up to 1 year) and samples from 83 subjects vaccinated with one or two doses of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine (BNT162b2/BNT162b2) (followed for up to 6 months). The Multi-SARS-CoV-2 assay, a multiparameter serology test developed for the serological confirmation of past-infections, was used to determine the reactivity of six different SARS-CoV-2 antigens. For each subject sample, 3 dilutions (1/50, 1/400 and 1/3200) were defined as an optimal set over the six antigens and their respective linear ranges. This allowed accurate quantification of the corresponding six antibodies. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was applied to convert intensity readings from 3 determined dilutions to a single quantification value for each antibody.Median half-life for the 20 naturally infected vs 74 vaccinated subjects (two doses) was 120 vs 50 days for RBD, 127 vs 53 days for S1 and 187 vs 86 days for S2 antibodies respectively.The newly proposed method, based on a series of a limited number of dilutions, can convert a conventional qualitative assay into a quantitative assay. This conversion helps define the sustainability of specific immune responses against each relevant viral antigen and can help in defining the protection characteristics after an infection or a vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4297991680,"Introduction Hypertension is one global public health emergency disease, and is one of the most critical factors for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and renal diseases. Hypertension affects quality of life of patients, however there is limited evidence on the factors that affect health related quality of life among hypertensive patients. As a result, the purpose of this study is to look into factors that affect the health-related quality of life of adult hypertensive patients. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dessie City public health facilities from March to April 2021 with the total samples size of 376 hypertensive patients. Simple random sampling technique was employed to select study participants. World health organization health related quality of life 26 items were used to measure outcome variable. Simple linear regression analysis was done and forwarded to multivariable linear regression analysis at p-value&lt;0.2. In multivariable linear regression analysis variables whose p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval with unstandardized β-coefficient were declared as statistically significant. Results A total of 360 hypertensive patients were included in the study. The mean scores of physical, psychological, social and environmental domains were 42.93, SD (18.86), 51.78, SD (20.40), 57.31, SD (20.20) and 48.15, SD (16.26), respectively. Age, duration of antihypertensive treatment, low social support, physical inactivity, co-morbidity, being widow, khat chewing, and being single had a significant association with lower health related quality of life. Conclusion and recommendations The health-related quality of life of hypertensive patients were found low in all domains. The findings indicate the necessity for health professionals, government, non-governmental organizations and community to pay more attention to patients’ quality of life, seeking changes in the therapeutic approach in general."

In this paper, we intended to use a complex inoculum composed of Pseudomonas putita and Clostridium thermocellum to in-situ compost A . adenophora debris and then to compare the phytotoxicity of extracts from uncomposted and composted A . adenophora (UCA and CA respectively) to barley seed germination and young seedling growth. A field experiment was finally conducted to reveal the effects of UCA and CA on barley nutrients uptake, yield, grain quality, soil enzyme activities, microbial biomass and biodiversity. In-situ composting sharply decreased 4,7-dimethyl-1-(propan-2-ylidene)-1,4,4a,8a-tetrahydronaphthalene- 2,6(1H,7H)-dione(DTD) and 6-hydroxy-5-isopropyl-3,8-dimethyl-4a,5,6,7,8,8a-hexahydronaphthal en-2(1 H)-one(HHO) from 2096.3 and 743.7 mg kg -1 in uncomposted A . adenophora to 194.4 and 68.19 mg kg -1 in composted A . adenophora . UCAE showed negative influences on seed germination performances (except lower rates on germination percentage). The mechanism may be the inhibition of bio-macromolecules hydrolysis (including proteins, starch, and phytin) in endosperms and their hydrolysates for forming new plants. CAE promoted seed germination and seedling growth, increased chlorophyll levels in leaves, and stimulated dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase activities in plants, while UCAE got opposite performance. Compared with chemical fertilizers, application of CA in combination with chemical fertilizers significantly improved plant nutrient uptake (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), yield, grain quality, quantity of 16S rDNA sequences, richness and diversity of bacterial communities in contrast to UCA which behaved otherwise. Taken together, the use of the microbial agent to in-situ compost A . adenophora may be an effective approach for agricultural use of A . adenophora debris as a plant-friendly organic fertilizer, being undoubtedly worth advocating."
https://openalex.org/W4297991766,"The evolutionary conserved Taurine Upregulated Gene 1 ( TUG1 ) is a ubiquitously expressed gene that is one of the highest expressed genes in human and rodent endothelial cells (ECs). We here show that TUG1 expression decreases significantly in aging mouse carotid artery ECs and human ECs in vitro , indicating a potential role in the aging endothelial vasculature system. We therefore investigated if, and how, TUG1 might function in aging ECs, but despite extensive phenotyping found no alterations in basal EC proliferation, apoptosis, barrier function, migration, mitochondrial function, or monocyte adhesion upon TUG1 silencing in vitro . TUG1 knockdown did slightly and significantly decrease cumulative sprout length upon vascular endothelial growth factor A stimulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), though TUG1-silenced HUVECs displayed no transcriptome-wide mRNA expression changes explaining this effect. Further, ectopic expression of the highly conserved and recently discovered 153 amino acid protein translated from certain TUG1 transcript isoforms did not alter angiogenic sprouting in vitro . Our data show that, despite a high expression and strong evolutionary conservation of both the TUG1 locus and the protein sequence it encodes, TUG1 does not seem to play a major role in basic endothelial cell function."

To precisely estimate one of these criteria, the Bayes factor, a variation of bridge sampling is developed."
https://openalex.org/W4297992029,We developed a simple and reliable method for the isolation of haploid nuclei from fresh and frozen testes. The described protocol uses readily available reagents in combination with flow cytometry to separate haploid and diploid nuclei. The protocol can be completed within 1 hour and the resulting individual haploid nuclei have intact morphology. The isolated nuclei are suitable for library preparation for high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing using bulk or single nuclei. The protocol was optimised with mouse testes and we anticipate that it can be applied for the isolation of mature sperm from other mammals including humans.

The study was an explorative study that used an interpretive paradigm. A semi-structured interview guide was used to interview ALHIV, selected by purposive sampling. The study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Kumasi. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.Transitioning of ALHIV was done without any guide; the themes generated were on the process of transition in which they used age (13 and above) and disclosure as the criterion to move ALHIV to the adult clinic. Most adolescents complained about being stigmatised, the attitude of staff, interruption of school and separation anxiety as experiences they went through during the transitioning process. On improving transition, ALHIV felt sexual and reproductive health services, information on treatment, privacy, and support were necessary transition components.The use of age and disclosure of status as a criterion for transitioning ALHIV affects moving and retaining this age group in HIV management programs in the adult clinics. There is, therefore, an urgent need for a guideline as the current transition process defeats the purpose of providing adolescents with age-specific care in the Adult Clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4297990957,"Interpretable factor solutions for questionnaire instruments are typically taken as justification for use of factor-based sub-scores. They can indeed articulate content and construct validities of a total and components but do not guarantee criterion validity for clinical application. Our previous documentation of basic psychometric characteristics for a 12-item patient-reported outcome measure in adult chronic otitis media (COMQ-12) justified next appraising criterion validity of sub-scores.On 246 cases at 1st clinic visit, we compared various classes of factor solution, concentrating on the best-fitting 3-factor ones as widely supported. Clinical data offered two independent measures as external criteria: binaural hearing (audiometric thresholds measured via audiometry) for evaluating 'Hearing' sub-score, and oto-microscopic findings for the 'Ear discharge symptoms' sub-score. As criterion for the total, and for semi-generic 'Activities/healthcare' sub-score, the generic Short Form-36 item set offered a widely used multi-item criterion measure.Factor model fit and parsimony again favoured a 3-factor solution for COMQ-12; however insufficient item support and the dominant 1st principal component of variation made sub-scoring problematic. The best solution was bi-factor, from which only the weighted total score met the declared convergent validity standard of r = 0.50. Two of the more specific sub-scores ('Ear discharge symptoms' and 'Hearing') correlated poorly with clinical findings and weighted binaural hearing thresholds.The COMQ-12 total is acceptably content-valid for general clinical purposes, but the small item set, reflecting excessive pressure for brevity in clinical application, does not well support three criterion-valid factor-based scores. This distinction should be made explicit, and profile sub-scoring discouraged until good convergent and furthermore divergent criterion validities are shown."
https://openalex.org/W4297991685,"Ungulates are key components of ecosystems due to their effects on lower trophic levels, role as prey, and value for recreational and subsistence harvests. Understanding factors that drive ungulate population dynamics can inform protection of important habitat and successful management of populations. To ascertain correlates of ungulate population dynamics, we evaluated the effects of five non-exclusive hypotheses on ungulate abundance and recruitment: winter severity, spring nutritional limitation (spring bottleneck), summer-autumn maternal condition carryover, predation, and timber harvest. We used weather, reconstructed brown bear ( Ursus arctos ) abundance, and timber harvest data to estimate support for these hypotheses on early calf recruitment (calves per 100 adult females in July–August) and population counts of Roosevelt elk ( Cervus canadensis roosevelti ) on Afognak and Raspberry islands, Alaska, USA, 1958–2020. Increasing winter temperatures positively affected elk abundance, supporting the winter severity hypothesis, while a later first fall freeze had a positive effect on elk recruitment, supporting the maternal carry-over hypothesis. Increased brown bear abundance was negatively associated with elk recruitment, supporting the predation hypothesis. Recruitment was unaffected by spring climate conditions or timber harvest. Severe winter weather likely increased elk energy deficits, reducing elk survival and subsequent abundance in the following year. Colder and shorter falls likely reduced late-season forage, resulting in poor maternal condition which limited elk recruitment more than winter severity or late-winter nutritional bottlenecks. Our results additionally demonstrated potential negative effects of brown bears on elk recruitment. The apparent long-term decline in elk recruitment did not result in a decline of abundance, which suggests that less severe winters may increase elk survival and counteract the potential effects of predation on elk abundance."

https://openalex.org/W4297991848,"Recently, there has been increasing interest in the field of indoor localization. This field of research can facilitate building and asset management. Although there are different technologies that can be used for localization, there are many limitations that need to be improved, and therefore there is a need to explore new technologies and alternatives that can improve indoor localization. It has been proven that visible light can be used to transfer data. A German physicist, Harald Haas, introduced the term ""Li-Fi"", which stands for ""light fidelity"", as a new technology that uses light as a medium to deliver data. Accordingly, in this study, we have proposed a hybrid asset localization system using Li-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This system utilizes light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and BLE tags to detect the locations of assets in a smart building with the support of crowdsourcing technology. The system can make the management, maintenance, and localization process of equipment inside the buildings more easier. To achieve the required, the paper provides a comparison between different applications that have been developed for indoor localization using Li-Fi technology in order to highlight the limitations that need more improvement. The proposed system consists of a web-based administrator panel that allows the administrator to manage maps, assets, tags, LED lamps, and maintenance requests, as well as a mobile application that enables the user to locate, search and view asset information. In addition, the mobile application performs the process of crowdsourcing to update the assets' locations. We experimentally explore the system's functionalities and the results show that the system can accurately localize assets, and can detect Li-Fi signals from 55 lx and above within a range of 1.5 m. In addition, the BLE stickers can be detected up to 7 meters away, however, the crowdsourcing process to update the asset location is performed if the distance between the mobile application and the asset is less than or equal 1 m which gives accurate results."
https://openalex.org/W4297991862,"Internet of Drones (IoD) is considered as a network and management architecture, which can enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data in controlled areas and conduct access control for UAVs. However, the current cloud-assisted IoD scheme cannot efficiently achieve secure communication between heterogeneous cryptosystems, and does not support multi-ciphertext equality tests. To improve the security and performance of traditional schemes, we propose a heterogeneous signcryption scheme (HSC-MET) that supports multi-ciphertext equality test. In this paper, we use a multi-ciphertext equality test technique to achieve multi-user simultaneous retrieval of multiple ciphertexts safely and efficiently. In addition, we adopt heterogeneous signcryption technology to realize secure data communication from public key infrastructure (PKI) to certificateless cryptography (CLC). At the same time, the proposed scheme based on the computation without bilinear pairing, which greatly reduces the computational cost. According to the security and performance analysis, under the random oracle model (ROM), the confidentiality, unforgeability and number security of HSC-MET are proved based on the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem."
https://openalex.org/W4297991940,"Because bowel gas deteriorates the image quality of abdominal ultrasonography (AUS), it is common to perform AUS prior to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). This one-way order limits the availability of examination appointments. To evaluate whether EGD using insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which is rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal mucosa, preserves the image quality of AUS performed subsequently, we designed a non-inferiority test in which each subject underwent AUS, EGD with CO 2 insufflation, and a second AUS, in that order. All saved AUS moving images were randomized and imaging quality was evaluated at 16 organs using a four-point Likert-like scale that divides the depiction rate by 25%. Sample size was calculated to be 26 using the following: non-inferiority margin of –0.40 corresponding to depiction rate of –10%, difference of means of 0.40, common standard deviation of 1.25, power of 90%, and 1-sided α-level of 0.025. We enrolled 30 subjects. The mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the image quality score of all 16 organs at pre- and post-EGD AUS in the 30 subjects were 3.54 [3.48–3.60] and 3.46 [3.39–3.52], respectively. The difference in the means was 0.08 of the scores, corresponding to a 2% depiction rate. The effect size was 0.172. The image quality of post-EGD AUS was not inferior, as demonstrated by the 97.5% CI of the difference, which did not cross the non-inferiority margin of –0.40. In conclusion, the use of CO 2 for insufflation in EGD does not cause much deterioration in the image quality of AUS performed subsequently. Therefore, it is permissible to perform EGD prior to AUS, which is expected to improve the efficiency of examination setup."
