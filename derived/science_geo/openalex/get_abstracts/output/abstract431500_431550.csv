https://openalex.org/W2089643849,"Of Microbes and Cancer Inflammation is a well-established driver of tumorigenesis. For example, patients with inflammatory bowel disease have an elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Whether the gut microbiota also contributes to the development of CRC is less well understood. Arthur et al. (p. 120 , published online 16 August; see the Perspective by Schwabe and Wang ) now show that the microbiota does indeed promote tumorigenesis in an inflammation-driven model of CRC in mice. Although germ-free mice were protected against developing cancer, colonization of mice with Escherichia coli was sufficient to drive tumorigenesis."

During macrophage infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a vacuolar pathogen, exogenous induction of autophagy can limit replication, but the mechanism of autophagy targeting and its role in natural infection remain unclear. Here we show that phagosomal permeabilization mediated by the bacterial ESX-1 secretion system allows cytosolic components of the ubiquitin-mediated autophagy pathway access to phagosomal M. tuberculosis. Recognition of extracelluar bacterial DNA by the STING-dependent cytosolic pathway is required for marking bacteria with ubiquitin, and delivery of bacilli to autophagosomes requires the ubiquitin-autophagy receptors p62 and NDP52 and the DNA-responsive kinase TBK1. Remarkably, mice with monocytes incapable of delivering bacilli to the autophagy pathway are extremely susceptible to infection. Our results reveal an unexpected link between DNA sensing, innate immunity, and autophagy and indicate a major role for this autophagy pathway in resistance to M. tuberculosis infection."

This is accomplished through changes in coloration, contrast, patterning, or shape. Morin et al. (p. 828 ) show at a basic level that some of these features can be added as microfluidic layers attached to mobile, flexible, soft machines. By pumping different fluids through the channels, the robots were able to change their coloration or overall contrast and could thus blend into the background of the surface they were lying upon. Conversely, by pumping through fluids of different temperature, the infrared profile of the robot could be changed without changing its visible coloration."
https://openalex.org/W2064484411,"Stem-cell function is an exquisitely regulated process. Thus far, the contribution of metabolic cues to stem-cell function has not been well understood. Here we identify a previously unknown promyelocytic leukemia (PML)–peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPAR-δ)–fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) pathway for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We have found that loss of PPAR-δ or inhibition of mitochondrial FAO induces loss of HSC maintenance, whereas treatment with PPAR-δ agonists improved HSC maintenance. PML exerts its essential role in HSC maintenance through regulation of PPAR signaling and FAO. Mechanistically, the PML–PPAR-δ–FAO pathway controls the asymmetric division of HSCs. Deletion of Ppard or Pml as well as inhibition of FAO results in the symmetric commitment of HSC daughter cells, whereas PPAR-δ activation increased asymmetric cell division. Thus, our findings identify a metabolic switch for the control of HSC cell fate with potential therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2110808396,"Mass cytometry can measure up to 34 markers on cells, but samples cannot be multiplexed. Bodenmiller et al. use metal ion tags to facilitate multiplexed mass cytometry analysis of human blood cell samples treated with 27 kinase inhibitors and 12 stimuli across a range of dosages and time points. Mass cytometry facilitates high-dimensional, quantitative analysis of the effects of bioactive molecules on human samples at single-cell resolution, but instruments process only one sample at a time. Here we describe mass-tag cellular barcoding (MCB), which increases mass cytometry throughput by using n metal ion tags to multiplex up to 2n samples. We used seven tags to multiplex an entire 96-well plate, and applied MCB to characterize human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) signaling dynamics and cell-to-cell communication, signaling variability between PBMCs from eight human donors, and the effects of 27 inhibitors on this system. For each inhibitor, we measured 14 phosphorylation sites in 14 PBMC types at 96 conditions, resulting in 18,816 quantified phosphorylation levels from each multiplexed sample. This high-dimensional, systems-level inquiry allowed analysis across cell-type and signaling space, reclassified inhibitors and revealed off-target effects. High-content, high-throughput screening with MCB should be useful for drug discovery, preclinical testing and mechanistic investigation of human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2034550137,"Detection of microbial products by host inflammasomes is an important mechanism of innate immune surveillance. Inflammasomes activate the caspase-1 (CASP1) protease, which processes the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, and initiates a lytic host cell death called pyroptosis. To identify novel CASP1 functions in vivo, we devised a strategy for cytosolic delivery of bacterial flagellin, a specific ligand for the NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5)/NLRC4 (NLR family, CARD-domain-containing 4) inflammasome. Here we show that systemic inflammasome activation by flagellin leads to a loss of vascular fluid into the intestine and peritoneal cavity, resulting in rapid (less than 30 min) death in mice. This unexpected response depends on the inflammasome components NAIP5, NLRC4 and CASP1, but is independent of the production of IL-1β or IL-18. Instead, inflammasome activation results, within minutes, in an 'eicosanoid storm'--a pathological release of signalling lipids, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that rapidly initiate inflammation and vascular fluid loss. Mice deficient in cyclooxygenase-1, a critical enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, are resistant to these rapid pathological effects of systemic inflammasome activation by either flagellin or anthrax lethal toxin. Inflammasome-dependent biosynthesis of eicosanoids is mediated by the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) in resident peritoneal macrophages, which are specifically primed for the production of eicosanoids by high expression of eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes. Our results therefore identify eicosanoids as a previously unrecognized cell-type-specific signalling output of the inflammasome with marked physiological consequences in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2040025072,"Dissecting SNARE Zippering The SNARE complex is critical for vesicle fusion, notably during release of neurotransmitters at synapses. Understanding the biophysics of SNARE assembly has been the object of several structural studies, and yet much remains to be understood about the mechanisms. Now, Gao et al. (p. 1340 , published online 16 August; see the Perspective by Rizo ) describe the results of cell-free experiments using optical tweezers to elucidate assembly and disassembly of the SNARE complex. Direct observations of SNARE intermediates revealed multiple steps of the assembly process, along with the associated energetics and kinetics. Applying forces similar to those occurring during fusion, an intermediate was stabilized, and the derived mechanism indicates how neurotransmitter release may be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2059653502,"The mechanistic underpinnings of metastatic dormancy and reactivation are poorly understood. A gain-of-function cDNA screen reveals that Coco, a secreted antagonist of TGF-β ligands, induces dormant breast cancer cells to undergo reactivation in the lung. Mechanistic studies indicate that Coco exerts this effect by blocking lung-derived BMP ligands. Whereas Coco enhances the manifestation of traits associated with cancer stem cells, BMP signaling suppresses it. Coco induces a discrete gene expression signature, which is strongly associated with metastatic relapse to the lung, but not to the bone or brain in patients. Experiments in mouse models suggest that these latter organs contain niches devoid of bioactive BMP. These findings reveal that metastasis-initiating cells need to overcome organ-specific antimetastatic signals in order to undergo reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1999391198,"Parp1 and Tet2 mediate essential epigenetic remodelling events in an early phase of induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming, thus directing subsequent induction of the pluripotency loci. The early epigenetic mechanism by which somatic cells are reprogrammed to induced puripotent stem (iPS) cells by the 'Yamanaka factors' is unknown. Asa Abeliovich and colleagues show that by the fourth day of cellular reprogramming two DNA-modification enzymes, Parp1 and Tet2, are recruited to the endogenous pluripotent loci, such as Nanog and Esrrb, leading to localized accumulation of modified cytosine bases, 5mC and 5hmC. Parp1 and Tet2 act through separate but overlapping mechanisms to regulate the 5hmC/5mC ratio, which correlates with transcriptional activity. These findings suggest additional roles for 5hmC during epigenetic reprogramming. Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by using the pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (together referred to as OSKM)1. iPSC reprogramming erases somatic epigenetic signatures—as typified by DNA methylation or histone modification at silent pluripotency loci—and establishes alternative epigenetic marks of embryonic stem cells (ESCs)2. Here we describe an early and essential stage of somatic cell reprogramming, preceding the induction of transcription at endogenous pluripotency loci such as Nanog and Esrrb. By day 4 after transduction with OSKM, two epigenetic modification factors necessary for iPSC generation, namely poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp1) and ten-eleven translocation-2 (Tet2), are recruited to the Nanog and Esrrb loci. These epigenetic modification factors seem to have complementary roles in the establishment of early epigenetic marks during somatic cell reprogramming: Parp1 functions in the regulation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) modification, whereas Tet2 is essential for the early generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the oxidation of 5mC (refs 3,4). Although 5hmC has been proposed to serve primarily as an intermediate in 5mC demethylation to cytosine in certain contexts5,6,7, our data, and also studies of Tet2-mutant human tumour cells8, argue in favour of a role for 5hmC as an epigenetic mark distinct from 5mC. Consistent with this, Parp1 and Tet2 are each needed for the early establishment of histone modifications that typify an activated chromatin state at pluripotency loci, whereas Parp1 induction further promotes accessibility to the Oct4 reprogramming factor. These findings suggest that Parp1 and Tet2 contribute to an epigenetic program that directs subsequent transcriptional induction at pluripotency loci during somatic cell reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2106100115,"Strong signatures of positive selection at newly arising genetic variants are well documented in humans(1-8), but this form of selection may not be widespread in recent human evolution(9). Because many human traits are highly polygenic and partly determined by common, ancient genetic variation, an alternative model for rapid genetic adaptation has been proposed: weak selection acting on many pre-existing (standing) genetic variants, or polygenic adaptation(10-12). By studying height, a classic polygenic trait, we demonstrate the first human signature of widespread selection on standing variation. We show that frequencies of alleles associated with increased height, both at known loci and genome wide, are systematically elevated in Northern Europeans compared with Southern Europeans (P < 4.3 × 10(-4)). This pattern mirrors intra-European height differences and is not confounded by ancestry or other ascertainment biases. The systematic frequency differences are consistent with the presence of widespread weak selection (selection coefficients ∼10(-3)-10(-5) per allele) rather than genetic drift alone (P < 10(-15))."
https://openalex.org/W1971501199,"In changing environments, animals must adaptively select actions to achieve their goals. In tasks involving goal-directed action selection, striatal neural activity has been shown to represent the value of competing actions. Striatal representations of action value could potentially bias responses toward actions of higher value. However, no study to date has demonstrated the direct effect of distinct striatal pathways in goal-directed action selection. We found that transient optogenetic stimulation of dorsal striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons during decision-making in mice introduced opposing biases in the distribution of choices. The effect of stimulation on choice was dependent on recent reward history and mimicked an additive change in the action value. Although stimulation before and during movement initiation produced a robust bias in choice behavior, this bias was substantially diminished when stimulation was delayed after response initiation. Together, our data suggest that striatal activity is involved in goal-directed action selection."
https://openalex.org/W2046421048,"Mature B cells encounter antigens during development that induce anergy or functional unresponsiveness; this large reservoir of dormant autoreactive B cells may serve as a pool of extended antibody specificity for purposes of protective immunity, as well as the source of pathogenic autoantibodies that characterize rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. This study demonstrates that B cells encounter autoantigens during development and that autoreactive B cells persist in the mature repertoire, but become less responsive or anergic to B-cell antigen-receptor stimulation, thereby avoiding autoimmunity. Autoreactivity seems to correlate with the threshold of B-cell activation so that only foreign antigens interacting with B cells at a level greater than the cells' inherent autoreactivity will be activated. The authors speculate that this large reservoir of dormant autoreactive B cells may act as a source of pathogenic autoantibodies in rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. In humans, up to 75% of newly generated B cells and about 30% of mature B cells show some degree of autoreactivity1. Yet, how B cells establish and maintain tolerance in the face of autoantigen exposure during and after development is not certain. Studies of model B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) transgenic systems have highlighted the critical role of functional unresponsiveness or ‘anergy’2,3. Unlike T cells, evidence suggests that receptor editing and anergy, rather than deletion, account for much of B-cell tolerance4,5. However, it remains unclear whether the mature diverse B-cell repertoire of mice contains anergic autoreactive B cells, and if so, whether antigen was encountered during or after their development. By taking advantage of a reporter mouse in which BCR signalling rapidly and robustly induces green fluorescent protein expression under the control of the Nur77 regulatory region, antigen-dependent and antigen-independent BCR signalling events in vivo during B-cell maturation were visualized. Here we show that B cells encounter antigen during development in the spleen, and that this antigen exposure, in turn, tunes the responsiveness of BCR signalling in B cells at least partly by downmodulating expression of surface IgM but not IgD BCRs, and by modifying basal calcium levels. By contrast, no analogous process occurs in naive mature T cells. Our data demonstrate not only that autoreactive B cells persist in the mature repertoire, but that functional unresponsiveness or anergy exists in the mature B-cell repertoire along a continuum, a fact that has long been suspected, but never yet shown. These results have important implications for understanding how tolerance in T and B cells is differently imposed, and how these processes might go awry in disease."

Using an approach that combines the selection imposed by a live predator, the bluegill sunfish, with manipulation of computer-generated “prey,” Ioannou et al. (p. 1212 , published online 16 August; see the Perspective by Romey ) show that “prey” that behave as a group are more likely to survive that those that move in other ways."

Many RNA viruses counter host immunity with high mutation rates coupled with short generation times and large effective population sizes, allowing rapid exploration of mutational space for adaptation. Previous studies have elucidated how the high mutation rates of RNA viruses are required for tropism in animal species (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005Pfeiffer J.K. Kirkegaard K.

The poxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses that are notable because they can infect most vertebrates (chordopoxvirinae) and insects (entomopoxvirinae) (Harrison et al., 2004Harrison S.C.

Poxviruses encode a large array of genes that hijack or antagonize components of the host cell to promote viral fitness (Bahar et al., 2011Bahar M.W. Graham S.C. Chen R.A. Cooray S. Smith G.L.

Virus Res. 2008; 71: 135-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Strong natural selection at these host-virus interfaces can drive rapid adaptations, which are reflected by the fixation of nonsynonymous substitutions in coding regions. These substitutions can either enhance or weaken interactions between host and viral factors (Emerman and Malik, 2010Emerman M. Malik H.S. Paleovirology—modern consequences of ancient viruses.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000301Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Red Queen hypothesis postulates that such interactions evolve as an ongoing series of counteradaptations (Dawkins and Krebs, 1979Dawkins R. Krebs J.R. Arms races between and within species.Proc.

A new evolutionary law.Evol. Theor. 1973; 1: 1-30Google Scholar). Several retrospective evolutionary studies comparing the sequences of open reading frames (ORFs) among poxvirus genomes provide ample evidence of adaptive changes to overcome rapidly evolving host defenses (Bratke and McLysaght, 2008Bratke K.A. McLysaght A. Identification of multiple independent horizontal gene transfers into poxviruses using a comparative genomics approach.BMC Evol.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 15655-15660Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One of the most potent innate defenses against viruses is encoded by protein kinase R (PKR), which is activated upon sensing double-stranded RNA that accumulates in the host cytoplasm during many viral infections (Weber et al., 2006Weber F. Wagner V. Rasmussen S.B. Hartmann R. Paludan S.R. Double-stranded RNA is produced by positive-strand RNA viruses and DNA viruses but not in detectable amounts by negative-strand RNA viruses.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5059-5064Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Active PKR phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α to inhibit protein production, which strongly impairs viral replication (Kaufman, 2000Kaufman R.J. Double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR.in: Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar). Antagonism by a variety of viruses over the course of primate evolution has driven the rapid evolution of PKR in primates (Elde et al., 2009Elde N.C. Child S.J. Geballe A.P. Malik H.S. Protein kinase R reveals an evolutionary model for defeating viral mimicry.Nature. 2009; 457: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar; Rothenburg et al., 2009Rothenburg S. Seo E.J. Gibbs J.S. Dever T.E. Dittmar K. Rapid evolution of protein kinase PKR alters sensitivity to viral inhibitors.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a result of this diversification, primate variants of PKR are differentially susceptible to inhibitors encoded by different viruses. Vaccinia virus encodes two such antagonists, K3L and E3L, which each specifically inhibit PKR by distinct mechanisms in different species (Davies et al., 1993Davies M.V. Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. The E3L and K3L vaccinia virus gene products stimulate translation through inhibition of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase by different mechanisms.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Langland and Jacobs, 2002Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. The role of the PKR-inhibitory genes, E3L and K3L, in determining vaccinia virus host range.Virology. 2002; 299: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The rapid evolution of PKR has led to species-specific resistance to K3L among primates. A partial explanation for flexibility in poxvirus host range is provided by several “host-range” factors, like K3L and E3L, which can overcome species-specific blocks to infection. Left unanswered, however, is the fundamental question of how poxviruses, despite their low mutation rate, efficiently explore mutational space and overcome rapidly evolving immune factors, such as PKR, as they move between host species. For example, some poxviruses, such as cowpox, vaccinia, and monkeypox, infect both animals and humans in zoonotic infections, with the latter cases being of considerable biomedical importance. The fact that these viruses can infect divergent host species despite diverse mechanisms of immunity suggests that they employ different means of evolutionary adaptation from those known for rapidly evolving RNA viruses to overcome low mutation rates. Moreover, even within the same host populations, poxviruses must adapt rapidly to persist despite low mutation rates. Gaining insight into the currently unknown basis of adaptation in this biomedically and evolutionarily important class of viruses is essential for understanding how these viruses infect a wide range of hosts. Fundamental insights into evolutionary mechanisms have been derived from laboratory and experimental evolution of various microbial populations (Beaumont et al., 2009Beaumont H.J. Gallie J. Kost C.

To date, however, nearly all protocols involving experimental evolution of viruses have used strains with high mutation rates (e.g., small RNA viruses) and/or ones that quickly generate large effective population sizes under laboratory conditions (e.g., bacteriophages). Here, we devised an experimental evolution protocol to determine how poxviruses adapt using serial vaccinia infections at relatively small population sizes. By passaging a vaccinia strain deleted for the host range gene E3L, we mimicked a host-switching event, which placed strong selective pressure on K3L to inhibit the antiviral PKR. Our studies reveal mechanisms of poxvirus adaptation to defeat host defenses via rapid episodes of transient gene amplification. This simple and recurrent mechanism of adaptation on a genomic scale also reveals a new general model for mitigating fitness costs associated with large changes in genome structure. Our experiments not only reveal an important means by which poxviruses adapt but also highlight a mechanism by which radical adaptations might be explored in many organisms that have large genomes and low mutation rates. We used the fact that K3L from vaccinia virus is a poor inhibitor of human PKR to determine how poxviruses can adapt to overcome an initially insurmountable host defense. By starting with the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus deleted for E3L (ΔE3L) (Beattie et al., 1995Beattie E. Denzler K.L. Tartaglia J. Perkus M.E. Paoletti E. Jacobs B.L. Reversal of the interferon-sensitive phenotype of a vaccinia virus lacking E3L by expression of the reovirus S4 gene.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 499-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we placed strong selective pressure on K3L (Figure 1A). Three replicate virus populations were repeatedly propagated in HeLa cells at a low multiplicity of infection of 0.1 plaque-forming units/cell. After 48 hr of infection, we collected the virus, measured titers, and repeated the protocol for ten passages (Figure 1B and Experimental Procedures). ΔE3L virus initially replicated much less efficiently than wild-type virus in HeLa cells, consistent with previous reports (Langland and Jacobs, 2002Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. The role of the PKR-inhibitory genes, E3L and K3L, in determining vaccinia virus host range.Virology. 2002; 299: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). By six rounds of passaging in HeLa cells, each of three replicate virus populations consistently produced 10-fold more infectious viruses than the parental virus strain as measured by plaque assays (Figure 1C) and β-gal activity assays (Figure 1C, inset). Further gains in virus production were not evident during the remaining four passages. Thus, despite a low mutation rate, and relatively small effective population sizes starting at 5 × 105 viruses/passage, all three replicates of vaccinia rapidly gained increased fitness over the course of passaging. To determine the genetic basis of rapid adaptation, we performed deep sequencing of all virus populations to approximately 1,000-fold genome coverage. We found only two nonsynonymous and one synonymous polymorphism in the genomes of passage 10 virus replicates at a frequency higher than 1% (Figure 2A). This paucity of mutations highlights the low rate of nucleotide substitution in vaccinia genomes. In addition, none of the substitutions were found at high frequency or in all replicates. In contrast, by scanning sequencing coverage among mapped reads, we found a substantial spike in relative depth that mapped exclusively over the K3L gene, which is consistent with a striking increase in copy number of the K3L locus in all three replicate strains (Figure 2A). The increased read-depth corresponds to an average of three (replicates A, C) to four (replicate B) copies of K3L per viral genome (Figure 2A). To further determine the character of these K3L expansions, we performed Southern blot analysis of viral genomes sampled from points throughout the passaging protocol, using the K3L gene as a probe. These analyses revealed a highly heterogeneous pool of viral genomes in each replicate, with some harboring 15 or more copies of K3L by passage 10 (Figure 2B). Intriguingly, the appearance of multiple copies of K3L paralleled the pronounced increases in virus replication, which occurred by passage 4 for both replicates A and C, and passage 6 for replicate B (compare Figures 1C and 2B). Therefore, increased copy number of K3L directly correlated with increased viral fitness. Additional analysis of discordantly mapping paired-end reads revealed a complex pattern of duplications at the K3L locus exclusive to the adapted strains (Figure 2C; Figure S1 available online; Table S1). Notably, analysis of the duplication break points confirmed the independent origins of the K3L duplications in each of the three replicate populations of adapted vaccinia viruses. Resequencing of parental genomes to nearly 1,000-fold coverage failed to reveal any pre-existing duplications of K3L in this homogenous virus population (Table S1). PCR confirmed the independent emergence of tandem duplications of K3L at several distinct break points in the genes adjacent to K3L in the evolved populations. In addition to our initial experiment, three additional ΔE3L virus replicates passaged under the same conditions all yielded expansions of K3L as judged by PCR to detect K3L-associated break points (Figure S2), demonstrating the reproducibility of gene amplification as a means of adaptation. To determine if genomic amplification of K3L accounted for enhanced viral replication, we first compared K3L protein expression between parental and passaged viruses (Figure 3A). Each passage 10 replicate expressed considerably more K3L protein than even wild-type virus, which still replicates more efficiently than any of the adapted strains because of the presence of E3L (Figure 3A). To determine whether overexpression of K3L alone is sufficient to explain the robust increase in viral fitness, we specifically knocked down K3L expression using siRNA transfections. Successful knockdown of K3L reduced virus replication to levels indistinguishable from prepassaged, parental ΔE3L virus (Figure 3B). Therefore, K3L copy number amplification was necessary and sufficient for increased expression of K3L, which caused the substantial gain in virus fitness we observed. Because K3L mimics PKR's substrate eIF2α and inhibits PKR by direct binding (Dar and Sicheri, 2002Dar A.C. Sicheri F. X-ray crystal structure and functional analysis of vaccinia virus K3L reveals molecular determinants for PKR subversion and substrate recognition.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it appears that an increased abundance of even weakly active K3L antagonizes PKR by mass action, providing the basis for an immediate evolutionary advantage due to genomic expansion. Whereas K3L copy number amplification provided a rapid, recurrent basis for adaptation in all of the replicate populations, most studies of virus evolution identify adaptive point mutations as the basis of fitness gains. We found that two of the replicates from our study possessed a single amino acid substitution, H47R, in K3L at frequencies of 3% and 12% (Table S2). Remarkably, this exact substitution was previously identified in a genetic screen for K3L mutants with enhanced activity against human PKR using a yeast assay interrogating the K3L-PKR interaction (Kawagishi-Kobayashi et al., 1997Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Silverman J.B. Ung T.L. Dever T.E. Regulation of the protein kinase PKR by the vaccinia virus pseudosubstrate inhibitor K3L is dependent on residues conserved between the K3L protein and the PKR substrate eIF2alpha.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4146-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated this variant from the adapted passage 10 replicate C vaccinia population containing a single copy of K3L with the H47R mutation and tested its fitness relative to viruses with gene expansions of wild-type K3L sequence. Both the single copy H47R-bearing virus and the multicopy K3L virus had marked improvements in fitness over the parental single-copy wild-type K3L virus (Figure 3C). These findings also strongly support the idea that fitness gains realized by K3L amplification and acquisition of H47R in serially propagated virus populations reflect specific antagonism of PKR. In addition, although only 12% of the K3L genes at passage 10 of replicate C contain the H47R mutation (541 reads out of 4,146 total sequencing reads), 47% of single-copy K3L genes from the same virus population harbor this substitution (24 cases with H47R out of 51 K3Ls sampled via PCR and sequencing; p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This result implies that low copy number viruses are strongly selected to possess the adaptive H47R allele of K3L compared to K3L expanded viruses in the same pool. Thus, our experimental evolution strategy uncovered two responses to the same selective challenge: adaptive copy number expansions seen in all replicate populations and an adaptive nonsynonymous mutation seen at low frequency in two of three replicates. The emergence of the H47R substitution raised the possibility that K3L expansions facilitated the appearance of the variant by providing additional targets for mutation to generate increased variation, including beneficial substitutions, like H47R. Examination of parental ΔE3L strain sequences mapping to codon 47 of the K3L coding region failed to reveal H47R in the starting population (Table S2). Also consistent with K3L expansions preceding the acquisition of H47R was our observation that replicate B, the slowest population to undergo K3L amplification (Figure 1C), lacked any detectable H47R K3L alleles by passage 10. Together, these data suggest that H47R appeared after K3L gene expansion. To determine when H47R emerged during the course of passaging, we amplified K3L from genomic samples of replicate C at each passage point and sequenced amplicon populations. K3L expansions, as judged by PCR amplification across K3L duplications, preceded the appearance of the H47R substitution during viral passaging (Figure 4). Sequencing of PCR products spanning K3L duplications at late passage points revealed the presence of H47R in both single and multicopy K3L arrays. We further sampled the composition of multicopy arrays by sequencing 34 clones bearing two K3L gene copies. Of these, ten had both wild-type and H47R-containing copies of K3L. Together, these data strongly suggest that K3L expansions facilitated the emergence and increased frequency of the H47R substitution. Thus, not only are the K3L gene expansions immediately advantageous because of their ability to provide enhanced antagonism of human PKR but they also facilitate the acquisition of single Darwinian “gain-of-function” changes by increasing the number of mutational targets despite an otherwise modest mutation rate. Two previously proposed mechanisms could account for facile gene expansion in vaccinia genomes. One study proposed unequal crossover as a mechanism to account for variation in the distal inverted terminal repeat regions of the vaccinia genome (Moss et al., 1981Moss B. Winters E. Cooper N. Instability and reiteration of DNA sequences within the vaccinia virus genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A second study pointed to the possibility that gene expansions could occur episomally, because vaccinia can promote rapid amplification of nonviral plasmids. To determine whether the K3L locus was being expanded by a mechanism involving episomes containing K3L, we used RecBCD enzyme, a complex helicase and nuclease, which rapidly digests all linear genomic DNA but spares any potential circular episomes (Eichler and Lehman, 1977Eichler D.C.

The initiation and control of homologous recombination in Escherichia coli.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 347: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of undigested genomes, as well as those treated with RecBCD to eliminate linear DNA forms that might have otherwise obscured circular forms, failed to reveal the presence of circular DNA intermediates containing K3L in genomes of viruses passaged in HeLa cells (Figure S3). Thus, we can exclude an episomal mode of amplification, which suggests that recombination-driven K3L gene expansions within linear genomes of each replicate virus account for the rapid adaptation of vaccinia virus.Figure S4Copy Number Variation in the Inverted Terminal Repeat Regions of the Vaccinia Genome, Related to Figure 2Show full captionMapped reads of parent and virus replicates A–C at passage 10 showing depth of coverage at the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions of the vaccinia genome.

Sequencing depth drops to single copy levels upstream of the first ORF and increases downstream of the last ORF shown as gene models. This analysis is related to Figure 2. Recombination-mediated gene expansions, which can facilitate the acquisition of adaptive substitutions, could represent a general mechanism for rapid adaptation of poxviruses. To determine if gene duplications similar to K3L were present at low frequency in virus populations, we assayed for the presence of additional duplications in virus populations. Twelve sets of PCR primers were designed to amplify products across potential duplication break points at locations spaced roughly evenly throughout the genome (Table S3). These probes for duplications were used to query three vaccinia strains (Western Reserve, Copenhagen-VC2, and the parental strain used in this study, Copenhagen-VC2-ΔE3L). Despite our limited sampling, we found that each strain harbored at least one duplication break point in virus populations (Figure 5). We did not detect any shared sequence motifs or consistent patterns of homology at sites in which duplications arose that might promote genomic expansions. However, each of the duplications we uncovered maps toward the distal regions of the vaccinia genome, which have a higher frequency of recombination and are comprised of many genes that are dedicated to the modulation of host factors (Moss, 2007Moss B. Poxviridae: the viruses and their replication.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2905-2946Google Scholar). In contrast, genes toward the center of the vaccinia genome are essential for virus-specific functions in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Four of the twelve primer sets tested amplified duplications in the Western Reserve strain, which included several break points from duplications of K3L (Table S4). Further examination of deep sequencing reads also revealed rare duplication break points that were confirmed for two cases by PCR in populations of adapted strains at genomic locations outside the K3L locus (Table S5). These data reveal that virus populations contain a variety of low-frequency break points that could rapidly seed genomic expansions under suitable selective conditions, such as changing hosts. Much like random nucleotide substitutions that can start adaptive sweeps driven by selection, we propose that these low-frequency duplication events across the vaccinia genome can drive rapid gene expansions to overcome host defenses, followed by expanded sampling of point mutations. Given the low rate of nucleotide substitutions uncovered by our"

We previously proposed a “selective phase model” in which the FG repeats interact with one another to form a sieve-like barrier that can be locally disrupted by the binding of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), but not by inert macromolecules, allowing selective passage of NTRs and associated cargo. Here, we provide direct evidence for this model in a physiological context. By using NPCs reconstituted from Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we show that Nup98 is essential for maintaining the permeability barrier. Specifically, the multivalent cohesion between FG repeats is required, including cohesive FG repeats close to the anchorage point to the NPC scaffold. Our data exclude alternative models that are based solely on an interaction between the FG repeats and NTRs and indicate that the barrier is formed by a sieve-like FG hydrogel.

A single FG Nup, Nup98, dominates the permeability barrier of vertebrate NPC Nup98 FG repeats are highly cohesive and form hydrogels of NPC-like permeability Nuclei with engineered NPCs reveal barrier-relevant features of FG repeat domain The NPC barrier requires multivalent cohesion between FG repeats Cell nuclei are enclosed by the nuclear envelope that comprises two concentric membranes and embedded nuclear pores (Watson, 1954Watson M.L. Pores in the mammalian nuclear membrane.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 15: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The pores arise from local fusions between inner and outer nuclear membranes (reviewed in Hetzer and Wente, 2009Hetzer M.W. Wente S.R. Border control at the nucleus: biogenesis and organization of the nuclear membrane and pore complexes.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 606-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). They connect the nuclear interior with the cytoplasm and are integrated into giant protein structures of 8-fold rotational symmetry called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs pose efficient barriers for inert objects ≥5 nm in diameter (Mohr et al., 2009Mohr D. Frey S. Fischer T. Güttler T. Görlich D. Characterisation of the passive permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2541-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). They suppress an intermixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, which in turn is a requirement for the ordered course of eukaryotic gene expression. Shuttling nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), however, can cross the barrier in a highly facilitated manner (reviewed in Görlich and Kutay, 1999Görlich D. Kutay U. Transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). NTRs bind cargo molecules and supply nuclei with proteins and the cytoplasm with nuclear products like ribosomes. The facilitated mode of NPC passage reaches a capacity of up to 1,000 translocation events per NPC per second (Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001Ribbeck K. Görlich D. Kinetic analysis of translocation through nuclear pore complexes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and accommodates objects of up to nearly 40 nm in diameter (Panté and Kann, 2002Panté N.

Cell. 2002; 13: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar; Lowe et al., 2010Lowe A.R. Siegel J.J. Kalab P. Siu M. Weis K. Liphardt J.T. Selectivity mechanism of the nuclear pore complex characterized by single cargo tracking.Nature. 2010; 467: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). NTRs can utilize an energy input, e.g., from the RanGTPase system to accumulate substrates against steep concentration gradients (Görlich et al., 2003Görlich D. Seewald M.J. Ribbeck K. Characterization of Ran-driven cargo transport and the RanGTPase system by kinetic measurements and computer simulation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, directional transport requires an intact NPC barrier that retains the transported molecules inside the destination compartment. NPCs are built from ∼30 different nucleoporins (Nups) that can be classified into structural Nups and phenylalanine-glycine repeat-containing Nups (FG Nups). The structural Nups form the NPC scaffold and provide binding sites for the FG Nups (reviewed in Brohawn et al., 2009Brohawn S.G. Partridge J.R. Whittle J.R. Schwartz T.U. The nuclear pore complex has entered the atomic age.Structure. 2009; 17: 1156-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). FG domains (Hurt, 1988Hurt E.C.

They represent nonglobular protein structures (Denning et al., 2003Denning D.P. Patel S.S. Uversky V. Fink A.L. Rexach M.

It is, however, not trivial to explain how such interactions render NPCs 100- to >1,000-fold more permeable for NTR⋅cargo complexes than for inert objects of similar size. In fact, a mere binding of NTRs to FG motifs should cause retention of NTR⋅cargo complexes and thus delay their passage through the central NPC channel. More importantly, such a simple arrangement cannot explain why molecules that are not bound to an NTR are blocked from NPC passage. To resolve this “nuclear transport paradox,” we previously proposed the “selective phase model” (Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001Ribbeck K. Görlich D. Kinetic analysis of translocation through nuclear pore complexes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar; see Figure 1). It assumes that the barrier-forming FG domains comprise many cohesive units, which bind each other and thereby mediate multivalent interactions within but also between individual FG domains. Such interactions would result in a sieve-like FG hydrogel (the selective phase) that allows passage of small molecules but suppresses fluxes of larger ones. NTRs overcome this size limit by binding to FG motifs and consequently disengaging FG meshes in their immediate vicinity (Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001Ribbeck K. Görlich D. Kinetic analysis of translocation through nuclear pore complexes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar; Kustanovich and Rabin, 2004Kustanovich T. Rabin Y. Metastable network model of protein transport through nuclear pores.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2008-2016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This way, NTRs can partition into the FG hydrogel and eventually exit the barrier on the trans side. The selective phase model is supported by several observations. First, yeast NPCs contain numerous cohesive FG domains (Frey and Görlich, 2007Frey S. Görlich D. A saturated FG-repeat hydrogel can reproduce the permeability properties of nuclear pore complexes.Cell. 2007; 130: 512-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Frey and Görlich, 2009Frey S.

Natively unfolded nucleoporins gate protein diffusion across the nuclear pore complex.Cell. 2007; 129: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Second, sufficiently concentrated solutions of cohesive FG domains spontaneously form FG hydrogels (Frey et al., 2006Frey S. Richter R.P. Görlich D. FG-rich repeats of nuclear pore proteins form a three-dimensional meshwork with hydrogel-like properties.Science. 2006; 314: 815-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar; Frey and Görlich, 2009Frey S.

Third, cargo⋅NTR complexes migrate into such hydrogels up to 20,000-fold faster than the respective cargoes alone (Frey and Görlich, 2007Frey S. Görlich D. A saturated FG-repeat hydrogel can reproduce the permeability properties of nuclear pore complexes.Cell. 2007; 130: 512-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Frey and Görlich, 2009Frey S. Görlich D. FG/FxFG as well as GLFG repeats form a selective permeability barrier with self-healing properties.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2554-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fourth, the intragel diffusion rate of a typical importin-β⋅cargo complex predicts a similar NPC passage time (∼10 ms) as was observed for traversing authentic NPCs (Yang et al., 2004Yang W. Gelles J. Musser S.M. Imaging of single-molecule translocation through nuclear pore complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12887-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar; Kubitscheck et al., 2005Kubitscheck U. Grünwald D. Hoekstra A. Rohleder D. Kues T. Siebrasse J.P. Peters R.

A saturated FG-repeat hydrogel can reproduce the permeability properties of nuclear pore complexes.Cell. 2007; 130: 512-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether FG domains behave at the nanoscopic scale of an NPC the same way as in macroscopic hydrogels and whether the function of authentic NPCs indeed relies on inter-FG cohesion and, hence, on hydrogel formation. A number of alternative models have been suggested. The “reduction of dimensionality model” (Peters, 2005Peters R. Translocation through the nuclear pore complex: selectivity and speed by reduction-of-dimensionality.Traffic. 2005; 6: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), for example, assumes that the central NPC channel is narrow enough to effectively suppress three-dimensional random walks of inert material through the pore, whereas NTRs (with bound cargo) are postulated to reach the other channel side faster by sliding two-dimensionally along an FG-covered channel surface. The “virtual gate model” (Rout et al., 2003Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Magnasco M.O. Chait B.T. Virtual gating and nuclear transport: the hole picture.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 622-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) also does not rely on inter-FG cohesion. Instead, it assumes that the brush-like behavior of (otherwise noninteracting) FG domains is sufficient to repel inert material from the central channel and that NTRs overcome this repulsion by binding to FG motifs. The “reversible collapse model” (Lim et al., 2007Lim R.Y. Fahrenkrog B. Köser J. Schwarz-Herion K. Deng J. Aebi U. Nanomechanical basis of selective gating by the nuclear pore complex.Science. 2007; 318: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) is identical to the virtual gate model up to the point that FG brushes repel inert material, but it further assumes that FG domains contract upon NTR binding and thereby move cargo complexes across the barrier. The field of nuclear transport is currently discussing which of the models describes the fundamental principles of the NPC barrier correctly. There is, however, general agreement that only tests in the context of real NPCs can provide a valid decision (Weis, 2007Weis K. The nuclear pore complex: oily spaghetti or gummy bear?.Cell. 2007; 130: 405-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; Terry and Wente, 2009Terry L.J. Wente S.R.

Musser S.M. Single molecule studies of nucleocytoplasmic transport.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1813: 1607-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fortunately, the various models differ clearly in their predictions as to how changes in the properties of FG domains would impact NPC selectivity. The selective phase, virtual gate, and reversible collapse models predict a barrier collapse when FG domains are removed, whereas the reduction of dimensionality model predicts little effect on passive NPC passage. The selective phase model predicts an NPC barrier failure when cohesive FG repeats are replaced by noncohesive ones, whereas all the other mentioned models predict no impact. We have now developed a system, based on engineered NPCs, that allows testing such predictions. We found that the passive diffusion barrier of vertebrate NPCs depends crucially on the FG nucleoporin Nup98 and, in particular, on its FG domain. We further observed that the isolated Nup98 FG domain is highly cohesive and forms FG hydrogels of exquisite NPC-like selectivity. Nonselectively permeable NPCs were evident when the Nup98 FG domain had been exchanged for any noncohesive FG domain. This also applied to noncohesive domains that were fully proficient in NTR binding. In contrast, heterologous highly cohesive FG domains allowed NPCs to exclude large inert molecules and to mediate efficient active transport. Our findings suggest that inter-FG cohesion is fundamental for NPC function and lend strong support to the selective phase model. The central predictions of the selective phase model are that the NPC-barrier-forming FG domains are cohesive and that replacing these cohesive FG domains by noncohesive ones leads to a barrier failure. We wanted to test these predictions in authentic NPCs. This required us to identify the barrier-relevant FG domain(s) and to establish a system that allows exchanging FG domains and subsequently monitoring of the permeability properties of the resulting NPCs. Xenopus laevis egg extracts appeared to be an ideal starting point. They are a rich source for nuclear membrane precursors and soluble Nups, allowing de novo assembly of nuclei around templates of demembranated sperm chromatin (Forbes et al., 1983Forbes D.J.

Importantly, individual Nups can be removed before assembly and replaced by engineered versions. The critical advantage of this system over genetic approaches is that it allows analysis of the full spectrum of NPC permeability phenotypes, i.e., even of those that would be lethal in a cellular context. Nuclei assembled from nondepleted extract behaved as expected. They excluded a variety of inert macromolecules and showed active import of IBB-MBP, which represents a fusion between a strong importin-β-dependent import signal (the IBB domain; Görlich et al., 1996Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R. Hartmann E. A 41 amino acid motif in importin alpha confers binding to importin beta and hence transit into the nucleus.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) with the maltose-binding protein from Escherichia coli (MBP). Likewise, they showed CRM1-mediated export of a nuclear export signal (NES) fused to GFP. This together indicated that the newly assembled NPCs had gained both an intact passive permeability barrier and the competence for facilitated translocation (Figures 2D and S2 available online). We first tested the contribution of Nup62 (Finlay et al., 1991Finlay D.R. Meier E. Bradley P. Horecka J. Forbes D.J. A complex of nuclear pore proteins required for pore function.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) to the NPC barrier because it is well conserved and localized to the center of the central NPC channel (Grote et al., 1995Grote M. Kubitscheck U. Reichelt R. Peters R. Mapping of nucleoporins to the center of the nuclear pore complex by post-embedding immunogold electron microscopy.J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where a selectivity filter would be most effective. Also, it probably represents the FG Nup with the highest copy number (Cronshaw et al., 2002Cronshaw J.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Matunis M.J. Proteomic analysis of the mammalian nuclear pore complex.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). It occurs in two complexes. The Nup54⋅58⋅62 complex (Finlay et al., 1991Finlay D.R. Meier E. Bradley P. Horecka J. Forbes D.J. A complex of nuclear pore proteins required for pore function.J.

Surprisingly, depletion of the Nup54⋅58⋅62 complex or the simultaneous depletion of the Nup54⋅58⋅62 and Nup62⋅88⋅214 complexes did not eliminate the NPC barrier. The nuclei appeared smaller, displayed a still respectable, albeit clearly reduced, facilitated import activity, and showed passive as well as active CRM1-mediated exclusion (Figures 2D and S2). These nuclei even replicated their DNA (Figure S2C).Figure S2Nuclei Assembled in Nup62-Depleted Extract Display Unexpectedly Mild Functional Defects, Related to Figure 2DShow full captionNuclei were assembled from Xenopus sperm chromatin, membranes and undepleted or depleted extracts as indicated.

Strikingly however, nuclei assembled in Nup62-depleted extracts showed a pattern of replication foci that was indistinguishable from that of control nuclei. Scale bar, 25 μm. It is possible that an insufficient degree of depletion accounts for a lack of more severe defects, in particular, as the source extract contains more Nup62 than needed to saturate its NPC binding sites. We regard this, however, as unlikely. Compared to their original concentration, the Nup62 complexes were depleted to very low levels, namely to ≤0.2% in the extract (Figure 2A) and to ∼1% in assembled NPCs (Figure 2C; data not shown). This indeed rules out that the basic functions of the NPC barrier have a stoichiometric requirement for the Nup62 complexes. These results are in contrast to the so-far prevailing view that Nup62 complexes are essential for NPC function (Finlay et al., 1991Finlay D.R. Meier E. Bradley P. Horecka J. Forbes D.J. A complex of nuclear pore proteins required for pore function.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). They are, however, in line with the observation that deleting the NPC binding site for Nsp1p (the yeast ortholog to Nup62) on Nic96p causes a growth defect, but not lethality (Schrader et al., 2008Schrader N. Stelter P. Flemming D. Kunze R. Hurt E. Vetter I.R. Structural basis of the nic96 subcomplex organization in the nuclear pore channel.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A drastic phenotype, however, became evident when all O-GlcNAc-modified FG Nups (Nups 54, 58, 62, 98, and 214) were depleted with the immobilized lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; Finlay and Forbes, 1990Finlay D.R. Forbes D.J. Reconstitution of biochemically altered nuclear pores: transport can be eliminated and restored.Cell. 1990; 60: 17-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The resulting nuclei displayed a closed nuclear envelope (data not shown) and contained NPCs that stained positively for nondepleted Nups (Figures 4C, 7A, S2C, and S4; data not shown) but failed in active nuclear import and export (see e.g., Figures 2D, 4A, and 7A–7C) as well as in DNA replication (Figure S2C). This is in full agreement with previous reports (Finlay and Forbes, 1990Finlay D.R. Forbes D.J. Reconstitution of biochemically altered nuclear pores: transport can be eliminated and restored.Cell. 1990; 60: 17-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Importantly, these WGA-depleted NPCs also failed to exclude fluorescently labeled large inert molecules, such as a 70 kDa dextran or IgGs (Figures 2D and S2B), indicating that they did not maintain a permeability barrier. The WGA depletion phenotype was previously attributed to the loss of Nup62 complexes (Finlay et al., 1991Finlay D.R. Meier E. Bradley P. Horecka J. Forbes D.J. A complex of nuclear pore proteins required for pore function.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our observation that depletion with anti-Nup62 resulted in lower residual Nup62 levels than the WGA depletion and yet produced milder defects, however, argues against this conclusion. Instead, it appears that the depletion of an additional component by WGA is responsible for the drastic phenotype. One candidate is Nup98 (Powers et al., 1995Powers M.A. Macaulay C. Masiarz F.R.

To enable systematic protein function interrogation in a multicellular context, we built a genome-scale transgenic platform for in vivo expression of fluorescent- and affinity-tagged proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans under endogenous cis regulatory control. The platform combines computer-assisted transgene design, massively parallel DNA engineering, and next-generation sequencing to generate a resource of 14,637 genomic DNA transgenes, which covers 73% of the proteome. The multipurpose tag used allows any protein of interest to be localized in vivo or affinity purified using standard tag-based assays.

To identify cancer-specific vulnerabilities that are the result of copy number losses, we performed integrated analyses of genome-wide copy number and RNAi profiles and identified 56 genes for which gene suppression specifically inhibited the proliferation of cells harboring partial copy number loss of that gene. These CYCLOPS (copy number alterations yielding cancer liabilities owing to partial loss) genes are enriched for spliceosome, proteasome, and ribosome components. One CYCLOPS gene, PSMC2, encodes an essential member of the 19S proteasome. Normal cells express excess PSMC2, which resides in a complex with PSMC1, PSMD2, and PSMD5 and acts as a reservoir protecting cells from PSMC2 suppression. Cells harboring partial PSMC2 copy number loss lack this complex and die after PSMC2 suppression. These observations define a distinct class of cancer-specific liabilities resulting from genome instability."

https://openalex.org/W1993648746,"Dectin-1 is a pattern recognition receptor that is important for innate immune responses against fungi in humans and mice. Dectin-1 binds to β-glucans in fungal cell walls and triggers phagocytosis, production of reactive oxygen by the NADPH oxidase, and inflammatory cytokine production which all contribute to host immune responses against fungi. Although the autophagy pathway was originally characterized for its role in the formation of double-membrane compartments engulfing cytosolic organelles and debris, recent studies have suggested that components of the autophagy pathway may also participate in traditional phagocytosis. In this study, we show that Dectin-1 signaling in macrophages and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells triggers formation of LC3II, a major component of the autophagy machinery. Further, Dectin-1 directs the recruitment of LC3II to phagosomes, and this requires Syk, activation of reactive oxygen production by the NADPH oxidase, and ATG5. Using LC3-deficient dendritic cells we show that whereas LC3 recruitment to phagosomes is not important for triggering phagocytosis, killing or Dectin-1-mediated inflammatory cytokine production, it facilitates recruitment of MHC class II molecules to phagosomes and promotes presentation of fungal-derived antigens to CD4 T cells."

Further, we find that regulation of the Com system relies on the formation of a functional comK gene via prophage excision. Prophage excision is specifically induced during intracellular growth, primarily within phagosomes, yet, in contrast to classic prophage induction, progeny virions are not produced. This study presents the characterization of an active prophage that serves as a genetic switch to modulate the virulence of its bacterial host in the course of infection."

Cell-selective silencing of K-ATP channel activity in medial SN DA neurons revealed that their K-ATP channel-gated burst firing was crucial for novelty-dependent exploratory behavior. We also detected a transcriptional upregulation of K-ATP channel and NMDA receptor subunits, as well as high in vivo burst firing, in surviving SN DA neurons from Parkinson's disease patients, suggesting that burst-gating K-ATP channel function in DA neurons affects phenotypes in both disease and health."

Whereas bacterial NRPSs use thioesterase domains to perform the cyclization, fungal NRPSs have apparently evolved to use a different enzymatic route. In verified fungal NRPSs that produce macrocyclic peptides, each megasynthetase terminates with a condensation-like (C(T)) domain that may perform the macrocyclization reaction. To probe the role of such a C(T) domain, we reconstituted the activities of the Penicillium aethiopicum trimodular NPRS TqaA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro. Together with the reconstituted bimodular NRPS AnaPS, we dissected the cyclization steps of TqaA in transforming the linear anthranilate-D-tryptophan-L-alanyl tripeptide into fumiquinazoline F. Extensive biochemical and mutational studies confirmed the essential role of the C(T) domain in catalyzing cyclization in a thiolation domain-dependent fashion.

Both N and C termini of the caveolin polypeptide have been shown to reside in the cytoplasm, whereas a highly hydrophobic segment of approximately 33 amino acids is predicted to insert into cellular membranes (Dupree et al., 1993Dupree P.

Caveolin proteins have been shown to be synthesized as integral membrane proteins at the endoplasmatic reticulum (Monier et al., 1995Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. VIP21-caveolin, a membrane protein constituent of the caveolar coat, oligomerizes in vivo and in vitro.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). An intriguing aspect of caveolin biology is the fact that the polypeptide undergoes multiple changes on its exocytic route from the site of synthesis to the plasma membrane (Hayer et al., 2010Hayer A.

At some as yet undefined stage along the exocytic route from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane, caveolin oligomers finally associate with lipid components typically found in detergent-resistant membranes and are henceforth organized in discrete units of large-molecular weight oligomers, giving rise to “exocytic caveolar carriers” (Parton and Simons, 2007Parton R.G. Simons K. The multiple faces of caveolae.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Caveolin oligomerization and formation of membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids are believed to be critical for caveolae formation (Anderson, 1998Anderson R.G.

The exact mechanism of caveola formation, or caveogenesis, remains largely enigmatic. To understand caveolin-membrane interactions, a simplified model system for caveola formation, in which lipid and protein composition can be modulated, would represent a major step forward. Here, we report the development of a model for caveola formation. We show that membrane vesicles, produced by scission of the caveolar domain from the membrane, can be induced by recombinant caveolin expression in the heterologous host Escherichia coli. This system provides fundamental insights into membrane domain formation, deformation of a biological membrane driven by caveolin, and the organization of a caveolar coat in an extremely tractable model system. In addition, we show that solutes can be incorporated into the caveolin-induced vesicles and that the vesicles can be directed to and taken up specifically by target cells through endocytic events. In order to investigate the interaction of caveolin proteins with biological membranes, we heterologously expressed a wide spectrum of caveolin proteins in the prokaryotic host E. coli. Whereas the vast majority of the recombinant protein was associated with the host membrane (and inclusion bodies were absent), large quantities of recombinant protein could be affinity purified without detergent solubilization. Therefore, the localization and nature of the recombinant caveolin proteins was investigated by immunoelectron microscopy. In cells expressing caveolin-1, a striking accumulation of circular profiles, 45–50 nm in diameter, was observed within the cytoplasm (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Upon expression of the caveolin construct, the cytoplasm of the host cells would in many cases become utterly filled with these internalized structures as exemplified in a tomographic reconstruction of part of the host cell (Movie S1). To investigate the process by which these structures are produced, we examined the localization of recombinant caveolin-1 at early times of protein expression. Specific labeling with antibodies against the recombinant protein was seen predominantly at the inner membrane of the host cells (Figures 1A, 1D, and 1E). At this time point, sparse labeling was detected within the center of the bacteria, but over time labeled vesicles accumulated throughout the entire cytoplasm of the bacteria (Figures 1A and 1D and Figure S1). Equivalent structures were observed for various caveolin proteins tested, i.e., mammalian caveolin-1 and -3 and also teleostean caveolin-1 (data not shown). Vesicular structures were not induced by chemical fixatives, as shown by high-pressure cryopreservation followed by freeze-substitution (Figures 1B, 1C, and 1F). These results suggest that the vesicles are derived from the inner membrane by an inward budding process. Consistent with this notion, profiles were observed that were connected to the membrane (Figures 1A–1C). These structures showed striking similarity to the morphology of surface caveolae in mammalian cells, both as surface invaginations and as budded caveolae. In view of the induction of these structures by caveolin, the apparent formation at the membrane and their morphology, we termed these structures “heterologous caveolae” or “h-caveolae.”Figure S1Membrane Inclusions in the Cytoplasm of E. coli Generated by Caveolin versus Wild-Type Membranes, Related to Figure 1Show full captionCells were processed for cryosectioning, immunolabeling and TEM as described in methods.(A and B) E. coli BL21 (λDE3) expressing maltose-binding-protein-caveolin-1 fusion protein.

Analysis of purified h-caveolae by negative-staining electron microscopy showed the presence of numerous 45–50 nm vesicles (diameter of membrane) with a prominent coat (Figure 2A), consistent with the observed induction of h-caveolae in the cytoplasm described above. h-caveolae could be produced and purified by engineering an affinity tag at either C or N terminus, suggesting that the topology of the protein was as predicted (Dupree et al., 1993Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Caveolae and sorting in the trans-Golgi network of epithelial cells.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). Single-step affinity chromatography of h-caveolae yielded an essentially pure preparation of maltose-binding protein (MBP)-caveolin-1 as judged by Coomassie blue staining of SDS-PAGE separated proteins (Figure 2C). Remarkably, endogenous (membrane) proteins were below the limits of detection. Affinity purified h-caveolae showed a monodisperse distribution with a median hydrodynamic radius around 59 nm (Figure 2E). Immunogold labeling with antibodies to MBP or to different caveolin epitopes confirmed the presence of the caveolin fusion protein on the surface of these purified structures (Figure 2F–2H). To gain further insights into the ultrastructure in essentially a native state, purified h-caveolae were rapidly frozen and examined in a vitrified state without fixatives or stains (Figures 2D and 5A). The cryofixed h-caveolae showed a well-defined coat, consisting of regularly spaced protrusions from the membrane, approximately 4 × 2 nm in dimension (vide infra). We next investigated whether caveolin isoforms and mutant proteins that do not generate caveolae in mammalian cells, i.e., noncaveogenic isoforms, could bring about the formation of h-caveolae in this model system. In this prokaryotic model system, neither caveolin-2 nor Caenorhabditis elegans caveolin gave rise to h-caveolae, as defined above by their size and geometry. When expressed in E. coli, both caveolins associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and apparently resulted in an expansion of membranous material, giving rise to pleiomorphic membranous inclusions (Figures 3A–3E). A tomographic reconstruction of part of a caveolin-2 expressing cell exemplifies the variable nature of these inclusions in comparison to the h-caveolae formed by mammalian caveolin-1 (Movie S2). Extending the validation of the current model system for caveolar biogenesis, we sought to establish whether mutations mimicking phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at the conserved Ser80 would influence its ability to form h-caveolae. Expression of mutant caveolin-1 in which Ser80 is substituted by glutamate in caveolin null cells results in accumulation of the mutant caveolin in the Golgi complex and no caveola formation, whereas an alanine substitution permits caveola formation in the same system. It has been hypothesized that Ser80 may play a key role in regulating the association of a postulated amphipathic helix (helix α2a, residues 80-95) with the membrane interface (Kirkham et al., 2008Kirkham M. Nixon S.J. Howes M.T. Abi-Rached L. Wakeham D.E. Hanzal-Bayer M. Ferguson C. Hill M.M. Fernandez-Rojo M. Brown D.A. et al.Evolutionary analysis and molecular dissection of caveola biogenesis.J.

Our data suggest that the S80E mutation is indeed noncaveogenic in this model system, while again giving rise to pleiomorphic membranous inclusions (Figure 3F). In contrast, S80A substitution gave rise to h-caveolae equivalent to the wild-type protein in geometry (data not shown). The formation of oligomeric assemblies has been shown to constitute an integral part of the biology of caveolae (Das et al., 1999Das K. Lewis R.Y. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P.

We therefore tested whether mutant caveolin proteins, partially or completely impaired in their ability to oligomerize in mammalian cells (Ren et al., 2004Ren X. Ostermeyer A.G. Ramcharan L.T. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Brown D.A. Conformational defects slow Golgi exit, block oligomerization, and reduce raft affinity of caveolin-1 mutant proteins.Mol. Biol.

All mutants exhibited a marked reduction in protein stability in vivo (Figure S2B), in stark contrast to the stability of the wild-type protein expressed in the same system. Expression in a host strain (ftsH) depleted for the membrane protease FtsH (a key component of the host's quality control system for integral membrane proteins [Ito and Akiyama, 2005Ito K. Akiyama Y. Cellular functions, mechanism of action, and regulation of FtsH protease.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar]) ameliorated the apparent lack of stability of the mutant proteins. Wild-type caveolin was found to behave exclusively as a high-molecular-weight complex on sucrose gradients when solubilized with Triton X-100. The missense mutation P132L, a naturally occurring mutation with relatively high frequency in human mammary carcinoma (Hayashi et al., 2001Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Invasion activating caveolin-1 mutation in human scirrhous breast cancers.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar), showed a skewed distribution of monomeric and oligomeric species on gradients. Two other mutant proteins (118A5 and G108/A112/S123/H126 all to L), showed predominantly monomeric or low-molecular-weight oligomeric distribution (Figure S2A).Figure S2Oligomerization Mutants Have Decreased Stability in the Host Membrane, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Wild-type and mutant caveolin proteins were expressed as MBP fusion proteins in ftsH depletion E. coli strain AD368 under restrictive conditions.

Around 144 ± 39 molecules of caveolin have been estimated to associate with a single caveola in mammalian cells (Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Kinase-regulated quantal assemblies and kiss-and-run recycling of caveolae.Nature. 2005; 436: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In order to establish the validity of the current system as a model for caveogenesis, we have undertaken structural characterization of the h-caveola by cryoelectron tomography. Reconstruction of the electron density by weighted back-projection of the tomographic tilt series revealed a discrete organization of the caveolar coat on purified h-caveolae (Figure 4 and Movie S3). The electron density apparent in the reconstruction is for the most part the density of the fusion protein as is demonstrated by the proteolytic cleavage and removal of the MBP moiety prior to cryoelectron microscopy (Figure S3). Nevertheless, this has enabled us to quantify the number of fusion proteins in the coat and visualize the arrangement of individual caveolin oligomers on the surface of the h-caveola. The average number of nonoverlapping density peaks after cleavage was 10.3 ± 1.2 (Figure S3, n = 13). When combined with a cleavage efficiency of 93.7%—as determined by immunoblotting—this indicates an average of 163.9 ± 19.5 fusion proteins per h-caveola, which is remarkably similar to the number of caveolins molecules predicted to associate with a single caveola in mammalian cells (Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005Pelkmans L.

Cryo-electron tomographic reconstructions, (C and D) and (E and F), respectively, demonstrate two different heterologous caveolae after protease cleavage of the MBP-tag. Even at the low resolution of the cryotomograms, a discrete arrangement of caveolin oligomers was evident (Figure 4 and Movie S3). Volumetric reconstructions (n = 8) suggested a polyhedral organization of putative caveolin oligomers (as suggested in Figure 4). For the reconstructed densities, an icosahedral symmetry with 2-fold symmetries along x, y, and z axes was detected with a map correlation of 0.991 ± 0.007 (SD, n = 8). In agreement with this model, we found that vitrified h-caveolae often presented polygonal profiles of decagonal appearance, exhibiting parallel lines and constant angles between edges (Figure 5A). Such a projection from a putative polyhedron was also evident in the slices of the tomographic reconstruction (Figures 4A–4C). The observation of distinct geometric “faces” suggested that the arrangement may indeed be polyhedral. To corroborate a potential polyhedral model, we analyzed the presence and geometry of discrete building blocks of oligomeric caveolin by detergent treatment and subsequent transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Based on our previous results in solubilizing oligomeric caveolin from the heterologous host (Figure S2), we hypothesized that treating purified h-caveolae with Triton X-100 would result in release of oligomeric caveolin from the vesicular structure and would facilitate visualization of caveolin organization. Indeed, discretely organized caveolin became evident upon aldehyde fixation and detergent extraction, in stark contrast to the density in the uncrosslinked h-caveolae, which did not retain any organization (of caveolin oligomers) and was reduced to a randomly oriented mass (data not shown). Intriguingly, distinct regular pentagons were discernable in the chemically fixed and detergent extracted h-caveolae (Figures 5B and 5C). Moreover, a 3-fold symmetrical arrangement of pentagonal substructures could be identified (Figure 5B), resembling the 3-fold relation observed for purified 400 kDa caveolin polymers from mammalian cells (Monier et al., 1995Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. VIP21-caveolin, a membrane protein constituent of the caveolar coat, oligomerizes in vivo and in vitro.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This provides the first evidence that the organization of caveolin oligomers, leading to the formation of h-caveolae, could be achieved by formation of a regular polyhedron. We next hypothesized that the dramatic membrane changes induced by caveolin expression must be reflected by changes in lipid composition of the host inner membrane and that the h-caveola may sequester (and require) specific lipids during formation.

NCFC patients manifest varying degrees of cognitive impairment, but the developmental basis of their brain abnormalities remains largely unknown. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an NCFC syndrome, is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Here, we show that biallelic Nf1 inactivation promotes Erk-dependent, ectopic Olig2 expression specifically in transit-amplifying progenitors, leading to increased gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis in neonatal and adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Nf1-deficient brains exhibit enlarged corpus callosum, a structural defect linked to severe learning deficits in NF1 patients. Strikingly, these NF1-associated developmental defects are rescued by transient treatment with an MEK/ERK inhibitor during neonatal stages. This study reveals a critical role for Nf1 in maintaining postnatal SVZ-derived neurogenesis and identifies a potential therapeutic window for treating NF1-associated brain abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2166941550,"The cellular mechanisms that regulate self-renewal versus differentiation of mammalian somatic tissue stem cells are still largely unknown. Here, we asked whether an RNA complex regulates this process in mammalian neural stem cells. We show that the RNA-binding protein Staufen2 (Stau2) is apically localized in radial glial precursors of the embryonic cortex, where it forms a complex with other RNA granule proteins including Pumilio2 (Pum2) and DDX1, and the mRNAs for β-actin and mammalian prospero, prox1. Perturbation of this complex by functional knockdown of Stau2, Pum2, or DDX1 causes premature differentiation of radial glial precursors into neurons and mislocalization and misexpression of prox1 mRNA. Thus, a Stau2- and Pum2-dependent RNA complex directly regulates localization and, potentially, expression of target mRNAs like prox1 in mammalian neural stem cells, and in so doing regulates the balance of stem cell maintenance versus differentiation."

We defined minimum binding epitopes for commercial antibodies recognizing the modified and unmodified H2B peptides. We further found that this platform is suitable for the highly sensitive characterization of methyltransferases and kinase substrates. The Intel arrays also revealed specific H2B epitopes that are recognized by autoantibodies in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus who have elevated disease severity.

During DNA replication, replication forks may stall when they encounter secondary DNA structures, repetitive sequences, certain protein-DNA complexes, or lesions generated by DNA-damaging agents. Especially in response to UV light-induced DNA lesions, replicative DNA polymerases stall because they are unable to accommodate altered DNA bases in their active sites. Although stalled replication forks are normally stabilized following the activation of DNA damage checkpoints, they may also collapse and thus result in double-strand break formation, gross chromosomal rearrangements, and genomic instability (1Branzei D.

Earlier studies in both yeast and mammalian cells suggest two major pathways for PRR: translesion synthesis (TLS) and damage avoidance by template switching. During TLS, the stalled replicative polymerase is replaced by TLS polymerases, which are a class of specialized polymerases with low processivity that can replicate over distortions in DNA and directly bypass lesions (4Prakash S.

The mechanism of lesion bypass by damage avoidance is unclear but is thought to involve template switching with the undamaged sister chromatid and/or the use of homologous recombination (6Broomfield S.

In yeast, ubiquitination of PCNA is mediated by the Rad6 epistasis group and two RING domain-containing E3 ligases, Rad18 and Rad5. Rad18 mediates the monoubiquitination of PCNA, whereas Rad5 facilitates the further addition of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains (5Waters L.S. Minesinger B.K. Wiltrout M.E. D'Souza S. Woodruff R.V.

The increased affinity of Y-family polymerases for monoubiquitinated PCNA (Ub-PCNA) is mediated by ubiquitin-binding domains that have been identified in all of the Y-family polymerases (11Bienko M.

Cell. 2005; 18: 499-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). PCNA ubiquitination is the key event regulating PRR; however, it is insufficient, by itself, to account for the specificity of PRR pathway choice, as several TLS polymerases have ubiquitin-interacting motifs (5Waters L.S. Minesinger B.K. Wiltrout M.E. D'Souza S. Woodruff R.V. Walker G.C. Eukaryotic translesion polymerases and their roles and regulation in DNA damage tolerance.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 134-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the precise molecular mechanism and regulatory events underlying the switch from replicative to translesion polymerase in response to DNA damage is largely unknown. In this study, we have identified a previously uncharacterized protein (C1orf124) as a regulator of TLS. C1orf124 is a multidomain protein and contains an SprT-like domain at its N terminus, an SHP box and a PIP box in the middle region, and a UBZ (ubiquitin-binding zinc finger) domain at the C terminus. We show that C1orf124 localizes to sites of UV light-induced DNA damage in the cells and is required for cell survival following UV radiation. On the basis of the results presented below, we propose that C1orf124 is a key mediator protein involved in TLS, which plays an important role in the switch from replicative DNA polymerase to TLS polymerase for efficient lesion bypass upon UV damage. Anti-C1orf124 antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with GST-C1orf124 fusion proteins containing residues 1–250 and 1–489 of human C1orf124 protein. Antisera were affinity-purified using an AminoLink Plus immobilization and purification kit (Pierce). Anti-β-actin and anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-RPA2 antibody was from Abcam. Anti-PCNA antibody (PC10) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-RAD18 antibody was obtained from Novus Biologicals. Anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer antibody was from Cosmo Bios. All cDNAs were subcloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) as entry clones and were subsequently transferred to gateway-compatible destination vectors for the expression of N-terminally tagged fusion proteins. All deletion mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Non-silencing control shRNA and shRNA target sets were purchased from Sigma. The C1orf124 targeting sequences are as follows: 1, 5′-CTATGTCAAACGAGCTACTAACTCGAGTTAGTAGCTCGTTTGACATAG-3′; and 2, 5′-GTACAACCACAGCTCAGAATTCTCGAGAATTCTGAGCTGTGGTTGTAC-3′. The shRNA-resistant wild-type and mutant C1orf124 constructs were generated by changing nucleotides in the shRNA1 targeting region (5′-GCAACTCTGGCACACTCGATCCTAGCAGCGATCGCTATGAGCATTA-3′). The shRNAs were packaged into lentiviruses by cotransfection with packaging plasmids pMD2G and pSPAX2 into 293T cells. 48 h later, the supernatant was collected for infection of HeLa cells. Infection was repeated twice with an interval of 24 h to achieve maximal infection efficiency. Infected cells were selected with medium containing puromycin (2 μg/ml). GST proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as follows. Cells were pelleted and lysed in NETN buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and 50 μg/ml lysozyme. Cells were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. After clarification, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes with NETN buffer A, beads coated with the indicated proteins were used for pulldown experiments. 293T cells were transfected with constructs encoding Myc-tagged PCNA and incubated for 24 h. Cells were lysed with high-salt buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.6% Triton X-100, 8% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm NaF). The supernatant was clarified and then incubated with GST-C1orf124, GST-C1orf124ΔPIP, or GST protein prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with HEPES/Triton buffer, the beads were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments following UV radiation, cells were treated with 100 J/m2 UV-C light and allowed to recover for 4 h. Cells were then collected, lysed in 600 mm NaCl/HEPES/Triton buffer, diluted to 150 mm NaCl, sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation before performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments. TAP was performed as described previously (20Yuan J. Ghosal G. Chen J. The annealing helicase HARP protects stalled replication forks.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2394-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding SFB (S-protein, FLAG, and streptavidin-binding peptide)-tagged constructs. Cell lines stably expressing tagged proteins were selected, and the expression of exogenous proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunostaining. For affinity purification, a total of 20 10-cm dishes of 293T cells stably expressing SFB-tagged protein were collected and lysed in NETN buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 μg/ml each pepstatin A and aprotinin for 25 min. Crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with 300 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with NETN buffer B and then eluted with 2 mg/ml biotin (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The eluates were incubated with 100 μl of S-protein-agarose beads (Novagen) for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with NETN buffer B. The proteins bound to beads were eluted by boiling with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis for protein identification performed by the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard University. Cells were lysed with NETN buffer B on ice for 30 min. Cleared cell lysates were then collected, boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS/Tween buffer and then probed with antibodies as indicated. Cells cultured on coverslips were washed with PBS, pre-extracted with 0.5% Triton solution for 2 min, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS and then immunostained with primary antibodies in 5% goat serum for 60 min. Coverslips were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with rhodamine or FITC for 60 min. Cells were then stained with DAPI to visualize nuclear DNA. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with anti-fade solution and visualized using a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope with a Nikon Plan Fluor 60× oil objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.30) at room temperature. Cells were photographed using a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) and analyzed using Photoshop software (Adobe). For micro-irradiation experiments, cells were seeded on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.), incubated overnight, and then visualized with a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-U inverted microscope. Cells were micro-irradiated with a Micropoint ablation system (Photonics Instruments, St. Charles, IL) with the laser output set to 35%. An average of 20 cells were micro-irradiated and further cultured for 6 h prior to immunostaining. To irradiate cells with UV light, 5-μm Nucleopore membrane filters (Millipore) were used. Cells were treated with 10 J/m2 UV-C light and incubated for 4 h prior to immunostaining. 1 × 103 cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes in triplicates. 24 h after seeding, cells were treated with UV light, HU, ionizing radiation, or mitomycin C (MMC) at the indicated concentrations. The medium was replaced 24 h later, and cells were then incubated for 14 days. Colonies formed were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue. The numbers of colonies were counted using a Gel Doc system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). SLX4 (also known as FANCP) is a Fanconi anemia protein that functions in the repair of interstrand DNA cross-links generated by agents such as MMC, cisplatin, and platinum-based drugs (21Gari K. Constantinou A. The role of the Fanconi anemia network in the response to DNA replication stress.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2009; 44: 292-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Svendsen J.M. Smogorzewska A. Sowa M.E. O'Connell B.C. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

The precise molecular function of SLX4 in MMC-induced DNA damage repair is unclear. To obtain a better understanding of how SLX4 is recruited to DNA damage sites and the molecular function of SLX4 in DNA cross-link repair, we performed TAP using cell lysates prepared from 293T cells stably expressing triple epitope (S-protein, FLAG, and streptavidin-binding peptide)-tagged SLX4 (SFB-SLX4). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed many known SLX4-associated proteins and also a previously uncharacterized protein, C1orf124 (Fig. 1A). C1orf124 is predicted to encode a protein of 489 residues with an SprT-like domain (residues 45–231) at the N terminus, an SHP box (first identified in Shp1, the yeast ortholog of p47; residues 253–261) and a PCNA-interacting PIP box (residues 325–332) in the middle, and a RAD18-like UBZ domain (residues 453–476) at the C terminus (Fig. 1B). Because C1orf124 contains a PCNA-interacting PIP box motif and a RAD18-like UBZ domain, we speculated that C1orf124 could function in the DNA damage response. Indeed, exogenously expressed C1orf124 localized to DNA damage sites generated by laser-induced micro-irradiation (Fig. 1C, upper panel) or following treatment of cells with HU (middle panel) or UV radiation (lower panel). Moreover, endogenous C1orf124 co-localized with γH2AX (Fig. 1D, upper panel) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (lower panel) in cells following HU treatment or UV radiation, respectively, indicating that C1orf124 functions in the DNA damage response. Cells with stable knockdown of C1orf124 (Fig. 1E) showed marked hypersensitivity to UV light (Fig. 1F) and HU treatment (Fig. 1G), but with only mild or no increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (Fig. 1H) and MMC treatment (Fig. 1I). Together, these data suggest that C1orf124 is a DNA damage protein involved mainly in promoting cell survival following replication stress. To gain insight in C1orf124 functions in the replication stress pathway, we performed TAP and identified PCNA as the major C1orf124-associated protein (Fig. 2A). C1orf124 has a characteristic PCNA-interacting motif (PIP box), which was first identified in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor also called p21 or Cip1 (24Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Structure of the C-terminal region of p21WAF1/CIP1 complexed with human PCNA.Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The PIP box (QNVLSNYF, residues 325–332) of C1orf124 (Fig. 2B) agrees well with the consensus PIP box sequence, QXX(L/V/I/M)XX(F/Y)(F/Y), deduced from those identified in FEN1, p21, and XPG (24Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). We generated a deletion mutant of C1orf124 (C1orf124ΔPIP) that lacks the entire PIP box. As shown in Fig. 2C, GST-fused wild-type C1orf124, but not GST-C1orf124ΔPIP or GST alone, could bind to PCNA, confirming that C1orf124 interacts with PCNA via this conserved PIP box motif. C1orf124 also contains a RAD18-like ubiquitin-binding UBZ domain at its C terminus (Fig. 1B). The interaction between C1orf124 and PCNA did not change markedly following UV treatment (Fig. 2D), and C1orf124 bound to both unmodified and monoubiquitinated PCNA (Fig. 2E). However, when the UBZ domain of C1orf124 was deleted, this mutant (C1orf124ΔUBZ) lost its ability to bind to Ub-PCNA (Fig. 2E). Its association with unmodified PCNA was also slightly reduced (Fig. 2E), indicating that the UBZ domain of C1orf124 helps the binding of C1orf124 to Ub-PCNA. Indeed, although full-length C1orf124 and the C1orf124ΔSHP mutant co-localized with replication protein A at laser-induced DNA damage sites (Fig. 2F) and with PCNA at damage foci following UV treatment (Fig. 2G), this damage-induced localization of C1orf124 was abolished in C1orf124ΔPIP and C1orf124ΔUBZ mutants, which lack the PIP box and UBZ domain, respectively (Fig. 2, F and G). These data suggest that C1orf124 localizes to DNA damage sites via its association with Ub-PCNA. Because both the PIP box motif and the UBZ domain of C1orf124 are important for its interaction with PCNA and its localization to DNA damage sites, we suspected that C1orf124 might function downstream of PCNA ubiquitination. However, we found that C1orf124 knockdown cells also showed reduced UV light-induced PCNA monoubiquitination (Fig. 3A). This reduction in PCNA ubiquitination was rescued by reconstitution of C1orf124 knockdown cells with full-length C1orf124, but not with the C1orf124ΔPIP or C1orf124ΔUBZ mutant (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that although binding to PCNA is required for the recruitment of C1orf124 following UV radiation, C1orf124 is also required for maintaining the level of ubiquitinated PCNA at DNA damage sites. The E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD18 is exclusively required for PCNA monoubiquitination, which is believed to be critical for the switch from normal replicative DNA polymerase to Y-family polymerase following DNA damage and therefore allows lesion bypass (9Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.

Consistent with a key role of RAD18 in TLS, RAD18 depletion causes hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (27Nakajima S. Lan L. Kanno S. Usami N. Kobayashi K. Mori M. Shiomi T. Yasui A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The reduction in PCNA ubiquitination observed in C1orf124 knockdown cells suggests that C1orf124 may also regulate RAD18 function. RAD18 is a putative C1orf124-associated protein identified by our mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 2A). We confirmed this association by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we found that the localization of RAD18 to UV light-induced damage foci was diminished in C1orf124 knockdown cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the chromatin association of RAD18 following UV radiation was also reduced in C1orf124 knockdown cells (Fig. 3D). Cells with co-depletion of RAD18 and C1orf124 exhibited similar UV sensitivity as RAD18−/− cells or C1orf124 knockdown cells (Fig. 3E), indicating that C1orf124 and RAD18 function in the same PRR pathway. DNA damage inhibits replication fork progression by blocking replicative DNA polymerases. To overcome this blockade, cells recruit specialized TLS polymerases, which can insert nucleotides opposite the damaged bases. In particular, TLS by DNA pol η (also called POLH/RAD30/XPV) is the major pathway for bypassing UV photoproducts (30Day T.A. Palle K. Barkley L.R. Kakusho N. Zou Y. Tateishi S. Verreault A. Masai H. Vaziri C. Phosphorylated Rad18 directs DNA polymerase η to sites of stalled replication.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recruitment of pol η and other TLS polymerases to stalled replication forks is mediated by monoubiquitination of PCNA (13Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Interaction of human DNA polymerase η with monoubiquitinated PCNA: a possible mechanism for the polymerase switch in response to DNA damage.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Y-family polymerases possess UBZ motifs, and the direct binding of TLS polymerases to Ub-PCNA facilitates their recruitment to stalled replication forks (11Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding domains in Y-family polymerases regulate translesion synthesis.Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). However, there are also other mechanisms that contribute to TLS polymerase recruitment. For example, RAD18 has been shown to associate directly with pol η and to guide the polymerase to sites of DNA damage (16Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. Rad18 guides pol η to replication stalling sites through physical interaction and PCNA monoubiquitination.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). When we compared the results of TAP of C1orf124-containing protein complexes obtained from untreated cells (Fig. 2A) with those from UV light-irradiated cells (Fig. 4A), we found that we obtained more peptides derived from POLD3 (polymerase delta 3/p66) and PDIP1 (POLD3-interacting protein 1/POLDIP1/KCTD13) in the untreated sample than in the UV light-irradiated sample. Interestingly, POLH (pol η) was identified only as a C1orf124-associated protein in the UV light-treated sample (Figs. 2A and 4A), suggesting that C1orf124 may associate with different polymerases before and after DNA damage. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the binding of C1orf124 to POLD3 or PDIP1 was dramatically reduced following UV irradiation (Fig. 4, B and C). On the other hand, the association of C1orf124 with translesion polymerase POLH was markedly increased in cells treated with UV radiation (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that C1orf124 may directly participate in the switching of replicative polymerase to translesion polymerase following UV damage and therefore mediate lesion bypass. Besides DNA replication and repair proteins, we also identified VCP and VCP-associated proteins (VCPIP and UBXD10) as C1orf124-binding proteins (Figs. 2A and 4A). VCP (also known as p97 and Cdc48) belongs to the hexameric AAA-ATPase family and functions in diverse cellular activities that include ubiquitin-dependent endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation protein quality control (31Meusser B.

Ye Y. The p97 ATPase associates with EEA1 to regulate the size of early endosomes.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 346-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and protein degradation at the outer mitochondrial membrane (34Meyer H. Bug M. Bremer S. Emerging functions of the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase in the ubiquitin system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Recent studies imply that VCP acts by extracting protein complexes bound to chromatin rather than promoting protein degradation. For example, Aurora B has been shown to be extracted from mitotic chromosomes by VCP/p97 and its cofactors (35Dobrynin G. Popp O. Romer T. Bremer S. Schmitz M.H. Gerlich D.W. Meyer H. Cdc48/p97-Ufd1-Npl4 antagonizes Aurora B during chromosome segregation in HeLa cells.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, VCP/p97 regulates DNA replication by mediating the removal of replication licensing factor Cdt1 that is bound to PCNA (36Havens C.G. Walter J.C. Mechanism of CRL4Cdt2, a PCNA-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1568-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). VCP/p97 has also been shown to function in repair of ionizing radiation-induced double-strand breaks. VCP/p97 is recruited to ionizing radiation-induced damage sites in an RNF8-dependent manner, where it catalyzes the removal of the Lys-48-conjugated protein substrates to allow for proper assembly of downstream signaling effectors, including RAD51, BRCA1, and 53BP1 (37Meerang M. Ritz D. Paliwal S. Garajova Z. Bosshard M. Mailand N. Janscak P. Hübscher U. Meyer H. Ramadan K. The ubiquitin-selective segregase VCP/p97 orchestrates the response to DNA double-strand breaks.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, VCP/p97 also mediates the removal of the RNA polymerase II complex when it is stalled at UV light-induced DNA lesions (38Verma R. Oania R. Fang R. Smith G.T. Deshaies R.J. Cdc48/p97 mediates UV-dependent turnover of RNA Pol II.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 82-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that VCP plays a role in the DNA damage response. Thus, it is possible that the association between C1orf124 and VCP may be important for C1orf124 function following UV irradiation. We found that C1orf124 binds to VCP via the SHP box (Fig. 5A). Deletion of the PIP box or UBZ domain of C1orf124 did not influence its interaction with VCP (Fig. 5A). To assess the function of C1orf124-VCP interaction following UV irradiation, we generated constructs encoding shRNA-resistant SFB-tagged wild-type C1orf124, C1orf124ΔPIP, C1orf124ΔSHP, or C1orf124ΔUBZ. Only the expression of shRNA-resistant wild-type C1orf124, but not any of these C1orf124 deletion mutants, could rescue the UV hypersensitivity in C1orf124-depleted cells (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that the binding of C1orf124 to VCP and to ubiquitinated PCNA is required for its in vivo function mediating cell survival following UV damage. In this study, we have identified and characterized the PCNA-binding protein C1orf124. Cells depleted of C1orf124 showed marked increases in cellular sensitivity to UV and HU treatment (Fig. 1, F and G), suggesting a function of C1orf124 in the DNA damage response. C1orf124 interacted with unmodified and ubiquitinated PCNA (Fig. 2, C–E) and localized to UV light-induced DNA damage sites. Depletion of C1orf124 resulted in a marked decrease in PCNA monoubiquitination, which was accompanied by a reduction in RAD18 chromatin association and RAD18 localization to DNA damage sites (Fig. 3, A–C). Theses results suggest that C1orf124 is required to stabilize RAD18 and Ub-PCNA at the sites of DNA damage. Our findings agree with the observations in a recent study characterizing the function of C1orf124 in the UV light-induced damage response (39Centore R.C. Yazinski S.A. Tse A. Zou L. Spartan/C1orf124, a reader of PCNA ubiquitylation and a regulator of UV light-induced DNA damage response.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which C1orf124 confers cellular resistance to UV damage is still unclear. In this study, we have shown that C1orf124 binds VCP via the SHP box and that the binding of C1orf124 to VCP/p97 is crucial for cellular resistance to UV damage (Fig. 5, A and B). Studies have shown that VCP/p97 functions in regulating DNA metabolic processes by mediating proteasomal degradation or catalyzing the extraction of proteins or protein complexes from the chromatin (35Dobrynin G. Popp O. Romer T. Bremer S. Schmitz M.H. Gerlich D.W. Meyer H. Cdc48/p97-Ufd1-Npl4 antagonizes Aurora B during chromosome segregation in HeLa cells.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Verma R. Oania R. Fang R. Smith G.T. Deshaies R.J. Cdc48/p97 mediates UV-dependent turnover of RNA Pol II.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 82-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the basis of this information and the data presented in our study, we propose that C1orf124 may function to stabilize Ub-PCNA and RAD18 on DNA damage sites by preventing their removal or extraction from the chromatin by VCP/p97 during TLS (Fig. 5C). C1orf124 may carry out its regulatory function by sequestering the substrates (RAD18 and PCNA) away from the enzymatic action of VCP/p97 either by directly inhibiting VCP activity or by physically disrupting VCP-substrate interaction via steric hindrance. Thus, in C1orf124-depleted cells, VCP can gain access to its substrates and catalyzes the removal of RAD18 and Ub-PCNA from the chromatin (Fig. 5C, right panel) and thus results in the reduction of RAD18 and Ub-PCNA at damage sites. Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that overexpression of a catalytically inactive dominant-negative mutant of VCP (E305Q/E578Q) restored RAD18 chromatin association in C1orf124 stable knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, the reduction of PCNA ubiquitination observed in C1orf124 knockdown cells was also rescued by the expression of this catalytically inactive mutant of VCP (supplemental Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we also found that C1orf124 preferentially bound to replicative polymerase POLD3 or TLS polymerase POLH before or after DNA damage (Fig. 4, B–D). Thus, we propose that C1orf124 may directly regulate the switch from replicative polymerase to translesion polymerase following DNA damage (Fig. 5C). It is likely that this function of C1orf124 may involve its regulated associations with these polymerases and potentially also the function of VCP/p97. Further studies are needed to elucidate precisely how this switch occurs at the molecular level. We thank all members of the Chen laboratory for advice and technical assistance.

Here we show that high fat diet (HFD) or saturated fatty acid exposure directly activates CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) protein expression in liver, adipocytes, and macrophages. Global C/EBPβ deletion prevented HFD-induced inflammation and surprisingly increased mitochondrial gene expression in white adipose tissue along with brown adipose tissue markers PRDM16, CIDEa, and UCP1, consistent with a resistance to HFD-induced obesity. In isolated peritoneal macrophages from C/EBPβ(-/-) mice, the anti-inflammatory gene LXRα and its targets SCD1 and DGAT2 were strikingly up-regulated along with IL-10, while NLRP3, a gene important for activating the inflammasome, was suppressed in response to palmitate. Using RAW 264.7 macrophage cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes, C/EBPβ knockdown prevented palmitate-induced inflammation and p65-NFκB DNA binding activity, while C/EBPβ overexpression induced NFκB binding, JNK activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression directly. Finally, chimeric bone marrow mice transplanted with bone marrow lacking C/EBPβ(-/-) demonstrated reduced systemic and adipose tissue inflammatory markers, macrophage content, and maintained insulin sensitivity on HFD. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HFD or palmitate exposure triggers C/EBPβ expression that controls expression of distinct aspects of alternative macrophage activation. Reducing C/EBPβ in macrophages confers protection from HFD-induced systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, suggesting it may be an attractive therapeutic target for ameliorating obesity-induced inflammatory responses."

We report a detailed kinetic model of the photochemistry of acetaldehyde (ethanal) under tropospheric conditions. The rate constants are benchmarked to collision-free experiments, where extensive photo-isomerization is observed upon irradiation with actinic ultraviolet radiation (310 to 330 nanometers). The model quantitatively reproduces the experiments and shows unequivocally that keto-enol photo-tautomerization, forming vinyl alcohol (ethenol), is the crucial first step. When collisions at atmospheric pressure are included, the model quantitatively reproduces previously reported quantum yields for photodissociation at all pressures and wavelengths. The model also predicts that 21 ± 4% of the initially excited acetaldehyde forms stable vinyl alcohol, a known precursor to organic acid formation, which may help to account for the production of organic acids in the troposphere."
https://openalex.org/W2095249314,"Asymmetric cell divisions are a fundamental feature of neural development, and misregulation can lead to brain abnormalities or tumor formation. During an asymmetric cell division, molecular determinants are segregated preferentially into one daughter cell to specify its fate. An important goal is to identify the asymmetric determinants in neural progenitor cells, which could be tumor suppressors or inducers of specific neural fates. Here, we show that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Stau2 is distributed asymmetrically during progenitor divisions in the developing mouse cortex, preferentially segregating into the Tbr2(+) neuroblast daughter, taking with it a subset of RNAs. Knockdown of Stau2 stimulates differentiation and overexpression produces periventricular neuronal masses, demonstrating its functional importance for normal cortical development. We immunoprecipitated Stau2 to examine its cargo mRNAs, and found enrichment for known asymmetric and basal cell determinants, such as Trim32, and identified candidates, including a subset involved in primary cilium function."

Using this strategy, we demonstrate that the oxidatively induced lesions 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (cdA) and 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine (cdG) and the methylglyoxal-induced lesion N(2)-(1-carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-CEdG) strongly inhibited transcription in vitro and in mammalian cells. In addition, cdA and cdG, but not N(2)-CEdG, induced transcriptional mutagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, when located on the template DNA strand, all examined lesions were primarily repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair in mammalian cells. This newly developed CTAB assay should be generally applicable for quantitatively assessing how other DNA lesions affect DNA transcription in vitro and in cells."

The assembly of RecA protein onto gapped DNA (gDNA) that is complexed with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein is accelerated by the RecF, RecO, and RecR (RecFOR) proteins. Here, we show the RecFOR proteins specifically target RecA protein to gDNA even in the presence of a thousand-fold excess of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The binding constant of RecF protein, in the presence of the RecOR proteins, to the junction of ssDNA and dsDNA within a gap is 1–2 nm, suggesting that a few RecF molecules in the cell are sufficient to recognize gDNA. We also found that the nucleation of a RecA filament on gDNA in the presence of the RecFOR proteins occurs at a faster rate than filament elongation, resulting in a RecA nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA for 1000–2000 nucleotides downstream (5′ → 3′) of the junction with duplex DNA. Thus, RecA loading by RecFOR is localized to a region close to a junction.

DNA lesions caused by exogenous and endogenous sources are lethal if left unrepaired (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Initiation of genetic recombination and recombination-dependent replication.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Just one DNA break or replication-blocking lesion is highly toxic to the organism: such damage can block cell division and, in the case of multicellular Eukarya, may lead to cancer (2Lisby M. Rothstein R. Choreography of recombination proteins during the DNA damage response.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, several pathways are responsible for the repair of such DNA lesions (3Michel B. Boubakri H. Baharoglu Z. LeMasson M. Lestini R. Recombination proteins and rescue of arrested replication forks.DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These pathways include nucleotide or base excision repair, homologous recombinational repair, and lesion bypass. The expression of some of the proteins involved in these repair pathways is controlled by the LexA repressor and RecA protein in a DNA damage-inducible system termed the SOS response (4Kuzminov A. Recombinational repair of DNA damage in Escherichia coli and bacteriophage λ.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAgDNAgapped DNASSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding. gaps in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are one type of damaged DNA. Such gapped DNA (gDNA) can be produced when DNA synthesis stops at a DNA lesion during DNA replication (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Initiation of genetic recombination and recombination-dependent replication.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The RecF pathway of recombination repairs gDNA and requires the functions of at least RecA, RecF, RecG, RecJ, RecN, RecO, RecQ, RecR, RuvA, RuvB, RuvC, and SSB proteins (5Kowalczykowski S.C.

The RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins mediate the loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA, functioning as the RecOR or RecFOR complexes; these proteins are often called “mediator” proteins. Mutation of recF, recO, or recR results in a delay of SOS induction (10Thoms B. Wackernagel W.

However, this delay and the loss of DNA repair are suppressed by specific mutations in the recA gene, called srf (suppressors of recF mutation) mutations (14Wang T.-C.

The RecA803 protein is the product of one srf suppressor; it binds efficiently to ssDNA that is complexed with SSB protein, whereas the wild-type RecA protein does not (16Madiraju M.V.V.S. Templin A.

These and other in vivo and in vitro observations strongly suggested that the RecFOR proteins were needed for assembly of the RecA filament on SSB-coated ssDNA. single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA gapped DNA single-stranded DNA-binding.

Genetic functions promoting homologous recombination in Escherichia coli: a study of inversions in phage λ.Genetics. 1987; 115: 11-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, SSB protein can either stimulate or inhibit the DNA strand exchange activity of RecA protein in vitro (20Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A.

When RecA protein is incubated with ssDNA prior to SSB protein or when substoichiometric amounts of SSB protein relative to ssDNA are used, SSB protein stimulates DNA strand exchange by removing secondary structure in ssDNA. When stoichiometric amounts of SSB protein are incubated with ssDNA prior to RecA protein filament assembly, SSB protein inhibits DNA strand exchange by kinetically impeding access of RecA to the ssDNA. Because SSB protein binds ssDNA faster than RecA protein (22Urbanke C. Schaper A.

Investigation of binding between recA protein and single-stranded polynucleotides with the aid of a fluorescent deoxyribonucleic acid derivative.Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2860-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), in the cell, SSB protein binds ssDNA prior to RecA protein, preventing the assembly of RecA filament and recombinational repair (24Moreau P.L. Overproduction of single-stranded-DNA-binding protein specifically inhibits recombination of UV-irradiated bacteriophage DNA in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RecFOR proteins as well as the srf mutations in RecA protein overcome this inhibitory effect by SSB protein as described above. In vitro analyses of RecA, RecFOR, and SSB proteins revealed the mechanism of RecA loading onto ssDNA or gDNA. It was first reported that RecA protein assembles onto SSB-coated ssDNA more quickly in the presence of RecOR proteins compared with their absence (25Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Biochemical interaction of the Escherichia coli RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins with RecA protein and single-stranded DNA a binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the specific binding of RecFOR proteins to gDNA was reported (26Hegde S.P. Rajagopalan M. Madiraju M.V.V.S. Preferential binding of Escherichia coli RecF protein to gapped DNA in the presence of adenosine (γ-thio) triphosphate.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The RecFR complex was found to bind to the 3′-end of a ssDNA-dsDNA junction within gDNA to stop the growth of RecA protein beyond the junction (27Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B.

Finally, it was then discovered that RecFOR proteins recognize the 5′-end of a dsDNA-ssDNA junction flanking an ssDNA gap and nucleate formation of the RecA filament onto SSB-covered ssDNA (28Morimatsu K.

Elongation of the RecA nucleoprotein filament in 5′ to 3′ direction results in displacement of SSB protein and the subsequent pairing with homologous dsDNA (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C.

The genetic evidence suggests that the RecFOR proteins have the ability to target RecA protein onto gDNA in the presence of competing ssDNA, and also onto gDNA that forms when lagging strand synthesis is impeded: such gDNA will have an RNA primer at its 5′ terminus.

M13 gDNA and φX174 gDNA were prepared by annealing KAT-32 to M13mp7 ssDNA and KAT-74 to φX174 ssDNA, respectively, as described (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These gDNA were used as the M13- and φX174-gDNAs, unless otherwise indicated. The gDNA-100, -4100, -1500, and -2800 were made by annealing KAT-71, KAT-72, KAT-73, and KAT-74 to φX174 ssDNA, respectively. RNA-containing gDNAs were prepared by annealing the RNA-containing oligonucleotides to φX174 ssDNA. The 32P-M13 dsDNA and 32P-φX174 dsDNA (both 35 bp) were prepared by annealing 5′-32P-labeled KAT-33 to cold KAT-38 and 5′-32P-labeled KAT-71 to cold KAT-76, respectively. The 50-bp 32P-φX174 dsDNA was prepared by annealing 5′-32P-labeled φX-117F to cold φX-166R. Reactions were performed at 30 °C. Complexes of gDNA and/or ssDNA and SSB protein in 90 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase) were formed by incubating for 5 min. RecFOR proteins were incubated for 5 min in 10 μl of the same buffer solution and were then added to the SSB-DNA complex. The sample was further incubated for 10 min. During this incubation, 5 min after adding RecFOR proteins, 32P-labeled dsDNA was added. Finally, adding RecA protein to the mixture started the reaction. Unless otherwise indicated, the standard reaction contained 5 μm (nucleotide) gDNA/ssDNA (0.7 nm molecule for M13-based DNA; 0.9 nm molecule for φX174-based DNA), 1 nm (molecule) 32P-dsDNA, 3 μm SSB protein, 0.015 μm RecF protein, 0.1 μm RecO protein, 1 μm RecR protein, and 1.8 μm RecA protein in the final mixture (total volume of 100 μl; all protein concentrations are given in terms of monomer concentrations). When M13 gDNA/ssDNA and φX174 gDNA/ssDNA were used simultaneously, the concentrations of these DNAs were both 5 μm so that the sample contained a total of 10 μm gDNA/ssDNA. Aliquots (24 μl) were taken at the indicated time, mixed with 5 μl of stop solution (5% SDS and 250 mm EDTA), and kept on ice. After the reaction, all of the aliquots were treated by addition of 2 μl of 1 mg/ml proteinase K in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue), followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager with ImageQuaNT software (GE Healthcare). ATP hydrolysis was measured using reactions that couple ADP formation to NADH oxidation as described previously (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The concentration of NADH was measured by its absorption at 380 nm every 20 s. The ATP hydrolysis rate was determined from the change in absorption (i.e. ATP hydrolysis) over a 2-min interval. Unless otherwise indicated, the standard reaction contained 5 μm (nucleotide) gDNA (0.7 nm molecule), 3 μm SSB protein, 0.1 μm RecO protein, 1 μm RecR protein, and 1.8 μm RecA protein in the final reactions (total volume of 100 μl). The concentration of RecF protein is indicated in the figure legends. To determine the role of the RecFOR proteins in RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange, we developed the substrates shown in Fig. 1A. One substrate is gapped DNA made by annealing an oligonucleotide to either φX174 or M13 ssDNA. The second substrate is duplex DNA (35 bp) that is homologous to the ssDNA region of the gDNA substrate. The strand of dsDNA that is complementary to the ssDNA region is 32P-labeled so that DNA strand exchange results in transfer of the labeled strand to the larger gDNA. Because the dsDNA is short (35 bp), the branch migration step of DNA strand exchange is very fast. Therefore, the extent of DNA strand exchange reflects the amount of RecA protein on the gDNA. The gDNA is preincubated with SSB protein to prevent rapid assembly of RecA protein onto the gDNA. The RecFOR protein complex can accelerate the assembly of RecA protein onto the gDNA by binding to the ssDNA-dsDNA junction in the gDNA at the 5′-end (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the absence of a junction (i.e. with ordinary circular ssDNA), the RecFOR-facilitated loading of RecA protein does not occur efficiently (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To determine how efficiently RecFOR targets RecA onto gDNA versus ssDNA, when both the gDNA and ssDNA are present simultaneously, substrates based on either M13 ssDNA or φX174 ssDNA were used (Fig. 1B). The sizes of these DNA species are different so that each can discriminated using agarose gel electrophoresis. Therefore, one can determine whether the RecA nucleoprotein filament formation occurred on the ssDNA or the gDNA. Fig. 1C shows the results of DNA strand exchange with various combinations of gDNA and ssDNA in the presence of RecA, RecFOR, and SSB proteins. Aliquots at 0, 5, and 10 min were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to determine the initial kinetics, and a 90-min time point determined the yield at a late stage of the reaction (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In experimental sets 1–4, the assembly of RecA onto ssDNA and gDNA was examined. As reported previously (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), RecA protein was loaded by RecFOR proteins onto either M13 gDNA or φX174 gDNA (Fig. 1C, experimental sets 1 and 2) faster than onto ssDNA (sets 3 and 4). The products of DNA strand exchange appeared at 5 min with the gDNA (Fig. 1C, experimental sets 1 and 2), but only a negligible amount of product was found at early times with ssDNA (sets 3 and 4). When M13 gDNA and φX174 gDNA were both present simultaneously in a competition experiment, RecA protein was loaded equivalently onto either gDNA (Fig. 1C, experimental set 5). When the competition was between gDNA and ssDNA (Fig. 1C, experimental sets 6 and 7), RecA protein was more efficiently loaded onto the gDNA than onto ssDNA; RecA protein was targeted to M13 gDNA in experimental set 6 and to φX174 gDNA in set 7. These results demonstrate that when gDNA and ssDNA are present in a competitive experiment, RecFOR directs RecA protein onto gDNA in kinetic preference to ssDNA. To examine whether all the RecFOR proteins are required for this targeting of RecA protein to gDNA, each of the RecFOR proteins was omitted individually (Fig. 2A). When all of the RecFOR proteins were present, RecA protein was specifically loaded onto the gDNA (Fig. 2A, experimental sets 2 and 3), but when any one of the RecFOR proteins was absent, the specific loading of RecA protein onto gDNA was not observed (Fig. 2A, experimental sets 4–6). Instead, RecA was distributed equally between each DNA, and the gDNA substrate behaved as though it was a simple ssDNA substrate, as seen in Fig. 2A, experimental set 1. Thus, RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins are required to load RecA protein specifically onto gDNA when competing ssDNA is present. Previously, RecF protein was shown to interact with the ssDNA-dsDNA junction, but RecO and RecR proteins were not (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To determine the optimal amount of RecF protein required for targeting, the concentration of RecF protein was varied in the presence of both gDNA and ssDNA (Fig. 2B). A limiting concentration of RecA protein was used in these experiments to restrict RecA assembly onto the kinetically preferred substrate. In the absence of RecF protein, the final extents of DNA strand exchange were 19% for M13 ssDNA and 24% for φX174 gDNA (Fig. 2B). Note that the φX174 ssDNA is a slightly better substrate than M13 ssDNA (Fig. 2A, experimental set 1), probably due to the lower amount of secondary structure in φX174 ssDNA than in M13 ssDNA. When the concentration of RecF protein was increased, the final extent of DNA strand exchange with the φX174 gDNA increased and reached a plateau at around 15 nm; at the same time, DNA strand exchange with the M13 ssDNA decreased to nearly background levels because most of the RecA protein was loaded onto φX174 gDNA (Fig. 2B). The optimal concentration of RecF protein (15 nm) for RecA loading onto gDNA was the same as in our previous study (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We examined the length of time that is required to make a productive gDNA-RecFOR complex. For these experiments, we used the M13 gDNA and measured the appearance of the ATPase activity from RecA protein (Fig. 3A). Because the ATPase activity of the RecA protein is DNA-dependent, the observed ATP hydrolysis rate is proportional to the amount of RecA-DNA complex formed; the ATPase activity of RecF protein is negligible due to its low concentration and low kcat value (34Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. ATP hydrolysis and DNA binding by the Escherichia coli RecF protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15367-15374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows the efficiency of RecA loading onto M13 gDNA, followed by using the ATPase activity of RecA protein, as a function of the preincubation time of the RecFOR complex with gDNA. Two different RecF concentrations (1 and 5 nm) were used; the concentrations of RecO and RecR were in excess, at 100 and 1000 nm, respectively (28Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange. A universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 nm RecF protein, at least 20–30 min was required for maximum loading efficiency (Fig. 3B, circles); for 1 nm RecF protein, the RecA-loading efficiency increased continuously for 60 min (Fig. 3B, squares). In the presence of 5 nm RecF protein, the RecA-loading efficiency was saturated by 60 min of preincubation, so a 60-min preincubation time was used to examine the effect of RecF concentration on RecA loading (Fig. 3C). Two different M13 gDNA concentrations (0.35 and 0.7 nm molecule) were used for the RecF titrations. For both concentrations of gDNA, the binding is hyperbolic and could be fit to yield an apparent dissociation constant, Kd, of 1.6 (±0.3) and 1.5 (±0.4) nm, respectively (Fig. 3C). To test the ability of RecFOR complex to recognize gDNA in a mixture of ssDNA and gDNA, we varied the molar ratio of ssDNA and gDNA. The RecFOR-facilitated loading of RecA onto gDNA was measured by DNA strand exchange (Fig. 4A). In this experiment, φX174 gDNA and M13 ssDNA were used. The concentration of M13 ssDNA was fixed at 5000 nm (nucleotides) and the φX174 gDNA was varied from 5 to 500 nm. The concentration of RecA protein was also varied. In the presence of 500 nm φX174 gDNA, DNA strand exchange efficiently occurred both in the presence of excess (2000 nm) and limiting (200 nm) amounts of RecA protein (Fig. 4A, experimental set 1). When the concentration of φX174 gDNA was reduced to 50 nm, DNA strand exchange decreased (Fig. 4A, experimental set 2). Fig. 4B shows the percentage of gDNA converted to DNA strand exchange product; in the presence of 2000 nm RecA protein, nearly 100% of the gDNA was converted to product when its concentration was 500 nm. When the concentration of gDNA was reduced to 50 or 5 nm, the reaction efficiencies per gDNA were only slightly reduced (Fig. 4B). In the presence of 200 nm RecA protein and with as little as 5 nm gDNA, 75–80% of the gDNA was converted to DNA strand exchange product (Fig. 4B). Note that this DNA strand exchange is occurring with a substoichiometric amount of RecA protein relative to the ssDNA present; the 200 nm RecA protein cannot completely cover the 5000 nm competitor ssDNA. Thus, the RecFOR proteins can target RecA protein onto gDNA even in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of ssDNA. We also investigated the ability of RecFOR protein to function at limiting concentrations of RecA protein to determine the distance over which RecA protein can assemble into a filament capable of DNA strand exchange.

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) 2The abbreviations used are: NCLneuronal ceroid lipofuscinosisANCLadult-onset NCLCSPαcysteine-string protein αEGFPenhanced GFPSUSsplit-ubiquitin system. are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, with a hallmark accumulation of autofluorescent lipid- and protein-rich ceroid (lipofuscin) in neurons and other cell types (1Jalanko A. Braulke T. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). NCLs are classified as early infantile, late infantile, juvenile, and adult, depending upon the age of symptomatic onset. The genes affected in different NCLs have been characterized and encode predominantly lysosomal proteins (1Jalanko A. Braulke T. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses.Biochim. Biophys.

Symptoms of adult-onset NCL (ANCL) usually precipitate before the age of 40 and lead to a significant decrease in life expectancy.

The cysteine-string domain of CSPα plays a dual role in promoting stable membrane attachment (16Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H.

First, the overall hydrophobicity of this region may allow transient membrane interaction of the nonpalmitoylated protein, allowing it to connect with membrane-bound Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) palmitoyltransferases. Subsequent palmitoylation of the cysteine-string domain by specific DHHC proteins promotes stable membrane attachment, facilitating trafficking to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane. In addition, the cysteine-string domain may also be involved in homodimerization and multimerization of CSPα (18Swayne L.A. Blattler C. Kay J.G. Braun J.E. Oligomerization characteristics of cysteine string protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 300: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The role of the cysteine-string domain in membrane binding, palmitoylation, and multimerization of CSPα suggests that ΔL116 and L115R mutations may perturb any one of these parameters. However, to date, analysis of the effects of the mutations have mainly used in silico modeling. A Kyte-Doolittle algorithm revealed a decrease in hydrophobicity of the cysteine-string domain for the L115R mutant and a smaller nonsignificant decrease for the ΔL116 mutant (6Nosková L.

Exome-sequencing confirms DNAJC5 mutations as cause of adult neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e26741Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In silico analysis did not reveal a consistent effect of the mutations on protein aggregation; however, this analysis highlighted the high intrinsic tendency to form antiparallel β-sheets species of CSPα and the mutants (7Benitez B.A. Alvarado D. Cai Y. Mayo K. Chakraverty S. Norton J. Morris J.C. Sands M.S. Goate A. Cruchaga C. Exome-sequencing confirms DNAJC5 mutations as cause of adult neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e26741Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to these in silico analyses, some experimental data were presented by Nosková et al. (6Nosková L. Stránecký V. Hartmannová H. Přistoupilová A. Barešová V. Ivánek R. Hůlková H. Jahnová H. van der Zee J. Staropoli J.F. Sims K.B. Tyynelä J. Van Broeckhoven C. Nijssen P.C. Mole S.E. Elleder M. Kmoch S.

Genet. 2011; 89: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which suggested that the mutants were mislocalized and exhibited a very modest decrease in palmitoylation. Although potentially powerful, caution must be exercised when interpreting results of these in silico analyses for the following reasons: (i) the structure of the cysteine-string domain is not known, significantly weakening the reliability of nonexperimental measurements; (ii) aggregation propensity is not simply related to the amino acid sequence of CSPα but may also be dependent on the palmitoylation status of the protein and relative cytosol-membrane distribution; (iii) palmitoylation of CSPα is tightly linked with the intrinsic membrane affinity of the cysteine-string domain; (iv) palmitoylation prediction programs do not consider the properties of the individual DHHC proteins that modify CSPα. In short, the in silico analyses performed to date may not adequately (if at all) define how the L115R and ΔL116 mutations affect the cellular properties of CSPα and cause autosomal dominant ANCL. The human CSPα coding sequence lacking the initiating methionine and flanked by HindIII and BamHI restriction sites was synthesized by GeneArt (Invitrogen). Human CSPα contains an intrinsic HindIII restriction site, and this was removed by introducing a silent mutation (AAG→AAA). This CSPα sequence was inserted in-frame into the pEGFP-C2 vector. To generate myc-tagged constructs, bovine CSPα was excised from a myc-pcDNA3.1 construct (9Zhang H. Kelley W.L. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Cysteine-string proteins regulate exocytosis of insulin independent from transmembrane ion fluxes.FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using BamHI and EcoRI enzymes and replaced with the human CSPα coding sequences. HA-tagged DHHC constructs were a kind gift from Masaki Fukata (19Fukata M. Fukata Y. Adesnik H. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Identification of PSD-95 palmitoylating enzymes.Neuron. 2004; 44: 987-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The sequences of all plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Service, Dundee, UK). Rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing CSPα was purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). HSC70 antibody was from New England Biolabs (Herts, UK). GFP antibody (JL8) was from Clontech. Rabbit Myc and mouse actin antibodies were from Abcam. Rat HA antibody (used for immunoblotting) was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and mouse HA antibody (used for immunofluorescence) was from Covance (Paris, France). PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% (HEK293T) or 7.5% (PC12) CO2. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for all transfections at 2 μl/μg DNA. For confocal microscopy, PC12 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine glass coverslips and transfected with 0.5 μg of EGFP-CSPα plasmids and analyzed ∼40 h later. For biochemical analysis, PC12 cells growing on poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and analyzed ∼40 h after transfection. HEK293T cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of EGFP-CSP and 1.6 μg of the indicated HA-tagged DHHC constructs and analyzed ∼20 h later. Transfected cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde. For antibody staining, the cells were then permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 (in PBS with 0.3% BSA) and incubated successively with primary antibody (1:50) and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody (1:400; Invitrogen). The cells were then washed in PBS, air-dried, and mounted on glass slides in Mowiol. A Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope was used to view cellular fluorescence. Image stacks of PC12 cells were acquired at Nyquist sampling rates and deconvolved using Huygens software (Scientific Volume Imaging). Samples were diluted in SDS-dissociation buffer (final concentration 2% SDS, 25 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8) heated to 100 °C for 5 min and loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels. Transfected PC12 or HEK293T cells on 24-well plates were resuspended in a buffer containing 5 mm Hepes, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and with or without 1% Triton X-100. The cells were frozen at −80 °C, thawed, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Recovered supernatant and pellet fractions were made up to an equal volume in SDS-dissociation buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Lysates from human postmortem brain samples were prepared by homogenization (Dounce homogenizer) in ice-cold buffer composed of 20 mm Hepes, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH 7.4. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation 4000 × g for 10 min.

Cortical tissue from ANCL patients carrying the L115R mutation was obtained from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis ADRC. All tissue used was from anonymized patients, and ethical approval for the work was granted by the University of Strathclyde (reference UEC1112/46). Human brain lysates (100 μg of protein) were incubated overnight at room temperature in 0.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 7, or 0.5 m Tris, pH 7, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). EGFP-CSPα exhibited proteolysis following extended incubation times in hydroxylamine, and therefore cells expressing EGFP-tagged constructs were treated with 0.5 m Tris-HA for 2 h. Following treatment, the cell samples were diluted in SDS-dissociation buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Transfected HEK293T cells were washed in DMEM supplemented with 10 mg/ml defatted BSA and then incubated in the same medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h. Cells were then lysed in SDS-dissociation buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Duplicate nitrocellulose membranes with either processed for immunoblotting or used for detection of 3H signal with the aid of a Kodak Biomax Transcreen LE intensifier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gateway-compatible mouse DHHC17/DHHC3 and human CSPα cDNAs were produced by PCR and inserted using Gateway technology into pDONR207 and then into pMetYC-Dest (bait plasmid) and pNX32-Dest (prey plasmid) respectively. After transformation of THY.AP4 and THY.AP5 yeast strains with bait and prey plasmids, respectively, the two strains were mated. Growth of diploid cells was monitored after dropping of 5 μl of each yeast suspension (at A600 1 or 0.1) on synthetic defined medium plates (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate, 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, 20 g/liter glucose, 1.5 g/liter CSM-Ade,-His,-Trp,-Leu,-Ura,-Met drop-out mix, and 20 g/liter agar) and subsequent growth for 4 days at 30 °C (for interactions with DHHC17) or 7 days (for interactions with DHHC3). As a loading control and to verify matings, the same amounts were dropped onto plates with synthetic defined medium supplemented with adenine and histidine, and growth was monitored after 3 days at room temperature. Yeast transformations, mating, and sample preparation for Western blotting were performed as described in Ref. 21Grefen C. Obrdlik P. Harter K.

Densitometric quantification of immunoblots was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Statistical analyses was by a one-way ANOVA using the Analyze-It plugin for Microsoft Excel; a p value of <0.05 was taken to represent statistical significance. For quantification of aggregation, the density of aggregates was expressed as a ratio to monomeric forms of the protein (corresponding to the sum of the nonpalmitoylated and palmitoylated bands). A schematic diagram of the domain structure of CSPα is shown in Fig. 1A, highlighting the position of the residues (leucine 115 and leucine 116) that are mutated in ANCL. As a first step toward the identification of acquired biochemical properties of CSPα proteins containing the ΔL116 and L115R mutations, EGFP-tagged forms of these proteins were expressed in neuroendocrine PC12 cells and analyzed by confocal microscopy and SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Wild-type EGFP-CSPα associates with the plasma membrane and vesicles in PC12 cells (16Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. Dual role of the cysteine-string domain in membrane binding and palmitoylation-dependent sorting of the molecular chaperone cysteine-string protein.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4748-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, left). In contrast, both the ΔL116 and L115R mutants displayed a more dispersed and punctate localization and a reduced plasma membrane staining (Fig. 1B, middle and right). As intracellular targeting of CSPα is dependent upon multiple palmitoylation of the cysteine-string domain (16Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. Dual role of the cysteine-string domain in membrane binding and palmitoylation-dependent sorting of the molecular chaperone cysteine-string protein.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4748-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we next examined whether this modification was perturbed for the mutant proteins. The palmitoylation status of CSPα can be readily assessed by its migration profile on SDS gels, as the fully palmitoylated form of the protein migrates approximately 7 kDa heavier than the nonpalmitoylated protein (16Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. Dual role of the cysteine-string domain in membrane binding and palmitoylation-dependent sorting of the molecular chaperone cysteine-string protein.Mol. Biol.

The migration of palmitoylated (p) and nonpalmitoylated (np) bands of wild-type EGFP-CSPα expressed in PC12 cells is shown in Fig. 1C (note that we confirm that the upper band is palmitoylated in subsequent figures). Interestingly, for the ΔL116 and L115R mutants there was a clear absence of palmitoylated monomeric forms of the proteins (Fig. 1C), and the mutations induced the formation of SDS-resistant aggregates (Fig. 1C, quantified in the right panel). These aggregates migrated predominantly as two distinct higher molecular mass bands, with the upper band remaining in the stacking gel (Fig. 1C). To confirm that aggregation was not dependent on the EGFP tag, myc-tagged forms of the CSPα proteins were also examined, confirming the near absence of palmitoylated monomeric forms of the mutant proteins and formation of high molecular mass aggregates (Fig. 1D). In contrast to the L115R mutant, a CSPα(L115A) mutant exhibited the same migration profile on SDS gels as wild-type CSPα (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that the defects in the L115R and ΔL116 mutants likely arise due to a loss of overall hydrophobicity rather than a specific requirement for an intact dileucine motif. Finally, we examined whether the mutant aggregates were cytosolic or membrane-associated. For this, transfected PC12 cells were disrupted by freeze/thawing and fractionated into cytosol and membrane fractions by centrifugation. Immunoblotting for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and syntaxin 1A confirmed the successful separation of cytosolic and membrane proteins in supernatant and pellet fractions, respectively (Fig. 1F). The ΔL116 and L115R aggregates were enriched in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1F). To confirm that the aggregates are truly membrane-associated and not pelleting due to their large size, the fractionation protocol was also performed in the presence of Triton X-100 to solubilize bulk cellular membranes. Under these conditions, the majority of the mutant aggregates did not pellet, supporting the idea that they are predominantly membrane-associated in PC12 cells. The cysteine-string domain of CSPα, where the disease-causing mutations occur, has 14 cysteine residues in a span of 24 amino acids. One possibility to explain the observed aggregation of CSPα mutants is that the mutations prevent palmitoylation of the protein, and aggregation is caused by the presence of many unmodified cysteines. To examine this, we first tested whether the mutations blocked interaction with DHHC palmitoyltransferases. In mammalian cells at least 24 DHHC proteins are expressed (23Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. DHHC palmitoyl transferases: substrate interactions and (patho)physiology.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and CSPα can be palmitoylated by DHHC3, DHHC7, DHHC15, or DHHC17 (17Greaves J. Salaun C. Fukata Y. Fukata M. Chamberlain L.H. Palmitoylation and membrane interactions of the neuroprotective chaperone cysteine-string protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25014-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here, we focused on the interaction of CSPα with DHHC17 and DHHC3; knock-out of DHHC17 led to a complete loss of CSP palmitoylation in Drosophila (24Ohyama T. Verstreken P. Ly C.V. Rosenmund T. Rajan A. Tien A.C. Haueter C. Schulze K.L. Bellen H.J. Huntingtin-interacting protein 14, a palmitoyl transferase required for exocytosis and targeting of CSP to synaptic vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1481-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The split-ubiquitin system (SUS) was used to study the interaction between CSPα proteins and DHHC17/3 (21Grefen C. Obrdlik P. Harter K. The determination of protein-protein interactions by the mating-based split-ubiquitin system (mbSUS).Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 479: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This assay depends on the release of LexA-VP16 transactivator following reassembly of N- and C-terminal halves of ubiquitin, which are fused to the interacting proteins of interest. Reassembled ubiquitin is cleaved by ubiquitin-specific proteases, leading to the release of LexA-VP16. Nuclear translocation of LexA-VP16 allows yeast cells to grow on media lacking adenine and histidine. No major difference was detected in the ability of wild-type CSPα or the ΔL116 and L115R mutants to interact with DHHC17 in the SUS (Fig. 2). In contrast, a CSPα mutant truncated before the cysteine-string domain (amino acids 1–112) displayed a greatly reduced interaction with DHHC17 under stringent conditions (with 200 μm methionine), confirm"
https://openalex.org/W2013671885,"Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is the major pathway involved in the removal of UV-induced photolesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Two Cockayne syndrome (CS) complementation group proteins, CSA and CSB, are important for TCR repair. The molecular mechanisms by which CS proteins regulate TCR remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of KIAA1530, an evolutionarily conserved protein that participates in this pathway through its interaction with CSA and the TFIIH complex. We found that UV irradiation led to the recruitment of KIAA1530 onto chromatin in a CSA-dependent manner. Cells lacking KIAA1530 were highly sensitive to UV irradiation and displayed deficiency in TCR. In addition, KIAA1530 depletion abrogated stability of the CSB protein following UV irradiation. More excitingly, we found that a unique CSA mutant (W361C), which was previously identified in a patient with UV(s)S syndrome, showed defective KIAA1530 binding and resulted in a failure of recruiting KIAA1530 and stabilizing CSB after UV treatment. Together, our data not only reveal that KIAA1530 is an important player in TCR but also lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying UV(s)S syndrome."

However, the functions of the latter noncanonical proteins in base excision repair are unclear. Here we elucidated the role of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-U (hnRNP-U), identified in the immunoprecipitate of human NEIL1, a major DNA glycosylase responsible for oxidized base repair. hnRNP-U directly interacts with NEIL1 in vitro via the NEIL1 common interacting C-terminal domain, which is dispensable for its enzymatic activity. Their in-cell association increases after oxidative stress. hnRNP-U stimulates the NEIL1 in vitro base excision activity for 5-hydroxyuracil in duplex, bubble, forked, or single-stranded DNA substrate, primarily by enhancing product release. Using eluates from FLAG-NEIL1 immunoprecipitates from human cells, we observed 3-fold enhancement in complete repair activity after oxidant treatment. The lack of such enhancement in hnRNP-U-depleted cells suggests its involvement in repairing enhanced base damage after oxidative stress.

If left unrepaired, most of these lesions are mutagenic and/or cytotoxic and are repaired via the evolutionarily conserved base excision/single-strand break repair (BER/SSBR) pathway. Repair of oxidized bases in the mammalian genome is initiated with their excision by one of five DNA glycosylases (DGs): OGG1, NTH1, and NEIL 1–3 (10Hegde M.L. Hazra T.K. Mitra S.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Oxidized base-specific DGs have intrinsic AP lyase activity, as a result of which the AP site produced after damaged base excision is cleaved via β or βδ elimination to generate 3′-phospho α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and 3′-phosphate, respectively (10Hegde M.L. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Early steps in the DNA base excision/single-strand interruption repair pathway in mammalian cells.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). NEIL1 and -2 belonging to the Nei family of DGs are distinct from OGG1/NTH1 in the Nth family because of their βδ-lyase activity and ability to excise base lesions from single-stranded DNA substrate in vitro (12Wiederhold L.

As we had shown earlier, the 3′-phosphate terminus generated by NEIL1 and -2 is removed by polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase in the second step of BER, whereas the 3′-phospho α,β-unsaturated aldehyde phosphate produced by OGG1/NTH1 is removed by AP-endonuclease (APE1) (12Wiederhold L.

For example, NEIL2 interacts functionally with Y-box-binding protein (YB-1), and also with RNA binding activity (17Prasad R. Liu Y. Deterding L.J. Poltoratsky V.P. Kedar P.S. Horton J.K. Kanno S.

We previously characterized the involvement of NEIL2 in the preferential repair of transcribed genes, where NEIL2 interacts functionally with both RNA polymerase II and hnRNP-U (19Banerjee D.

Unlike NEIL2, NEIL1 is up-regulated during the S-phase and interacts functionally with DNA replication proteins, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication protein A (RPA), FEN-1, and Werner helicase (WRN), etc. Based on these results, we have proposed that NEIL1 is preferentially involved in replication-coordinated BER (20Das A.

Because of the differential functions and mechanisms of NEIL1 versus NEIL2, we decided to investigate the specific role of hnRNP-U in NEIL1-mediated repair. In addition to its role in mRNA processing and transport, hnRNP-U has some unique functions, as also observed for other members of the hnRNP family (24Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G.

With a molecular mass of 90 kDa, it is the largest member of the abundant hnRNP family (24Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. Primary structure and binding activity of the hnRNP U protein: binding RNA through RGG box.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hnRNP-U was also found to be associated with WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) protein and suggested to be a potential Wilms tumor gene (27Spraggon L. Dudnakova T. Slight J. Lustig-Yariv O.

Miles C. hnRNP-U directly interacts with WT1 and modulates WT1 transcriptional activation.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1484-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). hnRNP-U interacts with MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of p53, a central player in DNA damage response and also in DNA repair (28Davis M. Hatzubai A. Andersen J.S. Ben-Shushan E. Fisher G.Z. Yaron A. Bauskin A. Mercurio F. Mann M. Ben-Neriah Y. Pseudosubstrate regulation of the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase by hnRNP-U.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The hnRNP-U interaction with some proteins may be regulated via its phosphorylation by DNA-protein kinase, which is activated by double-strand breaks in the genome (29Britton S. Froment C. Frit P.

In this study, we have documented the physical and functional interaction of NEIL1 with hnRNP-U, which enhances cell survival after oxidative stress by increasing NEIL1-mediated oxidized base repair. A 51-mer oligonucleotide containing 5-OHU, a major oxidative deamination product of C in DNA, at position 26 from the 5′-end, the complementary oligonucleotide containing G opposite the lesion (Sigma), was used for generating duplex oligonucleotides and partial duplexes containing a bubble or fork structure (supplemental Table S1). To produce 5′-32P-labeled substrates, the single-stranded (ss) oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase prior to annealing. The labeled substrates were separated from unincorporated radioactivity by chromatography on Sephadex G25. The pUC19CPD plasmid substrate containing a single 5-OHU for complete repair assay was generated as described previously (31Hegde M.L. Hegde P.M. Holthauzen L.M. Hazra T.K. Rao K.S. Mitra S.

His-tagged WT human hnRNP-U (the plasmid was a kind gift from Gourisankar Ghosh, University of California, San Diego) was expressed in BL-21 Codon-Plus E. coli (Stratagene) and purified from the bacterial extract by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). It was further purified to homogeneity by elution from Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using 100–750 mm NaCl gradient. The most purified fraction was eluted at 400 mm NaCl and stored after dialysis in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 450 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The hnRNP-U domains containing 1–100, 1–188, 1–235, 236–645, and 646–808 residues were cloned for GST fusion between the BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites in the pGEX-2T E. coli expression plasmid. The GST-tagged polypeptides were also expressed in E. coli, purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare), and then eluted using 20 mm reduced glutathione. The GST fusion peptides were dialyzed and further purified by cation exchange chromatography. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine, at 37 °C, 5% CO2, using reagents from Invitrogen. For co-IP experiments, we generated stable transfectants of HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-NEIL1 or empty-FLAG as follows.

After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and plated in fresh medium containing Zeocin (100 μg/ml) to select clones carrying stably integrated plasmid DNA. After 10 days, Zeocin-resistant clones were individually expanded and screened for expression of FLAG-NEIL1; only the clones with ectopic NEIL1 expression comparable with that of endogenous NEIL1 were used in this study. For IP analysis, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) at 48 h after transfection.

The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and the FLAG immunocomplex was eluted from the beads by adding SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. To analyze the cell cycle dependence of the NEIL1 interaction with hnRNP-U, HEK293 cells were synchronized by double thymidine block (36Whitfield M.L. Sherlock G. Saldanha A.J. Murray J.I. Ball C.A.

Briefly, at ∼30% confluency, the cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine in DMEM for 18 h and then transferred to fresh DMEM for 6 h. This was followed by a second thymidine treatment for 17 h. The cells were finally washed twice with PBS, allowed to grow in DMEM, and harvested at 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 h. The cells were fixed in 70% prechilled (−20 °C) ethanol, stained with the staining solution (containing 100 μg/ml RNase A, 40 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS), and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Briefly, the GST fusion hnRNP-U polypeptides (20 pmol) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl) and then mixed with full-length NEIL1 or its deletion polypeptides (10 pmol) in 0.5 ml of TBS buffer and incubated with constant rocking for 4 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting analysis. The proteins (40 pmol) transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane after SDS-PAGE were denatured in situ with 6 m guanidine-HCl and renatured by successive incubation with serially diluted guanidine-HCl in PBS + 1 mm DTT (23Theriot C.A.

The kinase activity of HPK1 is regulated by several mechanisms. During TCR signaling, HPK1 is activated by its Tyr-379 phosphorylation-mediated interaction with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 (17Sauer K.

In addition, protein phosphatase 4 positively regulates HPK1 kinase activation via inhibiting HPK1 ubiquitination and degradation during TCR signaling (21Zhou G. Boomer J.S. Tan T.H.

During cell apoptosis, HPK1 is cleaved by caspase-3 at DDVD (amino acids 382–385), and the resulting N-terminal kinase domain fragment shows enhanced kinase activity (22Chen Y.R. Meyer C.F. Ahmed B.

HPK1-deficient mice show enhanced T cell activation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, indicating a negative role of HPK1 in controlling TCR signaling (3Shui J.W. Boomer J.S. Han J. Xu J.

The negative role of HPK1 is mediated by induction of serine phosphorylation of SLP-76 and subsequent SLP-76/14-3-3 interaction (3Shui J.W. Boomer J.S. Han J. Xu J. Dement G.A. Zhou G. Tan T.H.

To date, the underlying mechanism for attenuation of SLP-76 function by Ser-376 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding remains unknown. Here, we show that TCR signaling induces SLP-76 ubiquitination, which targets phosphorylated SLP-76 for proteasomal degradation. SLP-76 ubiquitination is mediated by HPK1-induced Ser-376 phosphorylation. We further identify Lys-30 as an SLP-76 ubiquitination site; loss of Lys-30 ubiquitination of SLP-76 stabilizes phosphorylated SLP-76 and subsequently enhances ERK activation during TCR signaling. C57BL/6 (B6) WT and HPK1-deficient mice were bred in a specific pathogen-free environment in the Transgenic Mouse Facility at Baylor College of Medicine. All animal experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines and regulations. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated Ser-376 of an SLP-76 peptide (CFPQSApS376LPPY) were generated and purified by Eurogentec Inc. Anti-phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), anti-phospho-IKKα (Ser-180)/IKKβ (Ser-181), anti-ERK, anti-p38, anti-IKKβ, anti-HA (6E2), and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) were from Cell Signaling. Anti-SLP-76, anti-HPK1 (N-19), anti-JNK1 (F-3), and anti-GST (B-14) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody was from Sigma Aldrich. Anti-human 14-3-3 (θ/τ) monoclonal antibody was from BIOSOURCE. A monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes polyubiquitin chains joined through Lys-48 (anti-ubiquitin, Lys-48-specific; clone Apu2) has been described previously and was purchased from Millipore (24Newton K.

Human T cell lines (Jurkat, Jurkat TAg, and SLP-76-deficient J14 cells) were stimulated by 5 μg/ml anti-human CD3 (OKT3) antibody. Murine splenic T cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml biotin-labeled anti-CD3ζ (145-2c11) antibody, followed by TCR cross-linking using 20 μg/ml streptavidin. The stimulation was immediately stopped by cold spin, and the cells were lysed using lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. FLAG-SLP-76 plasmid was provided by G. A. Koretzky (University of Pennsylvania). Human SLP-76 tagged with two copies of FLAG at the N terminus was subcloned into the pIRES2-AcGFP1 vector (Clontech). SLP-76 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of serine-to-alanine or lysine-to-arginine. All SLP-76 mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Jurkat TAg and J14 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS and transfected using the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) with a setting of 1400 V, 30 ms, and one pulse. These assays were performed as described in our previous publication (3Shui J.W. Boomer J.S. Han J. Xu J. Dement G.A. Zhou G. Tan T.H. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling and T cell-mediated immune responses.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GST-14-3-3 isoform plasmids were provided by C. Walker (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center), W.-C. Lin (University of Alabama at Birmingham), and Y. Gotoh (University of Tokyo). For GST pulldown assay, GST-14-3-3 recombinant proteins were incubated with 400–800 μg of cell lysates at 4 °C for 2 h and then immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 45 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer and then boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer for 5 min. For co-immunoprecipitation, 2–5 μg of antibody and 400–600 μg of cell lysates were mixed and rotated on a rocker at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by the addition of 30 μl of Protein A/G Plus-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with cell lysis buffer and boiled in 20 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF filter, and subjected to Western blot analyses for the detection of the molecules of interest. To determine SLP-76 ubiquitination, HEK293T or Jurkat TAg cells were transfected with FLAG-SLP-76 and HA-ubiquitin. The cells were pretreated with MG132 for 0–4 h. Jurkat TAg cells were further stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody. The cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody (first immunoprecipitation). Two-thirds of the anti-FLAG immunocomplex was boiled in the presence of 1% SDS, diluted 10-fold to reduce SDS concentration, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (second immunoprecipitation). The ubiquitination of SLP-76 was determined by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Murine splenic T cells and the transfected J14 cells were stimulated with 10 and 5 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody, respectively, for 15 min. The cells were then treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0–120 min. The cell lysates were collected, and the levels of the proteins of interest were analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometry analysis of the Western blot results was performed using Gel-Pro software (Media Cybernetics). Simple linear regression for the relative actin-normalized SLP-76 (phosphorylated or total) protein band intensity versus time was employed to determine the degradation kinetics of SLP-76 (phosphorylated or total) proteins. According to the linear regression analysis, a y-value of 0.5 (indicating 50% relative expression) maps to the time corresponding to the protein half-life. LC-MS/MS was performed at the Core Facilities for Proteomics Research (Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-SLP-76 and HA-ubiquitin and then incubated with 25 μm MG132 for 3 h. FLAG-SLP-76 proteins were isolated from the transfected HEK293T cells using anti-FLAG antibody-agarose gel and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by sliver staining. Specific protein bands from silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels were excised, destained, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptide mixtures were loaded onto a nanoACQUITY UPLC BEH130 column (75 μm × 250 mm) packed with C18 resin (Waters) and separated using a segmented gradient, followed by LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Thermo Scientific). All MS and MS/MS raw data were processed by Raw2MSM and searched against a target protein sequence database using the Mascot Daemon 2.2 server. Previously, we identified that HPK1 induces SLP-76/14-3-3τ binding in T cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation (3Shui J.W. Boomer J.S. Han J. Xu J. Dement G.A. Zhou G. Tan T.H. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling and T cell-mediated immune responses.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SLP-76 also binds to 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ϵ in an HPK1-dependent manner during TCR signaling (23Di Bartolo V. Montagne B. Salek M. Jungwirth B. Carrette F. Fourtane J. Sol-Foulon N. Michel F. Schwartz O. Lehmann W.D. Acuto O. A novel pathway down-modulating T cell activation involves HPK1-dependent recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins on SLP-76.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There are four additional isoforms of mammalian 14-3-3 proteins ( γ, σ, η, and β) that are also expressed in T cells. The relative binding of SLP-76 to other 14-3-3 isoforms remains unclear. As shown in Fig. 1A, SLP-76 interacted with all seven isoforms of 14-3-3 in the presence of HPK1, with the relative binding order of γ > η > ϵ > β > τ and ζ > δ. To identify the 14-3-3-binding site on SLP-76, we mutated the potential 14-3-3-binding motifs (RSXp(S/T)XP and RX(Y/F)Xp(S/T)XP, where p(S/T) represents phosphorylated serine/threonine and X represents any amino acid) on SLP-76. Only the S376A mutation abolished HPK1-dependent SLP-76/14-3-3 interaction (Fig. 1B); this result was consistent with a previous report (23Di Bartolo V. Montagne B. Salek M. Jungwirth B. Carrette F. Fourtane J. Sol-Foulon N. Michel F. Schwartz O. Lehmann W.D. Acuto O. A novel pathway down-modulating T cell activation involves HPK1-dependent recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins on SLP-76.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HPK1-induced SLP-76 Ser-376 phosphorylation in murine primary T cells has never been demonstrated. We generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-Ser-376 of SLP-76. As shown in Fig. 1C, this antibody detected only phosphorylated WT SLP-76, but not the S376A mutant, in HEK293T cells cotransfected with HPK1, demonstrating the specificity of this phospho-specific antibody. We thus used this anti-phospho-Ser-376 antibody to study SLP-76 phosphorylation in murine splenic T cells. SLP-76 Ser-376 phosphorylation was indeed detected in WT cells, but not in HPK1-deficient splenic T cells, upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 1D). HPK1-deficient T cells showed enhanced ERK activation (Fig. 1D) as described previously (3Shui J.W. Boomer J.S. Han J. Xu J. Dement G.A. Zhou G. Tan T.H. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling and T cell-mediated immune responses.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An important question remaining to be addressed is how SLP-76 Ser-376 phosphorylation and subsequent 14-3-3 binding attenuate TCR signaling. Binding of 14-3-3 can induce ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of its binding proteins, such as MDMX (25LeBron C. Chen L. Gilkes D.M. Chen J. Regulation of MDMX nuclear import and degradation by Chk2 and 14-3-3.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1196-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the possibility that 14-3-3 binding may induce SLP-76 ubiquitination. As SLP-76 ubiquitination has not been reported previously, we first studied whether SLP-76 can be ubiquitinated. Anti-SLP-76 immunocomplex contained ubiquitinated species in HEK293T cells that overexpressed FLAG-SLP-76 and HA-ubiquitin in the presence of MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor (Fig. 2A, left panel). Furthermore, sequential immunoprecipitation of denatured anti-SLP-76 immunocomplex still showed ubiquitinated SLP-76, which was detected by both anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 2A, right panel). These data indicate that SLP-76 itself can be ubiquitinated. Next, we studied whether SLP-76 is ubiquitinated in T cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation. Jurkat T cells were transfected with FLAG-SLP-76 and HA-ubiquitin, followed by MG132 treatment and anti-CD3 stimulation. To remove the ubiquitination signals from SLP-76-associated proteins, sequential immunoprecipitation of SLP-76 was performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, SLP-76 ubiquitination was induced in Jurkat T cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation and was further enhanced by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, suggesting that ubiquitinated SLP-76 is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, ubiquitination of endogenous SLP-76 isolated from Jurkat T cells and murine primary T cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation and MG132 treatment was also detectible using the antibody recognizing ubiquitin linked at Lys-48 (Fig. 2, C and D). To further verify the effect of ubiquitination on SLP-76 protein levels, Jurkat T cells were pretreated with MG132, followed by anti-CD3 stimulation. Interestingly, the levels of Ser-376-phosphorylated and Tyr-145-phosphorylated SLP-76 proteins were increased by MG132 treatment in Jurkat T cells, whereas the increase in SLP-76 levels was less discernible upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in murine primary T cells as well (Fig. 3B), suggesting that ubiquitination specifically targets phosphorylated SLP-76 for proteasomal degradation. To further confirm the degradation of SLP-76 during TCR signaling, we stimulated primary T cells with anti-CD3 antibody for 15 min, followed by cycloheximide treatment in a time course and Western blotting of the cell lysates for measuring the half-life of the total and phosphorylated SLP-76 proteins. The levels of both SLP-76 and Ser-376-phosphorylated SLP-76 proteins were decreased with time, whereas Ser-376-phosphorylated SLP-76 showed a shorter half-life (66 versus 133 min) (Fig. 3C). These data further support that Ser-376-phosphorylated SLP-76 is targeted for degradation.FIGURE 3SLP-76 is targeted for proteasomal degradation in TCR signaling. A and B, MG132 increases the levels of SLP-76 phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells and murine primary T cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation. Human Jurkat T cells (A) and murine splenic T cells (B) were pretreated with MG132 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 4 h and then stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody for the indicated time periods. The levels of phosphorylated and total SLP-76 proteins were detected by Western blotting. The relative phosphorylation levels were determined by densitometry analysis. C, left panel, measurement of SLP-76 degradation by cycloheximide chase assay. Murine splenic T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody for 15 min and then treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 0–120 min. The cell lysates were collected, and the levels of the indicated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Right panel, simple linear regression analysis of the relative SLP-76 (Ser-376-phosphorylated and total) protein levels in the left panel at different times of cycloheximide treatment. The relative SLP-76 protein levels were quantified and normalized to β-actin protein levels. The equation of the protein degradation rate for SLP-76 in primary T cells is as follows: Y = −0.003412*X + 0.9529 (R2 = 0.4505, p = 0.0169). The equation of the protein degradation rate for Ser-376-phosphorylated SLP-76 in primary T cells is as follows: Y = −0.007396*X + 0.9881 (R2 = 0.7361, p = 0.0004).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Ser-376 phosphorylation regulates SLP-76 ubiquitination, we transfected FLAG-SLP-76 (WT or S376A mutant) into Jurkat T cells, followed by MG132 treatment and anti-CD3 stimulation. WT SLP-76, but not the S376A mutant, showed significant Lys-48-linked ubiquitination upon anti-CD3 stimulation and MG132 treatment (Fig. 4A). Similarly, endogenous SLP-76 was significantly ubiquitinated in WT splenic T cells, but not in HPK1-deficient T cells, upon anti-CD3 stimulation in the presence of MG132 treatment (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that HPK1-induced Ser-376 phosphorylation mediates Lys-48-linked ubiquitination of SLP-76 during TCR signaling. A direct interaction between 14-3-3 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl is induced in human Jurkat T cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation (26Liu Y.C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. Activation-modulated association of 14-3-3 proteins with Cbl in T cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). c-Cbl negatively regulates TCR signaling in thymocytes (27Naramura M. Kole H.K. Hu R.J. Gu H. Altered thymic positive selection and intracellular signals in Cbl-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15547-15552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored the possibility that Ser-376 phosphorylation-mediated 14-3-3 binding may recruit the E3 ligase c-Cbl, which may induce SLP-76 ubiquitination. Although anti-CD3 antibody induced the interaction of SLP-76 with c-Cbl, this interaction was unaffected in HPK1-deficient T cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that an E3 ligase other than c-Cbl is responsible for HPK1-mediated SLP-76 ubiquitination in T cells. Nonetheless, the search for the elusive E3 ligase for SLP-76 ubiquitination is not the focus of this study. To characterize the function of SLP-76 ubiquitination, we sought to identify SLP-76 ubiquitination site(s) using mass spectrometry. Lys-30 was identified as a ubiquitination site of SLP-76 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5A). To verify the identified SLP-76 ubiquitination site, we generated an SLP-76 mutant by the substitution of lysine with arginine at amino acid 30. Ubiquitination was undetectable in the FLAG-tagged SLP-76 K30R mutant coexpressed with HA-ubiquitin in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5B). To further verify that Lys-30 is a physiological SLP-76 ubiquitination site induced by TCR signaling, we transfected WT SLP-76 and the K30R mutant into Jurkat T cells, followed by anti-CD3 stimulation and MG132 treatment. WT SLP-76 showed significant ubiquitination in anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated Jurkat T cells, whereas the K30R mutant showed dramatically diminished ubiquitination (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that Lys-30 ubiquitination of SLP-76 is induced in T cells upon TCR signaling. To further study whether loss of Lys-30 ubiquitination renders resistance of SLP-76 to protein degradation, we measured the half-life of the SLP-76 K30R mutant by transfecting WT SLP-76 and the K30R mutant into SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells (J14 line), followed by anti-CD3 stimulation for 15 min and cycloheximide chase assay. Compared with WT SLP-76, the half-life of the Ser-376-phosphorylated SLP-76 K30R mutant was much longer (290 versus 98 min) (Fig. 5, D and E). Consistently, the total SLP-76 K30R mutant protein levels were also increased compared with WT SLP-76 (Fig. 5, D and E). Next, we studied the effect of SLP-76 Lys-30 ubiquitination on TCR signaling in the J14 line, which displays defective TCR signaling (28Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Uncoupling of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases from PLCγ1 in an SLP-76-deficient T cell.Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Despite equal transfection efficiency (85.9 versus 86.9%) of WT SLP-76 and the K30R mutant in J14 cells, the protein level of the K30R mutant was slightly higher than that of WT SLP-76 (Fig. 6A), which could be due to the resistance of the K30R mutant to protein degradation. SLP-76 phosphorylation at Ser-376 and Tyr-145 was increased and more sustained in the transfected J14 cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 6, B and C), indicating that loss of ubiquitination stabilizes activated SLP-76. Moreover, the activation of SLP-76 downstream signaling molecules, ERK and JNK, was significantly enhanced in SLP-76 K30R mutant-transfected J14 cells compared with WT SLP-76-transfected J14 cells (Fig. 6, B, C, and D). These data indicate that a loss of SLP-76 ubiquitination enhances the activation of SLP-76 and SLP-76-mediated T cell activation. As a central organizer of TCR signaling, SLP-76 is required for TCR signal transduction, leading to T cell development and activation. The activity of SLP-76 depends on its characteristic domains and phosphorylated residues, which bind to different signaling molecules. We and another research group (23Di Bartolo V. Montagne B. Salek M. Jungwirth B. Carrette F. Fourtane J. Sol-Foulon N. Michel F. Schwartz O. Lehmann W.D. Acuto O. A novel pathway down-modulating T cell activation involves HPK1-dependent recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins on SLP-76.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have identified Ser-376 as an HPK1-induced SLP-76 phosphorylation site that directly binds to 14-3-3. Here, we have further shown that Ser-376 phosphorylation induces SLP-76 Lys-30 ubiquitination, which targets activated (phosphorylated) SLP-76 for proteasomal degradation and therefore attenuates SLP-76-mediated TCR signaling. In this study, we have shown for the first time that SLP-76 is regulated by ubiquitination. Anti-ubiquitin antibody detected ubiquitinated proteins from sequential anti-SLP-76 immunocomplexes in HEK293T cells and anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated Jurkat T cells, indicating that SLP-76 itself, but not its associated proteins, is ubiquitinated during TCR signaling. MG132 stabilized only the phosphorylated form of SLP-76, but not total SLP-76, suggesting that ubiquitination targets Ser-376-phosphorylated SLP-76, which is only a small population of SLP-76 proteins. This could explain why SLP-76 ubiquitination has never been reported. As Ser-376 phosphorylation attenuates tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (3Shui J.W. Boomer J.S. Han J. Xu J. Dement G.A. Zhou G.

Med. 2007; 204: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is expected that blocking of Ser-376-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of SLP-76 in MG132-treated T cells would also increase Tyr-145-phosphorylated SLP-76. Furthermore, Lys-30 was identified as an SLP-76 ubiquitin site in HEK293T cells by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis using anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated SLP-76-transfected Jurkat T cells did not reveal Lys-30 or any other lysine residues as an SLP-76 ubiquitination site (data not shown), as the fraction of SLP-76 that is ubiquitinated in T cells is low. Nevertheless, mutations of a particular lysine to arginine that block ubiquitination provide an alternative approach to identify a ubiquitination site. In our study, the SLP-76 K30R mutant displayed dramatically reduced ubiquitination in both HEK293T cells and TCR-stimulated Jurkat T cells. This effect is unlikely due to the conformational change in the SLP-76 K30R mutant because it could still be phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation. Loss of SLP-76 Lys-30 ubiquitination in the K30R mutant resulted in resistance of phosphorylated SLP-76 to ubiquitin-mediate proteasomal degradation; thus, the SLP-76 K30R mutant displayed an increase in its phosphorylation levels. The enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 led to enhanced downstream signaling, including ERK and JNK activation. Thus, our data indicate that Lys-30 is a TCR-induced SLP-76 ubiquitination site that targets activated SLP-76 for proteasomal degradation and attenuates TCR signaling. It is notable that SLP-76 from HPK1-deficient T cells, SLP-76 S376A from transfected Jurkat T cells, and SLP-76 K30R from transfected Jurkat T cells showed some residual ubiquitination (Fig. 4, A and B, and Fig. 5C). These results suggest that SLP-76 ubiquitination may be also regulated by a mechanism independent of HPK1-induced Ser-376 phosphorylation. GLK/MAP4K3 is an HPK1-related Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase (10Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway by a novel protein kinase related to human germinal center kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similar to HPK1, GLK also directly interacts with SLP-76, which in turn activates GLK (29Chuang H.C. Lan J.L. Chen D.Y. Yang C.Y. Chen Y.M. Li J.P. Huang C.Y. Liu P.E. Wang X. Tan T.H. The kinase GLK controls autoimmunity and NF-κB signaling by activating the kinase PKCθ in T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although, GLK does not phosphorylate SLP-76 at Ser-376 (29Chuang H.C. Lan J.L. Chen D.Y. Yang C.Y. Chen Y.M. Li J.P. Huang C.Y. Liu P.E. Wang X. Tan T.H. The kinase GLK controls autoimmunity and NF-κB signaling by activating the kinase PKCθ in T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it remains possible that GLK may feedback phosphorylate SLP-76 on the other serine/threonine residues. Whether GLK plays a redundant role in the regulation of SLP-76 ubiquitination will be interesting to study. Finally, other SLP-76 family adaptor proteins, including BLNK and CLNK, also interact with and activate HPK1. In fact, we note that HPK1 feedback induces BLNK phosphorylation and ubiquitination in B cells during B cell receptor signaling (30Wang X. Li J.P. Kuo H.K. Chiu L.L. Dement G.A. Lan J.L. Chen D.Y. Yang C.Y. Hu H. Tan T.H.

A future study of the potential regulation of CLNK activation by HPK1-induced phosphorylation may lead to interesting findings. Taken together, our results demonstrate a negative feedback mechanism of SLP-76 regulation by ubiquitination, which is induced by HPK1-induced Ser-376 phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Future generation of knock-in mice expressing the SLP-76 K30R or S376A mutant will reveal the in vivo role of SLP-76 ubiquitination or Ser-376 phosphorylation in T cell-mediated immune responses and autoimmunity. This study also indicates a new direction to study the roles of other MAP4Ks in T cells and to study the regulation of other SLP-76 family adaptors by HPK1 and other MAP4Ks."

We detected zinc-dependent binding of a zinc-induced protein to a specific sequence, the zinc transcriptional regulatory element (ZTRE), in the SLC30A5 (zinc transporter ZnT5) promoter and showed that substitution of the ZTRE abrogated the repression of a reporter gene in response to zinc. We identified the ZTRE in other genes, including (through an unbiased search) the CBWD genes and (through targeted analysis) in multiple members of the SLC30 family, including SLC30A10, which is repressed by zinc. The function of the CBWD genes is currently unknown, but roles for homologs in metal homeostasis are being uncovered in bacteria. We demonstrated that CBWD genes are repressed by zinc and that substitution of the ZTRE in SLC30A10 and CBWD promoter-reporter constructs abrogates this response. Other metals did not affect expression of the transcriptional regulator, binding to the ZTRE or promoter-driven reporter gene expression. These findings provide the basis for elucidating how regulation of a network of genes through this novel mechanism contributes to zinc homeostasis and how the cell orchestrates this response.

https://openalex.org/W1970592904,"Ring-shaped clamp proteins encircle DNA and affect the work of many proteins, notably processive replication by DNA polymerases. Crystal structures of clamps show several cationic residues inside the ring, and in a co-crystal of Escherichia coli β clamp-DNA, they directly contact the tilted duplex passing through (Georgescu, R. E., Kim, S. S., Yurieva, O., Kuriyan, J., Kong, X. P., and O'Donnell, M. (2008) Structure of a sliding clamp on DNA. Cell 132, 43-54). To investigate the role of these contacts in reactions involving circular clamps, we examined single arginine/lysine mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in replication factor C (RFC)-catalyzed loading of the clamp onto primer template DNA (ptDNA). Previous kinetic analysis has shown that ptDNA entry inside an ATP-activated RFC-PCNA complex accelerates clamp opening and ATP hydrolysis, which is followed by slow PCNA closure around DNA and product dissociation. Here we directly measured multiple steps in the reaction (PCNA opening, ptDNA binding, PCNA closure, phosphate release, and complex dissociation) to determine whether mutation of PCNA residues Arg-14, Lys-20, Arg-80, Lys-146, Arg-149, or Lys-217 to alanine affects the reaction mechanism. Contrary to earlier steady state analysis of these mutants (McNally, R., Bowman, G. D., Goedken, E. R., O'Donnell, M., and Kuriyan, J. (2010) Analysis of the role of PCNA-DNA contacts during clamp loading. BMC Struct. Biol. 10, 3), our pre-steady state data show that loss of single cationic residues can alter the rates of all DNA-linked steps in the reaction, as well as movement of PCNA on DNA. These results explain an earlier finding that individual arginines and lysines inside human PCNA are essential for polymerase δ processivity (Fukuda, K., Morioka, H., Imajou, S., Ikeda, S., Ohtsuka, E., and Tsurimoto, T. (1995) Structure-function relationship of the eukaryotic DNA replication factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22527-22534). Mutations in the N-terminal domain have greater impact than in the C-terminal domain, indicating a positional bias in PCNA-DNA contacts that can influence its functions on DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2057583443,"Protein homeostasis depends on a balance of translation, folding, and degradation. Here, we demonstrate that mild inhibition of translation results in a dramatic and disproportional reduction in production of misfolded polypeptides in mammalian cells, suggesting an improved folding of newly synthesized proteins. Indeed, inhibition of translation elongation, which slightly attenuated levels of a copepod GFP mutant protein, significantly enhanced its function. In contrast, inhibition of translation initiation had minimal effects on copepod GFP folding. On the other hand, mild suppression of either translation elongation or initiation corrected folding defects of the disease-associated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutant F508del. We propose that modulation of translation can be used as a novel approach to improve overall proteostasis in mammalian cells, as well as functions of disease-associated mutant proteins with folding deficiencies."

IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus where it stimulates transcription of the interferonβ (IFNβ) gene, but the function of Pellino1 in this pathway is unknown. Here, we report that myeloid cells and embryonic fibroblasts from knock-in mice expressing an E3 ligase-deficient mutant of Pellino1 produce reduced levels of IFNβ mRNA and secrete much less IFNβ in response to viral double-stranded RNA because the interaction of IRF3 with the IFNβ promoter is impaired. These results identify Pellino1 as a novel component of the signal transduction network by which viral double-stranded RNA stimulates IFNβ gene transcription."

The eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) 6The abbreviations used are: RNAPIIRNA polymerase IIPICpreinitiation complexTFtranscription factorTBPTATA-binding proteiniTRAQisobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation. promoter is a particularly well studied platform for protein recruitment. These DNA sequences recruit the transcription machinery to the correct locations throughout the genome so that RNA synthesis occurs in a site-selective manner (1Juven-Gershon T. Hsu J.Y. Theisen J.W. Kadonaga J.T. The RNA polymerase II core promoter–the gateway to transcription.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Studies of RNAPII promoters have identified multiple core DNA elements that individually or together direct proper assembly and orientation of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) (1Juven-Gershon T.

These basal promoter sequences are usually found within 100 bp of the transcription start site. However, no single DNA sequence element is found at all core promoters, suggesting that multiple types of PICs could be present in the cell. In addition to the core promoter sequence elements, regulatory transcription factors can bind nearby to augment or inhibit core promoter usage. For example, upstream activating sequences in yeast are often found within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the core promoter. The mammalian counterparts, called enhancers, are often kilobases away from the transcription start site and can function both upstream and downstream of the core promoter (3Blackwood E.M.

Selective and efficient initiation from promoters in vitro minimally requires the basal transcription factor (TF) complexes TFIIB, TATA-binding protein (the TBP subunit of TFIID), TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, which are highly conserved from yeast to human. Enhancers and upstream activating sequences bind gene-specific activator proteins, which in turn recruit coactivator complexes that collectively stimulate transcription beyond basal levels. These coactivators may include the TBP-associated factors of TFIID, histone-modifying complexes, chromatin-remodeling complexes, and Mediator (a large multiprotein complex brought to the promoter by DNA-bound activators, which in turn recruit the core polymerase machinery) (5Näär A.M.

Where indicated, Gal4-VP16 was incubated with immobilized templates prior to the addition of extract. The templates were concentrated with a magnet and washed three times with 400 μl of transcription buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 2.5 mm DTT.

Western blotting was performed with antibodies against Rpb3 (NeoClone) and Rpb1, TBP, Tfb1, Tfg1, Tfa1, Ada1, and the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of PICs, reactions were scaled up 5-fold compared with reactions used to analyze PICs by Western blotting. After incubating nuclear extract prepared from strain BY4741 with templates for 40 min at room temperature, the templates were washed three times with transcription buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 2.5 mm DTT, followed by one wash with transcription buffer without Nonidet P-40.

A detailed description of the mass spectrometry methods and data analysis is given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” The HIS4 promoter has been used previously for immobilized template pulldown experiments to study PIC assembly and activity.

This DNA was linked to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads via 5′-biotin on the top strand. The template was incubated with S. cerevisiae nuclear extract and washed to reduce nonspecifically bound proteins. To ensure that isolated complexes were PICs that had not initiated transcription, extracts were first depleted of ATP, and binding reactions were done in the presence of α-amanitin. The promoter and associated proteins were eluted by restriction enzyme cleavage at a PstI site 20 bp upstream of the Gal4 site. The negative control DNA fragment was identical except that it lacked the HIS4 basal promoter (supplemental Fig. S1A). Immunoblotting showed that TBP, Rpb3 (RNAPII subunit), Tfa1 (TFIIE subunit), Tfb1 (TFIIH subunit), and Tfg2 (TFIIF subunit) were strongly enriched on the HIS4 template (supplemental Fig. S1B) as expected (11Ranish J.A.

The propensity of proteins to bind DNA nonspecifically often complicates the identification of physiologically significant interactions, particularly when proteins of interest are present at low levels relative to abundant contaminants. To identify proteins bound specifically to the HIS4 promoter relative to the no-promoter control, we used a modified version of our previous quantitative mass spectrometry approach (12Sikorski T.W. Ficarro S.B. Holik J. Kim T. Rando O.J. Marto J.A. Buratowski S. Sub1 and RPA associate with RNA polymerase II at different stages of transcription.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). First, we implemented selective solid-phase capture of cysteine-containing peptides; on average, cysteine represents ∼1% of all amino acids in the yeast proteome, with ∼85% of all proteins containing at least one cysteine. As a result, enrichment of cysteine-containing peptides provides a nearly 10-fold decrease in mixture complexity while maintaining representation of the majority of yeast proteins. Immobilization of cysteine peptides enabled iTRAQ labeling directly on the beads, minimizing sample lyophilization and other handling steps. Finally, we used our recently described automated three-dimensional high-pH reversed phase/strong anion exchange/low-pH reversed phase fractionation platform to provide efficient separation of iTRAQ-labeled peptides (13Ficarro S.B. Zhang Y. Carrasco-Alfonso M.J. Garg B. Adelmant G. Webber J.T. Luckey C.J. Marto J.A. Online nanoflow multidimensional fractionation for high-efficiency phosphopeptide analysis.Mol. Cell.

These modifications ensure high dynamic range of protein identification while simultaneously minimizing the deleterious effects of peptide ratio compression that have been associated with iTRAQ-based analysis of complex mixtures (15Bantscheff M.

Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 5347-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). First, we compared proteins associated with promoterless templates with those binding to the Gal4-binding site-HIS4 promoter chimera in the presence or absence of activator (Fig. 1B). Gal4-VP16 can stimulate transcription by up to 10-fold on this promoter (11Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Intermediates in formation and activity of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex: holoenzyme recruitment and a post-recruitment role for the TATA box and TFIIB.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). At a depth of 13 high-pH reversed phase/strong anion exchange/low-pH reversed phase fractions, we detected almost 700 proteins on average in each run, with ∼97% of the identified peptides containing at least one cysteine. Two biological replicate experiments exhibited a high degree of overlap in terms of both peptide and protein identification (67 and 70%, respectively) (supplemental Fig. S2A). We also observed good reproducibility for iTRAQ ratios across biological replicates (supplemental Fig. S2B). As expected, most proteins appeared to be nonspecifically associated as evidenced by uniform ratios across all channels (115/114, 116/114, and 116/115) (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). Significantly, exogenous Gal4 was detected only in iTRAQ channel 116 (Fig. 1C). To estimate each protein's probability of being enriched either on the promoter template or in the presence of Gal4-VP16, we used a mixture modeling approach (18Benaglia T. Chauveau D. Hunte D.R. Young D. mixtools: an R package for analyzing finite mixture models.J. Statis. Softw. 2009; 32: 1-29Crossref Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The distribution of the log (base 2) of iTRAQ ratios was fitted to three Gaussian distributions: enriched, not enriched, and excluded. The probability of a protein being in the enriched or the excluded distribution was then estimated as a function of its iTRAQ ratio. For activated complexes versus the no-promoter sample (116/114), ratios of 2.0 or greater (1.0 on the log2 scale) indicated a probability of enrichment of >0.6, so these proteins were categorized as likely promoter-associated factors (supplemental Fig. S2C, left panel). The majority of the 56 proteins in this class consisted of basal initiation factors, Mediator, and the chromatin-remodeling complexes SAGA, Swi/Snf, and NuA4 (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). Components of replication protein A were also enriched on the HIS4 promoter templates, as reported previously (12Sikorski T.W. Ficarro S.B. Holik J. Kim T. Rando O.J. Marto J.A. Buratowski S. Sub1 and RPA associate with RNA polymerase II at different stages of transcription.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A number of other proteins known to be components of the PIC, notably many TFIIH and TFIID subunits, were identified at higher levels on the promoter, but with ratios just below the 2-fold threshold to be categorized as enriched. Some subunits within enriched complexes were not detected, but this is unlikely to be due to partial assemblies within the PIC. In some cases, the “missing” subunits lacked cysteines or had cysteines within peptides outside the detectable size range. Stochastic undersampling is a likely explanation for other cases. For example, one of the TFIIE subunits not found by mass spectrometry was strongly enriched when assayed by immunoblotting (data not shown). A surprisingly small set of proteins was specifically recruited by Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 2C and supplemental Table S1). Virtually all came from three chromatin-related coactivator complexes: the histone H3 acetyltransferase SAGA, the histone H4 acetyltransferase NuA4, and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Swi/Snf (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, subunits of many other chromatin-related complexes were identified (RSC, Chd1, Isw1, Isw2, Ino80, Swr1, SAS, and Rpd3L), but these are likely to be nonspecifically associated because they were not enriched on promoter templates relative to the no-promoter control. However, a number of components of the RNAPIII transcription factor TFIIIC complex were excluded in the presence of Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 2D and supplemental Table S1). Interestingly, although basal initiation factor recruitment on a naked DNA promoter template showed a slight positive trend in the presence of Gal4-VP16, none of these proteins exceeded the 2-fold threshold for enrichment (Fig. 2E and supplemental Table S1). Immunoblotting confirmed the very modest increase in basal factor recruitment by the activator (Fig. 2F). Mediator, which has been shown genetically and biochemically to interact with activators, was also only slightly affected by Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 2D). These findings are consistent with reports suggesting that yeast Mediator associates tightly with RNAPII and may function as part of the basal initiation machinery (19Thompson C.M. Young R.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 80-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The minimal activator-dependent binding of basal factors is consistent with experiments showing that activators primarily stimulate reinitiation rather than the first round of transcription (25Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. A transcription reinitiation intermediate that is stabilized by activator.Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and that this function may be the primary mode of transcription activation on naked DNA templates (11Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Intermediates in formation and activity of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex: holoenzyme recruitment and a post-recruitment role for the TATA box and TFIIB.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Using our extracts and activators, we confirmed that single-round reactions gave ≤1.4-fold activation, whereas multiround reactions showed 2.6–4.3-fold activation (data not shown). Given the limited set of complexes recruited by Gal4-VP16, we were curious to test whether another activator would recruit the same set of complexes to the promoter. Gal4-Gcn4 contains the identical DNA-binding domain as in the experiment above but carries the Gcn4 activation domain (Fig. 3A) (26Reeves W.M. Hahn S. Activator-independent functions of the yeast Mediator Sin4 complex in preinitiation complex formation and transcription reinitiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Gal4-Gcn4 also stimulated transcription from the HIS4 promoter, although not as strongly as Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 3B). Immobilized template assays were performed with Gal4-Gcn4 and analyzed as described above (Fig. 3C). As before, we observed good reproducibility across biological replicates for both protein identifications and iTRAQ ratios (supplemental Fig. S3). Gal4-Gcn4 stimulated binding of the same limited set of complexes as Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 3, D and E, and supplemental Table S2). Interestingly, although recruitment of SAGA and Swi/Snf was similar for the two activators, NuA4 subunits that were strongly enriched by Gal4-VP16 were only modestly recruited by Gal4-Gcn4 (Fig. 3, F and G). These data show that activation domains have quantitatively and qualitatively different abilities to interact with coactivators and therefore are likely to stimulate transcription through different complexes. To determine the effect of nucleosomes on PIC formation, the template used above was assembled into chromatin using recombinant yeast histones and the assembly factors Nap1 and Isw1a (27Johnson A. Li G. Sikorski T.W. Buratowski S. Woodcock C.L. Moazed D. Reconstitution of heterochromatin-dependent transcriptional gene silencing.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 769-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chromatinization was verified using native gel electrophoresis and micrococcal nuclease digestion, which showed efficient assembly of up to three nucleosomes per template (supplemental Fig. S5). The chromatin templates supported transcription (see below) and could bind and elute from magnetic beads with efficiencies equivalent to those of naked DNA templates (supplemental Fig. S5). Immobilized chromatin templates were incubated with yeast nuclear extract and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry as described above (Fig. 4A). Once again, reproducibility between replicates was very good (supplemental Fig. S4). Several interesting observations emerged from comparison of naked (channel 114) versus chromatin (channel 116) templates in the absence of activators (supplemental Table S3). A number of known nucleosome-binding proteins were highly enriched on chromatin templates, including the Ran exchange factor Gsp1 (also known as Prp20 or Rcc1), Sir3, Chd1, the Spt16 subunit of FACT, and the RSC complex (Fig. 4, B–D). These interactions strongly validate the physiological relevance of our assembled chromatin. Conversely, there was a clear suppression of known PIC components, including the basal factors, Mediator, and coactivators (Fig. 4D). It remains to be seen whether this reduction represents reduced binding to the HIS4 basal promoter or suppression of “cryptic” promoters in other regions of the DNA template. As seen on naked DNA templates, the addition of the Gal4-VP16 activator to chromatinized templates significantly and specifically increased binding of SAGA, NuA4, and Swi/Snf, but not other chromatin-related factors (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Table S4). Interestingly, Gal4-VP16 on the chromatin templates now more strongly increased the levels of RNAPII, basal factors, and especially Mediator. Both immunoblotting (Fig. 5C) and in vitro transcription (Fig. 5D) confirmed that chromatin suppressed basal factor association, leading to stronger recruitment upon addition of the activator. These results suggest that activators help overcome chromatin-"
