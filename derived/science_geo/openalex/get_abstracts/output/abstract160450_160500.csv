https://openalex.org/W2170814877,"In crowded visual scenes, attention is needed to select relevant stimuli. To study the underlying mechanisms, we recorded neurons in cortical area V4 while macaque monkeys attended to behaviorally relevant stimuli and ignored distracters. Neurons activated by the attended stimulus showed increased gamma-frequency (35 to 90 hertz) synchronization but reduced low-frequency (<17 hertz) synchronization compared with neurons at nearby V4 sites activated by distracters. Because postsynaptic integration times are short, these localized changes in synchronization may serve to amplify behaviorally relevant signals in the cortex."

From a combinatorial screening approach looking at the solid solubility of transition metals in titanium dioxides and of their magnetic properties, we report on the observation of transparent ferromagnetism in cobalt-doped anatase thin films with theconcentration of cobalt between 0 and 8%. Magnetic microscopy images reveal a magnetic domain structure in the films, indicating the existence of ferromagnetic long-range ordering. The materials remain ferromagnetic above room temperature with a magnetic moment of 0.32 Bohr magnetons per cobalt atom. The film is conductive and exhibits a positive magnetoresistance of 60% at 2 kelvin."

https://openalex.org/W2105749655,"The ability of intestinal mucosa to absorb dietary ferric iron is attributed to the presence of a brush-border membrane reductase activity that displays adaptive responses to iron status. We have isolated a complementary DNA, Dcytb (for duodenal cytochrome b), which encoded a putative plasma membrane di-heme protein in mouse duodenal mucosa. Dcytb shared between 45 and 50% similarity to the cytochrome b561 family of plasma membrane reductases, was highly expressed in the brush-border membrane of duodenal enterocytes, and induced ferric reductase activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and cultured cells. Duodenal expression levels of Dcytb messenger RNA and protein were regulated by changes in physiological modulators of iron absorption. Thus, Dcytb provides an important element in the iron absorption pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1922570371,"The hypothesis that working memory is crucial for reducing distraction by maintaining the prioritization of relevant information was tested in neuroimaging and psychological experiments with humans. Participants performed a selective attention task that required them to ignore distractor faces while holding in working memory a sequence of digits that were in the same order (low memory load) or a different order (high memory load) on every trial. Higher memory load, associated with increased prefrontal activity, resulted in greater interference effects on behavioral performance from the distractor faces, plus increased face-related activity in the visual cortex. These findings confirm a major role for working memory in the control of visual selective attention."

We developed two computer models that integrate spatial data on deforestation, logging, mining, highways and roads, navigable rivers, vulnerability to wildfires, protected areas, and existing and planned infrastructure projects, in an effort to predict the condition of Brazilian Amazonian forests by the year 2020. Both models suggest that the region9s forests will be drastically altered by current development schemes and land-use trends over the next 20 years."
https://openalex.org/W1807331748,"Timing is crucial to many aspects of human performance. To better understand its neural underpinnings, we used event-related fMRI to examine the time course of activation associated with different components of a time perception task. We distinguished systems associated with encoding time intervals from those related to comparing intervals and implementing a response. Activation in the basal ganglia occurred early, and was uniquely associated with encoding time intervals, whereas cerebellar activation unfolded late, suggesting an involvement in processes other than explicit timing. Early cortical activation associated with encoding of time intervals was observed in the right inferior parietal cortex and bilateral premotor cortex, implicating these systems in attention and temporary maintenance of intervals. Late activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex emerged during comparison of time intervals. Our results illustrate a dynamic network of cortical-subcortical activation associated with different components of temporal information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2161273761,"The mammalian innate immune system retains from Drosophila a family of homologous Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that mediate responses to microbial ligands. Here, we show that TLR2 activation leads to killing of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis in both mouse and human macrophages, through distinct mechanisms. In mouse macrophages, bacterial lipoprotein activation of TLR2 leads to a nitric oxide-dependent killing of intracellular tubercle bacilli, but in human monocytes and alveolar macrophages, this pathway was nitric oxide-independent. Thus, mammalian TLRs respond (as Drosophila Toll receptors do) to microbial ligands and also have the ability to activate antimicrobial effector pathways at the site of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2076915648,"The macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB), is a complex natural product synthesized by the soil bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea through the action of a multifunctional polyketide synthase (PKS). The engineering potential of modular PKSs is hampered by the limited capabilities for molecular biological manipulation of organisms (principally actinomycetes) in which complex polyketides have thus far been produced. To address this problem, a derivative of Escherichia coli has been genetically engineered. The resulting cellular catalyst converts exogenous propionate into 6dEB with a specific productivity that compares well with a high-producing mutant of S. erythraea that has been incrementally enhanced over decades for the industrial production of erythromycin."

The crystal underwent a thermally irreversible but photochemically reversible color change (colorless to blue) upon alternate irradiation with ultraviolet (wavelength lambda = 366 nm) and visible (lambda > 500 nm) light that drove reversible photocyclization reactions. Upon irradiation with 366-nm light, new steps appeared on the (100) single-crystalline surface that disappeared upon irradiation with visible light (lambda > 500 nm). The step height, about 1 nm, corresponds to one molecular layer. Irradiation with 366-nm light formed valleys on the (010) surface that also disappeared by bleaching upon irradiation with visible light (lambda > 500 nm). The surface morphological changes can be explained by the molecular structural changes of diarylethenes regularly packed in the single crystal. These crystals could potentially be used as photodriven nanometer-scale actuators."

https://openalex.org/W2057229979,"EDG-1 is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) for sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP). Cell migration toward platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which stimulates sphingosine kinase and increases intracellular SPP, was dependent on expression of EDG-1. Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement. Moreover, PDGF activated EDG-1, as measured by translocation of β-arrestin and phosphorylation of EDG-1. Our results reveal a role for receptor cross-communication in which activation of a GPCR by a receptor tyrosine kinase is critical for cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2115988944,"Bag (Bcl2-associated athanogene) domains occur in a class of cofactors of the eukaryotic chaperone 70-kilodalton heat shock protein (Hsp70) family. Binding of the Bag domain to the Hsp70 adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain promotes adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent release of substrate from Hsp70 in vitro. In a 1.9 angstrom crystal structure of a complex with the ATPase of the 70-kilodalton heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70), the Bag domain forms a three-helix bundle, inducing a conformational switch in the ATPase that is incompatible with nucleotide binding. The same switch is observed in the bacterial Hsp70 homolog DnaK upon binding of the structurally unrelated nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. Thus, functional convergence has allowed proteins with different architectures to trigger a conserved conformational shift in Hsp70 that leads to nucleotide exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2051948962,"As an organelle coupling nuclear and cytoplasmic divisions, the centrosome is essential to mitotic fidelity, and its inheritance could be critical to understanding cell transformation. Investigating the behavior of the centrosome in living mitotic cells, we documented a transient and remarkable postanaphase repositioning of this organelle, which apparently controls the release of central microtubules from the midbody and the completion of cell division. We also observed that the absence of the centrosome leads to defects in cytokinesis. Together with recent results in yeasts, our data point to a conserved centrosome-dependent pathway that integrates spatial controls into the decision of completing cell division, which requires the repositioning of the centrosome organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2075009216,"Human immunodeficiency virus type–1 (HIV-1) membrane fusion is promoted by the formation of a trimer-of-hairpins structure that brings the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the gp41 envelope glycoprotein ectodomain into close proximity. Peptides derived from the carboxyl-terminal region (called C-peptides) potently inhibit HIV-1 entry by binding to the gp41 amino-terminal region. To test the converse of this inhibitory strategy, we designed a small protein, denoted 5-Helix, that binds the C-peptide region of gp41. The 5-Helix protein displays potent (nanomolar) inhibitory activity against diverse HIV-1 variants and may serve as the basis for a new class of antiviral agents. The inhibitory activity of 5-Helix also suggests a strategy for generating an HIV-1 neutralizing antibody response that targets the carboxyl-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain."
https://openalex.org/W2091336733,"Initiation of translation at the correct position on messenger RNA is essential for accurate protein synthesis. In prokaryotes, this process requires three initiation factors: IF1, IF2, and IF3. Here we report the crystal structure of a complex of IF1 and the 30 S ribosomal subunit. Binding of IF1 occludes the ribosomal A site and flips out the functionally important bases A1492 and A1493 from helix 44 of 16 S RNA, burying them in pockets in IF1. The binding of IF1 causes long-range changes in the conformation of H44 and leads to movement of the domains of 30 S with respect to each other. The structure explains how localized changes at the ribosomal A site lead to global alterations in the conformation of the 30 S subunit."

A voltage pulse between the gold film and the silicon transfers charge at the contact areas between the gold and the polymer electret. Areas as large as 1 square centimeter were patterned with trapped charges at a resolution better than 150 nanometers in less than 20 seconds. This process provides a new method for patterning; it suggests possible methods for high-density, charge-based data storage and for high-resolution charge-based printing."

Successful jokes involve a cognitive juxtaposition of mental sets, followed by an affective feeling of amusement; we isolated these two components of humor by using event-related fMRI on subjects who listened to auditorily presented semantic and phonological jokes (puns) and indicated whether or not they found the items amusing. Our findings suggest that whereas there are modality-specific pathways for processing the juxtaposition of mental sets necessary for the appreciation of jokes, a common component of humor is expressed in activity in medial ventral prefrontal cortex, a region involved in reward processing."
https://openalex.org/W2012532095,"Centrosomes were microsurgically removed from BSC-1 African green monkey kidney cells before the completion of S phase. Karyoplasts (acentrosomal cells) entered and completed mitosis. However, postmitotic karyoplasts arrested before S phase, whereas adjacent control cells divided repeatedly. Postmitotic karyoplasts assembled a microtubule-organizing center containing gamma-tubulin and pericentrin, but did not regenerate centrioles. These observations reveal the existence of an activity associated with core centrosomal structures-distinct from elements of the microtubule-organizing center-that is required for the somatic cell cycle to progress through G1 into S phase. Once the cell is in S phase, these core structures are not needed for the G2-M phase transition."

As temperature is reduced, low-frequency spin fluctuations first disappear with the loss of vortex mobility, but then reappear. We find that the vortex state can be regarded as an inhomogeneous mixture of a superconducting spin fluid and a material containing a nearly ordered antiferromagnet. These experiments show that as for many other properties of cuprate superconductors, the important underlying microscopic forces are magnetic."
https://openalex.org/W2036760739,"The guanosine triphosphatase Ran stimulates assembly of microtubule asters and spindles in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. A carboxyl-terminal region of the nuclear-mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), a nuclear protein required for organizing mitotic spindle poles, mimics Ran's ability to induce asters. This NuMA fragment also specifically interacted with the nuclear transport factor, importin-beta. We show that importin-beta is an inhibitor of microtubule aster assembly in Xenopus egg extracts and that Ran regulates the interaction between importin-beta and NuMA. Importin-beta therefore links NuMA to regulation by Ran. This suggests that similar mechanisms regulate nuclear import during interphase and spindle assembly during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2060489436,"Receptor editing, clonal deletion, and anergy are the mechanisms by which B cells maintain tolerance to self antigens. To determine the extent to which receptor editing shapes the normal antibody repertoire, we generated an immunoglobulin kappa polymorphism that facilitates the detection of editing of immunoglobulin light chains in vivo. We found that B cells are targeted for editing during a 2-hour delay in development at the pre-BII cell stage, and that about 25% of all antibody molecules are produced by gene replacement. These results suggest that receptor editing represents a major force in shaping the antibody repertoire."

The compounds were then mixed, and multistep reactions were conducted to make enantiomers or analogs of the natural product mappicine. The resulting tagged products were then demixed by fluorous chromatography (eluting in order of increasing fluorine content) to provide the individual pure components of the mixture, which were detagged to release the final products."

Bin1b exhibits structural characteristics and antimicrobial activity similar to that of cationic antimicrobial peptides, β-defensins.

Here we show that the mustard weed Arabidopsis thaliana can survive up to 10 generations without telomerase. The last five generations of telomerase-deficient plants endured increasing levels of cytogenetic damage, which was correlated with developmental anomalies in both vegetative and reproductive organs. Mutants ultimately arrested at a terminal vegetative state harboring shoot meristems that were grossly enlarged, disorganized, and in some cases, dedifferentiated into a callusoid mass. Unexpectedly, late-generation mutants had an extended life-span and remained metabolically active. The differences in plant and animal responses to dysfunctional telomeres may reflect the more plastic nature of plant development and genome organization."

We examined calcium responses of rat taste receptor cells in situ to a panel of bitter compounds to determine whether individual cells distinguish between bitter stimuli. Most bitter-responsive taste cells were activated by only one out of five compounds tested. In taste cells that responded to multiple stimuli, there were no significant associations between any two stimuli. Bitter sensation does not appear to occur through the activation of a homogeneous population of broadly tuned bitter-sensitive taste cells. Instead, different bitter stimuli may activate different subpopulations of bitter-sensitive taste cells."

Here, the solution structure of the FYVE domain of the early endosome antigen 1 protein (EEA1) in the free state was compared with the structures of the domain complexed with PtdIns(3)P and mixed micelles. The multistep binding mechanism involved nonspecific insertion of a hydrophobic loop into the lipid bilayer, positioning and activating the binding pocket. Ligation of PtdIns(3)P then induced a global structural change, drawing the protein termini over the bound phosphoinositide by extension of a hinge. Specific recognition of the 3-phosphate was determined indirectly and directly by two clusters of conserved arginines."

The sodium/iron ratio in these stratospheric particles is higher and the magnesium/iron and calcium/iron ratios are lower than in chondritic meteorites, implying that the fraction of material that is ablated must lie at the low end of previous estimates and that the extraterrestrial component that resides in the mesosphere and stratosphere is not of chondritic composition."

The B cell receptor (BCR) and MHC class II/Ig-α/Ig-β are distinct complexes, yet class II–associated Ig-α/β appears to be derived from BCR.

These chondrules formed under oxidizing conditions before condensation of iron-nickel metal, at temperatures greater than or equal to 1500 K, and were isolated from the cooling gas before condensation of moderately volatile elements such as manganese, sodium, potassium, and sulfur.

https://openalex.org/W2086349732,"T he old saying “putting an ear to the ground” may turn out to be literally true for elephants, according to a recent report by O'Connell-Rodwell and her colleagues ([1][1]). When elephants generate their low-frequency vocalizations (rumbles), acoustic sound waves traveling through the air are accompanied by seismic waves that travel through the ground. Given that a variety of creatures, from insects to rodents and even the enormous elephant seal, use the generation and detection of terrestrial vibrations to communicate, O'Connell-Rodwell and her team wondered if elephants, too, have this seismic signaling capability.

Eschewing the grasslands of Africa for a residential facility in Texas, the scientists analyzed acoustic and seismic signals generated by two captive Asian elephants. Whenever the elephants “rumbled” or stomped their feet during mock charges, seismic data were collected with geophones—sensitive microphones placed 10 m and 30 m from the elephants' pen that transformed terrestrial vibrations into electrical signals. Simultaneously, acoustic data were collected with audio equipment.

The seismic and acoustic waves generated by rumbles and foot stomps had similar frequencies (20 to 24 Hz) that fell within the ideal range for the long-distance transmission of low-frequency sounds. Intriguingly, the two sets of waves had different velocities (248 to 264 m/s in the ground, and 309 m/s in the air), so that they were no longer in phase as they traveled further away from their source. This hints that elephants may make their rumbles and foot stomps loud enough to produce separate acoustic and seismic waves.

![Figure][2] 

CREDIT: BEN AND LYNETTE HART

Through mathematical modeling, the investigators estimated that the seismic waves created by their stomping elephants traveled at least 36 km. Conceivably, these long-distance seismic signals may enable elephants to communicate with other herds. The location of a distant herd could be pinpointed by assessing the time delay between the arrival of seismic and acoustic signals.

Elephants are known to move toward thunderstorms that are more than 25 km away, too far for them to hear the sound of thunder. It is possible that they can detect the terrestrial vibrations associated with distant storms, presumably a major advantage in their search for new water sources.

Generating seismic signals is easy, but what about detecting them? The elephant's trunk has mechanoreceptors that respond to mechanical pressure. There may also be similar receptors in the elephant's well-innervated foot pads. These mechanoreceptors may explain foot-lifting behavior during which elephants lean forward and lift up one foot, possibly to improve their sensitivity to ground vibrations.

Establishing that elephants use seismic signaling for long-distance communication is no easy task. Undaunted, O'Connell-Rodwell and her team plan to train their elephants to respond to seismic waves by pulling a lever with their trunk or pressing a button with their feet—with, of course, the provision of a reward for the correct response.
