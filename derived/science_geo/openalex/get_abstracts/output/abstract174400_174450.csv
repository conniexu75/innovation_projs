https://openalex.org/W1984510622,"CD1d-restricted autoreactive natural killer (NK1.1 + ) T cells function as regulatory cells in various disease conditions. Using improved tetramer tracking methodology, we identified a NK1.1 – thymic precursor and followed its differentiation and emigration to tissues by direct cell transfer and in situ cell labeling studies. A major lineage expansion occurred within the thymus after positive selection and before NK receptor expression. Surprisingly, cytokine analysis of the developmental intermediates between NK − and NK + stages showed a T helper cell T H 2 to T H 1 conversion, suggesting that the regulatory functions of NK T cells may be developmentally controlled. These findings characterize novel thymic and postthymic developmental pathways that expand autoreactive cells and differentiate them into regulatory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2112075984,"During development, alterations in sensory experience modify the structure of cortical neurons, particularly at the level of the dendritic spine. Are similar adaptations involved in plasticity of the adult cortex? Here we show that a 24 hr period of single whisker stimulation in freely moving adult mice increases, by 36%, the total synaptic density in the corresponding cortical barrel. This is due to an increase in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses found on spines. Four days after stimulation, the inhibitory inputs to the spines remain despite total synaptic density returning to pre-stimulation levels. Functional analysis of layer IV cells demonstrated altered response properties, immediately after stimulation, as well as four days later. These results indicate activity-dependent alterations in synaptic circuitry in adulthood, modifying the flow of sensory information into the cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1980059018,"Glutamate receptors are concentrated in the postsynaptic complex of central synapses. This implies a highly organized and stable postsynaptic membrane with tightly anchored receptors. Recent reports of rapid AMPA receptor insertion and removal at synapses have challenged this view. We examined the stability of synaptic NMDA receptors on cultured hippocampal neurons using the open-channel blockers (+)-MK-801 and ketamine to tag synaptic NMDA receptors. NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs showed an anomalous recovery following ""irreversible"" MK-801 block. The recovery could not be attributed to MK-801 unbinding or insertion of new receptors, suggesting that membrane receptors had moved laterally into the synapse. At least 65% of synaptic NMDA receptors were mobile. Our results indicate that NMDA receptors can move laterally between synaptic and extrasynaptic pools, providing evidence for a dynamic organization of synaptic NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic complex."
https://openalex.org/W1988181440,"Activity-regulated transcription has been implicated in adaptive plasticity in the CNS. In many instances, this plasticity depends upon the transcription factor CREB. Precisely how neuronal activity regulates CREB remains unclear. To address this issue, we examined the phosphorylation state of components of the CREB transcriptional pathway. We show that NMDA activates transcription of CREB-responsive genes in hippocampal neurons, with ERK responsible for persistent CREB phosphorylation and CaM kinase IV (CaMKIV) responsible for phosphorylating the CREB coactivator, CBP. Ser301 of CBP was identified as a major target of CaMKIV phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. CaM kinase inhibitors attenuated phosphorylation at Ser301 and blocked CBP-dependent transcription. Additionally, mutation of Ser301 impaired NMDA- and CaMKIV-stimulated transcription. These findings demonstrate that activity-induced CaMKIV signaling contributes to CREB/CBP-dependent transcription by phosphorylating CBP at Ser301."
https://openalex.org/W2040002918,"Auditory information critical for fear conditioning, a model of emotional learning, is conveyed to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala via two routes: directly from the medial geniculate nucleus and indirectly from the auditory cortex. Here we show in the cortico-amygdala pathway that learned fear occludes electrically induced long-term potentiation (LTP). Quantal analysis of the expression of LTP in this pathway reveals a significant presynaptic component reflected in an increase in probability of transmitter release. Conditioned fear also is accompanied by the enhancement in transmitter release at this cortico-amygdala synapse. These results indicate that the synaptic projections from the auditory cortex to the lateral amygdala are modified during the acquisition and expression of fear to auditory stimulation, thus further strengthening the proposed link between LTP in the auditory pathways to the amygdala and learned fear."
https://openalex.org/W1994572841,"We explored the spatio-temporal dynamics of odor-evoked activity in the rat and mouse main olfactory bulb (MOB) using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) with a new probe. The high temporal resolution of VSDI revealed odor-specific sequences of glomerular activation. Increasing odor concentrations reduced response latencies, increased response amplitudes, and recruited new glomerular units. However, the sequence of glomerular activation was maintained. Furthermore, we found distributed MOB activity locked to the nasal respiration cycle. The spatial distribution of its amplitude and phase was heterogeneous and changed by sensory input in an odor-specific manner. Our data show that in the mammalian olfactory bulb, odor identity and concentration are represented by spatio-temporal patterns, rather than spatial patterns alone."
https://openalex.org/W2103744641,"Changes in synaptic connectivity patterns through the formation and elimination of dendritic spines may contribute to structural plasticity in the brain. We characterize this contribution quantitatively by estimating the number of different synaptic connectivity patterns attainable without major arbor remodeling. This number depends on the ratio of the synapses on a dendrite to the axons that pass within a spine length of that dendrite. We call this ratio the filling fraction and calculate it from geometrical analysis and anatomical data. The filling fraction is 0.26 in mouse neocortex, 0.22–0.34 in rat hippocampus. In the macaque visual cortex, the filling fraction increases by a factor of 1.6–1.8 from area V1 to areas V2, V4, and 7a. Since the filling fraction is much smaller than 1, spine remodeling can make a large contribution to structural plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2083673419,"The transcription factor CREB mediates diverse responses in the nervous system. It is not known how CREB induces specific patterns of gene expression in response to different extracellular stimuli. We find that Ca(2+) influx into neurons induces CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 and two additional sites, Ser142 and Ser143. While CREB Ser133 phosphorylation is induced by many stimuli, phosphorylation at Ser142 and Ser143 is selectively activated by Ca(2+) influx. The triple phosphorylation of CREB is required for effective Ca(2+) stimulation of CREB-dependent transcription, but the phosphorylation of Ser142 and Ser143, in addition to Ser133, disrupts the interaction of CREB with its cofactor CBP. These results suggest that Ca(2+) influx triggers a specific program of gene expression in neurons by selectively regulating CREB phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1993818203,"M(1) muscarinic (M(1)AChRs) and B(2) bradykinin (B(2)Rs) receptors are two PLCbeta-coupled receptors that mobilize Ca(2+) in nonexcitable cells. In many neurons, however, B(2)Rs but not M(1)AChRs mobilize intracellular Ca(2+). We have studied the membrane organization and dynamics underlying this coupling specificity by using Trp channels as biosensors for real-time detection of PLCbeta products. We found that, in sympathetic neurons, although both receptors rapidly produced DAG and InsP(3) as messengers, only InsP(3) formed by B(2)Rs has the ability to activate IP(3)Rs. This exclusive coupling results from spatially restricted complexes linking B(2)Rs to IP(3)Rs, a missing partnership for M(1)AChRs. These complexes allow fast and localized rises of InsP(3), necessary to activate the low-affinity neuronal IP(3)R. Thus, these signaling microdomains are of critical importance for the induction of selective responses, discriminating proinflammatory information associated with B(2)Rs from cholinergic neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2016027614,"Biological rhythms are driven in mammals by a central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Light-induced phase shifting of this clock is correlated with phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 in the SCN. Here, we characterize phosphorylation of CREB at Ser142 and describe its contribution to the entrainment of the clock. In the SCN, light and glutamate strongly induce CREB Ser142 phosphorylation. To determine the physiological relevance of phosphorylation at Ser142, we generated a mouse mutant, CREB(S142A), lacking this phosphorylation site. Light-induced phase shifts of locomotion and expression of c-Fos and mPer1 in the SCN are significantly attenuated in CREB(S142A) mutants. Our findings provide genetic evidence that CREB Ser142 phosphorylation is involved in the entrainment of the mammalian clock and reveal a novel phosphorylation-dependent regulation of CREB activity."

https://openalex.org/W2106820094,"Overexpression of CD30 and constitutive NF-kappaB activation characterizes tumor cells of Hodgkin's disease (HD), Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells. We report that in H-RS cells overexpression of CD30 leads to self-aggregation, recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF5, and NF-kappaB activation, independent of CD30 ligand. CD30 and TRAF proteins co-localized in H-RS cell lines and in lymph nodes of HD. An adenovirus-vector carrying a decoy CD30 lacking the cytoplasmic region or a dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant blocks NF-kappaB activation, down regulates IL-13 expression and induces apoptosis. Thus, in H-RS cells, ligand-independent activation of CD30 signaling drives NF-kappaB activation and this leads to constitutive cytokine expression, which provides a molecular basis for HD. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by adenovirus vector-mediated gene transfer may provide a novel strategy of cell- and target molecule-specific therapy for patients with HD."
https://openalex.org/W2058089459,"It has become increasingly appreciated that receptors coupled to Gαi family members can stimulate platelet aggregation, but the mechanism for this has remained unclear. One possible mediator is the small GTPase, Rap1, which has been shown to contribute to integrin activation in several cell lines and to be activated by a calcium-dependent mechanism in platelets. Here, we demonstrate that Rap1 is also activated by Gαi family members in platelets. First, we show that platelets from mice lacking the Gαi family member Gαz (which couples to the α2A adrenergic receptor) are deficient in epinephrine-stimulated Rap1 activation. We also show that platelets from mice lacking Gαi2, which couples to the ADP receptor, P2Y12, exhibit reduced Rap1 activation in response to ADP. In contrast, platelets from mice that lack Gαq show no decrease in the ability to activate Rap1 in response to epinephrine but show a partial reduction in ADP-stimulated Rap1 activation. This result, combined with studies of human platelets treated with ADP receptor-selective inhibitors, indicates that ADP-stimulated Rap1 activation in human platelets is dependent on both the Gαi-coupled P2Y12 receptor and the Gαq-coupled P2Y1 receptor. Gαi-dependent activation of Rap1 in platelets does not appear to be mediated by enhanced intracellular calcium release because no increase in intracellular calcium concentration was detected in response to epinephrine and because the calcium response to ADP was not diminished in platelets from the Gαi2−/− mouse. Finally, using human platelets treated with selective inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mouse platelets selectively lacking the Gβγ-activated form of his enzyme (PI3Kγ), we show that Gi-mediated Rap1 activation is PI3K-dependent. In summary, activation of Rap1 can be stimulated by Gαi- and PI3K-dependent mechanisms in platelets and by Gq- and Ca2+-dependent mechanisms, both of which may play a role in promoting platelet activation.

Circulating platelets adhere to collagen with the help of von Willebrand factor and become activated and release soluble mediators, such as ADP and thromboxane A2. These, in turn, along with locally generated thrombin, help to extend platelet plug formation (1Woulfe D. Yang J. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Brass L.F. Michelson A.D. Platelets. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). With the exception of collagen, most platelet agonists, including thrombin, ADP, thromboxane A2, and epinephrine, activate platelets by binding to one or more classes of G protein-coupled receptors on the platelet surface (2Brass L.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1663-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), leading to the exposure of fibrinogen binding sites on αIIbβ3 that are required for platelet aggregation. It has been established previously that a rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is sufficient to activate αIIbβ3. It has also been shown that most platelet agonists trigger Ca2+ entry into the cytosol by binding to receptors coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein Gq, the activated α subunit of which (Gαq) can activate phospholipase Cβ (3Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, mouse platelets lacking Gαq and human platelets with a decrease in expression of this α subunit have a defect in platelet function (3Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar,4Gabbeta J. Yang X. Kowalska M.A. Sun L. Dhanasekaran N. Rao A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8750-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to Gq, human platelets express four members of the Gi family of G proteins, Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, and Gz (5Woulfe D. Yang J. Brass L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1503-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Gagnon A.W. Manning D.R. Catani L. Gewirtz A. Poncz M. Brass L.F.

It has become increasingly appreciated that receptors coupled to Gi family members, like those coupled to Gq, play an important role in stimulating platelet activation, but the details of that role are less well understood (8Foster C.J. Prosser D.M. Agans J.M. Zhai Y. Smith M.D. Lachowicz J.E. Zhang F.L. Gustafson E. Monsma F.J., Jr. Wiekowski M.T. Abbondanzo S.J. Cook D.N. Bayne M.L. Lira S.A. Chintala M.S. J. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The coupling of Gi family members to the receptors for platelet agonists is selective. This is best illustrated by recent studies on platelets from genetically engineered mice lacking the α subunit for a particular Gi family member. For example, of the two most highly expressed Gi proteins in platelets, Gz couples preferentially to the α2A adrenergic receptor for epinephrine (11Yang J., Wu, J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas Gi2 is preferred by the ADP receptor P2Y12 (12Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Loss of Gαi2 impairs platelet responses to ADP, and loss of Gαz impairs the ability of epinephrine to potentiate platelet aggregation by other agonists. Given the defect in platelet function caused by the loss of individual Gi family members, it is reasonable to ask what signaling pathways are modulated by the activation of receptors coupled to these proteins. One generally accepted role is the inhibition of cAMP formation by adenylyl cyclase because it is clear that large increases in the cAMP concentration will inhibit platelet responses to agonists. However, whereas both Gz and Gi2 can clearly inhibit adenylyl cyclase, this cannot be their only role because the addition of membrane-permeable adenylyl cyclase inhibitors does not cause platelet activation equivalent to that caused by stimulation of the α2A or P2Y12 receptors (13Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Kim Y.B. Kunapuli S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), nor do these inhibitors reverse the phenotype produced by loss of Gαz. 1J. Yang, J. Wu, H. Jiang, R. Mortensen, S. Austin, D. R. Manning, D. Woulfe, and L. F. Brass, manuscript in preparation.1J. Yang, J. Wu, H. Jiang, R. Mortensen, S. Austin, D. R. Manning, D. Woulfe, and L. F. Brass, manuscript in preparation.Therefore, one goal of this study was to identify effectors other than adenylyl cyclase downstream of Gi activation that might promote platelet activation. Recently, the small GTPase Rap1 has emerged as a candidate regulator of integrin activation. Several investigators have already revealed a role for Rap1 in controlling activation of β2 integrins in a number of cell lines (14Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that constitutively active forms of Rap1A expressed as a transgene in T cells increase adhesion to fibronectin through avidity modulation of β1 and β2 integrins (17Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Like other Ras family members, Rap1 is activated by the binding of GTP and inactivated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Of the two isoforms of Rap1 found in humans (Rap1A and Rap1B, which differ by only 9 amino acids), Rap1B is highly expressed in human platelets and is rapidly activated by agonists that increase the cytosolic Ca2+concentration, provoking speculation that this small GTPase may play a role in activation of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (18Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Indeed, a preliminary report by Bertoni et al. (19Bertoni, A., Tadokoro, S., Eto, K., Pampori, N., Parise, L. V., White, G. C., and Shattil, S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277,in pressGoogle Scholar) in which dominant negative forms of Rap1 were expressed in megakaryocytes suggests that this is the case. The precise mechanism by which a rise in cytosolic Ca2+leads to platelet integrin activation remains unclear, as does the means by which Gi family members potentiate platelet activation. The possibility that activation of Rap1 might provide a common mechanism for both Gi- and Gq-mediated platelet activation led us to investigate whether Gi family members were capable of activating Rap1 independently of Gq-stimulated calcium release. We show here that both epinephrine- and ADP-stimulated Rap1 activation are diminished in platelets deficient in selected Gifamily members and retained in platelets from mice lacking Gαq, providing evidence that Rap1 is activated by Gi family members in mouse platelets. Using ADP receptor-selective inhibitors, we further demonstrate that ADP-dependent Rap1 activation is also stimulated by Gi-coupled receptors in human platelets. The activation of Rap1 is not as robust as that seen after the addition of thrombin, but in neither case is the Gi-mediated activation of Rap1 dependent on a detectable increase in Ca2+. Finally, using human platelets treated with selective inhibitors of PI3K2 and mouse platelets selectively lacking the Gβγ-activated form of this enzyme (PI3Kγ), we show that Gi-mediated Rap1 activation is PI3K-dependent. These results support and extend those reported very recently by Lova et al. (20Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and complement observations on Rap1 activation by collagen by Larson et al.(21Larson M.K. Chen H.

Gαz−/− mice were generated as describled previously (11Yang J., Wu, J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2000; 287: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Human platelets were isolated as described previously (18Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), washed once in HEN (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5), and resuspended at a concentration of 4 × 108 platelets/ml in HEPES-Tyrodes buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5.6 mmglucose, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, and 3.3 mmNaH2PO4). Platelets were isolated from mice essentially as described previously (11Yang J., Wu, J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Platelets from four mice of each genotype were combined for each experiment and washed once in HEN before being resuspended at a concentration of 4 × 108 platelets/ml in HEPES-Tyrodes buffer. Activated Rap1 was precipitated from platelet lysates as described previously (24Franke B. van Triest M. de Bruijn K.M. van Willigen G. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Negrier C. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5-ml fractions of washed platelets (4 × 108 platelets/ml) were treated with agonist or vehicle for 5 min at room temperature and then lysed with 0.5 ml of 2× lysis buffer (final concentrations: 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 μmaprotinin) for 5 min at 4 °C. Activated (GTP-bound) Rap1 was precipitated from the lysate by incubation (2 h at 4 °C) with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose precoupled to 15 μg of GST-conjugated RalGDS-RBD (a generous gift of Dr. J. Meinkoth, University of Pennsylvania). Precipitated beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then eluted in 1× Laemmli buffer. Boiled samples were applied to 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-Rap1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Quantitative analysis of Rap1-GTP bands was accomplished by comparing the density of immunoblot bands with NIH Image software and then dividing the density obtained in agonist-treated samples by that from untreated platelets to obtain the fold increase in Rap1-GTP, which was averaged from multiple experiments. Human platelets were isolated and washed as described above and incubated with 5 μm Fura-2AM in HEN for 1 h at 37 °C. Platelets were then washed once with HEN and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrodes buffer at a concentration of 4 × 108 platelets/ml, and cytosolic calcium concentrations were calculated by measuring the ratio of changes in Fura-2 fluorescence in an SLM/Aminco model AB2 fluorescence spectrophotomer with excitation at dual wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm and emission spectra measured at 510 nm. To understand more about the mechanisms by which Gifamily members contribute to platelet reactivity and to determine if potentially calcium-independent mechanisms of Rap1 activation exist in platelets, we examined Rap1 activation in human platelets activated with epinephrine, which does not elicit a detectable increase in cytosolic Ca2+. In Fig. 1, platelets were incubated with an agonist or buffer alone and lysed. GTP-bound Rap1 was precipitated with GST-conjugated RalGDS-RBD and detected by immunoblotting. There was little, if any, Rap1-GTP detected in resting platelets. All of the agonists tested caused an increase in Rap1 activation. Thrombin was consistently the most robust stimulus (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4), followed by ADP and epinephrine. In human platelets, epinephrine stimulated an average 4.5-fold increase in GTP binding to Rap1 relative to buffer alone (n = 10), ADP stimulated an average 10.5-fold increase (n = 9), and thrombin stimulated a 48-fold increase (n = 6) in Rap1-GTP binding (Fig.1 A). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1,B and C. Fig. 1 B shows the amount of Rap1-GTP precipitated with GST-conjugated RalGDS-RBD by each agonist relative to total Rap1 contained in 25 μl of each lysate. By immunoblotting Rap-GTP-depleted lysate from one such experiment, we calculated that ADP caused GTP loading of about 30% of total platelet Rap1 and that thrombin stimulated about 65% of total platelet Rap1. Epinephrine, which activates α2A adrenergic receptors coupled to Gz in platelets, activated about 10% of platelet Rap1. Thrombin and ADP cause a readily detectable increase in cytosolic Ca2+.

It has previously been shown that the α2Aadrenergic receptor on platelets couples to Gz and that the ability of epinephrine to potentiate aggregation in response to other agonists is greatly diminished in mice lacking Gαz (11Yang J., Wu, J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Whereas the wild-type mice exhibit a Rap1 activation profile similar to that seen in humans, the Gαz−/− mice activate Rap normally in response to ADP and thrombin but have a diminished ability to activate Rap1 in response to epinephrine. This Gz-dependent Rap activation does not appear to be due to general changes in calcium signaling in Gαz−/− mice because epinephrine alone had no effect on [Ca2+] i in either the knockout or the wild-type mouse platelets. The Gαz−/− platelets have a normal calcium transient in response to ADP and thrombin, although, as expected, the ability of epinephrine to potentiate the calcium transient induced by ADP or thrombin is diminished in the knockout mice (Fig. 2 B). To determine if other Gi family members can also contribute to Rap-GTP signaling, Rap activation was tested in Gαi2−/− mice. Platelets from these mice have been shown to have a diminished ability to aggregate in response to ADP (12Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Rap1 was activated normally by epinephrine, ADP, and thrombin in wild-type littermates of Gαi2−/− mice. However, in contrast to the activation profile seen with Gαz−/− mice, Gαi2−/− mice exhibited a markedly reduced response to ADP and thrombin but a normal response to epinephrine (Fig.3 A). These data, together with the result that Rap1 activation in response to all three agonists was normal in platelets from Gαi3−/− mice (data not shown), confirm the expectation that the recently cloned ADP receptor, P2Y12, couples predominantly to Gαi2 in platelets and that Gαi2 is also capable of leading to Rap1 activation. (Gαi3−/− mice have a normal aggregation response to epinephrine, ADP, and thrombin). 1J. Yang, J. Wu, H. Jiang, R. Mortensen, S. Austin, D. R. Manning, D. Woulfe, and L. F. Brass, manuscript in preparation. Again, because Rap1 activation by ADP and thrombin was affected in Gαi2−/− mice, the ability of wild-type miceversus Gαi2−/− mice to increase intracellular calcium in response to these agonists was tested to determine whether reduced calcium mobilization could account for the diminished Rap1 response to ADP and thrombin in Gαi2−/− mice. However, calcium transients in response to 10 μmADP or 1 unit/ml thrombin (the same concentrations applied in the Rap1 activation assays) were not reduced in platelets from Gαi2−/− mice compared with their wild-type littermates, making this unlikely (Fig. 3 B). To confirm that the observed Gi-dependent signals were not dependent on activation of Gq, for example due to thromboxane A2 release from activated platelets, we tested Rap1 activation in platelets from Gαq−/− mice. Compared with their wild-type littermates, Gαq−/− mice responded normally to epinephrine but had a slightly reduced response to ADP and a much diminished activation by thrombin (Fig. 4). It has been shown that the increase in cytosolic calcium initiated by both thrombin and ADP is entirely dependent on Gαq (3Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), an observation that we confirmed (Fig. 4 B; data not shown). Therefore, the activation of Rap1 by ADP that is retained in Gαq−/− mice is not due to intracellular calcium release. These results are consistent with the idea that ADP activates two receptors on platelets, a Gq-coupled receptor (P2Y1) and a Gi-coupled receptor (P2Y12), each of which is capable of independently leading to Rap1 activation. Thrombin activates mouse platelets via PAR4 with an assist from PAR3 (26Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Murine PAR4 does not appear to couple to Gi family members, and therefore the residual Rap1 activation observed by thrombin in Gαq−/−platelets is probably due to activation of Gi2 by released ADP. This would also account for the reduced activation of Rap1 by thrombin in Gαi2−/− mouse platelets (Fig. 3). As described above, ADP activates platelets by binding to two receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. To determine whether Rap1 can be activated in a Gi-dependent manner in human as well as mouse platelets, human platelets were stimulated with ADP in the presence of saturating concentrations of the P2Y1 receptor antagonist A3P5PS to allow selective activation of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor. Saturation of P2Y1 sites was confirmed by demonstrating complete blockade of the calcium transient initiated by the concentration of ADP used in the Rap1 activation assay (Fig. 5 C). The Rap1 activation signal was diminished but retained under these conditions in both human and mouse platelets (Fig. 5, B and A, respectively). In contrast, the P2Y12-selective inhibitors MeSAMP (see Fig. 5, A and B) and ARL-66096 (data not shown) nearly abolished the activation of Rap1 by ADP, consistent with a Gi -dependent mechanism. Therefore, it appears that in both mouse and human platelets, ADP activates Rap1 predominantly via Gi2, even though its receptors also couple to Gq. To begin to dissect the mechanism by which Gifamily members lead to Rap1 activation, platelets stimulated with epinephrine or with ADP plus the P2Y1 antagonist A3P5PS (to restrict the ADP response to P2Y12) were exposed to inhibitors of adenylyl cycase or PI3K and tested for Rap1 activation. To determine whether Gi-dependent Rap1 activation is simply a consequence of reduced levels of cAMP in the platelets, we tested Rap1 activation in the presence of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536. SQ22536 at 300 μm inhibited cAMP production stimulated by PGI2 to levels that were comparable to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase caused by ADP (data not shown) but failed to cause Rap1 activation or to potentiate the activation caused by epinephrine (Fig. 6 A). This suggests that the ability to stimulate Rap1 is not simply a function of depressing basal cAMP concentrations. Hirsch et al. (27Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have shown that ADP-stimulated platelets from PI3Kγ-null mice exhibit reduced fibrinogen binding compared with wild-type platelets. Because βγ subunits released from Gi family members have been shown to stimulate PI3Kγ, we tested the effect of two PI3K inhibitors on Rap1 activation in human platelets. Again, ADP was used in combination with A3P5PS to restrict receptor activation to P2Y12. Both PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (data not shown) and LY294002 (Fig. 6) inhibited Rap1 activated by eit"

The six chains assemble into three different triple helical protomers and self-associate as three distinct networks. The network underlies all epithelia as a component of basement membranes, which play important roles in cell adhesion, growth, differentiation, tissue repair and molecular ultrafiltration. The specificity of both protomer and network assembly is governed by amino acid sequences of the C-terminal noncollagenous (NC1) domain of each chain. In this study, the structural basis for protomer and network assembly was investigated by determining the crystal structure of the ubiquitous [(alpha1)(2).alpha2](2) NC1 hexamer of bovine lens capsule basement membrane at 2.0 A resolution. The NC1 monomer folds into a novel tertiary structure. The (alpha1)(2).alpha2 trimer is organized through the unique three-dimensional domain swapping interactions. The differences in the primary sequences of the hypervariable region manifest in different secondary structures, which determine the chain specificity at the monomer-monomer interfaces. The trimer-trimer interface is stabilized by the extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions without a need for disulfide cross-linking."

In the present study, we used Stat1 knockout tumor cells to determine (1) whether Stat1 can regulate angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of tumor cells; and (2) whether Stat1 is required for the inhibitory effect of IFN-β on the expression of angiogenic factor bFGF. Highly tumorigenic and metastatic RAD-105 tumor cells derived from a fibrosarcoma of a Stat1 knockout mouse were reconstituted with a Stat1 expression vector. The reconstitution of Stat1 suppressed the tumorigenicity and metastasis of RAD-105 cells in nude mice which correlated with a decreased microvessel density and decreased expression of proangiogenic molecules bFGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in vivo. Moreover, noncytotoxic concentrations of IFN-β significantly inhibited the in vitro expression of bFGF in the Stat1-reconstituted cells but not in the Stat1-deficient cells, which was consistent with decreased bFGF expression of Stat1-reconstituted tumors in vivo. Therefore, Stat1 is essential for IFN-mediated inhibition of bFGF production, suggesting that tumor-intrinsic Stat1 is an important mediator for antiangiogenic signals, such as IFN. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Stat1 expressed by tumor cells is a negative regulator of tumor angiogenesis and, hence, tumor growth and metastasis."

To evaluate the involvement of these genes in bladder cancer, we screened a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 2317 samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Amplification was found for MDM2 in 5.1%, for CDK4 in 1.1%, and for GLI in 0.4% of interpretable tumors. Among tumors having amplification of at least one of these 12q13-q15 genes, 76.6% had amplification of MDM2 alone and 6.4% had amplification of CDK4 alone. Coamplifications were seen of MDM2 and CDK4 in 10.6%, and of CDK4 and GLI in 6.4%. Neither coamplifications of all three genes nor isolated GLI amplifications were found. These data suggest a prominent role of MDM2 as a 12q13-q15 amplification target in bladder cancer. However, independent CDK4 amplifications do also occur suggesting either two non-overlapping amplification sites or else a minimal overlapping region between MDM2 and CDK4 perhaps containing another yet unknown oncogene. The frequency of amplification increased significantly from stage pTa to pT1-4 (P<0.04) and from low to high grade (P<0.005). These data are consistent with a high level of genetic instability in invasively growing and high-grade bladder tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2032828747,"A DNA microarray analysis identified the BH3-only BCL-2 family member, BIK/NBK, as a transcript that is upregulated during induction of apoptosis by oncogenic E1A. E1A depended on wild-type p53 to induce BIK and activate the death program. Further, p53 independently induced BIK RNA and protein, and BIK alone stimulated cell death in p53-null cells, dependent on the activation of caspases. BIK function, however, was abrogated by a disabling point mutation within the BH3 domain. Collectively, these results argue that BIK is a downstream apoptotic effector of p53 in response to a physiological p53-mediated death stimulus provided by E1A. Elevated BCL-2 functioned downstream of p53 and BIK induction to inhibit the E1A death pathway, with the ratio of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and pro-apoptotic BIK determining cell death or survival in E1A-expressing cells. Cells expressing BCL-2 or treated with the pan caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, allowed accumulation of high levels of cytotoxic BIK compared to control cells. Of note, a significant fraction of either ectopic or endogenous BIK was found associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that this organelle, in addition to mitochondria, may be a target of BIK function."

To better understand how the binding modes of NF-κB on its two best studied DNA targets might contribute to promoter-specific transcription, this structure is compared with the previously determined complex crystal structure containing NF-κB bound to the Ig κ light chain gene enhancer as well as to a second NF-κB·Ig κ light chain gene enhancer complex also reported in this paper. The global binding modes of all NF-κB·DNA complex structures are similar, although crystal-packing interactions lead to differences between identical complexes of the same crystallographic asymmetric unit. An extensive network of stacked amino acid side chains that contribute to base-specific DNA contacts is conserved among the three complexes. Consistent with earlier reports, however, the IFNβ-κB DNA is bent significantly less by NF-κB than is the Ig κ light chain gene enhancer. This and other small structural changes may play a role in explaining why NF-κB-directed transcription is sensitive to the context of specific promoters. The precise molecular mechanism behind the involvement of the high mobility group protein I(Y) in interferon β enhanceosome formation remains elusive."

Well known examples include O2 storage with myoglobin, O2 carriage with hemoglobin, mediators of electron transfer with cytochromes, and catalytic activation of heme ligands with P450s and peroxidases (1Antonini E.

Recently, a new class of heme enzymes involved in intramolecular signal transduction is emerging, known as heme-based sensors (4Rogers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5-Google Scholar, 6Chan M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Almost of all the heme-based sensors contain two different functional domains as follows: one is an N-terminal heme domain, which acts a sensor, and the other is a catalytic domain such as a histidine kinase or a soluble guanylate cyclase. These heme sensor enzymes use the heme for mediating transcriptional and regulatory events associated with the presence of gaseous molecules such as CO, NO, and O2 (4Rogers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5-Google Scholar, 6Chan M.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, the ligand association or dissociation from the heme iron leads to protein conformational changes, which transmit signals to the other domain where they initiate catalytic function or DNA binding. For example, the CooA1 protein fromRhodospirillum rubrum is a CO sensor heme protein that regulates the expression of the coo genes associated with CO-dependent growth (Refs. 7Nakajima H. Nakagawa E.

Soluble guanylate cyclase is an NO sensor heme protein that regulates conversion of 5′-GTP to the intracellular second messenger, cGMP (Refs.9Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hem-AT-Bs and Hem-AT-Hs are oxygen sensors in which the hemes are thought to mediate signal transduction for methylation of the chemotaxis proteins (11Hou S. Larsen R.W. Boudko D. Riley C.W.

Biol. 2001; 308: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholarand references therein). Dissociation of O2 from FixL Fe(II) heme initiates its histidine kinase function in another subunit in FixL. The phosphate group transfers to an Asp residue of FixJ. Phosphorylated FixJ then acts as a transcriptional activator of thenifA and fixK genes, which controls the expression of nitrogen fixation genes and a high affinity terminal oxidase complex, respectively. The N-terminal portion of FixL consists of a heme sensory domain whose sequence and tertiary structure characterize it as a PAS domain. PAS is an acronym formed from the names of the proteins in which imperfect repeat sequences were first recognized as follows: the Drosophila period clock protein (PER) (15Jackson F.R. Bargiello T.A. Yun S.H. Young M.W. Nature. 1986; 320: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), vertebrate aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (16Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F.

Based on the sequence homology of the heme sensor enzyme, FixL, Gilles-Gonzales group identified a heme domain with a PAS sequence fromEscherichia coli (designated Ec DOS for E. coli direct oxygen sensor) (18Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). They characterized the physicochemical properties of the isolated heme domain ofEc DOS. However, they did not report cloning of the full-length protein or characterize its catalytic function. The same groups cloned a phosphodiesterase (PDE) A1 protein fromAcetobacter xylinum (designated AxPDEA1) and found that it is a key regulator of bacterial cellulose synthesis (19Chang A.L. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikan D. Benziman M. Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3420-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). AxPDEA1 linearizes cyclic bis(3′,5′)diguanylic acid, an allosteric activator of the bacterial cellulose synthase. The N-terminal 140 amino acids of AxPDEA1 contain the heme-binding PAS motif. The PDE activity of the C-terminal domain of AxPDEA1 has been well characterized (19Chang A.L. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikan D. Benziman M. Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3420-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Importantly, AxPDEA1 is highly homologous over its entire length to theEc DOS protein (18Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was speculated thatEc DOS would be functionally similar. In the present study, we report for the first time the isolation of cDNA for full-length wild type Ec DOS, expression inE. coli, and characterization of its functions under various conditions. Mutations at the heme-binding site enabled one of the axial ligands to the heme to be identified. Importantly, it was found thatEc DOS has PDE activity toward cAMP, only when the heme is in the ferrous form. Its activity was strongly inhibited by heme ligands such as CO and NO and a selective PDE inhibitor. Thus, this work proves that this enzyme is a PDE with a redox-sensitive heme sensor.

On the other hand, the pET28a(+) vector has two XmnI sites. Therefore, at first, the Ec DOS gene was transferred into the pKF19 vector, which does not have these restriction enzyme sites. Oligonucleotides between these sites, which have mutation in the position of expected heme-bound histidine, were synthesized and inserted into the Ec DOS gene. The sequence was checked by Sanger's method using an automatic sequencer DSQ-2000L (Shimadzu Co.). Finally, Ec DOS-PAS gene mutants were transferred into the pET28 vector and expressed by the same method of Ec DOS full-length wild type. Ec DOS and the isolated Ec DOS-PAS domain were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells. Another plasmid, pGroESL, was co-transformed for expression of chaperon proteins GroES and GroEL. A single colony was picked and shaken in LB medium at 37 °C overnight. Then 0.5 ml of overnight culture was put into 500 ml of TB medium and shaken at 37 °C. The E. colicells that contain two kinds of plasmids were cultured in TB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol until anA 600 nm up to 1.2 at 37 °C. Then 0.05 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 0.45 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid were added to the culture medium, and further incubation with mild shaking at 25 °C was continued for another 24 h. After incubation, the E. coli cells were harvested and crushed in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 10% glycerol) containing aprotinin (final concentration 2 μg/ml), leupeptin (final concentration 2 μg/ml), pepstatin (final concentration 2 mg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration 1 mm), and 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration 1 mm) by an Ultrasonic Disrupter UD-201 (Tomy Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to precipitate the proteins. Ec DOS and the isolated Ec DOS-PAS domain were collected from 0 to 50% and 30–70% (NH4)2SO4 solutions by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, respectively. The precipitates were resolved in buffer A. The solution was passed though a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with buffer A, to remove (NH4)2SO4. The eluted solution was then applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 20 mmimidazole. The column was washed with buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with buffer A containing 120 mm imidazole. The fractions containing theEc DOS protein were pooled and concentrated. Before using the protein, imidazole was removed on a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column. For spectral experiments, DOS-PAS protein was further purified by a gel filtration column of Sephadex G-75 (16 × 60 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer. Finally the purified protein was quickly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The purifications of Ec DOS and the isolated PAS domain were checked and found to be more than 95% homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. Yields of Ec DOS and the isolated PAS domain were 210 and 610 nmol, respectively, from 1 liter of E. coli culture in terms of the heme absorbance at 417 nm (18Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Ec DOS was incubated at 37 °C with ant-cAMP or ant-cGMP in a reaction mixture of 500 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) and 2 mmMgCl2. To terminate the reaction, Ec DOS was removed by using an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA), and 2 units of alkaline phosphatase (Takara Syuzo Co.) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was applied to a column of DEAE-Sephadex and washed with water. Finally, the fluorescence intensity (excitation at 330–350 nm, emission at 410 nm) of the eluted fraction was measured to determine the amount of product (20Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13354-13358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kincaid R.L. Manganeillo V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 159: 457-477Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At least four experiments were conducted to obtain each value; experimental errors are less than 20%. Assays for bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate, andp-nitrophenyl phosphate were carried out in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm substrate, and 0.05–5 μm Ec DOS. The total volume was 2 ml, and this reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Then 1 ml of 0.5 n NaOH was added to the solution to stop the reaction, and the absorbance at 400 nm was measured. The reaction of the Ec DOS Fe(III) complex was performed under aerobic conditions. In the case of the Fe(II) complex, the enzyme was reduced by sodium dithionite in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere with an O2 concentration of less than 50 ppm (22Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sodium dithionite was removed using a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-25). The enzyme reaction was also carried out in the glove box. The CO concentration was controlled by addition of CO-saturated buffer (about 1 mm CO) to the reaction mixture. The NO concentration was controlled by addition of (±)-(E)-Methyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyiminol]-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexenamide (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), which releases NO in aqueous solution (23Nakano R. Sato H. Watanabe A. Ito O. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8570-8574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). (±)-(E)-Methyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyiminol]-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexenamide was dissolved in an adequate amount of Me2SO, and the Me2SO solution was added to the reaction mixture before initiating the reaction. The reaction tubes were sealed to prevent the diffusion of these molecules. All other conditions were the same as described above. PDE inhibitors, etazolate, hydrochloride, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were dissolved in an adequate amount of water or ethanol, respectively, and then the solution was added to the reaction mixture to make a final concentration of 2 μm. All other conditions were the same as described above. Spectral experiments under aerobic conditions were carried out on Shimadzu UV-1650, UV-2500, and Hitachi U-2010 spectrophotometers maintained at 25 °C by a temperature controller. Anaerobic spectral experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer in a glove box. When the heme was reduced by sodium dithionite, excess dithionite was always removed using Sephadex G-25 column in the glove box. Redox potentials were obtained on the same spectrometer in the glove box. 2,3,5,6-Tetramethylphenylenediamine,N-ethylphenazonium ethosulfate, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone were added as mediators to the sample before titration. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with Shimadzu RF-500 and RF-5300PC spectrofluorophotometers. CD spectra were obtained with a JASCO 2000 CD spectrometer. To ensure that the temperature of the solution was appropriate, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min prior to spectroscopic measurements. Titration experiments were repeated at least three times for each complex. Regression analyses were performed, and lines giving an optimum correlation coefficient were selected (23Nakano R. Sato H. Watanabe A. Ito O. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8570-8574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Experimental errors were less than 20%. Gel filtrations were carried out using AKTA liquid chromatography system equipped with Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The buffer used for gel filtrations contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Optical absorption spectra of Fe(III), Fe(II), Fe(II)-CO, Fe(II)-NO and Fe(II)-O2complexes of Ec DOS are shown in Fig.1 and summarized in TableI. The Soret and visible absorption peaks of Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)-CO complexes of Ec DOS were essentially the same as those of the isolated Ec DOS PAS domain (18Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The spectra of the Fe(III) and Fe(II) complexes ofEc DOS are typical of six-coordinate low spin complexes, which is different from those of the related enzyme, FixL, in which both Fe(III) and Fe(II) complexes are penta-coordinate high spin complexes (13Mukai M. Nakamura K. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13810-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. J. Mol.

Fe(III) Ec DOS has a sharp Soret band at 417 nm and distinct α- and β-bands in the 500–600 nm region, whereas Fe(III) FixL has a broad blue-shifted Soret band at 396 nm and a broad band at around 500 nm, typical of a penta-coordinate complex. The spectra of Fe(II) Ec DOS has a Soret band at 428 nm and well resolved α- and β-bands in the visible region, with the α-band (563 nm) being more intense than the β-band (532 nm), similar to those of AxPDEA1, whereas Fe(II) FixL has a Soret absorption band at 437 nm and a broad band at around 556 nm, typical of a high spin complex (13Mukai M. Nakamura K. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13810-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. J. Mol.

The Fe(II)-O2 complex of Ec DOS was formed by adding saturated O2 solution to the Fe(II) complex. This had an absorption at 417 nm, similar to that of the isolated PAS domain (18Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The Fe(II)-O2 complex was unstable and gradually changed the Fe(III) complex. Autoxidation of the Ec DOS Fe(II)-O2 complex to the Fe(III) complex as monitored at 579 nm was composed of a single phase with rate constant about 1.5 × 10−2 min−1.Table IOptical absorption maxima of Ec DOS, AxPDEA1, and FixL; all of them have heme-bound PAS domain (nm) EcDOS1-aAbsorption peaks ofEc DOS were essentially the same as those of EcDOS PAS domain (18).AxPDEA11-bRef. 19.FixL1-cRef. 18.SoretVisibleSoretVisibleSoretVisibleFe(III)417530, 564Not reported395509, 645Fe(II)428532, 563432550, 573437556Fe(II)-CO423540, 570Same as Ec DOS PAS427548, 560Fe(II)-NO419537, 563Not reportedNot reportedFe(II)-O2417541, 579Same as EcDOS PAS419545, 5621-a Absorption peaks ofEc DOS were essentially the same as those of EcDOS PAS domain (18Delgado-Nixon V.M.

Open table in a new tab In order to identify the axial ligands, the effect of modulating pH on the absorption bands was examined. When the pH of the wild type solution was varied from neutral to acidic, heavy precipitates were formed. On the other hand, isolated Ec DOS PAS domain was stable but was insensitive to changes in pH from 5 to 9.5. Clear decreases in the intensity of the absorption spectra of the PAS domain were observed outside this range (not shown). Denaturation rather than axial ligand substitution is probably responsible for these effects. From the ultraviolet region of the CD spectrum (Fig.2 A), the α-helix content ofEc DOS was estimated as 54% (CONTINLL program; 53% by the SELCON3 program; 56% by the CDSSTR program). β-Sheet content was estimated to be about 10%. Reduction of the heme iron did not change the CD spectrum in the ultraviolet region. The Soret CD band of the resting Fe(III) complex was located at 421 nm on the plus side with Δε = 8 × 104m−1cm−1 (Fig. 2 B). Reduction by sodium dithionite shifted the band position to 425 nm and markedly increased the CD intensity up to Δε = 2 × 105m−1 cm−1. The Fe(II)-CO complex had a Soret band at 431 nm on the plus side with Δε = 1 × 105m−1 cm−1. Ec DOS has 16 Trp residues, whereas Ec DOS PAS has 2 Trp residues. The fluorescence bands attributable to Trp are located at 336 and 333 nm (excitation at 285 nm) for Ec DOS and the isolated Ec DOS PAS domain, respectively (Fig.2 C). The fluorescence intensity of Ec DOS PAS was half that of Ec DOS. Electrochemical titrations were conducted for the isolatedEc DOS PAS domain. The one-electron midpoint potential of the Ec DOS heme was determined from the absorbance change at 562 nm. Half saturation points were +70 ± 1 mV for reduction and +63 ± 8 mV for oxidation (Fig. 3). No marked difference between the titration patterns in the two directions was observed. Therefore, the redox potential of heme in the isolated Ec DOS PAS domain was estimated to be +67 mVversus SHE (n = 0.90). In order to identify the heme axial ligands of the Ec DOS PAS domain, site-directed mutagenesis of both His residues in the isolated PAS domain (His-77 and His-83) was conducted. As shown in Fig.4, the His-83 → Gly and His-83 → Ala mutants had tight heme-binding capabilities and showed typical heme absorption maxima at 417 nm, similar to that of the wild type PAS domain. In contrast, the His-77 → Gly and His-77 → Ala mutants had only very small absorption bands at the Soret region, suggesting that very little heme was bound to these proteins consistent with His-77 being one of the heme axial ligands. Purified Ec DOS protein and the isolatedEc DOS PAS domain protein were located at 93- and 19-kDa molecular masses on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.5, A and B). These molecular masses, including the His6 tag (about 2 kDa), are close to values predicted from amino acid sequences of both proteins. Gel filtration was conducted to determine the molecular mass ofEc DOS (Fig. 5, C and D). The estimated molecular mass of Ec DOS was 320 kDa, suggesting that it is a tetramer. The molecular mass of the PAS domain was similarly estimated to be 30 kDa (data not shown), suggesting it is a dimer, as previously thought, even though the estimated mass is smaller than the calculated value (18Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since the amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of Ec DOS is homologous to that of AxPDEA1, cAMP or cGMP are the most probable substrates ofEc DOS. Ant-cAMP was assayed for activity with EcDOS. Only the Fe(II) complex of Ec DOS had enzyme-dependent PDE activity with cAMP (Fig.6). We did not see detectable activity with the Fe(II)-O2 complex of Ec DOS perhaps due to its very low turnover number or its instability. The Fe(II)-O2 complex steadily decomposed to the Fe(III) complex as mentioned above, which had no PDE activity. The activity of cGMP with Fe(II) Ec DOS was marginal. Bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate, universal substrates for many PDEs, were not substrates forEc DOS. The optimum reaction temperature was found to be between 30 and 40 °C. Thus, all catalytic activities were obtained at 37 °C in the present study. The pH optimum for catalysis was found to be around pH 8.5 (not shown). It was reported that divalent metal cations such as Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ can support PDE activity, whereas Ca2+ is virtually ineffective (21Kincaid R.L. Manganeillo V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 159: 457-477Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mg2+ was the most effective dication for supporting catalysis with Ec DOS; Ca2+ and Mn2+ were much less effective, and Zn2+ was ineffective (not shown). Addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol to the catalytic solution enhanced the activity by 30%. This may be due to reduction of interprotein disulfide bonds, causing a decrease in the amount of aggregated enzyme, as indicated by gel filtration chromatography (not shown). The turnover number of the enzyme under optimum conditions was 0.15 μmol/min/μmol of heme. In order to confirm that the Fe(II) heme regulates catalysis, CO and NO were added to the catalytic solution. As shown in Fig. 7, CO and NO markedly inhibited turnover. The IC50 values of CO and NO are about 1 μm or less. Dissociation constants for CO and NO were about 0.3 and 0.5 μm, respectively, for Fe(II)Ec DOS, estimated by optical absorption titration (not shown). Note that dissociation constants were calculated from the free CO or NO concent"

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are required for the development of specific subpopulations of neurons, but how they contribute to their ordered genesis is unclear. We show that the ability of bHLH factors to regulate the development of distinct neuronal subtypes in the Xenopus retina depends upon the timing of their function. In addition, we find that the timing of bHLH function can be regulated posttranslationally, so that bHLH factors with overlapping expression can function independently. Specifically, XNeuroD function in the retina can be inhibited by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), while Xath5 function can be inhibited by Notch. Thus, the potential of bHLH factors to regulate the development of neuronal subtypes depends upon the context in which they function."

To investigate how the brain represents such sequences, we devised an oculomotor sequence task in which the monkey had to choose the target solely by the sequential context, not by the current stimulus combination. We found that many neurons in the supplementary eye field (SEF) became active with a specific target direction (D neuron) or a specific target/distractor combination (C neuron). Furthermore, such activity was often selective for one among several sequences that included the combination (S neuron). These results suggest that the SEF contributes to the generation of saccades in many learned sequences."

A novel c-type heme, Heme 1, with lysine and water or hydroxide iron coordination forms the site for substrate binding, and a nearby Ca(II) ion bridges two regions of polypeptide containing key residues for catalysis. Fourc-type hemes, Hemes 2 through 5, withbis-histidine iron coordination accompany Heme 1 and presumably participate in delivering electrons to the active site during catalysis. The hemes are packed in motifs common to a number of proteins, and all nearest neighbor Fe–Fe distances lie below 13 Å. The electrostatic surface of the E. coli enzyme around Heme 2 differs from those of the W. succinogenes and S. deleyianum enzymes and may reflect the distinct redox partners of these enzymes (8Bamford V.A.

A signal with gz ∼ 3.17 characteristic of abis-histidine-coordinated heme Fe(III) with near perpendicular imidazole ring planes titrates withE m,7 = −323 mV and has been attributed to either or both of Hemes 4 and 5. The structure and electrochemical properties of the cytochromec nitrite reductases prompt questions whose answers will underpin an understanding of the mechanism(s) of substrate reduction in these enzymes and about which relatively little is known. For example, can a change of oxidation state at each redox center in the enzyme modulate activity, and if so, is this achieved through changes in electronic or structural properties? Also, given the arrangement of close-packed hemes and in particular the near parallel configuration of Hemes 1, 3, and 4, how are electrons “packaged” for delivery to the substrate and reaction intermediates? Hydroxylamine could be reduced in sequential one-electron steps or a single, concerted two-electron transfer. The possible routes through which the six-electron reduction of nitrite could be achieved are clearly more numerous. There would be an opportunity for the pathways of hydroxylamine and nitrite reduction to overlap if the reduction of nitrite occurs in a series of one- or two-electron transfers (10Einsle O. Messerschmidt A. Stach P. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Kroneck P.M.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, the initial kinetic study of theE. coli enzyme found the Michaelis constant describing hydroxylamine reduction to be more than two orders of magnitude greater than that for nitrite reduction (7Kajie S. Anraku Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that hydroxylamine is not a free intermediate in the reduction of nitrite by this enzyme. Protein film voltammetry (PFV) is a relatively new addition to the range of techniques used to study redox enzymes (13Armstrong F.A. Heering H.A. Hirst J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1997; 26: 169-179Crossref Google Scholar). In this technique the enzyme is immobilized as a (sub-)monolayer, or film, on an electrode surface. Within the film the enzyme undergoes direct electron exchange with the electrode and ideally retains the catalytic properties of the “native” enzyme. When the film contacts a solution of its substrate, the rate at which electrons flow through the enzyme and into the substrate is quantitated by the flow of catalytic current. This current is most informative in the absence of limitations imposed by electron exchange across the electrode:enzyme interface or transport of substrate to the enzyme film. In this situation the current provides a direct measure of the enzyme's intrinsic rate of product formation. This rate will therefore vary in a precise manner in response to defined variation of the electrode potential. For a reductase, variations in activity are defined by changes in the population of reduced, catalytically competent enzyme and the rate-defining step of catalysis. Changes in either of these parameters will give rise to sigmoidal variations of the catalytic current magnitude as the electrochemical potential is varied. As a consequence the catalytic current-potential profiles or waveforms arising from enzyme films frequently show multiple sigmoidal features;i.e. features in which the activity may increase or decrease as the electrode potential is lowered with a concomitant increase in driving force for the reaction being catalyzed (13Armstrong F.A.

It is by visualizing such modulations of activity across the electrochemical potential domain that PFV is able to provide unique insight into the mechanisms of redox enzyme catalysis. Here we present the first PFV study of a cytochrome cnitrite reductase. The catalytic behavior of E. colicytochrome c nitrite reductase has been defined on progression from substrate-limited to enzyme-limited catalysis for both nitrite and hydroxylamine reduction. Distinct fingerprints of catalytic behavior are observed in each case; such fingerprints provide important new insight into the mechanisms by which this enzyme directs substrate reduction. E. coli cytochromec nitrite reductase, NrfA, was purified as described previously and stored as frozen aliquots in liquid nitrogen (8Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Activity was measured spectrophotometrically by substrate-dependent oxidation of dithionite-reduced methyl viologen (ε600 nm = 13,700 m−1cm−1) in 1 mm methyl viologen, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, at 20 °C (8Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The samples used in these experiments had a specific activity of 880 μmol of nitrite consumed min−1mg−1, andA 410 nm/A 280 nm = 3.7 for the oxidized enzyme. Buffer-electrolyte was composed of 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, unless stated otherwise. Dissolution of the desired mass of NaNO2 in ice-cold buffer-electrolyte gave stock solutions of 25 mm NaNO2. The pH was confirmed as 7.0 after equilibration at 20 °C. Stock solutions of 2 mhydroxylamine were prepared by dissolution of NH2OH·HCl in ice-cold buffer-electrolyte. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by addition of an appropriate volume of 10 m NaOH, and the solution was brought to the desired volume with buffer-electrolyte. The pH was confirmed as 7.0 upon equilibration at 20 °C. Reagents were of Analar quality or equivalent. Solutions were prepared with water having total nitrogen content < 0.1 ppm (Fisher). Cyclic voltammetry was performed using a three-electrode cell configuration housed in an N2-filled chamber (atmospheric O2 < 2 ppm) as described previously (14Anderson L.J. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11294-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Pyrolytic graphite edge (PGE) and polycrystalline gold working electrodes of 3-mm diameter were polished immediately prior to use with an aqueous slurry of 0.3-μm Al2O3, sonicated, rinsed, and dried with a tissue. Frozen 5-μl aliquots of 0.6 μm nitrite reductase in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, were taken into the glove box, thawed, and immediately placed on the surface of a freshly prepared working electrode. After approximately 15 s the enzyme solution was removed from the electrode surface, which was then rinsed with room temperature buffer-electrolyte to remove any loosely bound enzyme. Excess buffer-electrolyte was carefully removed from the electrode with a tissue taking care not to dry the electrode surface. The electrode was then placed in the electrochemical cell, and voltammetry commenced. Voltammetry was performed with an Autolab electrochemical analyzer under the control of GPES software. Electrode rotation was with an EG&G model 636 electrode rotator. Potentials are reported with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode by addition of 197 mV to the potential measured with an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode. The experimentally observed catalytic current magnitude, i cat, was determined at −550 mV as the difference between the measured current and the non-catalytic current, the latter estimated by linear extrapolation of the non-catalytic part of the voltammogram. The rate at which electrons passed through the enzyme film during catalysis was obtained on division of i cat by the Faraday constant (96,484 Coulombs mol electrons−1). It was found that the catalytic response observed during hydroxylamine reduction was limited only by the properties of the enzyme. In this situation, i cat, can be equated to the flow of current through the enzyme, icatenzyme, anticipated from a Michaelis-Menten analysis of redox enzyme kinetics,icatenzyme=imaxCsCs+KmEquation 1 where i max is the catalytic current observed at the maximum turnover rate, C S the substrate concentration, and K m the Michaelis constant. Variation of i cat with hydroxylamine concentration was determined in three independent experiments. For each experiment, values of i cat were corrected for the first order loss of signal amplitude with time.K m was then determined from the variation of the time-corrected catalytic current magnitudes withC S. Data were fitted to Equation 1 in Microcal Origin using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for non-linear least-squares curve fitting. The value of K m reported in the text is the average of the three independent experimental determinations. The error reported is that which encompasses the experimentally determined values ofK m . The catalytic currents observed during nitrite reduction were not limited solely by the properties of the enzyme. The influence of electrode rotation rate on i cat indicated that the catalytic response is limited in part by substrate transport to the enzyme film. To estimate the value of icatenzyme that would be recorded in the absence of mass transport limitations, i.e. at infinitely high electrode rotation rates, the method of Suchetaet al. was adopted (18Sucheta A. Cammack R. Weiner J. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5455-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The value ofi cat was related to the electrode rotation rate through the relationship,1icat=1icatenzyme+10.62nFADo23ν−16Csω½Equation 2 where ω is the electrode rotation rate expressed as an angular velocity, ω = (2π × revolutions per minute)/60 s−1. From Equation 2, a plot of icat−1 versusω−1/2 at a given substrate concentration yields ( icatenzyme)−1 upon extrapolation to ω−1/2 = 0. The gradient of this plot is defined by the additional terms in Equation 2, where n is the number of electrons transferred in reduction of the substrate to the product, F is the Faraday constant, A the electrode area, D o the diffusion coefficient of the substrate, and ν the kinematic viscosity of the solution. For a cytochrome c nitrite reductase film, values ofi cat were corrected for loss of magnitude over the time of each experiment, and the subsequent plots of icat−1 against ω−1/2 were linear at each nitrite concentration investigated (Fig. 2, insets). Values of icatenzyme were determined from Equation 2, and K m was determined from Equation 1 as described above. A series of initial experiments established that E. coli cytochromec nitrite reductase is amenable to study by PFV. Freshly polished, pyrolytic graphite edge (PGE) electrodes were covered with solutions containing various concentrations of the enzyme, and the electrodes were then rinsed to remove any loosely bound material and placed in an electrochemical cell containing a solution of nitrite. Cyclic voltammetry showed that electrodes exposed to a dilute solution (< 2 μm) of the enzyme gave rise to large, negative currents at potentials below approximately 0 V (Fig.2). These currents indicated that catalytic reduction was occurring at negative potentials. Control experiments provided no evidence for catalytic reduction in the absence of the enzyme (Fig. 2, dotted lines). Cytochromec nitrite reductase is clearly capable of utilizing direct electron exchange with PGE electrodes to drive nitrite reduction. To confirm that the catalytic response originated from an enzyme film, enzyme-coated electrodes were transferred to fresh nitrite-containing solutions where the catalytic response was found to persist with only slight loss of magnitude. Subsequent studies established that the behavior of cytochromec nitrite reductase during nitrite reduction was distinct from that during hydroxylamine reduction. The catalytic waveforms describing reduction of each substrate are presented separately below. Cyclic voltammograms arising from films of cytochromec nitrite reductase in 5 and 130 μm nitrite showed a clear dependence on the rate of electrode rotation (Fig. 2). With the electrode stationary (0 rpm) the sweep toward more negative potentials showed a peak in the reduction current that was absent from the return sweep. This observation was consistent with the presence of a highly active enzyme film that rapidly lowers the concentration of substrate at the electrode surface soon after the onset of catalysis. In agreement with this suggestion, the catalytic current magnitude increased when the electrode was rotated to continually deliver substrate to the enzyme film. Two observations were made as the electrode rotation rate was increased and the rate of substrate delivery to the enzyme film became less of a limitation on the rate of catalysis. First, the catalytic current magnitudes,i cat, increased and approached a constant value (Fig. 2, insets). Second, the values ofi cat for the forward and reverse sweeps became increasingly superimposable. The form of the catalytic response observed at the highest electrode rotation rates is therefore dominated by the rates of processes intrinsic to the enzyme and its interaction with substrate. At the highest electrode rotation rate used in this study (3000 rpm) it was clear that sweeping across the electrochemical potential domain gave rise to distinct modulations of activity in 5 and 130 μm nitrite. At 5 μm nitrite a peak in the rate of substrate reduction was observed at −235 mV on sweeping inboth directions across the electrochemical potential domain (Fig. 2 A). The catalytic waveform was unaffected by addition of the reaction product, ammonium. Therefore, product inhibition was not responsible for the decrease in activity observed at lower potentials. Successive voltammograms recorded from a single enzyme film over a 2-h period showed a slow decrease in magnitude of the catalytic response. The half-life for signal loss was approximately 40 min. Whether the decrease in magnitude was due to film desorption or enzyme inactivation is unclear. Importantly, however, no detectable changes in the shape or position of features in the catalytic waveform were noted over the 2-h period. This is consistent with the response arising from a single form of electrocatalytically active enzyme whose population decreases over the time of the experiment without the formation of new species that contribute to the voltammetric response. Films of cytochrome c nitrite reductase prepared on gold electrodes displayed similar catalytic waveforms to those observed at PGE electrodes. Detailed analysis of the catalytic waveform arising at gold electrodes was precluded by a rapid decrease in signal magnitude during these experiments: the half-life for signal loss was approximately 4 min. However, a clear peak in activity was observed on both the forward and reverse potential sweeps at approximately −253 mV. PGE and gold electrodes present surfaces of quite different properties for interaction with cytochrome c nitrite reductase. The observation of similar variations of activity across the electrochemical potential domain at both electrode materials demonstrates that these variations arise from intrinsic properties of the enzyme. The slight difference in peak potentials exhibited at the electrode materials could reflect the influence of the electrode:protein interface on the reduction potential of the heme center(s) responsible for the modulations of activity. Detailed film voltammetry was performed on PGE electrodes at scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1 to assess how effectively the catalytic cycle was coupled to electron transfer events. The catalytic waveform at a given scan rate was obtained as the difference between voltammograms recorded in the presence and absence of an enzyme film. The magnitude, shape, and position of features in the catalytic waveform were invariant across this entire range of scan rates. Interfacial electron exchange between the enzyme and electrode is therefore facile. The rates of chemical and intramolecular electron transfer events of catalysis are also sufficiently rapid not to become uncoupled from interfacial electron transfer across this range of scan rates. Indeed it is known that this enzyme exhibits a turnover number of 770 s−1 during nitrite-dependent oxidation of dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, which corresponds to passage of 4620 electrons s−1 (8Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For comparison, Paracoccus pantotrophus nitrate reductase, NarGH, which exhibits a turnover number of approximately 30 s−1 in assays of nitrate-dependent oxidation of dithionite-reduced methyl viologen corresponding to a flux of 60 electrons s−1, displayed catalytic waveforms that are attenuated at scan rates greater than 40 mV s−1 (15Anderson L.J. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Faraday Discuss. 2000; 116: 155-169Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The catalytic waveform recorded in 130 μm nitrite under conditions of least limitation from substrate mass transport was clearly distinct from that recorded in 5 μm nitrite (Fig.2). At both PGE and gold electrodes two reversible, sigmoidal increases of activity centered on approximately −184 and −312 mV accompanied the lowering of the electrode potential. These features are more clearly resolved in a plot of the first derivative of the catalytic current with respect to applied potential described below (Fig.3 A). There were negligible differences between the catalytic waveforms recorded at scan rates from 20 to 200 mV s−1. However, unexpected behavior was observed at scan rates below 20 mV s−1. Here, as the potential was swept to more negative values, the activity became progressively smaller than that recorded at the higher scan rates. On returning to more positive potentials the activity of the film continued to decrease relative to that obtained on the forward sweep. At these slower scan rates prolonged exposure of the film to more negative potentials was causing inactivation of the enzyme film and an inequality in the catalytic current magnitudes measured at a given potential on the forward and reverse sweeps. The inequality became more pronounced when CaCl2 was omitted from the experiments. Optimum equality of the forward and reverse catalytic currents required the presence of >0.5 mmCaCl2, and experiments were routinely performed in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. Interestingly there was no detectable influence of MgCl2 on the catalytic voltammetry. In the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 the catalytic voltammetry was indistinguishable from that observed in the absence of CaCl2. A possible origin for the specific role of Ca(II) ions in determining the voltammetry of cytochrome c nitrite reductase lies in the presence of a structurally conserved Ca(II) ion associated with the enzyme's active site (4Einsle O.

The importance of this Ca(II) ion in the catalytic process was illustrated in studies of the S. deleyianum enzyme where Ca(II) ion dissociation resulted in a decrease in activity that was reversed on re-association of Ca(II) (6Stach P. Einsle O. Schumacher W. Kurun E. Kroneck P.M.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 79: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The slow inactivation of films of E. coli cytochromec nitrite reductase may then reflect an absence of the active site Ca(II) ion, perhaps resulting in a failure of the enzyme to efficiently process reaction intermediates and leading to a subsequent deviation from the “normal” catalytic cycle. However, the structure of the E. coli enzyme reveals a second Ca(II) ion, coordinated between Hemes 3 and 4, and it cannot be excluded that dissociation of this Ca(II) ion contributes to the voltammetric behavior (8Bamford V.A.

Further experiments established that the activity lost on poising the enzyme film at −450 mV for 60 s was recovered after poising the film at 100 mV for 30 s. Thus, although it was not possible to conclusively identify the cause of the decrease in activity triggered by exposure to lo"

These findings suggest that the Notch pathway may be an important determinant of vascular structure in human health and disease. The Notch family receptors have been characterized as critical determinants of cell fate in a variety of organisms. In mice,Notch-1 and Notch-2 gene deletions are characterized by perturbations in organogenesis that result in embryonic lethality (7Conlon R.A. Reaume A.G. Rossant J.

Mechanistic studies performed in cell culture models in other cell types indicate that the Notch pathway influences cell fate by regulating programs governing growth, apoptosis, and differentiation (9Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

However, the role of the Notch signaling pathway in VSMCs remains to be defined. The Notch receptor family is activated via a proteolytic cleavage of the intracellular domain (IC) of Notch. In certain contexts, the Notch IC portion translocates to the nucleus together with Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H); mammalian orthologue, RBP-Jk/C promoter binding factor (CBF-1)). RBP-Jk provides DNA binding specificity through recognition of the consensus sequence, whereas Notch IC functions as an activation domain. In support of this notion, several studies have demonstrated the utility of overexpressing a dominant negative RBP-Jk (associates with Notch IC but lacks DNA binding) in the context of Notch IC expression to determine whether Notch-induced cellular events occur via an RBP-Jk-dependent or independent transcriptional pathway (14Nakagawa O.

In the classic model, in response to Notch signaling, RBP-Jk activates transcription of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such ashairy-and-enhancer of split 1 (HES-1) (17Jarriault S., Le Bail O.

Recent studies have established that the Hairy-related transcription factor(HRT) genes, HRT1, HRT2, andHRT3, are downstream targets for transcriptional activation by Notch signaling.

Moreover, zebrafish embryos harboring a mutation in Gridlock, an orthologue of HRT2, show dramatic impairment of vascular formation (22Weinstein B.M. Stemple D.L. Driever W. Fishman M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence has established that Gridlock expression is a critical determinant of arterial versus venous cell fate within the developing vasculature (23Zhong T.P. Rosenberg M. Mohideen M.A. Weinstein B. Fishman M.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 24Zhong T.P. Childs S. Leu J.P. Fishman M.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In most cell types examined, expression of Notch1IC leads to increased CBF-1/RBP-Jk-dependent activity. Conversely, evidence suggests that the role of Notch3 is context- and cell type-specific (15Beatus P. Lundkvist J. Oberg C. Lendahl U. Development. 1999; 126: 3925-3935PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed in other cell types have indicated that Notch3IC expression inhibits Notch1IC-RBP-Jk-mediated HES activation (15Beatus P. Lundkvist J. Oberg C. Lendahl U. Development. 1999; 126: 3925-3935PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that Notch3 may act as an antagonist of the Notch1-RBP-Jk signaling pathway. Therefore, the expression and regulation of the Notch3 signaling pathway in VSMCsin vivo and in vitro and the elucidation of the Notch3-RBP-Jk signaling pathway and downstream target genes in adult VSMCs remain to be defined. The present study tested the hypothesis that the well-described modulation of VSMC fate in response to vascular injury and growth factor activation involves a coordinate regulation of the Notch pathway. In accord with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that the Notch family of receptors and the downstream HRT effector genes are coordinately down-regulated in response to vascular injury. It is well established that growth factors such as PDGF are important mediators of vascular remodeling and lesion formation (25Chandrasekar B. Tanguay J.F. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 35: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. Microcirculation. 1998; 5: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Pfeifer M.

We postulated that pathological modifications of vessel structure induced by PDGF may be mediated by the coordinate modulation of the Notch-HRT pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that PDGF promotes a similar coordinate down-regulation of the Notch receptors and HRT genes in cultured VSMCs via an ERK-dependent signaling pathway. We further established that Notch3 signaling in VSMCs does not inhibit but indeed promotes RBP-Jk-mediated signaling and induces the expression of the downstream target genes, HRT1 andHRT2. Taken together, this study documents the coordinate regulation of the Notch and HRT genes in VSMCsin vitro and in vivo in a context- and cell type-dependent manner. In addition, it has defined thatHRT1 and HRT2 are direct downstream target genes of Notch3-RBP-Jk signaling in VSMCs. These findings provide initial insight into the context- and cell type-dependent coordinate regulation of Notch3 and downstreamHRT target genes in VSMCs and define a potential mediator signaling pathway, ERK/MAPK, in vitro and in vivo. Primary isolated rat aortic smooth cells (RASMCs; passages 4–15) and the rat embryonic aortic A7r5 cell line (ATCC) were used in our study. Unless otherwise specified, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) were balloon-injured using previously described methods (29Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. Zhang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8474-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) in accordance with a protocol approved by the Standing Committee on Animals, Morehouse School of Medicine. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) and katamine hydrochloride (90 mg/kg body weight). The left common carotid artery was injured with a 2-French Fogarty embolectomy balloon catheter, and vessels were harvested at 1 (n = 5), 3 (n = 6), 5 (n = 3), and 7 (n = 5) days after injury for mRNA analysis, and the right carotid artery was used as control. Both uninjured and injured vessels were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the adventitial layer was removed. In addition, the endothelium of the control vessels was denuded by cotton swab sweeping twice. The samples for protein analysis were harvested in an identical manner. Total RNA from cell pellets or pulverized arteries was extracted (Rneasy kit; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and reverse transcription reaction (Advantage RT for PCR kit; CLONTECH) was performed with 0.5–1 μg of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX)-treated RNA. QRTPCR was carried out using the LightCycler thermocycler and the SYBR green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primer sequences and reaction conditions can be found in TableI.

Open table in a new tab 10–60 μg of protein per sample from cell cultures or rat carotid arteries were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Goat anti-rat Notch3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was employed for the immunoblots. Membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Ecl-Luminol kit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein loading was verified systematically by Ponceau S staining and/or actin immunoblotting. Notch3IC in pCMX-PL2 was a kind gift from Dr. U. Lendahl (Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Nobel Institute, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). A dominant negative RBP-Jk construct, R218H, in pCMX was a kind gift from Dr. Tasuku Honjo (Department of Medical Chemistry, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). For reporter gene experiments, 3× RBP-Jk-responsive elements (3 × 5′-CTGGTGTAAACA CGCCGTGGGAAAAAATTT-3′) were inserted into the PGL3-promoter luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter. Experiments were performed using Nucleofector technology. The electroporations were performed using the human aortic smooth muscle cell Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Simply, for each reaction, 1 × 106cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA and mixed with a total of 7 μg of plasmid DNA in 100 μl of human aortic smooth muscle cell Nucleofector solution. After electroporation, the samples were transferred into 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Gene expression analysis and luciferase assays were performed 24 h after electroporation. A7r5 VSMCs were transiently co-transfected with the genes of interest and a reporter plasmid using the Nucleofector electroporation system as described above. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection using a commercially available kit (Promega) and normalized by green fluorescent protein fluorescence levels. The expression levels of Notch signaling pathway elements in rat carotid arteries were investigated by QRTPCR at different time points within 1 week after balloon injury. Expression levels of Notch-1, Notch-3,HRT1, and HRT2 were analyzed in RASMCs treated with PDGF (20 ng/ml; Sigma) by QRTPCR. Postconfluent RASMCs were kept quiescent in OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 48 h before PDGF administration for the time points indicated. Protein level changes were confirmed by immunoblot with available reagents. The mediator role of the ERK, p38, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways was evaluated in PDGF-treated RASMCs after 12 h of treatment with the following inhibitors, respectively: U0126 (10 μmol/liter; Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA), SB202190 (25 μmol/liter; Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc.), and LY294002 (50 μmol/liter; Sigma). The efficacy of pathway blockade at these doses has been confirmed in our laboratory as described previously by others (30Bai H. Pollman M.J. Inishi Y. Gibbons G.H. Circ.

Comparisons between two groups were analyzed via Student'st test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Results were presented as means ± S.E. At least three different samples were analyzed in each experimental group. We initiated our study by defining the basal in vitro and in vivomRNA expression levels of the Notch receptors, Notch1–4, and the HRT gene family, HRT1–3, by QRTPCR. As indicated in TableII, each of the four Notch receptors and the three HRT genes was detected in adult rat carotid arteries. With the exception of Notch4, whose expression levels were undetectable in vitro, similar relative expression of the Notch receptors and HRT genes was detected in cultured RASMCs under confluent, quiescent culture conditions.Table IIExpression levels of Notch receptors and HRT transcription factors in rat carotid arteries and cultured VSMCs determined by QRTPCRGeneMedian cycle number of mid-log linear phase (mean ± S.E.M.)Carotid arteryVSMCs GAPDH 2-aGAPDH was used as the housekeeping gene for the quantification.21.2 ± 0.5916.2 ± 0.04 Notch130.7 ± 0.4828.8 ± 0.20 Notch225.8 ± 0.7722.1 ± 0.25 Notch326.3 ± 0.4424.9 ± 0.15 Notch434.8 ± 0.63ND2-bND, not detected.

After defining the basal expression of the Notch-HRT pathway in VSMCsin vivo and in vitro, we hypothesized that the well-described modulation of VSMC fate in response to vascular injury and growth factor activation involves a coordinate regulation of the Notch-HRT pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relative mRNA expression levels of Notch1–3 and HRT1–3 by QRTPCR in rat carotid arteries after standard balloon injury. As seen in Fig.1 A, each of the Notch receptors was markedly down-regulated between 2- and 3-fold within the first 24 h after injury. The initial down-regulation was maintained at days 3 and 5, with a trend toward recovery of relative preinjury levels by day 7. The most dramatic down-regulation was observed with the Notch3 receptor. We further examined the protein expression levels of the Notch3 receptor at day 3 by immunoblotting. As noted in Fig. 1 B, the Notch3 receptor protein levels were dramatically down-regulated in a fashion similar to the mRNA expression levels. We next examined the expression levels of the HRT gene family at the identical time points after arterial injury. QRTPCR analysis of the mRNA expression levels of HRT1–3 (Fig.1 C), revealed a similar pattern of acute down-regulation, suggesting a possible coordinate regulation of the Notch receptors andHRT genes. The most dramatic down-regulation was observed with the HRT1 gene, reaching ∼13-fold at day 3. By day 7, the expression levels of the HRT genes had returned to preinjury levels. It is well established that growth factors such as PDGF are important mediators of vascular remodeling and lesion formation (25Chandrasekar B. Tanguay J.F. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 35: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. Microcirculation. 1998; 5: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Pfeifer M.

We postulated that pathological modifications of vessel structure induced by PDGF may be mediated by the coordinate modulation of the Notch-HRT pathway. We observed that PDGF induced a time-dependent down-regulation of mRNA levels of the Notch receptorsNotch1 and Notch3 in RASMCs within 6–12 h of administration (Fig. 2 A). The most dramatic regulation was again observed with Notch3. A similar trend was observed for Notch2 (data not shown). We further defined the PDGF-induced down-regulation of the Notch3 receptor by establishing a dose-dependent relationship. As seen in Fig. 2 B, PDGF induced a dose-dependent down-regulation of the Notch3 receptor at the level of steady-state protein. This down-regulation was observed for both the full-length form of the receptor (300 kDa) as well as the intracellular domain portion of the receptor (90 kDa). We further hypothesized that the coordinate regulation of the Notch receptors and HRT transcription factors observed in vivo may be simulated by PDGF administration in cultured VSMCs. To address this question, we performed QRTPCR analysis of the mRNA expression levels of HRT1 and HRT2 after PDGF administration. We observed a similar pattern of down-regulation within the 6–12-h time period, again suggesting a coordinate regulation of Notch receptors and HRT transcription factors (Fig. 2 C). Similar to the results obtained after arterial injury, the most dramatic down-regulation was seen with the gene HRT1. To examine the cellular mechanisms that link PDGF to the regulation of the Notch-HRT pathway, we assessed the mediator role of ERK/MAPK. QRTPCR analysis demonstrated that the PDGF-induced down-regulation of Notch3 could be abolished by ERK blockade with the pharmacologic MEK inhibitor U0126 (Fig.3 A). We further demonstrated the specificity of the ERK pathway as a mediator of Notch3 inhibition by establishing that blockade of neither the p38 nor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways reversed the PDGF-induced down-regulation (Fig. 3 A). To further define the role of the ERK pathway, we examined its overall effect on Notch3 protein expression at 12 h. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the MEK inhibitor (U0126) prevented the PDGF-induced down-regulation of Notch3 protein levels in RASMCs. We further hypothesized that the PDGF-induced coordinate down-regulation of HRT1 and HRT2 was mediated by the ERK signaling pathway. QRTPCR analysis demonstrated that the PDGF-induced down-regulation of HRT1 and HRT2could similarly be abolished specifically by blockade of the ERK pathway, and not the p38 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways (Fig. 3, C and D). As additional control experiments, we established that only blockade with the MEK inhibitor (U0126) and not the p38 (SB203580) or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002) inhibitors affected the levels of ERK activation in ourin vitro model system (Fig. 3 E). Whereas the studies performed above established a coordinate regulation of the Notch receptors and HRT transcription factors in vitro and in vivo, it remained to be determined whether the HRT genes were directly downstream of Notch signaling in VSMCs. In most cell types examined, expression of Notch1IC leads to increased CBF-1/RBP-Jk-dependent activity. Conversely, evidence suggests that the role of Notch3 is context- and cell type-specific (15Beatus P. Lundkvist J. Oberg C. Lendahl U. Development. 1999; 126: 3925-3935PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed in other cell types have indicated that Notch3IC expression inhibits Notch1IC-RBP-Jk-mediated HES activation (15Beatus P. Lundkvist J. Oberg C. Lendahl U. Development. 1999; 126: 3925-3935PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that Notch3 may act as antagonist of the Notch1-RBP-Jk signaling pathway. The effects of Notch3 signaling on RBP-Jk activity and downstream target genes within VSMCs remained to be determined. To begin to examine Notch3 signal transduction in VSMCs, we used promoter-reporter assays and observed that transient co-transfections of Notch3IC with the 3× wild-type RBP-Jk-reporter construct markedly induced luciferase activity (Fig.4 A). To further define the critical role of RBP-Jk in this process, we established that co-transfection of either the wild-type or R218H RBP-Jk blocked the Notch3IC-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 4 A). These data are in accord with observations in other cell types that define RBP-Jk as a suppressor of transcriptional activity in the absence of an association with the intracytoplasmic domain of a Notch receptor. As an additional control, we established by QRTPCR analysis that co-expression of either RBP-Jk or dominant negative mutant R218H RBP-Jk had no effect on the expression levels of Notch3IC (Notch3IC + control plasmid = 1 ± 0.011, Notch3IC + RBP-Jk = 0.94 ± 0.15, Notch3IC + R218H = 0.97 ± 0.18, normalized values relative to vimentin; n = 3; p > 0.05). We further determined that co-expression of Notch3IC and Notch1IC promotes RBP-Jk-dependent transcriptional activation to a greater degree than expression of Notch1IC alone (data not shown). Taken together, these studies suggest that in contrast to Notch3 signal transduction in other cell types, Notch3 signaling in VSMCs is not an antagonist of Notch1 but a potent inducer of RBP-Jk-dependent transcriptional activity. After establishing that Notch3 signaling induced RBP-Jk-dependent transcriptional activation, we examined whether HRT1 and HRT2 were direct downstream target genes of the Notch3-RBP-Jk transcriptional pathway in VSMCs. We initially established the transfection efficiency within our in vitro model system using the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofector electroporation technique. Utilizing green fluorescent protein-reporter plasmid constructs and UV microscopy, we defined an approximate 70% transfection efficiency within our VSMC in vitro model system within 24–48 h of transfection. After defining the transfection efficiency, we established that transient transfection of VSMCs with Notch3IC markedly induced the expression of both HRT1 andHRT2 mRNA expression levels as determined by QRTPCR (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, in accord with our data using the RBP-Jk reporter construct above, the Notch3-induced expression of these genes could be inhibited by co-expression of either the wild-type or dominant negative RBP-Jk. Taken together, these studies establish that HRT1 and HRT2 are direct downstream target genes of Notch3-RBP-Jk activity in VSMCs. It is well established that the pathogenesis of vascular disease is characterized by the activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional programs that modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and extracellular matrix modification. These transcriptional programs are reminiscent of the genetic programs determining organogenesis during ontogeny. Given that the Notch family of receptors and downstream transcriptional effectors are highly conserved cell fate determinants involved in organogenesis, we were intrigued by the finding that a heritable arteriopathy involves mutations within the Notch3 receptor. This study tested the hypothesis that cell fate determinants such as Notch3 are modulated by growth factors expressed in the context of vascular injury and repair in adult VSMCs. Although the role of Notch receptors and downstream effectors in vasculogenesis is being well characterized, the potential influence on vascular function and structure in the adult animal remained to be defined. The present study documents that major components of the Notch signaling pathway, including the Notch receptors (Notch1–3) and the downstream effector genes (HRT1–3), are constitutively expressed in adult VSMCs both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our findings establish a coordinate regulation of the Notch receptors and downstream HRT effectors in the context of vascular injury. To our knowledge, these findings are the first description of HRT gene regulation within the vasculature of the adult animal. These findings complement previous studies that have documented the expression of Jagged-1 (33Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar),Notch-4 (34Uyttendaele H. Marazzi G., Wu, G. Yan Q. Sassoon D. Kitajewski J. Development. 1996; 122: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and HESR-1 (35Henderson A.M. Wang S.J. Taylor A.C. Aitkenhead M. Hughes C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6169-6176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in endothelial cells. In addition, Lindner et al. (36Lindner V. Booth C. Prudovsky I. Small D. Maciag T. Liaw L. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 875-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), using in situ hybridization of en face tissue preparations, have recently reported that all four Notch receptors are expressed in the adult vasculature and regulated in the endothelium and adjacent intima in the context of vascular injury. However, the expression levels of the Notch family of receptors and the downstream HRTeffector genes within VSMCs of the vessel wall remained to be determined. It is postulated that although the HRT genes may be downstream and regulated in large part by the activity of the Notch receptors, there may be other regulatory mechanisms involved. Support for this notion is seen in our data depicting the time course of recovery of the Notch receptor and HRT gene expression levels. Our data suggest that recovery of HRT gene expression is observed before the recovery of Notch receptor expression. These data are in accord with observations and discussions in other in vitro and in vivo model systems that lead to the postulate that other mechanisms such as positive and negative feedback loops, as well as other yet to be determined mediators, modulate HRT expression levels in addition to Notch-RBP-Jk activity (14Nakagawa O.

Leu J.P. Fishman M.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data indicate that many of the critical elements of the Notch receptor signal transduction pathway are present within the adult vasculature, and the expression levels of these mediators are modulated in response to vascular injury. The observation that expression of Notch signaling pathway elements is modulated by vascular injury led us to postulate an interplay between growth factor stimulation and the activity of this cell fate program. It is well established by multiple investigators that vascular injury promotes PDGF and PDGF receptor expression as well as ERK activation (37Ferns G.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Motani A.S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2808-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that PDGF acutely induces a coordinate down-regulation of Notch1, Notch3,HRT1, and HRT2 in cultured VSMCs. Furthermore, we showed that an ERK-dependent pathway mediates the down-regulation of Notch and HRT expression by PDGF. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the expression of these Notch receptors and the downstream HRT effectors is modulated by the ERK signaling pathway in mammalian cells. This finding suggests a possible nexus by which the activation of a growth-regulatory signaling pathway is coupled to the Notch cell fate program. Additional studies are needed to better define the mechanism by which ERK signal transduction regulates the expression of the Notch pathway elements. We were intrigued by the apparent coordinate down-regulation of bothNotch1 and Notch3 and the downstreamHRT genes by growth factor stimulation. These data suggested to us that the HRT genes may be directly downstream of both Notch1 and Notch3 signaling in VSMCs. These results were intriguing because the signal transduction of Notch3 within VSMCs remained to be determined and indeed could exhibit cell type specificity. In most cell types examined, expression of Notch1IC leads to increased CBF-1/RBP-Jk-dependent activity. Conversely, evidence suggests that the role of Notch3 is context- and cell type-specific (15Beatus P. Lundkvist J. Oberg C. Lendahl U. Development. 1999; 126: 3925-3935PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed in other cell types have indicated that Notch3IC expression inhibits Notch1IC-RBP-Jk-mediated HES activation (15Beatus P. Lundkvist J. Oberg C. Lendahl U. Development. 1999; 126: 3925-3935PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that Notch3 may act as an antagonist of the Notch1-RBP-Jk signaling pathway. Therefore, the effects of Notch3 signaling on RBP-Jk activity and downstream target genes within VSMCs remained to be determined. Using the RBP-Jk promoter-reporter assay system, we initially defined that Notch3 signal transduction in VSMCs induced RBP-Jk activity that could be inhibited by either wild-type or dominant negative RBP-Jk. The finding that expression of either the wild-type or dominant negative RBP-Jk inhibited Notch3-induced luciferase activity is in accord with previous observations in other cell types with Notch1-mediated activity. RBP-Jk alone acts as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of interactions with the intracytoplasmic domain of Notch1. Furthermore, wild-type RBP-Jk acts to inhibit both endogenous NotchIC-RBP-Jk and overexpressed NotchIC-RBP-Jk-mediated activity by complexing with NotchIC but not binding to the DNA recognition sequence (14Nakagawa O.

The findings of this study suggest that in contrast to Notch3 signal transduction in other cell types, Notch3 signaling in VSMCs is a potent inducer of RBP-Jk-dependent transcriptional activity in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, we established thatHRT1 and HRT2 were direct downstream target genes of the Notch3-induced RBP-Jk activity in VSMCs. To our knowledge, this is the first description establishing Notch3-RBP-Jk activity inducing the direct downstream HRT target effector genes in VSMCs. Although it is well documented that the Notch pathway is a potent modulator of cell function and fate in various model systems, the role of this pathway in VSMCs remains to be fully elucidated. Our findings that this pathway is regulated in the context of vascular injury and growth factor stimulation lead us to postulate that this pathway may be coupled to VSMC growth and/or differentiation regulation. Consistent with this notion are studies performed by Chin and co-workers (20Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. J. Biol.

In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated an intriguing bifunctional effect of constitutive Notch3 receptor activation on the regulation of VSMC growth (41Campos A.H. Wang W. Pollman M.J. Gibbons G.H. Circulation. 2001; 104: II-275Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additional studies are needed to better define the functional role of Notch receptor signaling and downstreamHRT effector gene activity in VSMCs. Studies of Notch-1 knockout mice have documented striking abnormalities in vasculogenesis in addition to other developmental defects (42Krebs L.T. Xue Y. Norton C.R. Shutter J.R. Maguire M. Sundberg J.P. Gallahan D. Closson V. Kitajewski J. Callahan R. Smith G.H. Stark K.L. Gridley T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1343-1352PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a striking vasculopathy in zebrafish reminiscent of aortic coarctation is due to a mutation of the downstream Notch effector gene HRT2 (23Zhong T.P. Rosenberg M. Mohideen M.A. Weinstein B. Fishman M.C. Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is established that HRT2 activity is critical for arterialversus venous fate specification during the fashioning of the first zebrafish artery. In addition, it is noteworthy that mutations in the Notch3 pathway are associated with an arteriopathy in humans that predisposes them to early-onset stroke (3Joutel A. Andreux F. Gaulis S.

We speculate that changes in the expression and activity of the Notch signaling pathway may also contribute to the pathogenesis of acquired arteriopathies that predispose individuals to stroke. It is anticipated that future investigation of the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway in VSMCs will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of vascular complications."

To address how the two NF-κB and three Sp1 binding sites of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR) control multiple activator assembly and transcription, we first observed and compared unique conformations between the crystallographic structure of the NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer bound to the uPA-κB target site to that of the p50·p65·HIV-κB complex. Next, cooperativity between two NF-κB molecules bound to tandem HIV-κB sequences was measured as well as that of NF-κB and transcription factor Sp1 when bound to adjacent sites. The cooperativity of hybrid HIV-LTR enhancers was measured with the 3′ κB site converted to uPA-κB or to interferon β gene enhancer κB. The hybrids were defective in transcriptional activator assembly and less active transcriptionally. These functional differences correlate with observed conformational differences and demonstrate that distinct κB DNA sequences function as allosteric regulators in a gene-specific manner.

Of 15 potential NF-κB homo- and heterodimers, the NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer is most prevalent in cells (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). Rel/NF-κB family members share an N-terminal Rel homology region (RHR)1 that is responsible for dimer formation and DNA binding to decameric κB sites. The x-ray crystal structure of the NF-κB p50·p65 RHR heterodimer bound to the κB binding site of immunoglobulin κ light chain gene enhancer (Ig-κB) has been determined (2Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The Ig-κB DNA sequence is identical to both κB sites contained within the long terminal repeat of the human immunodeficiency virus promoter (HIV LTR) and is therefore also referred to as HIV-κB. The x-ray structures of several other DNA-bound NF-κB homodimers reveal that the NF-κB RHR displays different conformations on various κB sites (3Chen Y.Q. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 4Cramer P. Larson C.J. Verdine G.L. Müller C.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7078-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ghosh G. van Duyne G.

Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Variability in NF-κB structure is accommodated by the bimodular architecture of the RHR; the N-terminal DNA binding domain (NTD) and C-terminal dimerization domain are connected by a short, flexible linker. Most eukaryotic genes are regulated by a gene-specific enhanceosome consisting of a regulatory enhancer and its multiple bound activators. Through interactions with other factors on gene enhancers, NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer regulates hundreds of genes (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 7Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The sequence and dynamics of the gene-specific κB sites have been observed to affect NF-κB binding affinity in solution (8Tisné C. Hantz E. Hartmann B. Delepierre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Tisné C. Delepierre M. Hartmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Tisné C. Hartmann B. Delepierre M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3883-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that each of these κB site-specific NF-κB conformations is essential for the formation of a gene-specific enhanceosome. The role of DNA as an allosteric effector is not a new one. Experiments in protein transactivation have led to an evolution in the view of transcription away from one in which a regulator is composed of two separable domains, a DNA binding domain that localizes a transactivation domain to the appropriate environment, to the newer paradigm in which DNA binding has direct effects on transactivation. One family of proteins in which the allosteric role of DNA is particularly well documented is the nuclear receptor family, which includes the subset of steroid hormone receptors. These homo- and heterodimeric proteins make extensive use of different DNA spacer lengths and sequences to directly affect the combinatorial assembly of the dimeric protein on DNA (11Holmbeck S.M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Zhao Q. Chasse S.A. Devarakonda S. Sierk M.L. Ahvazi B. Rastinejad F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Rastinejad F. Wagner T. Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recent experiments on the PIT-1 homeodomain protein have also demonstrated an allosteric effect of DNA. A two-base pair change in the spacer not only changes the conformation of bound proteins but also the function of the proteins from a repressor to an activator (14Scully K.M. Jacobson E.M. Jepsen K. Lunyak V. Viadiu H. Carriere C. Rose D.W. Hooshmand F. Aggarwal A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2000; 290: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments have also hinted at a relationship between the DNA-bound conformation of NF-κB with its function. NF-κB binds with equal affinity to the κB sites from the Ig κ light chain gene enhancer (Ig-κB) and the interleukin-2Rα gene promoter (IL2Rα-κB) (15Cross S.L. Halden N.F. Lenardo M.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1989; 244: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, only the Ig-κB site activates transcription potently in Jurkat phorbol ester-stimulated transfection experiments. Fujita et al. (16Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) used altered protease sensitivity patterns to demonstrate a unique p50 homodimer conformation when it strongly activates from Ig-κB that is absent when bound to H2-κB DNA from which it does not strongly activate. The identity and arrangement of DNA binding sites for transcriptional activators in each complex enhancer appear to be gene-specific. For example, the HIV proximal promoter contains two identical κB sequences followed immediately by three binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. The DNA binding domains of NF-κB and Sp1 were shown to cooperatively bind DNA (17Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to understand how HIV-κB DNA controls multiple activator assembly and transcription. We have endeavored to determine the roles of particular κB sites in effecting DNA conformation, interprotein interactions, and transcription from the HIV-LTR promoter. We also tested whether these κB sites are replaceable with other κB sites. To this end, we first determined the crystallographic structure of NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer bound to the unique κB sequence from the human urokinase plasminogen activator gene promoter (uPA-κB) and compared it with the p50·p65·HIV-κB complex (2Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Next, binding cooperativity was measured between NF-κB and itself when bound to two tandem HIV-κB sequences as well as between NF-κB and Sp1 when bound to two adjacent target sites from the HIV-LTR. Finally, we measured the transcriptional activation of hybrid HIV-LTR enhancers with the 3′ κB site converted to uPA-κB and to an interferon β gene enhancer κB (IFNβ-κB). The NF-κB heterodimer protein used in the uPa-κB complex crystallization contained co-expressed truncated murine p50 (residues 39–350) and p65 (residues 19–291). The heterodimer was purified according to previous published protocols (18Chen F. Kempiak S. Huang D. Phelps C. Ghosh G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The peak fractions were concentrated, aliquoted, stored at −80 °C, and used within 5 h of thawing. The UPA-17 base pair DNA target site was synthesized as two single-stranded oligonucleotides via phosphoramidite synthesis with the following sequences: 5′-ctcagggaaagtacaga-3′ and 5′-tctgtactttccctgag-3′ (Yale Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory). The DNA strands were purified and annealed as described earlier (2Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The final double-stranded oligonucleotide was mixed with a 10% molar excess of the p50·p65 heterodimer. DNAs containing 5′-iodinated uracil bases were synthesized with the following sequences: UPA-2, 5′-tctguacutuccctgag-3′; UPA-4, 5′-tctguacuuuccctgag-3′; UPA-5, 5′-tcuguacuuuccctgag-3′. Crystals grew at 18 °C (0.08 × 0.08 × 0.3 mm) from 2-μl hanging drops in a final concentration of 6 mg/ml complex, 50 mm Na-MES (pH 6.5), 200 mmCaCl2, 0.05% β-octyl glucopyranoside, 0.05 mm sodium spermine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals with iodinated DNA grew in the same conditions. Before data collection, crystals were dialyzed at 18 °C over 2 days in 25 μl of reservoir solution against 5 ml of a cryosolvent consisting of the same components plus 30% glycerol, mounted, and flash frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 105 K using a MarResearch imaging plate system using x-rays from a large Rigaku rotation anode FR5 operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. The unit cell dimensions are as follows:a = 137.13, b = 179.70,c = 97.07 Å in the C222 space group. There is one dimer in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent volume fraction of 68.5%. The data were indexed and integrated using DENZO (19Otwinowski Z. DENZO: an Oscillation Data Processing Program for Macromolecular Crystallography. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and scaled by SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

The UPA-4 crystal structure of the heterodimer-DNA complex was solved by molecular replacement method combined with multiple isomorphous replacement. Molecular replacement was performed with a p50·p65 heterodimer-DNA as the search model (2Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) in AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) against the UPA-4 data set alone. The orientation and position of the molecular replacement solution was subsequently refined by rigid body refinement with CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 10: 25-26Google Scholar). We initially could not place the p50 N-terminal domain in the correct position. We performed multiple isomorphous replacement with two iodine derivatives (UPA-2 and UPA-5) to obtain additional phase information. Iodine sites were identified by difference Fourier synthesis, and then phasing parameters were refined and combined using MLPHARE (23Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The figure of merit after phase combination was 0.59 for acentric and 0.74 for centric reflections. After histogram matching and solvent flattening, the electron density map allowed us to locate the N-terminal domain of p50. Refinement was performed against the UPA-4 data set. Manual adjustments were made based on F o − F c and 2F o − F c difference maps using O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The parameter set of Engh and Huber was applied for the structure refinements. When individual isotropic temperature factors were included in the refinement, a final crystallographic Rfactor of 25.0% and an R free value of 28.4% were achieved. Ramachandran plots from PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 98% nonglycine residues were in most favored regions (77.5%) and additional allowed regions (20.3%) in both subunits. The final refinement statistics and stereochemical parameters are presented in Table I. A lower resolution native data set was subsequently collected. Refinement was performed against this native UPA-17 data set in the same manner. The model was refined to a final R factor of 25.8% and an R free value of 30.3%. Ramachandran plots from PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 98% nonglycine residues were in most favored regions (72.0%) and additional allowed regions (26.0%) in both subunits. The final refinement statistics and stereochemical parameters are presented in Table I. No noticeable differences were observed in the refined native model compared with that of the refined derivative. Because the model obtained from the derivative data is higher in resolution with better statistics, we used this model for interpretation. To determine its HIV-κB DNA binding affinity, p50-(39–350)·p65-(19–291) heterodimer protein was serially diluted from 1 μm to 31 pm in FP buffer (50 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 37 °C in a 1.2-ml total volume and blanked on a Beacon 2000 Fluorescence Polarizer. After the addition of 0.1 nm fluorescein-labeled HIV-κB site DNA, the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and final readings were taken. To determine the affinity of the protein for competitor DNA, p50-(39–350)·p65-(19–291) heterodimer protein was diluted to a final protein concentration of 40 nm and a final fluorescein-HIV-κB DNA concentration of 4 nm in 0.5 ml of FP buffer and blanked. After the addition of serially diluted unlabeled double-stranded competitor DNA with a maximum concentration of 25 μm (either UK19 (5′-TCTGAGGGACTTTCCTGATC-3′) or ss20 (5′-TCTGAGGGACTTTCCTGATC-3′; κB sites underlined), the samples were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, and final readings were taken. Fraction-bound DNA was plottedversus protein concentration and fitted to the following equation to determine the IC50 value: y = (x/k)/((x/k) + 1), wherey represents the fraction bound, x is the DNA concentration, and k is the IC50. Single-stranded DNAs were synthesized off site (GenoSys) and annealed. They were then [γ-32P]dATP-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 30 min and cleaned of free nucleotides (Qiagen). About 50,000 cpm were used per reaction (final concentration of DNA, 3–19 pm). The NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer and the DNA binding domain of Sp1 (612–706 amino acids) were diluted in 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1.0 mm zinc acetate. NF-κB was added in increasing total concentrations from 11.2 pm to 4.4 μm. Sp1, when present, was at a final concentration of 200 nm, enough Sp1 to saturate the DNA. After the addition of one or both proteins, complex was formed at 25 °C for 30 min in 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1.0 nm zinc acetate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were loaded onto nondenaturing 6% acrylamide 0.5× TB gels that had been prerun at 4 °C with a constant 200 V. Gels were run at 4 °C with circulating 0.5× TB buffer for 3 h at a constant 200 V, dried on filter paper (Whatman), exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, scanned with a Molecular Dynamics 445 scanner, and quantified with the ImageQuant software. Equilibrium dissociation constants for NF-κB binding to DNA alone and Sp1-saturated DNA were calculated using a 1:1 binding model, A + B → AB, where A represents an NF-κB dimer and B represents DNA or Sp1-saturated DNA. EMSA experiments on κB-κB binding were carried out in an identical manner, except for data analysis. This was a result of multiple migrating species for DNA bound by a single NF-κB dimer in the case of the hybrid DNAs. Gels were quantified via phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics 445 scanner) to produce background-subtracted values for each band. The ratio of ternary complex (DNA bound by two NF-κB dimers) versusbinary complex (DNA bound by a single NF-κB dimer) was then calculated and plotted against NF-κB concentration for the wild type (HIV-HIV), IFNβ-HIV, and uPA-HIV targets. The binary bands for the uPA-HIV and IFNβ-HIV gels were taken as a sum of the two migrating species. All experiments were performed a minimum of three times. The HIV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct was a gift from G. Nabel. Mutations were made to the proximal κB site in the HIV-LTR via anin vitro site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following sense strand primers and their corresponding antisense strands used for mutagenesis were synthesized off site (GenoSys) and had the following sequences: IFNβ-κB, 5′-gggactttccgctggggaaattccagggaggcgtggcc-3′; uPA-κB: 5′-gggactttccgctggggaaagtacagggaggcgtggcc-3′ (changes underlined). Mutations were confirmed via DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (26Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 27Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription reactions were carried out as follows. Template DNA (100 ng) was incubated with recombinant proteins for 30 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 40 μl of transcription mix containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmNTPs, 4 mm MgCl2, 35 mm HEPES, pH 8.2, 80 mm KCl, and 10 μl of HeLa nuclear extract (8 mg/ml). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of mix containing 0.4 msodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 5 μg of tRNA, and 20 μg of proteinase K at 37 °C for 15 min. The RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of hybridization mix containing 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mmNaCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.1 pmol of γ-32P-labeled CAT primer followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight. The hybridization reaction was precipitated by adding 180 μl of 0.5 mammonium acetate and isopropyl alcohol. The RNA-primer hybrid was resuspended in 10 μl of reverse transcription mix containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 74 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmdNTPs, and 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The products were analyzed on an 8% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (19:1) gel containing 5m urea in 0.5× TBE. We endeavored to determine whether the NF-κB p50·p65 heterodimer binds to a κB site other than the HIV-κB with a different conformation. The target site selected for this study was from the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) promoter (28Hansen S.K. Guerrini L. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22230-22237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This site was selected because a comparison of this target site with the HIV-κB site shows four base pair differences at the −1, 0, +1, and +3 positions (Fig. 1). Two of these differences are in positions central to mediating base-specific contacts in the HIV-κB structure (2Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and were expected to produce the most observable changes in conformation. Both the structural and the biochemical experiments were performed with the p50·p65 RHR that is sufficient for DNA binding. The structure of the p50·p65 RHR bound to a DNA target 17 base pairs long containing the uPA-κB site was solved to 2.7-Å resolution using molecular replacement and multiple isomorphous replacement techniques (Table I, Fig. 2 A). The heterodimer bound to the uPA-κB site assumes a different and unique global conformation compared with the HIV-κB-bound structure (2Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). Superposition of the dimerization domains of the two structures reveals, relative to the Ig-κB bound structure, a rotation of the uPA-κB-bound p65 NTD by 10.3° and a translation by 8.8 Å, while the p50 NTD is rotated by 6.5° and translated by 7.1 Å. 2For clarity, p50 residues are shown in normal roman type, and p65 residues are in italics.Figure 2The NF-κB N-terminal domains undergo conformational variations.

However, the detailed chemistry of these interactions is different (Fig. 2 C). Arg-54 makes bidentate contacts with the N-7 and O-6 atoms of G−4instead of those of G−3 as previously observed. Arg-56 no longer makes bidentate contacts but now only contacts the N-7 atom of G−4. Glu-60 also shifts by contacting the N-4 atom of C−3 instead of both the N-4 atoms of C−3and the backbone of Tyr-57 as observed in the HIV-κB structure. Lys-241 now contacts both O-4 atoms of T−1 and T−2 instead of just G−1. The p65 subunit binds to the 3′ DNA half-site via Arg-35,Glu-39, and Arg-187 and makes stacking contacts through Tyr-36 (Fig. 2 D). Noteworthy are the changes in contacts at the +3 base pair, which has been mutated from a G:C base pair in the HIV-κB to a T:A base pair in the uPA-κB. The side chain of Arg-33 bends back into the protein, not making hydrogen contacts to the DNA and making van der Waals contacts.Glu-39 also reorients, contacting only the N-6 of A+3 and Arg-35 and losing a contact to the backbone of Tyr-36. Arg-187 and Tyr-36maintain similar contacts to the DNA in both structures. DNA backbone contacts are also not conserved between the structures (Fig.2 E). There are only 12 backbone contacts made in this complex versus the 23 in the HIV-κB structure. Refinement of the model against a native data set of lower resolution yields no significant differences in conformation. To test if the direct DNA contacts made by the protein in the uPA-κB complex affect the affinity of the NF-κB·uPA-κB complex, we measured the relative binding affinities by using fluorescence polarization competition assays to determine IC50 values, the concentration of competitor DNA at which 50% of the NF-κB·fluorescein-labeled DNA reference complexes were displaced. The IC50 values were found to be similar for uPA-κB (28 nm), HIV-κB (20 nm) (Fig.3), and IFNβ-κB, a κB site present in the enhancer of the interferon β gene (data not shown). We have also measured the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of NF-κB for these κB sites (K D ) through EMSAs (Fig.4 A). These experiments show that direct binding of NF-κB to the three different DNAs also occurred with similar affinity (Fig. 4 B). The apparentK D values for the HIV-κB site, the uPA-κB site, and the IFNβ-κB site are 0.8, 1.2, and 0.8 nm, respectively. Additional gel shift experiments of NF-κB binding to the three κB sites show that the complexes run with different mobilities (Fig. 4 C). This result confirms observations from crystallographic structures, which show different protein conformations on different DNAs. Both x-ray crystallographic experiments and biochemical DNA bending experiments (29Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) have shown that NF-κB heterodimer binds different κB DNAs with varying degrees of bend angle. The recent x-ray structure solution of NF-κB bound to the IFNβ-κB site demonstrates that the protein can assume yet another distinct conformation. 3B. Berkowitz et al., submitted for publication.Similar affinities suggest that the reduced number of direct contacts in the NF-κB·uPA-κB complex does not necessarily lower binding affinity.Figure 4EMSA experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2033227353,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare autosmomal recessive genetic disorder causing premature aging. The gene (WRN) responsible for WS encodes a protein homologous to the RecQ-type helicase. WRN has a nucleolar localization signal and shows intranuclear trafficking between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm. WRN is recruited into the nucleolus when rRNA transcription is reactivated in quiescent cells. Inhibition of mRNA transcription with α-amanitin has no effect on nucleolar localization of WRN whereas inhibition of rRNA transcription with actinomycin D releases WRN from nucleoli, suggesting that nucleolar WRN is closely related to rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I (RPI). A possible function of WRN on rRNA transcription through interaction with RPI is supported by the results described here showing that WRN is co-immunoprecipitated with an RPI subunit, RPA40. Here we show that WS fibroblasts are characterized by a decreased level of rRNA transcription compared with wild-type cells, and that the decreased level of rRNA transcription in WS fibroblasts recovers when wild-type WRN is exogenously expressed. By contrast, exogenously expressed mutant-type WRN lacking an ability to migrate into the nucleolus fails to stimulate rRNA transcription. These results suggest that WRN promotes rRNA transcription as a component of an RPI-associated complex in the nucleolus."

The spectra of the oxidized enzyme show two distinct νas(Fe-O-Fe) modes at 815 and 833 cm−1 of the heme/non-heme diiron center. The splitting of the Fe-O-Fe mode suggests that two different conformations (open and closed) are present in the catalytic site of the enzyme. We find evidence from deuterium exchange experiments that in the dominant conformation (833 cm−1mode, closed), the Fe-O-Fe unit is hydrogen-bonded to distal residue(s). The ferric nitrosyl complex of nitric-oxide reductase exhibits the ν(Fe3+-NO) and ν(N-O) at 594 and 1904 cm−1, respectively. The nitrosyl species we detect is photolabile and can be photolyzed to generate a new form of oxidized enzyme in which the proximal histidine is ligated to hemeb 3, in contrast to the resting form. Photodissociation of the NO ligand yields a five-coordinate high-spin heme b 3.

It is a membrane-bound cytochromebc complex composed of two subunits, NorC and NorB, that catalyzes the reduction of NO to N2O (5Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lübben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The complex contains four known redox centers: three heme groups and one non-heme Fe atom (5Hendriks J.

Soc. 2000; 122: 9344-9345Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Heme c (six-coordinate, low-spin) is bound to NorC subunit and functions as the electron entry site of the enzyme. NorB contains one six-coordinate, low-spin heme b and a five-coordinate, high-spin heme b 3, which, together with a non-heme iron atom, form the dinuclear NO reduction site. The sequence of NorB contains all six histidines that are the ligands of heme a, heme a 3, and CuB in cytochrome c oxidase (4Hendriks J. Gohlke U. Saraste M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman (RR) scattering is a powerful technique for the study of heme proteins because the spectra are rich in information about the heme groups (8Kitagawa T. Spiro T. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley, New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar, 9Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Spiro T. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley, New York1988: 133-215Google Scholar). Moreover, vibrational modes of ligands bound to heme may be assigned by isotopic substitution measurements, and their properties, which reflect ligand structure, may be studied. It has been reported that in oxidized Nor, heme b 3 is not coordinated to the protein by its proximal histidine residue (6Moënne-Loccoz P. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5147-5152Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, the single oxygen isotope-sensitive ligand vibration observed at 811 cm−1 in the RR spectrum was attributed to the νas(Fe-O-Fe) of the hemeb 3/non-heme diiron center (7Moënne-Loccoz P. Richter O.-M.H. Huang H.-w. Wasser I.M. Ghiladi R.A. Karlin K.D. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9344-9345Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the structural implications involved in the transition from oxidized to reduced enzyme were not reported. The properties of oxidized Nor, when compared with those of the chemically generated deoxy (five-coordinate) and the nitrosyl complex, can be related to structural changes that take place in the protein upon ligand binding and release. It is these interactions between the heme and the protein that determine the biological properties of the heme protein. Moreover, in unraveling the NO protonation mechanism, it is necessary to establish sites in the enzyme that have exchangeable protons. If there are such sites near the high-spin heme b 3 or the non-heme Fe, then solvent exchange from protonated to deuterated buffers could lead to changes in the RR spectra because the vibrational frequencies are sensitive to effective mass. In an effort to gain information concerning these observations, we have used 413.1 nm RR excitation to examine the spectra of oxidized Nor upon deuteration and H218O exchange and compare them to those of the fully reduced form, the NO-bound form, and the NO photoproduct. Our data indicate the presence of two oxygen-sensitive modes at 811 and 833 cm−1 in the oxidized enzyme. The latter mode also shows deuterium sensitivity. With the identification of the two distinct νas(Fe-O-Fe) modes at 815 and 833 cm−1 of the heme/non-heme diiron center, its structural properties can be described now with more certainty. With the aid of isotopic substitution, we have also characterized the ferric-NO complex by its ν(Fe3+-NO) stretching frequency at 594 cm−1 and ν(NO) at 1904 cm−1, and we postulate that this species is a catalytic intermediate in the NO reduction cycle. In addition, we have shown that the nitrosyl species we detect is photolabile and that the photoproduct has vibrational properties that are different from those of the resting enzyme. Based on our results, we propose a structure-function model of Nor for the transition from the oxidized to the reduced form and from the oxidized to the NO-bound form and its photoproduct. Nitric-oxide reductase was purified as described elsewhere (5Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lübben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme was measured according to Ref. 5Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lübben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and was 40 μmol/mg/min (46e−/s). The samples were concentrated to 150 μm in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% dodecyl β-d-maltoside and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. For hydrogen/deuterium and H2O/H218O isotope studies, solutions of the oxidized enzyme were exchanged three times in 99.9% D2O (Aldrich) and 97% H2O18(Icon). The concentration of Nor was determined using an ε411 = 3.11 × 105m−1·cm−1. The pD solutions prepared in D2O buffers were measured by using a pH meter and assuming pD = pH (observed) + 0.4. The Raman experiments were carried out with 413.1 nm excitation obtained from a Kr+laser (Coherent K-90). Approximately 40 μl of a 50 μmenzyme solution in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (or pD = 7.4), was placed in a rotating (4000–6000 rpm) quartz Raman cell to minimize local heating. The sample cells are custom designed for anaerobic measurements and can be used for recording both the resonance Raman and optical absorption spectra (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lamda 20 UV-visible spectrometer). The Raman spectra were acquired by using a SPEX 1877 triplemate with an EG&G (model 1530-CUV-1024S) charge-coupled device detector. Frequency shifts in the Raman spectra were calibrated with toluene. The accuracy of the Raman shifts is about ±2 cm−1 for absolute shifts and about ±1 cm−1for relative shifts. The incident laser power was 5–7 milliwatts, and the total accumulation time was 20–30 min for each spectrum. FTIR spectra were obtained from 200–300 μmsamples with a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. Oxidized samples were exposed to 1 atm NO in an anaerobic cell to prepare the nitrosyl adduct and loaded anaerobically into a cell with CaF2 windows and a 0.025 mm spacer for the FTIR measurements and into a rotating quartz cell for the Raman measurements. NO gas was obtained from Messer, and isotopic NO (15NO) was purchased from Isotec. The FTIR spectrum was obtained as the difference using the buffer as background with 2 cm−1 spectral resolution and is the average of 1000 scans. The optical absorption spectrum of oxidized enzyme (Fig.1, trace A) displays maxima at 411, 530, and 558 nm, which are indicative of low-spin hemesb and c and high-spin hemeb 3. The shoulder at 595 nm is typical of the porphyrin-to-ferric charge transfer transition characteristic of ferric high-spin heme b 3. The spectrum of the NO-bound oxidized enzyme (Fig. 1, trace B) was obtained by the direct addition of gaseous NO to the resting enzyme and shows a Soret maximum at 416 nm and the visible transition at 562 nm along with the disappearance of the 595 nm band. For the reduced enzyme (Fig. 1,trace C) the Soret is at 420 nm, and the visible transitions are at 521, 551, and 558 nm. The high-frequency RR spectra are used to assess the spin and ligation states of the hemes via the porphyrin marker band frequencies and the status of the proximal and distal environments for the resting, deoxy, NO-bound, and photoproduct form of heme b 3. The RR spectra of heme proteins in the high-frequency region contain several well-established porphyrin modes termed as the oxidation state ν4 or the ligation state (ν3, ν2, and ν10) marker modes. Fig.2 shows the high-frequency RR spectra of oxidized (trace A) and fully reduced (trace B) Nor by using 413.1 nm excitation frequency, in which resonances from all hemes are enhanced, and the resulting assignments are summarized in Table I. The modes of the oxidized enzyme (trace A) at 1373 (ν4), 1492 (ν3), 1578 (ν2), and 1630 (ν10) cm−1 indicate the presence of a five-coordinate high-spin heme b3 . This suggests that the heme b 3 iron is ligated by either a proximal or a distal ligand (see below). Also present in this spectrum are modes at 1505 (ν3), 1584 (ν2), and 1639 (ν10) cm−1, indicating the presence of six-coordinate low-spin heme c and heme b. The mode at 1597 cm−1 originates from ν37 of low-spin heme b or heme c. The ν4bands for the ferric hemes have coincident positions despite the large differences in their redox potentials and porphyrin substituents. This is unusual in view of the ν4 dependence upon metal→porphyrin backbonding (dp→ eg(π)). In the spectrum of the reduced enzyme (trace B), the ν4 mode is located at 1362 cm−1, establishing that all hemes are in the ferrous state. The ν3 at 1472 cm−1, ν2 at 1560 cm−1, and ν10 at 1606 cm−1establish the presence of a ferrous, five-coordinate high-spin hemeb3 . The presence of low-spin hemes cand b is shown by ν3 intensity at 1494 cm−1. The modes at 1584 and 1591 cm−1 are assigned to ν2 of the low-spin hemes b andc, respectively. The ν10 vibrational mode for the low-spin hemes is expected around 1620 cm−1. Overlap with the vinyl stretching vibration near 1625 cm−1, however, hinders the assignment of the ν10 vibration. The frequencies of all modes are in agreement with previous analyses of RR spectra of enzymes containing hemes b and c and with those of Fe protoporphyrin model compounds (10Varotsis C. Babcock G.T.

Raman bands in the low-frequency range do not only include modes from the porphyrin macrocycle and its substituents but also include Fe-ligand motions along the axis normal to the heme. The 250–750 cm−1 region of the Nor spectra is crowded with bands, most of which can be assigned to porphyrin or substituent modes of ferric, six-coordinate low-spin hemes b andc. Intensity changes and frequency shifts upon H218O and D2O exchanges are observed only in the 740–890 cm−1 spectral region. This spectral region is displayed on an extended view in Fig.4. With the Soret band excitation, the RR spectra of ferrous five-coordinate heme b-type with histidine as an axial ligand exhibit iron-histidine stretching modes in the 200–250 cm−1 (8Kitagawa T. Spiro T. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley, New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar). The frequency of the 207 cm−1 mode (trace D) is similar to that found for the ν(Fe2+-His) of other ferrous, five-coordinate high-spin hemes b (8Kitagawa T. Spiro T. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. Wiley, New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar).Figure 4Same as Fig. 3, but in the spectral region 740–890 cm −1 .

By subtracting the H218O spectrum (trace B) from that recorded in H216O, we obtain the difference spectrum A-B shown in the inset. This difference spectrum shows two oxygen isotope-sensitive band pairs at 815/776 and 833/796 cm−1 for H216O/H218O. To determine if there is any evidence for hydrogen bonding to the oxygen-sensitive modes, we measured the RR spectrum in D2O buffer. Trace C shows the spectrum of oxidized Nor in D2O. Comparison of trace C withtrace A shows that the 833 cm−1 band is upshifted to 836 cm−1 in D2O. Further evidence for the upshift of the 833 cm−1 mode in the D2O spectrum and of the two oxygen isotope-sensitive band pairs at 815/776 and 833/796 cm−1 for H216O/H218O is shown in the difference spectrum (inset, C-B). The observed shift upon deuteration is consistent with hydrogen bonding interactions. The difference spectrum C-B also shows that the 815 cm−1 band appears to be somewhat broader in D2O than in H2O. If the bandwidth depends on conformational inhomogeneity, then the 815 cm−1 band suggests packing of amino acid residues to the bridged oxygen. No other oxygen isotope-sensitive modes are detected in the 160–900 cm−1region, suggesting that neither the symmetric stretch nor the Fe-O-Fe bend is enhanced with 413.1 nm excitation. In addition, we do not detect the 815 and 833 cm−1 modes in the RR spectrum of the fully reduced enzyme (Fig. 3, trace D), as would be expected from the transition from the oxidized to reduced state. The data demonstrate that both the 815 and 833 cm−1modes can be assigned to the νas(Fe-O-Fe) of Nor because the 38–39 cm−1 shift is in agreement with that expected from the harmonic oscillator approximation for Fe-O-Fe. The spectral perturbations in the high-frequency region of the RR spectra caused by the addition of NO to the resting enzyme (Fig.5 trace A) are limited except for the disappearance of ν3 and ν2 signals at 1492 and 1578 cm−1 from the ferric five-coordinate high-spin heme b 3. Coordination of NO to hemeb3 of the oxidized enzyme shifts the ν3 and ν2 modes to higher frequency, such that they coincide with those of the low-spin hemes c andb at 1505 and 1584 cm−1, respectively (trace B). This indicates that hemeb 3 is ferric six-coordinate low-spin in the NO complex. The marked differences we observe in the NO-bound spectra as a function of laser power (trace C) indicate the occurrence of a photolabile species. Identification of ν3 and ν2 at 1492 and 1572 cm−1 (trace C) indicates that photodissociation of the NO ligand is producing a five-coordinate high-spin heme b 3. The core-size band ν2 has lost intensity and is downshifted to 1572 cm−1, indicating an expanded core in the photoproduct, as compared with the oxidized form. Direct confirmation of the heme b 3 nitrosyl complex requires detection of the heme Fe3+-NO stretching vibration. The low-frequency RR spectra of the NO-bound form of Nor in the ferric state is shown in Fig. 6. Trace A is from a sample of oxidized enzyme, trace B is from a sample that was exposed to 14N16O, andtrace C is from a sample that was exposed to15N16O. Traces B and Cidentify the line at 594 cm−1 for14N16O as a mode that involves motion of the NO because it downshifts by 6 cm−1 to 588 cm−1upon isotope substitution. Although the ferric-NO species has a frequency that is similar to the 594 cm−1 observed for non-heme Fe-NO complexes (12Noguchi T. Hoshino M. Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Inoue Y. Endo I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16777-16781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we nevertheless favor a hemeb 3-NO structure for the species we detect. The basis for this lies in the high-frequency RR data. In analogy to other heme proteins, such as Mb and Hb, in which histidine is coordinated to the iron, and the strongest NO isotope-sensitive line present in the spectrum is the Fe-NO stretching mode, we assign the mode at 594 cm−1 as the Fe-NO stretching mode. The ν(Fe3+-NO) stretching vibration in nitrosyl Nor is similar to the ν(Fe3+-NO) frequency found in nitrosyl-hemoglobin and to that of the low and high pH nitrosyl-myoglobin (13Benko B. Yu N.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7042-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Mackin H.C. Benko B., Yu, N.T. Gersonde K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 199-203Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). No other isotope-sensitive mode that could be identified as a possible Fe-N-O bending mode is present in the spectrum of Nor. Traces D and E were obtained with relatively high power, and the absence of modes located at 594 and 588 cm−1 indicates photodissociation of the NO ligand, as it was observed in the high-frequency experiments. The FTIR spectrum displayed in the inset shows a single vibration at 1904 cm−1. This frequency is very similar to the ν(NO) of the acidic form of metMb-NO (15Tomita T. Haruta N. Aki M. Kitagawa T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2666-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that of horseradish peroxidase-NO (13Benko B. Yu N.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7042-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Tomita T. Haruta N. Aki M. Kitagawa T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2666-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but is 18 cm−1 higher than that of the neutral metMb-NO (15Tomita T. Haruta N. Aki M. Kitagawa T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2666-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Miller L.M. Pedraza A.J. Chance M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12199-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). No other modes are present in the frequency range 1800–2000 cm−1 that could be identified as possible NO modes of the non-heme iron. The assignment of the Fe3+-NO and NO stretching frequencies in the reaction of Nor with NO provides a clear description of the nitrosyl complex. Moreover, the 800–900 cm−1 spectral region of the RR spectra indicate that photodissociation of the NO ligand from the distal site of heme b 3 is not followed by regeneration of the heme Fe-O-Fe bond. The most reasonable assignment for the two oxygen-sensitive modes present in the spectra of oxidized Nor at 815 and 833 cm−1 is that they arise from two different conformations of a heme Fe(III)-O-Fe(III) complex. The conformer with the weaker hydrogen bond to the bridged oxo is expected to have the weaker Fe-O-Fe bond and thus the lower frequency vibration. According to this interpretation, the more strongly hydrogen-bonded conformer in Nor contributes to the 833 cm−1 mode and has an Fe-O-Fe bond strength comparable to that found in the model compound [(5L) Fe(III)-O-Fe(III)-Cl]+ (νas(Fe-O-Fe) = 841 cm−1) (7Moënne-Loccoz P. Richter O.-M.H. Huang H.-w. Wasser I.M. Ghiladi R.A. Karlin K.D. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9344-9345Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The 815 cm−1 mode, however, is 26 cm−1 lower than that of the [(5L) Fe(III)-O-Fe(III)-Cl]+, heme/non-heme complex, despite the fact that the model compound reproduces the immediate coordination spheres expected to occur around the irons in the protein environment (7Moënne-Loccoz P. Richter O.-M.H. Huang H.-w. Wasser I.M. Ghiladi R.A. Karlin K.D. de Vries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9344-9345Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Nor species we detect has a frequency that is close to the 818–829 cm−1 bands observed for the six-coordinate ferryl complexes (11Nakamoto K. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1990; 100: 363-402Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the five coordinate oxoferrylporphyrin π-cation radical (11Nakamoto K. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1990; 100: 363-402Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) observed at 818 cm−1. Despite the similarity in these frequencies, we nevertheless favor a Fe-O-Fe structure for the species we detect. We attribute the conformer with the high-frequency of νas(Fe-O-Fe) at 833 cm−1 as one with a strong positive polar interaction (including hydrogen bonding) between the oxygen atom and the distal residues. This way, a rigid (closed) structure is formed, in which the O atom is stabilized by hydrogen bonding. The conformer with the low-frequency of νas(Fe-O-Fe) at 815 cm−1 is assigned as one with an open structure. The I833cm−1/I815 cm−1 indicates that the H-bonded conformer is the major species in the resting form of the enzyme. Because we can eliminate an explanation involving the heme b 3proximal ligation for rationalizing the open versus closed conformation behavior, we consider as an attractive model one that invokes variation in the extent to which formation of a hydrogen bond between the bridged oxo moiety and distal residues, including the axial ligands of non-heme iron and/or a H2O molecule, can occur. This indicates that hydrogen bonding to the oxo moiety by distal residues may be the difference between the two conformations of the Fe-O-Fe unit in Nor. It will be interesting to determine whether there are associated variations in the catalytic function between these two forms because the interaction of the non-heme iron with the heme-bound NO intermediates in the dinuclear site could be quite different for these two forms of the enzyme. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether the two forms of the resting enzyme are a reflection of activity regulation. TableII summarizes ν(Fe3+-NO), δ(Fe3+-NO), and ν(NO) frequencies for several heme proteins and model compounds. In the histidine-containing proteins, using Soret excitation RR spectroscopy, only the Fe-NO stretching and Fe-N-O bending vibrations have been detected (13Benko B. Yu N.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7042-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 2843-2850Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This observation was attributed to the little orbital conjugation that exists between the NO group and the heme in the His-Fe-NO complexes. In the cysteine-containing enzyme P-450Nor, however, in addition to the Fe-NO stretching vibration, the N-O has been detected using Soret excitation (18Obayashi E. Tsukamoto K. Adachi S.-I. Takahashi S. Nomura M. Iizuka T. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7807-7816Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, the ν(NO) of His-Fe3+-NO heme proteins was reported by applying UV RR excitation (15Tomita T. Haruta N. Aki M. Kitagawa T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2666-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have searched in the 1800–2000 cm−1 RR range and found no evidence for such a mode in our Soret excitation data, in agreement with previous observations in other His-Fe-NO complexes. The stretching frequency of Fe3+-NO in P-450, which has cysteine as the proximal ligand, is about 70 cm−1 downshifted compared with that of heme proteins possessing histidine as the proximal ligand (15Tomita T. Haruta N. Aki M. Kitagawa T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2666-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Miller L.M. Pedraza A.J. Chance M.R.

Soc. 1997; 119: 7807-7816Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Variations in the basicity of the proximal ligand are likely to contribute to the vibrational differences between the cysteine- and histidine-containing ferric nitrosyl complexes. Considering the strong electron donating effect of the cysteine sulfur in P-450, it may be argued that the Fe(III)-NO bond strength is a sensitive function of the proximal ligand basicity; the vibrational frequency decreases as the proximal ligand becomes electron donating to the Fe(III)-NO center (see below).Table IIFrequencies (cm −1 ) of the NO isotope-sensitive lines in several ferric nitrosyl proteinsMoleculesν(Fe-NO)δ(Fe-N-O)ν(NO)Ref. no.Mb595573192213Benko B.

https://openalex.org/W1989324947,"A mutation in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA1) is associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a common, inherited eye disease. Expression of mutant (CNGA1-RP) homomeric channels in Xenopus oocytes revealed no measurable differences compared to wild-type CNGA1 homomers. As native retinal rod CNG channels comprise CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits, we coexpressed CNGA1-RP and CNGB1. Surprisingly, this subunit combination did not produce detectable channels at the membrane surface. We show that the mechanism underlying this defect involves an intersubunit interaction between CNGA1 and CNGB1 that was not formed between CNGA1-RP and CNGB1 subunits. In the absence of this interaction, a short N-terminal region in CNGB1 prevented membrane expression. Thus, disruption of a regulatory interaction by mutation in CNGA1 exposed a region of CNGB1 that disrupted surface expression of heteromeric CNGA1-RP/CNGB1 channels, accounting for this instance of RP."

During latency little or no viral replication takes place; instead, the EBV-infected B cell is immortalized through the expression of a small subset of viral genes, serving to establish and maintain cellular growth transformation. On the other hand, a switch in the genetic program can lead to the expression of viral replication-associated genes. It can be accomplished, in vitro, by treatment of latent B cells with various activating agents, including phorbol esters, butyrate, Ca2+ ionophores, and anti-immunoglobulin. These treatments trigger a variety of cellular signaling pathways resulting in the activation of cellular transcription factors activating transcription from the BZLF1 promoter Zp (1Daibata M.

Zta is a lytic switch transactivator, a protein that is a transcription factor of the b-Zip family, which exhibits homology to c-Fos and the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) (3Farrell P.J.

The Zta protein activates the expression of EBV lytic genes necessary for lytic DNA replication (8Countryman J. Jenson H. Seibl R. Wolf H. Miller G. J.

Zta also binds to the lytic origin site of EBV replication, and this binding is a prerequisite for EBV DNA replication (10Schepers A. Pich D. Mankertz J. Hammerschmidt W. J.

Zta can also be translated from bicistronic mRNA that contains both BRLF1 and BZLF1. The mRNA is transcribed from Rp, located in a BamHIR fragment; however, translation of BZLF1 from the bicistronic mRNA requires Rta protein (11Chang P.J. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. J.

This contributes to the induction of EBV lytic cycle (12Cayrol C. Flemington E.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13di Renzo L. Altiok A. Klein G. Klein E. Int. J.

These receptor-activated Smads form a heteromeric complex with Smad4 and then translocate into the nucleus where target genes are transcriptionally activated (21Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr.

The BZLF1 gene promoter Zp is located between the coding sequence of BRLF1 (Rta) and BZLF1 (Zta). The previously identified responsive elements of Zp-221 (covering from −221 to +13 of Zp) contain four ZI elements, a ZII domain, and two juxtaposed elements ZIIIA and ZIIIB (4Flemington E. Speck S.H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Flemington E. Speck S.H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZI domains can be regulated by Sp1 and Sp3. ZII domain contains a CREB/AP-1-like binding site, which is a key element for various inducing agents. ZIII domains are the major Zta auto-activation sites. By determining Zp transcriptional regulation, in response to TGF-β, we discovered a potential SBE site ∼12-bp proximal to the previously determined promoter region, −221 to +13. In order to substantiate that the SBE site is inducible, we examined a Zp reporter construct, Zp-236, which is 15 bp longer than the previously used construct. We discovered that the SBE site, GTCTG, −233 to −229, is crucial to Zp activity. We also discovered that in response to TGF-β induction, the SBE site and the AP-1 motif act cooperatively. The activation is through the cooperation between Smad3/4, c-Jun, and c-Fos.

The Zp-236 was generated by PCR using B95-8 genomic DNA as a template and primers Zp-F (5′-AATGTCTGCTGCATGCCATG-3′, corresponding to nt 103,430 to nt 103,411 of B95-8 genome) and Zp-R (5′-GGCAAGGTGCAATGTTTAG-3′, corresponding to nt 103,182 to nt 103,200 of B95–8 genome). The PCR product was cloned into the SmaI-treated pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). The PCR condition was reported previously (27Liang C.L. Tsai C.N. Chung P.J. Chen J.L. Sun C.M. Chen R.H. Hong J.H. Chang Y.S. Virology. 2000; 277: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Zp-181 was generated by PCR with primers Zp-181-F (5′-CTTATTTTAGACACTTCTGA-3′) and Zp-R. Zp-81 was generated with primers Zp-81-F (5′-CACGTCCCAAACCATGACAT-3′) and Zp-R. The reporter plasmids that contained mutated Zp with a mutation at the AP-1 consensus binding element and SBE site were generated by PCR. The SBE site-specific Zp mutants were generated by PCR using primers Zp-R and Zp-236m1 (5′-TGCGAGATCTAATATGTACTGCATGCCATG-3′) or Zp-181m2 (5′-CTTATTTTAGACACTGGTAAAAACTGC-3′), respectively. The AP-1 site-specific mutant, Zp-236mAP1, was generated by overlapping PCR using primers Zp-F, Zp-236mAP1-F (5′-CCCAAACGAATTCATCACAGAGGAG-3′), Zp-236mAP1-R (5′-CTCCTCTGTGATGAATTCGTTTGGG-3′), and Zp-R. Zp-81mAP1 was generated with primers Zp-81mAP1(5′-CACGTCCCAAACGAATTCATCACA-3′) and Zp-R. Zp-236m1mAP1 was generated by PCR using Zp-236mAP1 as template with two primers, Zp-236m1 and Zp-R. The underlined nucleotides shown above indicate mutations. The PCR products were digested withSmaI and MluI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and then inserted into an SmaI and MluI-digested pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). The pCMV3 expression vector was constructed by inserting 750-bp CMV-IE (cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene) promoter into HindIII site of pGEM3 (Promega). The c-Jun expression plasmid was constructed by inserting cDNA of c-Jun into pCEP4 vector. The c-Fos expression plasmid was constructed by inserting cDNA of c-Fos into pBluescript KS-vector. Both c-Jun and c-Fos expression plasmids were provided by Dr. S. L. Chen, National Defense Medical School. The dominant-negative Erk1/2(KR), DN-p38, and DN-JNK expression plasmids were obtained from Dr. J. S. Yu, Chang-Gung University. The expression vectors pcDNA3-Smad3, Smad4, and DN Smad3 were described previously (17Zhang Y. Feng X., We, R. Derynck R.

The sequences of these constructs were confirmed by Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) using T7 Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter plasmid (2 μg) and the indicated amount of expression plasmid were introduced into P3HR-1 (5 × 106), Rael (5 × 106), and Ramos (8 × 106) cells by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 0.22 kV using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad), and the transfected cells were incubated for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). The protein concentration of the cell lysate was measured by using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). A 50-μg sample of protein extract was used to measure the luciferase activity in an illuminometer (Berthold autolumat model LB953, Germany). To examine the effect of TGF-β, cells were transfected with plasmid DNA and treated with 4 ng/ml recombinant human TGF-β 1 (R & D Systems) for 24 h. To test the effect of TPA treatment, cells were cultured in 5 ml of 0.4% FBS RPMI 1640 with 30 ng/ml TPA for 24 h. Plasmid DNA was purified by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation. To examine the effect of sense or antisense oligonucleotides, P3HR-1 cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of Zp-236 and sense or antisense oligonucleotides. The sense Smad4 (5′-CAA ATG GAC AAT ATG TCT ATT ACG-3′), the antisense Smad 4 (5′-CGT AAT AGA CAT ATT GTC CAT TTG-3′), the sense c-Jun (5′-TCT ATG ACT GCA AAG ATG GAA ACG-3′,) and the antisense c-Jun (5′-CGT TTC CAT CTT TGC AGT CAT AGA-3′) were used. After 72 h, cells were then treated with 4 ng/ml TGF-β for another 12 h before harvesting. Cells were washed three times with a phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant of the whole-cell lysate was then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrotransfered to the nitrocellulose membrane, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies. Anti-Zta monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. M. R. Chen and C. H. Tsai, National Taiwan University (31Tsai C.H. Liu M.T. Chen M.R., Lu, J. Yanf H.L. Chen J.Y. Yang C.S. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 4: 69-77Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Anti-tubulin antibody was purchased from Neo Markers. Anti-FLAG-Smad protein antibody (anti-FLAG antibody M2) was purchased from Sigma, and anti-Myc-Smad protein antibody (anti-Myc antibody) was purchased from CLONTECH. Anti-c-Jun antibody (KM-1) and anti-c-Fos antibody (6–2H-2F) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The blot was then subjected to the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) for the detection of Zta and tubulin protein. The double-stranded oligonucleotide carrying the Z promoter (Zp) was used as the probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The oligonucleotide was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The mixture of 293 cell nuclear extract and 15,000 cpm of γ-32P-oligonucleotide was incubated in a buffer containing 0.13 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For a competitive assay, a 200-fold excess of the individual cold double-stranded oligonucleotides was added to the reaction mixture before the addition of the γ-32P-labeled probe. After a 30-min incubation period at room temperature, the samples were loaded on a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE at 100 V for 2.5–3 h. For the supershift assay, the reaction mixture was incubated with 4 μg of antibody and applied to gel. Anti-FLAG-Smad protein antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-c-Fos antibody (6–2H-2F), anti-ATF-2 antibody (N-96), and anti-Sp1 antibody (1C6) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax film. Total RNA isolated from Rael and P3HR-1 cells treated with 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 or untreated was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of total RNA were heated at 70 °C for 5 min and then rapidly cooled on ice. Reverse transcription was carried out in a reaction containing 20 μm Zp-specific 3′ primer (5′-TTGGGCACATCTGCTTCAAC-3′), 2.5 mm dNTP, 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega), and 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega) at 42 °C for 1 h. Ten pmol of the 5′ primer (5′-CTAGCAGACATTGGTGTTCC-3′) and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) were added to one-third of the reaction mixture. Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles of PCR for 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Ten μl of RT-PCR product was analyzed on 2% agarose gel, followed by the Southern hybridization. For quantitative RT-PCR analysis, RNA isolated from P3HR-1 (5 × 106) cells transfected with Smad3/4 and/or c-Jun/c-Fos expression vectors were treated without or with 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. The total RNA was isolated by Trizol reagent recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was applied to first strand cDNA synthesis by using a random hexamer primer (5′-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′) and Taqman Reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Fifty nmol of the Zta 5′ primer and Zta-3′ primer or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-specific 5′ primer (5′-TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCATGAC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′) were mixed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The real time detection of emission intensity of SYBR Green bound to double-stranded DNA was analyzed by GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). All of the procedures were performed as per the manufacturer's recommendations, and the quantitative PCRs were carried out in triplicate for each primer set. After PCR, background subtraction of the initial cycles was followed by determination of the optimal threshold level (5% of the full scale) of fluorescent intensity using GeneAmp 5700 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). The level of mRNA for BZLF1 gene was expressed as a ratio to GAPDHmRNA value in each sample. Each PCR product was electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels to confirm the specific DNA band. To prepare the virus stock for infection of EBV-negative CA46 cells, the supernatant of Rael cells treated with or without 2 ng/ml TGF-β for 2 days was collected by centrifugation. The pellet went through three rounds of freezing and thawing before clearing by centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size membrane, and the filtrate was centrifuged for 2 h at 8,800 × g with a Beckman SW28 rotor. The resultant pellet, a virus preparation, was suspended in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for in vitro infection assay. One-half of the virus preparation was used to detect EBV genomic DNA by PCR. The other half was used to infect 2.5 × 106 EBV-negative CA46 cells. Forty eight h after infection, DNA of the infected CA46 cells was analyzed by PCR using EBV-specific primers, 30F and 30R, described previously (32Chang Y.S., Su, I.J. Chung P.J. Shu C.H., Ng, C.K., Wu, S.J. Liu S.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a control, a similar preparation was obtained from a culture medium of Rael cells without TGF-β treatment. To prepare the virus stock for the in vitro transformation assay, supernatants of Rael cells treated without or with various concentrations of TGF-β (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 ng/ml) for 2 days were collected by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in the medium and filtered with a 0.45-μm pore size membrane. To transform the cells in vitro, each of 1 × 107umbilical cord primary B cells derived from three individuals were infected with the pellets resuspended in 3 ml of RPMI 1640 growth medium after ultracentrifugation. The infected cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, and the outgrowing cells were scored 1½ months later. TGF-β treatment induces EBV to enter a lytic cycle through the action of the latent-to-lytic switching BZLF1gene product (Zta) whose expression is activated (34Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). To examine how the BZLF1 gene was regulated, we first tested the time course of BZLF1 gene and Zta protein expression in two EBV-positive cell lines, Rael and P3HR-1. Cells treated with 4 ng/ml TGF-β were subjected to the RT-PCR using sequence-specific primers for BZLF1 gene. As illustrated in Fig.1, Zta transcripts were significantly elevated 1 h after TGF-β treatment and were increased ∼200% by 12 h. Zta protein was also easily detected by anti-Zta monoclonal antibody at 12 h after TGF-β treatment and increased to ∼500% at 24 h in P3HR-1 cells. Similarly, in Rael cells, Zta transcripts were significantly elevated 2 h after TGF-β treatment and increased ∼300% by 48 h. Zta protein was easily detected by anti-Zta monoclonal antibody at 12 h after TGF-β treatment and reached the peak level (∼500%) at 48 h after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 1 B). This level of activation remained as the treatment was prolonged. These results suggest that TGF-β induces BZLF1 gene expression and Zta protein production. The TGF-β signaling pathway signal involves the cooperation of the effector Smad proteins including Smad3 and Smad4 (16Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 34Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). Among them, Smad4 recognizes and binds to a Smad4-binding element (SBE) or to a core “CAGA” sequence (or SBE-like sequences) within the regulatory region of the targeted genes (12Cayrol C. Flemington E.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zawel L. Dai J.L. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 45Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of Zp-236 identifies a potential SBE site (−233 to −229), two CAGA boxes (−166 to −163 and −59 to −56), in addition to the previously reported AP-1 recognition motif (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, to study the mechanism involved in the TGF-β-inducedBZLF1 gene activation, the Zp-236 was generated (Fig.2 B) and was used to examine the effect of TGF-β. P3HR-1 cells were transfected with Zp-236, and the transfected cells were treated with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 10 ng/ml TGF-β, respectively, for 24 h. Promoter strength, in terms of luciferase reporter gene activity, was measured. Activation of Zp was increasingly enhanced as a function of TGF-β concentration: from ∼2-fold over the basal value with 0.1 ng/ml to ∼3.5-fold with >2 ng/ml (Fig.3 A), although the increment was relatively small. Zp promoter activity correlated withBZLF1 gene transcription and Zta protein production as demonstrated in Fig. 1.Figure 3Zp activation in response to TGF-β treatment. A, relative Zp activity in P3HR-1 cells as a function of TGF-β doses. Transfected cells containing Zp-236 were treated with increasing amounts (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 10 ng/ml) of TGF-β, and the luciferase activity (fold increase) was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative luciferase activity was the ratio of Zp-236 luciferase activity measured in the presence of TGF-β to that measured without TGF-β. Controls were as follows: pGL2-Basic as a vector control and pCMV-luc a positive control (data not shown). B, effect of Smad proteins in Zp-236 activation with or without TGF-β. P3HR-1 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of Zp-236 and 2 μg each of Smad3, Smad4, and dominant-negative Smad3 (DN Smad3), respectively. The cells were then treated with 4 ng/ml TGF-β, and the luciferase activity was measured as in A. Plasmid pcDNA3 served as the vector control. As in A, the relative promoter activity (fold increase over the activity obtained without any factor) was determined and plotted.C, expression of p3TP-lux induced by TGF-β in P3HR-1 cells. Plasmid p3TP-lux, serving as control, was used to monitor TGF-β responsiveness. + signifies the presence of the agent. The values were the average of six independent experiments. The S.D. is indicated with a vertical bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the cooperation of the effector Smad proteins in Zp activation, Zp-236 with Smad3 or Smad4 or further with both expression vectors was co-transfected, respectively, into P3HR-1 cells, and the transfected cells were treated with 4 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, Zp-236 was activated 2–3-fold by the expression of the ectopically transferred Smad3 or Smad4 without TGF-β. In the presence of TGF-β, Zp activity of the control was enhanced ∼2-fold, whereas it was stimulated ∼6-fold over the basal level without TGF-β by Smad3 and ∼4-fold by Smad4. When the cell contained both Smad3 and Smad4, Zp was activated ∼6-fold without TGF-β; in contrast, in the presence of TGF-β, it was ∼11-fold over the basal level without TGF-β. The addition of dominant-negative Smad3 (DN Smad3) or dominant-negative Smad4 (DN Smad4), which inhibited the TGF-β-induced activation, eliminated the enhancement (Fig.3 B, data not shown for DN Smad4), confirming the activation observed above. As a positive control, p3TP-lux that would be induced by TGF-β induction was activated ∼4-fold with 4 ng/ml TGF-β (Fig.3 C). The effect of TGF-β on transcriptional activation of target genes is to form a Smad complex such as Smad3-Smad4 or Smad2-Smad3-Smad4, which enters the nucleus. As a result, Smad4 should recognize and bind to the SBE site (−233 to −229) and two SBE-like sites (−166 to −163 and −59 to −56) within Zp-236 (Fig. 2 A). To test whether or not Smad4 indeed recognized these sites, 293 cells were infected with a FLAG-tagged Smad4 recombinant adenovirus, followed by TGF-β treatment. Nuclear extracts of the 293 cells were then prepared and used for EMSA. A DNA complex was formed using probe 1 (Fig.4, A and B). This complex was supershifted to a higher molecular weight complex detected by an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody but not by an anti-ATF-2 antibody (a nonspecific antibody). This complex was also competed off with a 200× unlabeled probe 1 and with the CAGA motif (Smad4 consensus binding motif). The complex formation was not affected when mutated SBE sequences were added (Fig. 4 B). Similar supershifts were obtained when probe 2 (−181 to −81) and probe 3 (−81 to +13), containing the two SBE-like sequences, respectively, were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and used for EMSA (Fig. 4,C and D). These results suggested that Smad4 indeed physically bound to the SBE site and the two SBE-like sequences located within Zp-236. A recent report (33Fahmi H. Cochet C. Hmama Z. Opolon P. Joab I. J.

Increases in the activity of the IKK complex result in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB and the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Recent data indicate that the constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway by the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I, Tax protein leads to enhanced phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO by IKKβ. To address further the significance of IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO, we determined the sites in IKKγ/NEMO that were phosphorylated by IKKβ, and we assayed whether IKKγ/NEMO phosphorylation was involved in modulating IKKβ activity. IKKγ/NEMO is rapidly phosphorylated following treatment of cells with stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 that activate the NF-κB pathway. By using both in vitro and in vivo assays, IKKβ was found to phosphorylate IKKγ/NEMO predominantly in its carboxyl terminus on serine residue 369 in addition to sites in the central region of this protein. Surprisingly, mutation of these carboxyl-terminal serine residues increased the ability of IKKγ/NEMO to stimulate IKKβ kinase activity. These results indicate that the differential phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO by IKKβ and perhaps other kinases may be important in regulating IKK activity.

The ability to activate rapidly and subsequently silence the NF-κB pathway in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli suggests that both positive and negative regulation is involved in its control. The further characterization of the mechanisms that regulate this pathway will be important for better understanding how NF-κB is involved in the control of the host immune and inflammatory responses.The members of the NF-κB family of transcription factors, which include p105/50, p100/52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB, contain a Rel homology domain that mediates their heterodimerization and homodimerization properties and DNA-binding properties (2Baldwin A.S.

Thus, IKKγ/NEMO plays a central role in the activation of the NF-κB pathway in response to a variety of different stimuli.Recently it was demonstrated (40Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I, Tax protein, which results in the constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway, leads to constitutive phosphorylation of both IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO. Furthermore, IKKβ was shown to phosphorylate IKKγ/NEMO using in vitro kinase assays. These results suggested that IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO could potentially regulate the function of each other. In this study, bothin vivo and in vitro assays were utilized to characterize IKKγ/NEMO phosphorylation by IKKβ. Our results indicate that IKKβ phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO appears to be important for regulating its functional properties.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the role of IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO on regulating its function was explored. IKKβ was found to phosphorylate IKKγ/NEMO predominantly on serine residue 369 in the carboxyl terminus of IKKγ/NEMO using both in vitro andin vivo assays. Mutation of serine residues 369 and 375 increased the ability of IKKγ/NEMO to stimulate IKKβ phosphorylation of IκBα and activate an NF-κB reporter construct. Mutation of the putative phosphorylation sites at residues 147, 148, 156, and 158 did not markedly alter IKKγ/NEMO phosphorylation unless the carboxyl terminus was eliminated. These results suggest that phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO by IKKβ and perhaps other kinases may be important in modulating its function.IKKγ/NEMO is required for NF-κB activation in response to a variety of different signals (13Li Y.

Thus, the mechanisms by which IKKγ/NEMO leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway has been the subject of intense investigation. The ability of IKKγ/NEMO to regulate the NF-κB pathway is likely mediated via its differential interactions with factors that regulate the NF-κB pathway. Transient expression assays of IKKγ/NEMO indicate that IKKγ/NEMO results in the recruitment of IKKβ into the high molecular weight IKK complex and stimulate its kinase activity (27Li X.H. Fang X. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4494-4500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Yamamoto Y. Kim D.W. Kwak Y.T. Verma U. Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol.

Furthermore, IKKγ/NEMO can enhance the association of the IκB proteins with the IKK complex to facilitate its phosphorylation and subsequent degradation (33Yamamoto Y. Kim D.W. Kwak Y.T. Verma U. Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36327-36336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). IKKγ/NEMO has also been demonstrated to be able to increase IKK activity in a reconstituted yeast system to result in the assembly of the high molecular weight IKK complex (44Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IKKγ/NEMO can bind to other proteins including the adaptor protein RIP at early times following TNFα binding to the TNF receptor (13Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L., Ye, J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and the NF-κB inhibitory protein A20 at later times post-TNFα treatment to reduce TNFα-mediated effects on the NF-κB pathway (30Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the differential association of IKKγ/NEMO with cellular regulatory proteins is important for modulating TNFα-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway. Thus IKKγ/NEMO interacts with a variety of cellular proteins that are likely critical in modulating IKK activity.Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are important in altering protein function (45Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed the ability of IKKβ to phosphorylate IKKγ/NEMO and then determined whether IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO altered its ability to stimulate IKKβ activity. First, we demonstrated that endogenous IKKγ/NEMO was rapidly phosphorylated following treatment of cells with activators of the NF-κB pathway including TNFα and IL-1. It is interesting to note that the kinetics of IKKγ/NEMO phosphorylation correlate with the increases in IKKβ activity in response to these agents. These results in conjunction with data obtained from transient expression assays and in vitrokinase assays with IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO suggest that IKKβ can directly phosphorylate IKKγ/NEMO. The level of phosphorylated IKKγ/NEMO increased rapidly following cytokine stimulation. The rapid decrease in both IKKγ/NEMO phosphorylation and IKKβ activity following cytokine treatment suggests that both of these proteins could potentially be targets of phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 2A which reduces IKK activity following cytokine treatment (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The transient phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO following cytokine stimulation may result in its differential interactions with a variety of cellular proteins including IKKβ, IκB, A20, and RIP (9Mercurio F.

A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Our studies suggest that at least two regions of IKKγ/NEMO are phosphorylated by IKKβ. However, additional sites of IKKβ phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO are indeed likely. Other kinases such as protein kinase Cα have also been demonstrated to phosphorylate serine residues in IKKγ/NEMO at positions that differ from those identified using IKKβ (43Tarassishin L. Horwitz M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results seen with mutation of residues in IKKγ/NEMO that are targets for IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation, mutation of serine residues 85 and 141 that are phosphorylated by protein kinase Cα result in the reduced ability of IKKγ/NEMO to stimulate IKKβ phosphorylation of IκBα (43Tarassishin L. Horwitz M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Given the specific association of IKKγ/NEMO and IKKβ and the temporal relationship between the increased IKKβ activity and IKKγ/NEMO phosphorylation, our data and that of a previous study (40Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggest that IKKβ is an important, although not likely the only, kinase involved in phosphorylating IKKγ/NEMO.The major site of IKKβ phosphorylation in the carboxyl terminus of IKKγ/NEMO is serine residue 369, although serine residue 375 may also potentially be phosphorylated by IKKβ. IKKβ was also found to phosphorylate IKKγ/NEMO in a region between amino acids 137 and 180 at potential sites including residues 147, 148, 156, and 158. It is likely that IKKβ predominantly phosphorylates the carboxyl terminus of IKKγ/NEMO when not bound to other proteins. However, the carboxyl terminus of IKKγ/NEMO is capable of binding to a variety of proteins such as A20 and RIP (30Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and it is possible that this binding may lead to conformational changes that make additional domains in IKKγ/NEMO more accessible to phosphorylation by IKKβ. It is also possible that phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO may be temporally regulated with the carboxyl-terminal residues initially phosphorylated by IKKβ and then either IKKβ or other kinases phosphorylating additional residues in IKKγ/NEMO.The results of this study suggest that IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO leads to its decreased ability to stimulate IKKβ and activate an NF-κB reporter construct. Initially, the nonphosphorylated form of IKKγ/NEMO may preferentially bind to IKKβ to stimulate its ability to phosphorylate IκBα. Subsequent phosphorylation of IKKγ/NEMO by IKKβ may perhaps alter its conformation, its ability to oligomerize (46Poyet J.-L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J.-H. Fernandes-Alnemri T.F. Yamaoka S.

This can potentially decrease IKK activity and/or lead to IKKγ/NEMO association with other regulators of the NF-κB pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2322995926,"The JNK group (for c-Jun N-terminal kinase) of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) is activated in cells in response to environmental stress and cytokines. Activation of JNK is the result of dual phosphorylation by specific upstream kinases which phosphorylate the TxY motif. Much less is known concerning the down-regulation by protein phosphatases. Here, we demonstrate that the tyrosine-specific and constitutively-expressed phosphatase VHR (for VH1-Related) down-regulates the JNK signaling pathway at the level of JNK dephosphorylation. VHR was shown to efficiently dephosphorylate JNK and to form a tight complex with activated JNK when the catalytically-inactive C124S VHR mutant was employed as an in vivo substrate trap. Utilizing an in vitro assay, the transcription factor c-Jun specifically inhibited the ability of VHR to dephosphorylate JNK, likely by sterically blocking access to the phosphorylation sites when JNK and c-Jun form a complex. c-Jun has no effect on the ability of VHR to inactivate the ERK MAP kinases or to hydrolyze artificial substrates. The c-Jun inhibition results are discussed in terms of the resistant-nature of JNK dephosphorylation in cellular extracts and in terms of a general model in which VHR may be a general MAP kinase phosphatase whose specificity and activity are dictated by the presence of MAP kinase-associated proteins that inhibit dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2048063297,"The present study highlights retinoids as modulators of c-Raf kinase activation by UV light. Whereas a number of retinoids, including retinol, 14-hydroxyretroretinol, anhydroretinol (AR), and retinoic acid bound the c-Raf cysteine-rich domain (CRD) with equal affinity in vitro as well as in vivo, they displayed different, even opposing, effects on UV-mediated kinase activation; retinol and 14-hydroxyretroretinol augmented responses, whereas retinoic acid and AR were inhibitory. Oxidation of thiol groups of cysteines by reactive oxygen, generated during UV irradiation, was the primary event in c-Raf activation, causing the release of zinc ions and, by inference, a change in CRD structure. Retinoids modulated these oxidation events directly: retinol enhanced, whereas AR suppressed, zinc release, precisely mirroring the retinoid effects on c-Raf kinase activation. Oxidation of c-Raf was not sufficient for kinase activation, productive interaction with Ras being mandatory. Further, canonical tyrosine phosphorylation and the action of phosphatase were essential for optimal c-Raf kinase competence. Thus, retinoids bound c-Raf with high affinity, priming the molecule for UV/reactive oxygen species-mediated changes of the CRD that set off GTP-Ras interaction and, in context with an appropriate phosphorylation pattern, lead to full phosphotransferase capacity.

Receptor protein tyrosine kinase, ligated by their respective growth factors, dimerize, become autophosphorylated, and recruit adapter molecules (Grb2) and the nucleotide exchange factor SOS to the cell membrane. The further assembly of GTP-bound Ras enables c-Raf to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where an as yet unidentified mechanism bestows competence on c-Raf to activate the MAPK cascade (16Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (e.g. Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 (17Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol.

For docking with Ras, two important contact sites in the regulatory domain of c-Raf have been identified, one centered on the stretch of amino acids 51–131, the other contained within the CRD (19Ghosh S.

Whether this involves changes in the phosphorylation pattern and consequent changes in the conformation of the regulatory domain is still unclear. The participation of lipid mediators in the activation of c-Raf has been suspected because of structural similarities with the PKC family of serine/threonine kinases (21Hurley J.H. Newton A.C.

Besides the classical RTPK signal chain, alternative activation signals exist. Ultraviolet light and ionizing irradiation as well as oxidizing agents lead to c-Raf/MAPK activation (13Radler-Pohl A.

To understand the biological significance, it is worth remembering that macrophages naturally produce substantial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in every cell type by mitochondria as well as by dedicated enzyme systems. The changing view is that ROS, like nitric oxide, serve as normal intracellular messengers (31Hildeman D.A. Mitchell T. Teague T.K. Henson P. Day B.J. Kappler J. Marrack P.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 32Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 33Los M. Droge W.

Acta. 1997; 1355: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also long known, the potent activating capacity of ultraviolet irradiation rests on the intracellular production of ROS (35Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Wlaschek M. Brenneisen P. Schauen M. Blaudschun R. Wenk J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1247-1257PubMed Google Scholar, 36Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Whereas the chemistry of oxidative activation of serine/threonine kinases is poorly understood, it stands to reason that ROS target the most susceptible groups in c-Raf, namely the thiols of cysteines, assuming a direct chemical modification and not activation of an upstream factor. Direct attack by ROS is all the more likely, since six cysteine residues are clustered within a stretch of 50 amino acids of the regulatory domain, all susceptible to oxidation. The questions of what changes the CRD may undergo during UV activation and how retinoids regulate such chemical changes are addressed in the present report. If the biology of vitamin A were a guide (37Buck J. Grun F. Derguini F. Chen Y. Kimura S. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 38Chen Y.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2521-2528PubMed Google Scholar), the expectation would be that hydroxylated retinoids (retinol and 14HRR) enhanced, whereas anhydroretinol attenuated, the UV effects. This prediction was borne out. As previously shown, vitamin A functions as regulatory co-factor for redox regulation of c-Raf and other serine/threonine kinases (41Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.X. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammmerling U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A single site capable of binding several natural vitamin A metabolites at nanomolar affinity was mapped to the CRD. Since bound retinoids influenced redox activation (42Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammmerling U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the importance of this domain as a primary target for oxidation was suggested. Further, two zinc coordination centers exist per CRD, each composed of three thiol groups of cysteines and one imino group of histidine. Chemistry predicts that oxidation of one or more thiols would compromise the integrity of the zinc finger. Precedents that zinc finger structures serve as redox sensors of enzymes exist in bacteria, and the related structures in PKC have recently been shown to shed their bound Zn2+ ions as a result of oxidation (43Knapp L.T. Klann E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24136-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 2I. Korichneva, unpublished data. We therefore asked whether Zn2+ ions would be liberated from the c-Raf CRD during UV irradiation and whether pro-oxidant retinoids would impact on zinc release. We further investigated whether UV-mediated oxidation of the CRD wasper se sufficient for kinase activation but found that, unlike PKC α and ζ isoforms (42Imam A. Hoyos B. Swenson C. Levi E. Chua R. Viriya E. Hammmerling U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Knapp L.T. Klann E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24136-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), c-Raf required the additional productive interaction with GTP-bound Ras, as well as modifications in the tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation patterns. Nevertheless, the CRD emerged as the key target structure for ROS elicited by stress-related mechanisms. Several findings in this report will highlight our conclusion: the triggering of c-Raf activity by ROS generated during UV irradiation in vitro; the binding of pro-oxidant retinoids to the CRD; the conversion of thiol groups to disulfide by UV exposure in vivo; the release of Zn2+ ions after UV irradiation; and the requirement for the CRD to communicate with Ras. Therefore, despite its appearance as a rigid structural element, the CRD should be more appropriately viewed as a dynamic, redox-sensitive hinge with profound regulatory importance for initiation of the c-Raf activation cycle by UV light. All-trans isomers of AR and 14HRR were synthesized as described previously (37Buck J. Grun F. Derguini F. Chen Y. Kimura S. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp.

Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.X. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The FLAG-c-Raf chimera was constructed by replacing the c-Raf CRD with the PKCα CRD. The following primers were used to isolate the PKCα CRD cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (template kindly provided by Dr. T. Powell, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York): 5′-CAT GTT CCC CTC ACA ACA CAC AAG TTC AAA ATC CAC and 5′-GAT GTT ACT CCA GTC CAC GCA GAG GCT GGG GAC ATT GAT. This product was used to synthesize the N and C termini of c-Raf chimeric gene using the following primers: 5′-GCG GCC GCG AAT TCA ATG GAG CAC ATA CAG and 5′-TGA AGA CAG GTG GGA TCC TTA CTA GAA GAC AGG CAG CCT, respectively. The two products were used to generate the full-length molecule by PCR, which was then cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the Sigma vector pFLAG-CMV2. Fidelity was confirmed by sequencing. COS-7 cells were transfected according to the calcium phosphate method (45Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes the day before transfection. 2 h prior to transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum). 12 μg of DNA/dish were mixed with CaCl2 and phosphate buffer to form a fine precipitate, which was then dispersed over the cells. The day after transfection, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with 3 ml each of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were cultured with 2 ml of retinoid-free, phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) for 2 ½ days prior to activation. UV irradiation was performed for 2 min at 400 milliwatts/cm2 using the 312-nm wavelength. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min after irradiation and harvested. Cells were lysed in 100 μl lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmvanadate). The lysates were precleared with 30 μl of a 50% (v/v) protein G-agarose slurry, and the FLAG-c-Raf protein was precipitated using 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with kinase buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm vanadate). The kinase reaction was performed in 20 μl of kinase buffer using 200 ng of kinase-disabled His-MEK (K97M) (provided by Dr. R. Kolesnick, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) as substrate, 60 mm ATP, and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to autoradiography, followed by Western analysis. Both Western blot and autoradiographs were evaluated by densitometry (Bio-Rad GS 700 densitometer with Quantity One software). Kinase activity values were normalized for the amount of FLAG-c-Raf precipitated. Data were analyzed by Student's ttest. COS cells transfected with FLAG-c-Raf CRD were UV-irradiated, treated with 1 or 10 mm H2O2, or left untreated and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and 150 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide in permeabilization buffer (lysis buffer containing 20 μg/ml digitonin instead of 1% Triton X-100) (47Bernier M. Nadiv O. Kole H.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8357-8364Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were added. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1% Triton X-100, and cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The FLAG-c-Raf CRD protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel as described above. The beads were resuspended in 25 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris, pH 8, and 0.5% SDS and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. Following reduction, 25 μl of 50 mm AMS, 100 mm Tris, pH 8, and 0.5% SDS were added, and thiol trapping was allowed for 30 min at 37 °C (48Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× nonreducing Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were applied to a 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel from Bio-Rad and analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). The c-Raf-CRD was expressed as GST fusion protein in the BL21/DE3 strain ofEscherichia coli (Novagen). The growth conditions were as follows. The bacteria were initially grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 and then transferred to room temperature. When the optical density reached 0.7–0.8, protein synthesis was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were harvested 2 h later. Bacteria were lysed by two passages through a French press, and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on the glutathione-agarose matrix (Sigma) according to a standard protocol. Purity by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE was usually >90% by this protocol. The fluorescence emission spectra of 250 nm GST-c-Raf CRD fusion protein, equimolar concentrations of protein-retinoid complexes, and quantitative fluorescence measurement of 250 nm protein with retinoid titration at 25 nm increments, from a 75 μmstock solution in methanol, were performed in PBS, purged of oxygen by sparging with helium for 15 min in a JASCO spectrofluorimeter (model FP777), as described in detail (41Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.X. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The protein solution was excited at 280 nm, and the emission spectra were monitored from 300 to 550 nm, or at 330 nm for the single wavelength measurements. All measurements were repeated 4–6 times. Binding constants were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting according to the theorem by Norris et al. (49Norris A.W. Cheng L. Giguere V. Rosenberger M. Li E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Complementary binding data were obtained by the method of enhancement of retinol fluorescence (41Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R.

COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-c-Raf cDNA and cultured in retinol-free medium as indicated above. Cells were preincubated with 100 nmretinol, 14HRR, AR, RA, or phosphatidylserine for 15 min prior to the addition of 5 nm [3H]retinol for 30 min and harvested after washing with PBS containing 0.5% bovine albumin. Extracts were prepared by repeated freeze thawing in 0.25 mTris, pH 8, supplemented with 25 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmvanadate. c-Raf immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.5% bovine albumin, and incorporated counts were measured by liquid scintillation counting. Results were expressed as differentials between immunoprecipitates of transfected and nontransfected cultures. A solution of 250 nm of GST-c-Raf CRD fusion protein in PBS was UV-irradiated at 312 nm for 2 min in the absence or presence of an equimolar concentration of retinol, AR, or retinol plus AR, followed by the addition of 3 μm TSQ. The changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum of TSQ (excitation λmax = 335 nm) were monitored from 390–600 nm. Two spectrofluorimetric methods, state of the art in the field (41Hoyos B. Imam A.

Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), were employed to measure binding of retinoids to the c-Raf CRD: quenching and enhancement. Quenching is based on the decrease in the intrinsic protein fluorescence due to resonance energy transfer to a suitable bound ligand. Fluorescence emanated from the natural Trp-186 residue. Preliminary evidence 3B. Hoyos, unpublished observation.suggested that retinol bound nearby at the second zinc chelation center formed by Cys residues 165, 168, and 184, in cooperation with His-139. Enhancement, or increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of the ligand/retinoids, is predicated on the movement of the ligated retinoids from the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic environment of the receptor/CRD protein. We have previously shown that retinol bound c-Raf and certain PKC CRDs with nanomolar affinity (41Hoyos B. Imam A. Chua R. Swenson C. Tong G.X. Levi E. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test for binding of other natural retinol metabolites, solutions of bacterially expressed GST-c-Raf-CRD fusion protein were excited at 280 nm, and the changes in protein fluorescence emission spectra were recorded, brought about by the additions of stoichiometric amounts of retinoids. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, the fluorescence intensity of c-Raf CRD decreased in the presence of 14HRR, AR, or RA, indicating binding. The signal was particularly prominent for 14HRR, followed by AR, and moderately decreased by RA. In distinction from retinol, no detectable fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal was generated by the last three retinoids, probably due to their poor fluorescence properties. Binding of the retinoids, retinol, 14HRR, and AR, to the c-Raf CRD was confirmed by the fluorescence enhancement method. Fig. 1 Bshows the idiosyncratic increases in the emission spectrum intensities that each retinoid produced when ligated to an equimolar amount of c-Raf CRD. The magnitude of the enhancement differed for each retinoid, reflecting the differences in their chromophore properties. RA, a poorly fluorescent retinoid, could not be evaluated by this method. To determine the binding constants, titrations of retinol, 14HRR, AR, and RA were performed (Fig. 2). c-Raf CRD (250 nm) was excited at 280 nm, and its fluorescence emission was monitored at 330 nm after the addition of each 25 nm increment of retinoid from a 75 μm stock solution in methanol. The binding curves, corrected for inner filtering, indicated that binding was saturable. When applied to a nonlinear curve fitting theorem developed by Norris et al.(49Norris A.W. Cheng L. Giguere V. Rosenberger M. Li E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the apparent dissociation constants in the nanomolar range were computed (Table I). Titration using GST as specificity control yielded a flat line (data not shown), no binding having taken place. Together, the results demonstrate high affinity binding of the retinoids to the CRD in vitro.Table IApparent dissociation constants ± S.E.

To demonstrate binding of other retinoids as well, a competition assay was developed, using COS-7 cell transfectants expressing the full-length FLAG-c-Raf protein. Cells were labeled with 5 nm [3H]retinol in the presence or absence of 1 × 10−7m retinol, 14HRR, AR, and RA as cold competitors, and bound radioactivity was measured in c-Raf immunoprecipitates using anti-FLAG antibody. All retinoids tested competed for binding of [3H]retinol to c-Raf, demonstrating specific binding (Fig. 3). Phosphatidylserine, a known ligand of the c-Raf CRD, competed only moderately with retinol, indicating minor overlap of binding sites (27Ghosh S. Xie W-Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C.

Thus, the in vivo and in vitro binding results established that the c-Raf CRD harbors a receptor site with equal specificity for four retinoids tested, extending our previous findings (41Hoyos B.

Indolmycin, a secondary metabolite ofStreptomyces griseus and a selective inhibitor of prokaryotic tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS), was used to explore the mechanism of inhibition and to explain the resistance of a naturally occurring strain. Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), an indolmycin-resistant strain, contains two trpS genes encoding distinct TrpRS enzymes. We show that TrpRS1 is indolmycin-resistant in vitro and in vivo, whereas TrpRS2 is sensitive. The lysine (position 9) in the enzyme tryptophan binding site is essential for making TrpRS1 indolmycin-resistant. Replacement of lysine 9 by glutamine, which at this position is conserved in most bacterial TrpRS proteins, abolished the ability of the mutant trpS gene to confer indolmycin resistance in vivo. Molecular modeling suggests that lysine 9 sterically hinders indolmycin binding to the enzyme. Tryptophan recognition (assessed byk cat/K M) by TrpRS1 is 4-fold lower than that of TrpRS2. Examination of the mRNA for the two enzymes revealed that only TrpRS2 mRNA is constitutively expressed, whereas mRNA for the indolmycin-resistant TrpRS1 enzyme is induced when the cells are exposed to indolmycin.

Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 689-710PubMed Google Scholar). For example, while sharing the class I synthetase signature sequences, HIGH and KMSKS, the human and Escherichia coli TrpRS proteins have only slight similarity. In contrast to bacterial TrpRS, the human enzyme is autophosphorylated (6Zargarova T.A. Aleksandrova N.M. Palei E.L. Favorova O.O. Biokhimiia. 1990; 55: 1328-1337PubMed Google Scholar) and has a 30–40 residue N-terminal extension (7Kisselev L.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which is widely seen in the TrpRSs of higher eukaryotes (5Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 689-710PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a natural fragment of human TrpRS acts as a regulator of angiogenesis (8Wakasugi K. Slike B.M. Hood J. Otani A. Ewalt K.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These divergences and their indispensable role for cell viability position the aaRSs as promising targets of species-specific inhibitors (9Schimmel P. Tao J. Hill J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In fact, some antibiotics inhibit aminoacyl-tRNA formation by binding to the active sites of the aaRSs as amino acid or aminoacyl-adenylate analogs. Best known is mupirocin, an antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens (10Fuller A.T. Mellows G. Woolford M. Banks G.T. Barrow K.D. Chain E.B. Nature. 1971; 234: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) that selectively inhibits the prokaryotic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (11Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is widely used as a topical antimicrobial agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains exhibiting mupirocin resistance are already known (12Rahman M. Connolly S. Noble W.C. Cookson B. Phillips I. J. Med. Microbiol. 1990; 33: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Watanabe H. Masaki H. Asoh N. Watanabe K. Oishi K. Furumoto A. Kobayashi S. Sato A. Nagatake T. J. Hosp. Infect. 2001; 47: 294-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mupirocin resistance is caused by a plasmid encoding a gene for an altered isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase that discriminates mupirocin in the active site (14Hodgson J.E. Curnock S.P. Dyke K.G. Morris R. Sylvester D.R. Gross M.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The antibiotic indolmycin ((5S)-5-[(1R)-1-indol-3-ylethyl]-2-(methylamino)-Δ2-oxazolin-4-one) is a second metabolite produced by Streptomyces griseus ATCC 12648 (formerly named Streptomyces albus BA3972A), which was isolated from a sample of African soil (15Rao K. Antibiot. Chemother. 1960; 10: 312-315Google Scholar, 16Marsh W.S. Garretson A.L. Wesel E.M. Antibiot. Chemother. 1960; 10: 316-320Google Scholar). To date, indolmycin has been reported to be produced by at least four strains ofStreptomyces species. A structural analog ofl-tryptophan (Fig. 1), indolmycin competitively inhibits bacterial TrpRS enzymes (17Werner R.G. Thorpe L.F. Reuter W. Nierhaus K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although it is effective on various microorganisms, from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria, it shows only weak inhibition of mammalian TrpRS (17Werner R.G. Thorpe L.F. Reuter W. Nierhaus K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, new compounds are being synthesized based on the structure of indolmycin (18Werner R.G. Demain A.L. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1981; 34: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Witty D.R. Walker G. Bateson J.H. O'Hanlon P.J. Cassels R. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 3067-3070Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with the hope of introducing a new class of antibacterial agents. A recent paper reported that clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori, which is known as a major causative agent of chronic active gastritis and is considered to be an important etiological factor of peptic ulcers in humans (21Sipponen P. Hyvarinen H. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1993; 196: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), are highly sensitive to indolmycin in vivo (22Kanamaru T. Nakano Y. Toyoda Y. Miyagawa K.I. Tada M. Kaisho T. Nakao M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2455-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible usefulness of indolmycin for H. pyloritreatment. Here we report the analysis of two TrpRS enzymes found in the indolmycin-resistant Streptomyces coelicolorA3(2) strain. One of the two enzymes is indolmycin-resistant, and its expression is induced when the S. coelicolor is exposed to indolmycin; the sensitive TrpRS is constitutively expressed. The possible significance of this finding on indolmycin production by this strain is discussed. [14C]Tryptophan (2.1 GBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Indolmycin was a kind gift from Pfizer, Inc. Oligonucleotides were purchased from AmershamBiosciences or from the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. S. coelicolor A3(2) genomic DNA was provided by Dr. J. Cullum (University of Kaiserslautern). The Bacillus stearothermophilus trpS gene was described earlier (23Praetorius-Ibba M. Stange-Thomann N. Kitabatake M. Ali K. Söll I. Carter C.W., Jr. Ibba M. Söll D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13136-13143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The E. coli strains used in this study included W3110 [F−, λ−, IN(rrnD-rrnE)1], DH5α [F−, φ80dlacZΔM15, Δ (lacZYA-argF)U169, deo R, recA1,endA1, hsdR17(rk− mk+),phoA, supE44, λ−,thi-1, gyrA96, relA1], 42C [argG, lac− , B1,relA +, trpS42] (24Isaksson L.A. Skold S.E. Skjoldebrand J. Takata R. Mol. Gen.

Many of the Streptomyces strains were from the collection of A. Demain; S. coelicolor A3(2) was from Dr. J. Piret (Northeastern University) and also from Dr. H. Kinashi (Hiroshima University), Streptomyces ambofaciens was from Dr. J. Piret, and S. griseus FD11901 was from Pfizer, Inc. The tryptophan auxotrophic strain S. coelicolor no. 2179 was from Dr. D. Hopwood (John Innes Centre). E. coli strain 42C was described elsewhere (25Sever S. Rogers K. Rogers M.J. Carter C., Jr. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To prepare seed cultures ofStreptomyces, YM medium (10 g of malt extract, 4 g of yeast extract, 4 g of glucose per liter, pH 7.3) (26Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2001Google Scholar) was used. The minimal medium for Streptomyces growth was NMMP (2 g of (NH4)2SO4, 5 g of Difco casamino acids, 0.6 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 50 g of polyethylene glycol 6000, 1 ml of minor elements solution, 15 mmNaH2PO4, K2HPO4buffer (pH 6.8), 0.5% glucose per liter) (see reference (26Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2001Google Scholar) for details). For the growth of E. coli, LB medium (10 g of tryptone peptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter, pH 7.0) (27Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) was used. The minimal medium for the indolmycin susceptibility assay of E. coli transformants was M9 medium (27Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 1 mg/liter thiamine, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 μm FeCl3, 100 μm CaCl2, and 20 mg/liter ofl-arginine. The susceptibility tests of Streptomyces were done by the filter diffusion method. Each Streptomyces strain was assayed with discs containing different concentrations of indolmycin in hopes of finding the minimal level of compound required to inhibit the strain. A 200-μl aliquot of bacteria was placed on each plate (100 × 15 mm). Subsequently, 15 ml of a specific agar medium were added to each plate in a swirling manner to distribute the bacteria homogeneously throughout the agar. After the agar solidified, 200 μl of the antibacterial compound were applied to a filter paper disc (0.25 in diameter), and four such discs were placed on each plate. The plates were then incubated at 4 °C for 24 h to allow the antibiotics to diffuse and placed in a 30 °C-incubator for 24–72 h. The zones of inhibition were identified as a clear, circular area around the disc where indolmycin inhibited bacterial growth. The genes for S. coelicolor A3(2) TrpRS1 (SCO3334 in the data base at the Sanger Centre) and TrpRS2 (SCO4839) were first amplified by PCR cycles (94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles). The PCR products were then digested by NdeI and BglII and were gel-purified by 0.7% agarose electrophoresis in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (27Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). These purified fragments were ligated into theNdeI-BglII sites of the pCBS1 vector (28Bunjun S. Stathopoulos C. Graham D. Min B. Kitabatake M. Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Vivares C.P. Weiss L.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12997-13002Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to allow constitutive expression. The pCBS1 derivative with TrpRS1 was designated as pCBS-SCW1, and that with TrpRS2 was named pCBS-SCW2. The transformants were obtained by electroporation, and those with the correct length inserts were sequenced. For protein overproduction, theNdeI-BglII fragments of pCBS-SCW1 and pCBS-SCW2 were recloned into the NdeI-BamHI-digested plasmids, pET-3a and pET-16b, respectively. The overproducing plasmids were designated as pET-SCW1 and pET-SCW2, respectively. The gene for the tRNATrp was constructed by the Khorana method (29Khorana H.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 709-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The T7 promoter sequence was placed in front of the first nucleotide of the tRNATrp, and a BstNI site was introduced at the CCA-3′ end of the tRNA gene. The ligated DNA was digested byBamHI and was cloned into the pHSG399 plasmid (30Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene. 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This plasmid was designated as pSCR. S. coelicolor TrpRS1 and TrpRS2 were produced in E. colistrain BL21(DE3). TrpRS1 was purified in its native form as described (23Praetorius-Ibba M. Stange-Thomann N. Kitabatake M. Ali K. Söll I. Carter C.W., Jr. Ibba M. Söll D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13136-13143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. A Western blot with an anti-E. coli TrpRS antibody stained proteins only in one of the two TrpRS activity peaks (210 mm KCl) of the first UNO-Q chromatography, indicating that those fractions contained TrpRS from the E. coli host strain. Thus, the active fractions around 300 mm KCl were pooled and used for further purification. Fractions that contained electrophoretically pure 37-kDa protein after the final chromatography were dialyzed against storage buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol (pH 7.0)) and kept at −20 °C. The fraction of active TrpRS protein was determined by active site titration (25Sever S. Rogers K. Rogers M.J. Carter C., Jr. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Attempts to purify native TrpRS2 showed that it had different chromatographic properties than TrpRS1. Therefore we introduced an affinity tag at the N terminus of the protein by cloning the gene into pET-SCW2, a pET-16b construct with a His10 tag sequence. Enzyme purification was achieved on a HiTrap column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) chelated by Ni2+and a HiTrap-benzamidine column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences). A transformant of BL21 (DE3) with pET-SCW2 was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/liter ampicillin at 30 °C to anA 600 of 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and the culture further incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. After harvesting, an extract was prepared in the Ni2+column binding buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and applied to the HiTrap-chelating column, washed, and eluted with a gradient of 10–500 mm imidazole. Factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) was then added to the eluted protein in digestion buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl (pH 8.0)) and incubated at 25 °C for 20 h. The digest was applied to the HiTrap-chelating column to remove the cleaved tag and the non-cleaved protein. Finally, the flow-through was applied to the HiTrap-benzamidine column to remove the Factor Xa from the solution. A single 37-kDa band was seen when this fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The plasmid pSCR was prepared by ultracentrifugation with a CsCl density gradient. The purified plasmid was digested with BstNI to serve as a DNA template for transcription of the tRNATrp. Transcription, purification, and refolding of tRNA was performed as described (31Curnow A.W. Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation assays were carried out as described (23Praetorius-Ibba M. Stange-Thomann N. Kitabatake M. Ali K. Söll I. Carter C.W., Jr. Ibba M. Söll D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13136-13143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that 4 μm transcript tRNATrp was used instead of 2 μm. All assays were performed at 30 °C, the optimal growth temperature of Streptomyces. The kinetic parameters were determined using concentrations of tryptophan that covered the range of 0.2–5 times theK M values. For the K i values, the amounts of indolmycin that partially inhibit TrpRSs were first determined, and the apparent K M values for tryptophan were measured in the presence of the determined amount of indolmycin. The K i values were then calculated by the real and apparent K M values. Point mutations of the S. coelicolor and B. stearothermophilus TrpRS genes were introduced by the overlap extension method (32Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The sequences were confirmed before the following experiments. The pCBS1 derivative with a mutant S. coelicolor TrpRS1(K9Q) was designated pCBS1-SCW1-K9Q, and that with mutant B. stearothermophilusTrpRS(Q9K) was designated as pCBS1-BSW-Q9K. To assess the in vivo activity of the various trpS genes, pCBS-SCW1, pCBS-SCW2, pCBS-SCW1-K9Q, and pCBS-BSW-Q9K were separately transformed into the E. coli trpS mutant strain 42C (24Isaksson L.A. Skold S.E. Skjoldebrand J. Takata R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This strain is tryptophan auxotroph because of its mutant TrpRS with the highK M for tryptophan (25Sever S. Rogers K. Rogers M.J. Carter C., Jr. Söll D.

The transformants were selected on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C and were grown in LB medium with the same concentration of ampicillin at 30 °C. Aliquots (3 μl) of the overnight cultures were then spotted onto two M9 glucose plates supplemented by l-arginine (25Sever S. Rogers K. Rogers M.J. Carter C., Jr. Söll D.

For the susceptibility tests, these plasmids were transformed into the W3110 strain. E. coli strain 42C was not used as it is indolmycin-resistant. 2M. Kitabatake and K. Ali, unpublished results.Overnight cultures of the transformants were prepared in LB ampicillin medium at 37 °C, and 3 μl of aliquots were spotted on an M9 glucose plate containing 0.1 mm indolmycin. The plate was incubated at 30 °C. RT-PCR was carried out using the Access RT-PCR Introductory System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs used in this study were prepared by the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) with slight modifications, following the notes provided by the manufacturer. The primers for TrpRS1 were: MK54 (5′-CAGGAGGTGGACATATGACACGGGTTTTCAG-3′) and MK134 (5′-CACGTACCCGGGATCGGCGGACAGC-3′); for TrpRS2 MK133 (5′-GCGTCTCCGGGTCGTCCAGGTACTG-3′) and MK135 (5-CGCGACCTCGCGGACCGCTTCAACCAG-3′). We assumed S. griseus to be indolmycin-resistant as it produces this compound. To confirm this assumption, we examined the in vivo indolmycin sensitivity of several Streptomyces strains. Of the ten testedStreptomyces strains, we found that five strains, S. griseus 7–455F3, S. griseus FE11901,Streptomyces cattleya, S. coelicolor, andStreptomyces lavendulae, showed resistance at 500 μg/ml indolmycin (see “Materials and Methods”). At the same concentration, the other five strains, Streptomyces lividans, Streptomyces clavuligeres, Streptomyces glaucescens, Streptomyces hygroscopicus, andS. ambofaciens, were indolmycin-sensitive. However, this indolmycin concentration, is higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration values of previously reported indolmycin-sensitive bacteria, for example: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31–250 μg/ml, Ref. 33Preobrazhenskaya M.N. Balashova E.G. Turchin K.F. Padeiskaya E.N. Uvarova N.V. Pershin G.N. Suvorov N.N.

O'Hanlon P.J. Cassels R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 1375-1380Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Streptomyces strains are generally resistant to indolmycin. To shed light on the mechanism of the resistance of theStreptomyces strains, we chose S. coelicolorA3(2) for further analysis, as its genome was being sequenced (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Scoelicolor/). Because indolmycin is a prokaryotic TrpRS inhibitor, and given that S. coelicolor is indolmycin-resistant, we decided to biochemically examine S. coelicolor TrpRS and the effect of the inhibitor. BLAST searches revealed two trpSorthologs in the S. coelicolor A3(2) genome. The start codons of each open reading frame were predicted by the examination of a multiple sequence alignment of bacterial TrpRSs (Fig.2) and an analysis of the third letter of each codon. Based on the two open reading frames, the TrpRS enzymes are quite similar with 47% amino acid identity. After PCR amplification and cloning into the pET expression vectors and heterologous expression in E. coli, the proteins were extensively purified. TrpRS2 was well expressed (giving >20 mg of the pure protein/liter of culture), whereas TrpRS1 was not (only 0.1 mg of pure protein/liter of culture); this may be due to the presence in the trpS1 gene encoding TrpRS1 of 16 CGG codons, which are relatively minor inE. coli. TheS. coelicolor genome sequence indicated only one tRNATrp gene in the organism. Therefore the aminoacylation properties of both TrpRS enzymes were determined with the in vitro transcript of the S. coelicolortRNATrp. Both enzymes were equally active (Table I). TheK M values for tryptophan of TrpRS1 and TrpRS2 were 11.7 μm and 3.7 μm, respectively. The former value is comparable with that of the indolmycin-sensitiveE. coli TrpRS (12.4 μm) (25Sever S. Rogers K. Rogers M.J. Carter C., Jr. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but thek cat of S. coelicolor TrpRS1 (0.78 s−1) is less than one-half that of the E. colienzyme (2.0 s−1) (25Sever S. Rogers K. Rogers M.J. Carter C., Jr. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As for TrpRS2, although the rate constant (0.90 s−1) was only slightly better than that of TrpRS1, the K M value for tryptophan (3.7 μm) was three times lower than that of TrpRS1. These results indicate that TrpRS2 catalyzes tryptophanyl-tRNA formation more efficiently than TrpRS1 in vitro.Table IThe kinetic parameters of the TrpRS1 and TrpRS2 from S. coelicolor A3(2) E. coliTrpRS B. stearothermophilus TrpRS S. coelicolor TrpRS1 S. coelicolor TrpRS2 K M (μmTrp)12.4 ± 1.21-aData from Sever et al.

Open table in a new tab However, the enzymes showed a profound difference in the presence of indolmycin. Preliminary experiments suggested that indolmycin concentrations of 1 μm (TrpRS1) and 10 nm(TrpRS2) partially inhibit Trp-tRNA formation (at 1 μmtryptophan). We then measured the apparent K M andk cat values of the two enzymes in the presence of those amounts of indolmycin. Although thek cat values were not greatly affected by the addition of indolmycin, the K M values were elevated several times from the real K M value of each enzyme. The results indicate that the activities of TrpRS1 and TrpRS2 are both competitively inhibited by indolmycin, but the susceptibilities of the two enzymes are different from each other. The inhibition constant (K i) values of the two enzymes were then determined from the real K M and the apparentK M values. The K i of TrpRS1 (900 nm) was greater than that of TrpRS2 (6 nm) by about 150-fold, suggesting that TrpRS1 is indolmycin-resistant by reducing the affinity of its tryptophan binding site to indolmycin. TheK i value of TrpRS2 (6 nm) is comparable with those of the indolmycin-sensitive TrpRSs, i.e. E. coli TrpRS (24 nm) (34Bryant R. Overproduction of tryptophanyl transfer RNA synthetase caused by a genetic duplication in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Yale University, 1982Google Scholar) and B. stearothermophilus TrpRS (9 nm)2 showing that the S. coelicolor TrpRS2 is indolmycin-sensitive, like other bacterial TrpRSs. The K i value of TrpRS1 (900 nm), however, is as high as a mutant B. stearothermophilus TrpRS (800 nm, data not shown) that lacks a hydrogen bond between the active site His-43 and indolmycin. 3M. Kitabatake, unpublished results. Therefore, we concluded that TrpRS1 is indolmycin-resistant and that TrpRS2 is indolmycin-sensitive. Because the biochemical analysis revealed that the resistance of TrpRS1 is probably caused by reduced affinity of indolmycin to the tryptophan binding site, we thought it likely that this had resulted from changes of one or a few amino acids. To examine this possibility and to identify the potential key substitution(s), we analyzed a multiple sequence alignment of bacterial TrpRS proteins (Fig. 2). Both S. coelicolor enzymes aligned well with the other TrpRSs and shared the characteristic HIGH and KMSKS motifs (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 2Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3Arnez J.G. Moras D.

We looked for specific amino acids inS. coelicolor TrpRS1 that differed from the otherwise conserved positions. The location of these residues was then examined in the crystal structure of the wild type B. stearothermophilus TrpRS (35Doublie S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter C.W., Jr. Structure. 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) so that only those residues in close proximity to the tryptophan binding site were considered. Of several candidates examined, we felt that Lys-9 may be the most important residue. In the crystal structure of B. stearothermophilusTrpRS complexed with indolmycin and ATP, 4W. Yin and C. Carter, Jr., unpublished results. Gln-9 is in the tryptophan binding pocket, and the Oε atom of the glutamine is only 3.2 Å away from the methylamino group of indolmycin (Fig. 1). To examine the effect of Lys-9 in S. coelicolor TrpRS1 on indolmycin binding, we modeled a mutant TrpRS structure replacing Gln-9 with Lys-9 based on the crystal structure of B. stearothermophilus TrpRS-indolmycin complex. When Cα and Cβ of Lys-9 were superimposed on those of Gln-9 and the long side chain of lysine remained in free form, the Cε atom of Lys-9 was too close to the imido nitrogen of indolmycin. If the side chain of Lys-9 is stretched, then the minimum distance between Lys-9 and indolmycin would be only 1.8 Å, which is too close for proper interaction. In addition, the ε-amino group of Lys-9 in the model is only 2.7 Å away from the nitrogen atom of the methylamino group of indolmycin. This may lead to electrostatic repulsion, because the imino nitrogen is presumably positively charged at neutral pH. These observations support the idea that the unique Lys-9 residue of TrpRS1 would prevent indolmycin association with the tryptophan binding pocket. To test this idea in vivo, we constructed two mutants of TrpRS. The first one is the S. coelicolor TrpRS1 K9Q mutant, and the second is the B. stearothermophilus TrpRS Q9K mutant. The wild type and mutant S. coelicolor and B. stearothermophilus trpS genes were cloned into the pCBS1 plasmid under the control of the E. coli TrpSpromoter, which has been shown to be suitable for constitutive expression of various aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes (36Ibba M. Losey H.C. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Bunjun S. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were transformed into the tryptophan auxotrophicE. coli strain 42C to test for complementation of itstrpS gene or into E. coli strain W3110 for the indolmycin resistance test. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the auxotrophy of the 42C strain was complemented by all of the TrpRS genes tested. Although the strain with the empty plasmid pBR322 did not grow well, all strains with the TrpRS clones could grow on the same minimal plate. Thus, all the cloned trpS genes gave rise to active enzymes in vivo. It is noteworthy that TrpRS1 functions better than TrpRS2 in E. coli, indicating the lower species specificity of TrpRS1 as compared with that of TrpRS2 (Fig.3 A). Indolmycin resistance was checked with the W3110 transformants at 30 °C for 40 h. They all grew normally in the absence of indolmycin (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, only the strain that expressed the wild type S. coelicolor TrpRS1 grew well in the presence of 0.1 mm indolmycin (Fig. 3 B). This strongly suggests that TrpRS1 is sufficient for the indolmycin resistance of S. coelicolor. The S. coelicolorTrpRS1 K9Q mutant, which complemented the E. coli mutant strain 42C as efficiently as the S. coelicolor wild type TrpRS1 at 30 °C (Fig. 3 A), did not confer any indolmycin resistance on the W3110 host strain (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that Lys-9 in the S. coelicolor TrpRS1 gene is essential for indolmycin resistance of the E. colitransformant. Thus, the results of the in vivo experiment support the suggestion from structure modeling on the role of Lys-9. However, the B. stearothermophilus TrpRS Q9K mutant did not show clear resistance in vivo; only a faint trace of growth was observed on the selection plate (Fig. 3B). This suggests that Lys-9 is necessary for indolmycin resistance in TrpRS1 but not sufficient for general indolmycin resistance in vivo. The kinetic analyses described above revealed the functional complementarity of the two S. coelicolor TrpRS enzymes. These observations suggested that TrpRS2 should play the major role in Trp-tRNA synthesis in the absence of indolmycin in the growth medium and that TrpRS1 would assume this role when the presence of indolmycin inhibits TrpRS2. To investigate this postulate, we analyzed the expression of the two TrpRS mRNAs in S. coelicolor. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the mRNA of TrpRS1 was observed only when the strain was grown in a minimal medium supplemented with 0.1 mm of indolmycin (lane 7), which is the non-permissible concentration forE. coli but not for S. coelicolor. The addition of 0.01 mm of indolmycin (lane 5) or tryptophan starvation in the cell (lane 3) did not induce the transcription of the TrpRS1 gene. The emergence of the 901-bp band, corresponding to the TrpRS1 mRNA, was dependent on the addition of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (compare lane 7 and lane 8), indicating that this band is not a product of genomic DNA contamination. No TrpRS1 mRNA was detected in a fresh culture of cells grown in rich medium (Fig. 4 A). In contrast the mRNA for TrpRS2, which may be the organism's housekeeping TrpRS because of its more efficient biochemical properties, was indeed observed (in the presence of reverse transcriptase) under all conditions examined (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). These results suggest that TrpRS2 is the major enzyme that is constitutively expressed and catalyzes Trp-tRNA formation in S. coelicolor, whereas the indolmycin-resistant TrpRS1 is induced only when the cells are exposed to indolmycin. As a consequence,S. coelicolor can grow in a medium with 0.1 mm indolmycin as the induced TrpRS1 would take over Trp-tRNA formation. The molecular mechanism of TrpRS1 mRNA induction by indolmycin addition was not investigated in this work. When MFOLD (37Walter A.E. Turner D.H. Kim J. Lyttle M.H. Muller P. Mathews D.H. Zuker M.

For example, the well studied IκBα protein actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and both inhibits nuclear import and mediates nuclear export of NF-κB/Rel proteins. In contrast, the IκBβ protein can inhibit nuclear import of NF-κB/Rel proteins but does not remove NF-κB/Rel proteins from the nucleus. To further understand how the IκB proteins control the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of NF-κB/Rel proteins, we have characterized the nuclear import and nuclear export functions of IκBε. Our results indicate that the IκBε protein, like the IκBα protein, actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Similar to IκBα, nuclear import of IκBε is mediated by its ankyrin repeat domain and is not blocked by the dominant-negative RanQ69L protein. However, the nuclear import function of the IκBε ankyrin repeat domain is markedly less efficient than that of IκBα, with the result that nuclear shuttling of IκBε between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is significantly slower than IκBα. Nuclear export of IκBε is mediated by a short leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES)-like sequence (343VLLPFDDLKI352), located between amino acids 343 and 352. This NES-like sequence is required for RanGTP-dependent binding of IκBε to CRM1. Nuclear accumulation of IκBε is increased by either leptomycin B treatment or alanine substitutions within the IκBε-derived NES. A functional NES is required for both efficient cytoplasmic retention and post-induction control of c-Rel by IκBε, consistent with the notion that IκBε-mediated nuclear export contributes to control over the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of NF-κB/Rel proteins.

Mammalian cells have five NF-κB/Rel proteins, termed p50, p52, RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB. The NF-κB/Rel proteins are defined by the presence of a N-terminal, highly conserved region of 300 amino acids known as the Rel homology domain. The Rel homology domain is responsible for dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding by NF-κB/Rel proteins. Nuclear localization and DNA binding of NF-κB/Rel proteins are regulated in large part through association with members of the inhibitory of κB (IκB) family. In mammalian cells, the major regulatory IκB proteins are IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, which share a common domain structure. The N termini of these IκB proteins constitutes a signal response domain, which is targeted for phosphorylation and ubiquitination by a variety of extracellular stimuli (6Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L.

Taken together, these data suggest that IκBα and IκBβ have distinct and non-overlapping nuclear functions.The third major IκB protein, IκBε, is generally regarded as a cytoplasmic protein. However, the possibility that IκBε can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus has not been examined. We now report that the IκBε protein is able to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear import of IκBε is mediated by its ankyrin repeat domain, although the IκBε-derived ankyrin repeat domain is less efficient at promoting nuclear localization of a heterologous reporter protein than the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBα. Similar to IκBα, nuclear import of IκBε is not blocked by a dominant-negative Ran protein that otherwise disrupts classical NLS-dependent nuclear import. The IκBε protein interacts with CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner and contains a canonical “leucine-rich” NES-like motif (amino acids 343–352) that is required for Ran-GTP-dependent binding to CRM1. Mutation of this NES-like motif in IκBε results in increased nuclear localization of IκBε. Importantly, the C-terminal NES-like motif of IκBε is required for both efficient cytoplasmic retention and post-induction repression of c-Rel by IκBε. Taken together, our data indicate that IκBε is not restricted to the cytoplasm as previously suggested but actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, our results suggest that one of the functions of IκBε in the nucleus is to direct the export of NF-κB/Rel proteins back to the cytoplasm.DISCUSSIONThe IκBε protein, first identified in a two-hybrid screen using the RelA subunit of NF-κB as bait, is emerging as an important regulator of NF-κB/Rel proteins (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Li Z. Nable G, J. Mol. Cell.

Most notably, loss of IκBε results in specific defects in T-cell development, Ig isotype switching, and cytokine gene expression (37Memet S. Laouini D. Epinat J.C. Whiteside S.T. Goudeau B. Philpott D. Kayal S. Sansonetti P.J. Berche P. Kanellopoulos J. Israel A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5994-6005PubMed Google Scholar). IκBε has been suggested to act exclusively in the cytoplasm to inhibit nuclear localization of NF-κB/Rel proteins (36Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of IκBε has not been examined in detail. In this report, we provide evidence that IκBε contains nuclear import and export functions that enable shuttling of IκBε between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, IκBε is able to mediate CRM1-dependent nuclear export of NF-κB/Rel proteins.Our results provide several lines of evidence for a nuclear import function in IκBε. First, although IκBε displays a predominant cytoplasmic pattern of localization, disruption of nuclear export with the CRM1-specific inhibitor, leptomycin B, results in a significant relocalization of IκBε to the nucleus. Second, fusion of the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBε is able to target a heterologous protein to the nucleus. Finally, IκBε is able to accumulate in the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells in standard in vitro nuclear import assays. Taken together, our results indicate that the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBε, like the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBα, is a functional nuclear import domain. It is likely that IκBε and IκBα utilize a similar mechanism for transit through the nuclear pore complex, as nuclear import of IκBε, like that of IκBα, is not disrupted by the dominant-negative RanQ69L-GTP protein (26Sachdev S. Bagchi S. Zhang D.D. Mings A.C. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Despite the overall similarities in nuclear import between IκBα and IκBε, one important difference is the relative effectiveness of the ankyrin repeat domains of IκBα and IκBε at promoting nuclear import. Fusion of the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBα to the core domain of nucleoplasmin results in a marked relocalization of nucleoplasmin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The ankyrin repeat domain of IκBε is also effective at relocalization of the nucleoplasmin core from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, although it is less efficient than the ARD of IκBα. In contrast, the ARD of IκBβ is ineffective at relocalization of nucleoplasmin core to the nucleus. This finding suggests that although the ankyrin repeat domains of IκB proteins share overall structural similarities, the ankyrin repeat domains of each IκB proteins are markedly different in their abilities of mediating nuclear import.The relative weakness of the IκBε ankyrin repeat as a functional nuclear import signal is also reflected in the behavior of the full-length IκBε protein in leptomycin B-treated cells. In the case of IκBα, 30 min of leptomycin B treatment is sufficient to relocalize the bulk of IκBα to the nucleus (21Johnson D. Antwerp D.V. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), whereas only a partial relocalization of IκBε is achieved even after several hours of leptomycin B. Several other reports also demonstrate that nuclear localization of IκBε is markedly diminished relative to IκBα, leading to the prevailing suggestion that IκBε functions only in the cytoplasm (20Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 36Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our results agree with the notion that nuclear import of IκBε is less efficient than IκBα. Nevertheless, the ability of IκBε to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus suggests that IκBε may function in both compartments to regulate NF-κB/Rel proteins.One potential nuclear function of IκBε might be to mediate nuclear export of NF-κB/Rel proteins. In agreement with the results of Tam and Sen (38Tam W.F. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7701-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we find that inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export only marginally alters the steady-state cytoplasmic localization of the c-Rel/IκBε complex. However, we find that CRM1-dependent nuclear export is required for efficient IκBε-mediated cytoplasmic retention of c-Rel after TNF-α/cycloheximide-induced degradation of IκBε. We have identified a canonical NES in IκBε that is required for RanGTP-dependent binding of IκBε to CRM1. Furthermore, IκBα and IκBε proteins have comparable affinities to CRM1. In contrast, IκBβ does not have measurable affinity to CRM1. The NES of IκBε is also required for cytoplasmic localization of both IκBε and for IκBε-dependent cytoplasmic retention of c-Rel. These results suggest that removal of NF-κB/Rel proteins from the nucleus is an important nuclear function of IκBε.Post-induction repression of activated gene expression provides an effective mechanism for temporal regulation of gene expression. In the NF-κB/Rel system, it is clear that a major function of the IκBα protein is to participate in an autoregulatory circuit that attenuates NF-κB-dependent transcription. Thus, for example, the IκBα gene is rapidly induced by NF-κB/Rel proteins, and IκBα is able to efficiently enter the nucleus, displace NF-κB/Rel proteins from DNA, and mediate their removal from the nucleus (18–29). Our present results together with the previous demonstration that expression of the IκBε gene is induced by NF-κB/Rel proteins (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) support the notion that IκBε also participates in post-induction repression of NF-κB/Rel proteins. However, as suggested by Whitesideet al. (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), it is likely that that IκBα and IκBε have distinct roles in the post-induction repression of NF-κB/Rel proteins. IκBε expression is induced with markedly slower kinetics than IκBα, and nuclear import of IκBε is less efficient than IκBα (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Li Z. Nable G, J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). IκBα and IκBε both share the ability to inhibit DNA binding of NF-κB/Rel proteins and to direct their removal from the nucleus, although these IκB proteins have distinct specificities for different NF-κB/Rel proteins (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A plausible scenario is that IκBα controls expression of NF-κB-dependent genes that must be activated and subsequently repressed in a relatively short time frame, whereas IκBε is specialized for control over NF-κB-dependent genes that are activated and subsequently repressed over a longer time period. The NF-κB/Rel transcription factor family has provided a powerful experimental paradigm for understanding how eukaryotic gene expression is regulated (reviewed in Refs. 1Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar, 3Gilmore T.D.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells have five NF-κB/Rel proteins, termed p50, p52, RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB. The NF-κB/Rel proteins are defined by the presence of a N-terminal, highly conserved region of 300 amino acids known as the Rel homology domain. The Rel homology domain is responsible for dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding by NF-κB/Rel proteins. Nuclear localization and DNA binding of NF-κB/Rel proteins are regulated in large part through association with members of the inhibitory of κB (IκB) family. In mammalian cells, the major regulatory IκB proteins are IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, which share a common domain structure. The N termini of these IκB proteins constitutes a signal response domain, which is targeted for phosphorylation and ubiquitination by a variety of extracellular stimuli (6Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L.

The central portion of IκB proteins contains an ankyrin repeat domain comprised of six ankyrin repeats that functions as a protein-protein interaction domain (9Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M.

The C-terminal regions of IκB proteins are generally acidic, are important for inhibition of DNA binding by NF-κB/Rel proteins, and may regulate the basal degradation rate of IκB proteins (14Whiteside S.T.

DISCUSSIONThe IκBε protein, first identified in a two-hybrid screen using the RelA subunit of NF-κB as bait, is emerging as an important regulator of NF-κB/Rel proteins (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Li Z. Nable G, J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most notably, loss of IκBε results in specific defects in T-cell development, Ig isotype switching, and cytokine gene expression (37Memet S. Laouini D. Epinat J.C. Whiteside S.T. Goudeau B. Philpott D. Kayal S. Sansonetti P.J. Berche P. Kanellopoulos J. Israel A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5994-6005PubMed Google Scholar). IκBε has been suggested to act exclusively in the cytoplasm to inhibit nuclear localization of NF-κB/Rel proteins (36Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of IκBε has not been examined in detail. In this report, we provide evidence that IκBε contains nuclear import and export functions that enable shuttling of IκBε between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, IκBε is able to mediate CRM1-dependent nuclear export of NF-κB/Rel proteins.Our results provide several lines of evidence for a nuclear import function in IκBε. First, although IκBε displays a predominant cytoplasmic pattern of localization, disruption of nuclear export with the CRM1-specific inhibitor, leptomycin B, results in a significant relocalization of IκBε to the nucleus. Second, fusion of the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBε is able to target a heterologous protein to the nucleus. Finally, IκBε is able to accumulate in the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells in standard in vitro nuclear import assays. Taken together, our results indicate that the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBε, like the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBα, is a functional nuclear import domain. It is likely that IκBε and IκBα utilize a similar mechanism for transit through the nuclear pore complex, as nuclear import of IκBε, like that of IκBα, is not disrupted by the dominant-negative RanQ69L-GTP protein (26Sachdev S. Bagchi S. Zhang D.D. Mings A.C. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Despite the overall similarities in nuclear import between IκBα and IκBε, one important difference is the relative effectiveness of the ankyrin repeat domains of IκBα and IκBε at promoting nuclear import. Fusion of the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBα to the core domain of nucleoplasmin results in a marked relocalization of nucleoplasmin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The ankyrin repeat domain of IκBε is also effective at relocalization of the nucleoplasmin core from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, although it is less efficient than the ARD of IκBα. In contrast, the ARD of IκBβ is ineffective at relocalization of nucleoplasmin core to the nucleus. This finding suggests that although the ankyrin repeat domains of IκB proteins share overall structural similarities, the ankyrin repeat domains of each IκB proteins are markedly different in their abilities of mediating nuclear import.The relative weakness of the IκBε ankyrin repeat as a functional nuclear import signal is also reflected in the behavior of the full-length IκBε protein in leptomycin B-treated cells. In the case of IκBα, 30 min of leptomycin B treatment is sufficient to relocalize the bulk of IκBα to the nucleus (21Johnson D. Antwerp D.V. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), whereas only a partial relocalization of IκBε is achieved even after several hours of leptomycin B. Several other reports also demonstrate that nuclear localization of IκBε is markedly diminished relative to IκBα, leading to the prevailing suggestion that IκBε functions only in the cytoplasm (20Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 36Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our results agree with the notion that nuclear import of IκBε is less efficient than IκBα. Nevertheless, the ability of IκBε to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus suggests that IκBε may function in both compartments to regulate NF-κB/Rel proteins.One potential nuclear function of IκBε might be to mediate nuclear export of NF-κB/Rel proteins. In agreement with the results of Tam and Sen (38Tam W.F. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7701-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we find that inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export only marginally alters the steady-state cytoplasmic localization of the c-Rel/IκBε complex. However, we find that CRM1-dependent nuclear export is required for efficient IκBε-mediated cytoplasmic retention of c-Rel after TNF-α/cycloheximide-induced degradation of IκBε. We have identified a canonical NES in IκBε that is required for RanGTP-dependent binding of IκBε to CRM1. Furthermore, IκBα and IκBε proteins have comparable affinities to CRM1. In contrast, IκBβ does not have measurable affinity to CRM1. The NES of IκBε is also required for cytoplasmic localization of both IκBε and for IκBε-dependent cytoplasmic retention of c-Rel. These results suggest that removal of NF-κB/Rel proteins from the nucleus is an important nuclear function of IκBε.Post-induction repression of activated gene expression provides an effective mechanism for temporal regulation of gene expression. In the NF-κB/Rel system, it is clear that a major function of the IκBα protein is to participate in an autoregulatory circuit that attenuates NF-κB-dependent transcription. Thus, for example, the IκBα gene is rapidly induced by NF-κB/Rel proteins, and IκBα is able to efficiently enter the nucleus, displace NF-κB/Rel proteins from DNA, and mediate their removal from the nucleus (18–29). Our present results together with the previous demonstration that expression of the IκBε gene is induced by NF-κB/Rel proteins (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) support the notion that IκBε also participates in post-induction repression of NF-κB/Rel proteins. However, as suggested by Whitesideet al. (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), it is likely that that IκBα and IκBε have distinct roles in the post-induction repression of NF-κB/Rel proteins. IκBε expression is induced with markedly slower kinetics than IκBα, and nuclear import of IκBε is less efficient than IκBα (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Li Z. Nable G, J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). IκBα and IκBε both share the ability to inhibit DNA binding of NF-κB/Rel proteins and to direct their removal from the nucleus, although these IκB proteins have distinct specificities for different NF-κB/Rel proteins (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A plausible scenario is that IκBα controls expression of NF-κB-dependent genes that must be activated and subsequently repressed in a relatively short time frame, whereas IκBε is specialized for control over NF-κB-dependent genes that are activated and subsequently repressed over a longer time period. The IκBε protein, first identified in a two-hybrid screen using the RelA subunit of NF-κB as bait, is emerging as an important regulator of NF-κB/Rel proteins (11Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R.

https://openalex.org/W2332897912,"The RelA transcription factor is part of dimeric complexes, most commonly either p50-RelA (NF-κB) heterodimers or RelA homodimers, that control a variety of cellular processes. Immortalized embryonic fibroblasts established from rela knockout mice have previously been shown to be more sensitive to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) than are control fibroblasts. In this report, we show that one line of rela−/− fibroblasts has additional phenotypes that distinguish them from control mouse fibroblasts. As compared to normal 3T3 cells, RelA-deficient fibroblasts have a spindled morphology, are less adherent to culture dishes, grow to a higher saturation density, and can form colonies in soft agar. These properties are consistent with a weakly transformed phenotype for rela−/− cells. Furthermore, RelA-deficient fibroblasts can form tumors in immunodeficient mice, but these tumors regress, probably because of the sensitivity of these cells to TNF. The ability of rela−/− fibroblasts to form colonies in soft agar can be reverted by re-expression of wild-type mouse RelA, but not by expression of RelA mutants that cannot form homodimers. There is no clear correlation between the absence of RelA and the levels of expression of other Rel/NF-κB family members or adhesion proteins (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) whose genes have upstream κB sites. Taken together, these results suggest that RelA has tumor suppressing activity under some circumstances and that RelA complexes are involved in the control of a variety of cellular properties associated with oncogenesis."

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) was identified as a hypoxia-activated transcription factor; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie hypoxia signal transduction in mammalian cells remain undefined. In this study, we found that a flavoprotein, NADPH-P450 reductase (NPR), could regulate the induction of EPO mRNA under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic EPO mRNA induction in Hep3B cells was inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium chloride, which is an inhibitor of NADPH-dependent enzymes. NPR antisense cDNA was transfected into Hep3B cells, and NPR-deficient hepatocyte cells (NPR− cells) were established. NPR− cells lacked EPO induction under hypoxia, and HIF-1α in NPR− cells did not respond to either transcriptional activation or translocation to the nucleus based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter gene assay including hypoxia response element. In contrast, NPR overexpression in Hep3B cells enhanced the DNA binding activity of HIF-1α by luciferase reporter gene assay. A study with HeLa S3 cells produced the same results.

Hypoxia stimulates a group of physiologically important genes such as erythropoietin (EPO)1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Transcriptional activation of the EPO gene is controlled via an enhancer element located in the 3′-flanking region of the gene, hypoxia response element (HRE), and requires binding of a specific transcription factor termed hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) (1Semenza G.L.

Identification and cloning of HIF-1 revealed a heterodimeric protein consisting of two subunits: HIF-1α and HIF-1β (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Targeting for the protein degradation is determined by binding to the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) to form a ubiquitin-ligating complex (5Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C.

In hypoxia, degradation of HIF-1α is blocked, and then HIF-1α is transferred into the nucleus to bind to HRE. The mechanisms of sensing low oxygen and transduction of this signal to HIF-1 are not well understood. Recently, researchers have hypothesized that the mechanisms involve the generation of reactive oxygen species by NADPH-oxidase.

Although the presence of cytochrome b 558 was previously believed to be restricted to these cell types, its presence has also been demonstrated in other cells, such as rat carotid body cells (10Cross A.R.

In support of this model, exogenous H2O2 and diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPIC), an inhibitor of NADPH-dependent enzymes, are found to inhibit hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α (13Gleadle J.M.

They found that the K+ channel of the knockout mouse was opened by hypoxia, although DPIC inhibited it efficiently. A different model based on the role of the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been suggested as a mechanism of hypoxic response. Inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain blocks HIF-1 DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and also blocks the induction of EPO, VEGF, aldolase, and phosphoglycerate kinase mRNA, which are HIF-1 target genes in Hep3B cells under hypoxic conditions (16Chandel N.S.

Res. 1996; 79: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid by P450 in rat vascular tissue is directly dependent on the concentration of oxygen. P450 enzymes require molecular oxygen for their activity, and the majority of them require only very low PO2 levels for normal activity. The unique characteristic of the extrahepatic P450 enzymes responsible for 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid formation is that a high level of PO2 is required for the catalytic activity of these enzymes. Furthermore, CO, which efficiently binds to heme, inhibits chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity including HRE element in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (21Liu Y. Christou H. Morita T.

Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). There is no definitive evidence that the P450 system contributes to gene regulation under hypoxic conditions. P450s require NADPH-P450 reductase (NPR) for electron transfer as well as molecular oxygen. NPR is known as a flavoprotein and requires NADPH. In this study, we observed that DPIC inhibited hypoxic EPO induction in Hep3B cells that did not express gp91 phox mRNA. This result suggested that DPIC did not inhibit gp91 phox (a component of NADPH-oxidase) in the cells, suggesting the presence of another flavoprotein that regulates hypoxic response of the cells. We found that NPR plays an important role in the regulation of HIF-1 activation, stabilization, and HRE binding under hypoxic conditions. We also propose that NPR is present in the plasma membrane, although it was previously believed to exist only in the endoplasmic reticulum. We further studied the correlation of NPR expression with VEGF and HIF-1 expression in human tumor tissues. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and DPIC were purchased from Sigma. LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent, antibiotic G418, pBluescript II, and pcDNA 3.1 were purchased from Invitrogen. DH5α-competent cells were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). pGL3-SV40 and pRL-TK vector were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Isogen and restriction enzymes were purchased from Nippon Gene (Toyama, Japan). RNA PCR Kit (AMV) version 2.1 and Pyrobest DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara (Shiga, Japan). Nitrocellulose membrane, horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG, and 4-chloro-1-naphthol were purchased from Bio-Rad. Protease inhibitor (Complete, Mini: inhibition of serine and cysteine proteases) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The entire coding region of human NPR was isolated from a human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR. PCR was performed with Pyrobest DNA polymerase as follows: 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1.5 min. The NPR coding regions of 1.2 kb upstream and 1.3 kb downstream were amplified using each primer set. The primers were designed from the total nucleotide sequence (which lost 5′-terminal ATG) reported by Shephard et al. (23Shephard E.A. Palmer C.N. Segall H.J. Phillips I.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The upstream primers were 5′-CCCCTCGAGATGGGAGACTCCCACGTGGACACCA (a single line indicates the XhoI site, and a double line indicates the initiation codon, nucleotides 1–25) and 5′-CGCCAGCTCGTACAGCACGT (antisense, nucleotides 1151–1170). The downstream primers were 5′-ATGCACCTGGAATTGGACAT (sense, nucleotides 901–920) and 5′-GGGGAATTCCTAGCTCCACACGTCCAGGGAGTAG (a line indicates the EcoRI site, nucleotides 2010–2034). The upstream fragment was digested with XhoI andPvuII, and the downstream fragment was digested withPvuII and EcoRI. These two fragments were ligated with pBluescript cut with XhoI and EcoRI. The full-length NPR cDNA was cut out with XhoI andEcoRI and subcloned into pcDNA, an expression vector for mammalian cells. The resulting plasmid contained antisense NPR cDNA, called pcDNA-aNPR. The plasmid containing sense NPR cDNA, called pcDNA-sNPR, was inserted into theKpnI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA. The entire coding region of human HIF-1α was isolated from Hep3B cDNA by PCR. The PCR conditions were the same as those used for human NPR. The HIF-1α coding region was divided into three fragments and amplified by PCR. The primers for PCR were designed with reference to the nucleotide sequence of HIF-1α reported by Hogenesch (24Hogenesch J.B. Chan W.K. Jackiw V.H. Brown R.C., Gu, Y.Z. Pray-Grant M. Perdew G.H. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8581-8593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The upstream region (0.9 kb), the middle region (1.5 kb), and the downstream region (0.7 kb) were amplified using the following sets of primers: 5′-GGGGTACCACCGATTCACCATGGAGGGC (a single line indicates the KpnI site, and a double line indicates the initiation codon, nucleotides −11 to 9), 5′-ACTGTCCTGTGGTGACTTGT (antisense, nucleotides 894–903), 5′-TATGACCTGCTTGGTGCTGA (sense, nucleotides 648–667), 5′-TTCCTCAGGAACTGTAGTTC (antisense, nucleotides 2093–2112), 5′-CAGTTACAGTATTCCAGCAG (sense, nucleotides 1793–1812), and 5′-TTCGCGGCCGCCGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCT (a line indicates the NotI site, nucleotides 2453–2478), respectively. The three fragments were successively subcloned into pBluescript digested with KpnI and SalI,SalI and SpeI, and SpeI andNotI, respectively. The constructed plasmid including full-length HIF-1α was cut with KpnI and PstI. The fragment was subcloned into pQE82L vector, which contains a His tag sequence and is used for the expression of His tag protein inEscherichia coli (Qiagen). Human NPR expressed in E. coli was a generous gift of Dr. S. Asahi (Department of Biology, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University). Human NPR was purified as described previously (25Funae Y. Imaoka S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 926: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Human HIF-1α, which has a His tag, was expressed in E. coli as DH5α cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The DH5α cells were cultured in a Jar Fermenter (K-0816, Able, Tokyo, Japan) and were collected by centrifugation. The expressed HIF-1α was solubilized in 6m guanidine HCl. HIF-1α containing His tag in its N terminus was purified by affinity chromatography with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose gel (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbed protein was eluted with 0.25m imidazole. Purified HIF-1α solution was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and used for the preparation of antibodies. The preparation of antibodies against NPR and HIF-1α is described elsewhere (26Imaoka S. Terano Y. Funae Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Human NPR (50–100 μg) or HIF-1α (50–100 μg) was given to rabbits. An antibody against gp91 phox was a generous gift from Dr. E. F. Sato (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Osaka City University). The human hepatoma cell line Hep3B was obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research at the Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer of Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). The human cervix cell line HeLa S3 (JCRB0713) was provided by the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). Hep3B cells and HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Stable transfectants of NPR knockdown lines were generated from Hep3B cells by transfection of antisense NPR expression plasmids (pcDNA-aNPR) (5 μg). After the transfection, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 4 h. Then the cells received fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The clones were picked up as individual colonies and maintained in medium containing G418 (600 μg/ml). The expression of NPR in Hep3B cells transfected with pcDNA-aNPR was checked by immunoblotting with an anti-NPR antibody. At least two independent clones were isolated for each expression plasmid. DPIC was dissolved in water and added to the medium (final concentration, 100 μm). For hypoxic stimulation, the cells were incubated in 1% O2, 5% CO2 and nitrogen-balanced with a modulator incubator chamber (Napco 7101, Winchester, VA). Total RNA was extracted from both Hep3B cells and HeLa S3 cells with Isogen and transferred to cDNA using a RNA PCR kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR containing 10 pmol of each primer, 1.5 units of AmpliTaq, and 100 ng of cDNA was performed with the following cycles: 10 min at 94 °C and then 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 2.5 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The PCR primers of p22 phox (27Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Walker L.E. Allen R.A. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar) were 5′-TTCATGGATGTCTATCAGCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATCTCTCCTATGTGCTGGC-3′ (antisense). The oligonucleotide sequences of PCR reaction products were confirmed by sequencing. The Hep3B cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The nuclear extracts for the cells were prepared by the method of Wang et al. (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides for EMSA were 5′-GATCGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′ (EPO sense) and 5′-GATCTGAGACAGCACGTAGGGC-3′ (EPO antisense), which is the 3′-region of EPO. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Electrophoresis was done using 4% polyacrylamide gels at 15 mA in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Human neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy adult volunteers by sedimentation through mono-poly-resolving medium (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Company, Osaka, Japan). Cells at 80% confluence were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor. Immunoblotting with antibodies against HIF-1α and NPR was done by a method described previously (26Imaoka S. Terano Y. Funae Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Each protein was visualized using horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG and by 4-chloro-1-naphthol or ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Complementary oligonucleotides (50 bp containing HRE of EPO) were synthesized (22Huang L.E. Willmore W.G., Gu, J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pGL3-SV40 digested with BamHI. The clone containing two copies of HRE was picked up and named pGL3-SV40HRE. Both pGL3-SV40HRE and pRL-TK were lipofected into the cultured cells (5 × 105 Hep3B cells) in a 30-mm dish with GenePORTERTM2 transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). The luciferase activity was measured 48 h later with a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, Berthold, Tokyo Japan) using the dual luciferase reporter system (Toyo-Inki, Tokyo, Japan). Microsomes of human bladder and Hep3B cells were prepared as described previously (31Imaoka S. Yoneda Y. Matsuda T. Degawa M. Fukushima S. Funae Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Human bladder tissue samples were obtained by total cystectomy or transurethral resection at the Osaka City General Hospital and Osaka City University Hospital. None of these patients had received any type of therapy for bladder tumors prior to surgery. From the resected bladders, small pieces of tissue, including the bladder mucosa, were rapidly extracted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All of the tissues were taken after informed consent had been obtained from the patients and their families. We examined the effect of DPIC upon the induction of the EPO gene by hypoxia in human hepatoma cells (Hep3B cells). DPIC is an inhibitor of NADPH-dependent enzymes such as NADPH-oxidase and NPR. The Hep3B cells were incubated under hypoxia (1% oxygen) for 3 h in the presence of DPIC (100 μm). Exposure to DPIC markedly reduced the hypoxic induction of EPO (Fig. 1). The presence of NADPH (1 mm) together with DPIC recovered the induction of EPO mRNA in hypoxia, but the presence of NADH did not. These findings suggest that the NADPH-dependent enzyme NADPH-oxidase, a candidate oxygen sensor, plays a role in the hypoxic EPO mRNA induction. For that reason, we investigated the expression of NADPH-oxidase component proteins, p22 phox and gp91 phox , using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (Fig.2 A). However, the two proteins were not detected in Hep3B cells. On the contrary, NPR, which is also an NADPH-dependent enzyme, was detected by RT-PCR. NPR protein was abundantly present in Hep3B cells (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Expression of NADPH-dependent enzymes in Hep3B cells.

Ms., microsomes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined whether NPR regulates EPO mRNA induction by hypoxia. NPR− cells were prepared by transfection of pcDNA-aNPR plasmid. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-human NPR antibody (Fig.3 A) or to cytochromec enzyme assay. The NPR in NPR− cells was much less than that in control cells transfected with vector only. The NPR activity assayed by cytochrome c reduction in NPR− cells was also extensively reduced (data not shown). Hypoxic EPO mRNA induction using NPR− cells was investigated (Fig. 3 B). The expression of EPO mRNA was suppressed by NPR knockdown, whereas it was induced by hypoxia in control cells. NPR− cells were next treated with CoCl2, which mimics hypoxia (32Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The induction of EPO mRNA by CoCl2 in NPR− cells occurred to the same degree as in control cells, indicating that these cells maintain the capacity of EPO induction. This study suggests that NPR is an important factor in hypoxic induction of EPO mRNA. Next, we investigated whether NPR regulates the EPO expression at the transcriptional level in Hep3B cells. Hypoxia stabilized HIF-1α and increased the HIF-1α protein level, but the level was dramatically decreased in the presence of DPIC (Fig.4 A), indicating that DPIC inhibited HIF-1α stabilization (the HIF-1α mRNA level was not changed). We examined whether NPR influences the activation or stabilization of HIF-1 and the interaction of HIF-1 with HRE of the EPO gene (Fig. 4 B). Hep3B cells were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia for 3 h, in the presence or absence of DPIC. The nuclear protein extracts were prepared from the cells, and the HIF-1 binding activity was examined with EMSA. The HRE oligonucleotide probe produced one major DNA-protein complex under hypoxia, and the protein complex disappeared when DPIC was added to the cells. We also investigated the binding of HIF-1 with HRE with a reporter gene assay including the plasmid constituted with HRE and the luciferase gene (Fig.5). Under hypoxic conditions, the cells lipofected by the reporter gene were observed to induce the luciferase activity by 12.5-fold compared with that occurring under normoxic conditions. When DPIC was added, the induction of luciferase activity by hypoxia was inhibited, and it almost matched the normoxia level (Fig. 5 A). We next lipofected both the reporter gene and either pcDNA-aNPR, pcDNA-sNPR, or empty vector to Hep3B cells (Fig. 5 B). The induction of luciferase activity was also inhibited by the reduction in NPR. In contrast, NPR overexpression increased the luciferase activity under hypoxic conditions, although there was no effect under normoxic conditions. These results indicate that the expression levels of NPR in Hep3B cells are important for hypoxic response. We further studied the hypoxic response in another cell line, HeLa S3, which expresses NADPH-oxidase (Fig.6 A), although Hep3B did not express NADPH-oxidase. Either pcDNA-aNPR or pcDNA-sNPR was transfected into HeLa S3 cells, and the hypoxic response was investigated (Fig. 6 B). As in Hep3B cells, the induction of luciferase activity in hypoxia was inhibited by the reduction in NPR and was increased by the overexpression of NPR. These results indicate that NPR is important for the activation of HIF-1 and the interaction of HIF-1 with HRE.Figure 5Dual luciferase reporter assay in Hep3B cells. A, effect of DPIC on the luciferase activity.B, effect of NPR antisense cDNA and NPR sense cDNA on the luciferase activity. Hep3B cells were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid (pGL3-SV40HRE vector) containing the HIF-1-binding domain of the human EPO gene (HRE) and a control plasmid (pRL-TK vector), containing a basal T4 promoter. At 48 h post-transfection, DPIC was added to the transfected Hep3B cells, and the cells were incubated for 2 h under hypoxia or normoxia (A). Either pcDNA-aNPR or pcDNA-sNPR (B) was transfected together with pGL3-SV40HRE and pRL-TK vector, and the cells were incubated for 2 h under hypoxia or normoxia. The amount of luciferase activity was quantitated with the cells lysates. The ratio (reporter/control luciferase activity) obtained from the cell lysates under hypoxia was set at 100%.

DNA-protein complex under hypoxia by EMSA was reduced by anti-NPR IgG, although control IgG had no effect. We next expressed transient fusion luciferase proteins containing the HRE and added anti-NPR IgG to the cells (Fig.7 B). The addition of control IgG did not affect the luciferase activity induced by hypoxia, whereas anti-NRP IgG reduced it by 50% in comparison. Because the IgG protein cannot pass through the plasma membrane, NPR IgG may bind with NPR located on the surface of the plasma membrane. This antibody against NPR did not cross-react with gp91 phox , which was expressed abundantly in human neutrophils, indicating that the specificity of an anti-NPR antibody is high (Fig.7, C and D). We have supplied evidence that BSA-NADPH (a covalent complex of NADPH and BSA) recovered the EPO induction inhibited by DPIC as well as NADPH (Fig.8). We concluded that NADPH acted on the plasma membrane, because neither BSA-NADPH nor NPR IgG can pass through the membrane.Figure 8Induction of EPO mRNA in Hep3B cells treated with BSA-NADPH. The cells were incubated for 3 h under hypoxia in the presence of DPIC or of DPIC plus BSA-NADPH. The ratio (EPO mRNA/β-actin mRNA) under hypoxia was set at 100%. The values are given as the means ± S.D. of six separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NPR is a major NADPH-dependent enzyme transferring electrons to microsomal P450 and heme oxygenase (33Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NPR is distinct from many other flavoproteins in that it contains one molecule each of FAD and FMN per polypeptide chain. NPR reduces NADPH in FMN. We have shown here a new function of NPR, as a regulator of HIF-1 activation and gene induction by hypoxia. Despite various studies, thus far the molecular mechanisms responsible for oxygen sensing and downstream pathways utilized by the hypoxic signal are still poorly understood. Recent studies of oxygen sensing have explored the role of oxygen as an electron acceptor in a variety of nonmitochondrial redox systems involving electron transport and have focused on an NADPH-oxidase from phagocytes that catalyzes the production of hydrogen peroxide (12Gorlach A. Holtermann G. Jelkmann W. Hancock J.T. Jones S.A. Jones O.T. Acker H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We utilized hypoxic EPO induction to test the hypothesis that NADPH-oxidase is an oxygen sensor. Although we observed that DPIC as an NADPH-oxidase inhibitor inhibited EPO induction in Hep3B cells by hypoxia, NADPH-oxidase mRNA was not detected in Hep3B cells by RT-PCR. These results indicate that DPIC is probably not an inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase in Hep3B cells. Our data provide evidence that NPR is the target of DPIC. We cloned cells that had low NPR expression (NPR− cells) to elucidate whether the target of DPIC is NPR. The EPO gene was not induced in the NPR− cells under hypoxic conditions, whereas the hypoxic EPO induction in the NPR− cells was normally induced by cobalt, which is known to induce EPO mRNA, as happens with hypoxia (32Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). These findings were consistent with our results, in which DPIC had little or no effect on EPO induction by cobalt. Therefore, we studied whether NPR influences either transportation of HIF-1 to the nucleus or its HRE binding. As expected, binding of HIF-1 to HRE of the EPO gene examined by EMSA and reporter gene assay was extensively reduced in Hep3B cells lipofected with pcDNA-aNPR. The same experiments with HeLa cells that expressed NADPH-oxidase produced the same results. These results suggest that NPR but not NADPH-oxidase is important for the activation of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions in general. Moreover, we found novel evidence that NPR is located on the plasma membrane. This was demonstrated by both the anti-NPR antibody, which did not cross-react with NADPH-oxidase, and BSA-NADPH. Thus far it has been understood that NPR and P450 are located in the endoplasmic reticulum; however, in this study, anti-NPR IgG also inhibited the binding of HIF-1 to HRE of the EPO gene. An important function of NPR in the plasma membrane is the regulation of EPO induction and HIF-1 activation. The activation of HIF-1 by hypoxia appears to be complex and to involve changes in protein stability, nuclear localization, DNA binding capability, and transcriptional activation function (34Wenger R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar).

Although a conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans has been defined (43Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E.

We hypothesize that NPR might modify HIF prolyl hydroxylase activity through the reduction of an unknown factor, because we have observed that both HIF-1 degradation and DNA binding have diminished under hypoxic conditions in cells lacking NPR. If HIF prolyl hydroxylase directly senses oxygen and promotes pVHL-dependent ubiquitylation, hypoxia could induce the EPO gene in the NPR− cells. In addition, the inhibition of EPO induction by CO cannot be explained by this system, in which some hemeprotein works (21Liu Y. Christou H. Morita T. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Kourembanas S. J. Biol.

Tumors become hypoxic, and then hypoxia causes the expression of VEGF, which is regulated by HIF-1. More recently, Li et al. (44Li D. Gan Y. Wientjes M.G. Badalament R.A. Au J.L. J. Urol. 2001; 166: 2500-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) found that NPR was induced in human bladder tumors. In this study, we found that the expression of NPR was well correlated with that of VEGF (Fig.9). The HIF-1α protein level was also high in tissues that had a high expression of NPR. These findings are consistent with in vitro studies where NPR overexpression in Hep3B cells and HeLa S3 cells increased HRE binding activity by luciferase assay. These findings suggest that NPR is important for HIF-1α stabilization and VEGF expression in vivo. In conclusion, NPR regulates gene expression under hypoxic conditions by modulating the HIF-1α activation and its HRE binding. We also found that NPR was present in the plasma membrane and had the function of regulating gene expression. We have presented evidence for the relation of NPR to HIF-1α expression in human bladder tissues and have suggested that NPR is an important factor in hypoxic expression of genes such as VEGF in vivo.

We investigated the nuclear import of the L1 major capsid protein of high risk HPV16. When digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated with HPV16 L1 capsomeres, the L1 protein was imported into the nucleus in a receptor-mediated manner. HPV16 L1 capsomeres formed complexes with Kap α2β1 heterodimers via interaction with Kap α2. Accordingly, nuclear import of HPV16 L1 capsomeres was mediated by Kap α2β1 heterodimers, required RanGDP and free GTP, and was independent of GTP hydrolysis. Remarkably, HPV16 L1 capsomeres also interacted with Kap β2 and binding of RanGTP to Kap β2 did not dissociate the HPV16 L1·Kap β2 complex. Significantly, HPV16 L1 capsomeres inhibited the nuclear import of Kap β2 and of a Kap β2-specific M9-containing cargo. These data suggest that, during the productive stage of infection, while the HPV16 L1 major capsid protein enters the nucleus via the Kap α2β1-mediated pathway to assemble the virions, it also inhibits the Kap β2-mediated nuclear import of host hnRNP A1 protein and, in this way, favors virion formation.

Approximately 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer are identified each year globally with nearly 300,000 deaths annually. About 85 genotypically distinct HPV genotypes have been isolated and characterized, with roughly half infecting the skin and the other half preferentially infecting oral/anogenital mucosal epithelial tissues. Mucosal HPVs have demonstrated varying degrees of oncogenic potential; high risk HPVs, such as types 16, 18, 31, and 45, are frequently detected in invasive cervical carcinomas, whereas the low risk types, such as types 6 and 11, are more often associated with benign exophytic condylomas (1zur Hausen H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 690-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPVs are small, nonenveloped, icosahedral DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus of squamous epithelial cells. The virion particles (52–55 nm in diameter) consist of a single molecule comprising 8 kb of double-stranded circular DNA contained within a spherical capsid composed of 72 homopentameric L1 capsomeres and of L2 minor capsid protein. The number of L2 molecules per capsid has been estimated at 36 (2Doorbar J. Gallimore P.H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2793-2799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 12 (3Trus B.L. Roden R.B. Greenstone H.L.

The capsids can be disassembled into capsomeres quantitatively by an agent that reduces disulfide bonds and reassembled by removing the reducing agent (10Li M. Beard P. Estes P.A. Lyon M.K. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2160-2167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11McCarthy M.P. White W.I. Palmer-Hill F. Koenig S. Suzich J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The L1 capsid proteins of HPVs seem to enter the nucleus of host cells twice during the virus life cycle: immediately after the virions infect the undifferentiated proliferating epithelial cells and again during the late productive phase when the newly synthesized L1 and L2 proteins assemble the replicated HPV genomic DNA into infectious virions inside the nuclei of terminally differentiated epithelial cells. Proteins must carry nuclear localization signals (NLSs) to enter the nucleus. The first identified NLSs, now referred to as classic NLSs, fall into two categories: a monopartite NLS consisting of a simple sequence of 3–5 basic amino acid residues and a bipartite NLS consisting of a basic dipeptide upstream from a simple basic sequence. Other types of NLSs have since been identified in hnRNP proteins, ribosomal proteins, and U small nuclear RNPs. NLSs are recognized by adapters of the karyopherin α/importin α (Kap α/Imp α) family and by import receptors of the karyopherin β/importin β (Kap β/Imp β) family that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The basic paradigm for nuclear import is that the NLS cargo is bound (either directly or indirectly via an adapter) by an import receptor in the cytoplasm, translocated through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and released inside the nucleus. The receptor and the adapter are then recycled back to the cytoplasm in a form competent for another round of import (12Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32–33 (suppl.): 76-83Crossref Google Scholar, 14Wente S.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The first identified nuclear import receptor was Kap β1, which functions together with a Kap α adapter in nuclear import of proteins that contain classic monopartite or bipartite NLSs. Kap α binds to the NLS of the cargo, whereas Kap β1 mediates docking at the NPC (15Gorlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.

There are six human Kap α adapters, and it is likely that they have both distinct and overlapping specificities for classic basic NLSs. Kap β1 can also function without adapters when importing ribosomal proteins, cyclin B1, and viral proteins. Other members of the Kap β family have been identified and shown to function in nuclear import of specific cargoes. All Kap β receptors shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and bind to nucleoporins at the NPC and to the GTPase Ran in its GTP-bound form. The nucleotide state of Ran is regulated by cytoplasmic RanGAP and RanBP1, which accelerate GTP hydrolysis to form cytoplasmic RanGDP, and by the nuclear RanGEF (RCC1), which catalyzes nucleotide exchange to regenerate nuclear RanGTP. Binding of nuclear RanGTP to Kap βs (importins) causes the dissociation of the import complexes with release of the cargoes inside the nucleus. The Kap βs (importins/exportins) exit the nucleus in complex with RanGTP and, therefore, constantly deplete Ran from the nucleus (12Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32–33 (suppl.): 76-83Crossref Google Scholar, 14Wente S.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Ran is actively re-imported into the nucleus via the transport factor p10/NTF2, which binds specifically to RanGDP but not to RanGTP (22Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the nuclear import of the L1 major capsid protein of high risk HPV16. We found that HPV16 L1 capsomeres enter the nucleus via the classic Kap α2β1-mediated nuclear import pathway. Importantly, we also discovered that both HPV16 and HPV45 L1 capsomeres interact with Kap β2 and inhibit nuclear import of Kap β2 and its specific M9-containing cargo. These data suggest that during the late productive stage of infection the newly synthesized L1 major capsid proteins can interact with Kap β2 and may inhibit major Kap β2-mediated nuclear import pathways and, thus, inhibit other nuclear events so as to optimize virion formation.

Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (3-h induction with 1 mm IPTG at 30 °C), and the soluble GST fusion proteins were purified in their native state on glutathione-Sepharose beads using a standard procedure. To obtain cleaved Kap β2, the GST-Kap β2 fusion protein was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a Tev enzyme that has a His tag (Invitrogen), and after cleavage the GST was removed by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads and the Tev enzyme by binding to Talon beads, using standard procedures. Human Ran (25Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was prepared as described previously (26Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All proteins were checked for purity and lack of proteolytic degradation by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The purified proteins were dialyzed in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. The L1 capsids of HPV16 and HPV45 were generated in insect cells, purified as described (27Rose R.C. Bonnez W., Da Rin C. McCance D.J. Reichman R.C. J. Gen.

Purity and lack of proteolytic degradation of the L1 proteins were always checked by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and immunoblotting prior to use. L1 capsomeres were obtained by incubating the L1 capsids with 5% mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 °C (11McCarthy M.P. White W.I. Palmer-Hill F. Koenig S. Suzich J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against HPV16 L1 capsids as described (27Rose R.C. Bonnez W., Da Rin C. McCance D.J. Reichman R.C. J.

Murine antibodies raised against Kap α2/Rch-1 and Kap β2/transportin were from Transduction Laboratories; a mouse monoclonal antibody to Kap β1/p97 was from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., and the goat anti-GST antibody was fromAmersham Biosciences. HeLa cytosol from Cellex Biosciences Inc. was centrifuged and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The L1 major capsid protein of HPV16 contains two classic NLSs at its C terminus: a monopartite NLS (AKRKKRKL) and a bipartite type that overlaps with the monopartite NLS (KRKATPTTSSTSTTAKRKKRKL) (29Zhou J. Doorbar J. Sun X.Y. Crawford L.V. McLean C.S. Frazer I.H. Virology. 1991; 185: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The monopartite NLS (mpNLS) of HPV16 L1 and the overlapping bipartite/monopartite NLS (bpNLS) of HPV16 L1 were separately fused to a GST reporter protein. For making the GST-bpNLS construct the forward and reverse oligonucleotides, phosphorylated at 5′-ends, were annealed, and the overhanging areas were filled in using a DNA polymerase I, large Klenow fragment. The resulting DNA fragments were blunt end-ligated with T4 DNA ligase, double-digested withEcoRI and XhoI, and inserted into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) that was double cut with the same enzymes. For making the GST-mpNLS construct, unphosphorylated oligonucleotides were designed with the corresponding restriction-cutting sites, annealed, and inserted directly into the pGEX4T-1 vector as described above. The GST-bpNLS and GST-mpNLS constructs were transformed in XL1 blue bacteria and confirmed by automated sequence analysis (BioServe Biotechnologies Sequencing Department). The M9-GST construct was a gift from Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss. For protein expression, the constructs were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria. After induction of E. coli BL21(DE3) with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C, the GST-NLS fusion proteins were purified in their native state on glutathione-Sepharose using a standard procedure. The purified proteins were checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, dialyzed in buffer A, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use.

HeLa cells are cervical carcinoma cells that contain HPV18 DNA integrated into the cellular genome with consequent disruption of several viral genes but preservation of theE6 and E7 genes.

In the present study, subconfluent HeLa cells, grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 24 h, were permeabilized with 70 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min on ice and washed with buffer A. Digitonin permeabilizes the plasma membrane but leaves the nuclear envelope intact. As a consequence, digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells retain intact import-competent nuclei but are largely depleted of cytosolic transport factors, as indicated by the absence of NLS-mediated nuclear import in the presence of buffer alone and in the absence of either exogenous cytosol or recombinant Kaps plus RanGDP. It should be noted that p10 is retained in the digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells in sufficient amounts to support NLS-mediated nuclear import (Refs. 32Gorlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E.

Final import reaction volume was adjusted to 20 μl with buffer A. For visualization of nuclear import, the HPV16 L1 protein and the GST-NLS fusion proteins were detected by immunofluorescence with specific antibodies, as previously described (38Nelson L.M. Rose R.C. LeRoux L. Lane C. Bruya K. Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The nuclei were identified by DAPI staining. Nuclear import was analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope, which has a fluorescence attachment, and a Sony DKC-5000 charge-coupled device camera. Two types of binding assays were performed. First, GST-NLSHPV16L1 fusion proteins, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (2 μg of protein/10 μl of beads) were incubated under rotation for 30 min at room temperature with the purified Kaps (2 μg of protein) in buffer A (total volume, 40 μl). Control experiments for binding specificity consisted of incubating GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with the purified Kaps. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Second, GST-Kap β1 or GST-Kap β2 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (2 μg of protein/10 μl of beads) was incubated for 30 min under rotation at room temperature with HPV16 L1 or HPV45 L1 capsomeres (2 μg of protein) in buffer A containing 0.25% Tween 20 (binding buffer). In some experiments, 2 μg of either Kap α2 or RanGTP was added to the incubation mixture, as indicated in the figure legends. Control experiments for binding specificity consisted of incubating GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with the L1 capsomeres. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. We had previously established for the L1 major capsid proteins of HPV11 and HPV45 that capsid disassembly is required for their nuclear import (38Nelson L.M. Rose R.C. LeRoux L. Lane C. Bruya K. Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 39Merle E. Rose R.C. LeRoux L. Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nuclear import of the L1 major capsid protein of HPV16 was investigated in either capsid or capsomere conformation. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated with either HPV16 L1 capsomeres (Fig.1 A) or HPV16 L1 capsids (Fig. 1 B) in the presence of cytosol and an energy-regenerating system. As previously found for HPV11 and HPV45, the HPV16 L1 capsomeres were imported into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells in the presence of cytosol (Fig. 1 A), whereas the HPV16 L1 capsids were not (Fig. 1 B). It has been shown previously that the L1 major capsid protein of HPV16 contains two classic NLSs at the C terminus: a monopartite NLS and a bipartite type that overlaps with the monopartite NLS (29Zhou J. Doorbar J. Sun X.Y. Crawford L.V. McLean C.S. Frazer I.H. Virology. 1991; 185: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because HPV16 L1 contains classic basic NLSs, we investigated whether nuclear import of HPV16 L1 major capsid protein can be mediated by the Kap α2β1 heterodimers. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated with HPV16 L1 capsomeres in the presence of either Kap β1 + RanGDP (A), Kap β1 + RanGDP + p10 (B), Kap β1 + Kap α2 + RanGDP (C), or Kap β1 + Kap α2 + RanGDP + p10 (D). We found that nuclear import of HPV16 L1 was efficiently mediated by Kap α2β1 heterodimers (Fig. 2,C and D) but not by Kap β1 (Fig. 2,A and B). Addition of exogenous p10 did not increase nuclear import of HPV16 L1 capsomeres in agreement with previous results that sufficient endogenous p10 is retained in the digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells to support NLS-mediated import (32Gorlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar,34Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We next tested for nuclear import two GST fusion proteins containing either the overlapping bipartite/monopartite NLS of HPV16 L1 (GST-bpNLSHPV16L1) or the monopartite NLS of HPV16 L1 (GST-mpNLSHPV16L1). Both the GST-bpNLSHPV16L1and the GST-mpNLSHPV16L1 were imported into the nucleus in the presence of cytosol or in the presence of Kap α2β1 heterodimers plus RanGDP but not in the presence of transport buffer alone or Kap β1 plus RanGDP (Fig. 3 and data not shown). As a control, GST itself was not imported into the nucleus in the presence of cytosol (data not shown). In agreement with the nuclear import data, the bpNLSHPV16L1interacted directly with Kap α2 (Fig.4 A, lane 1) and formed a trimeric complex with the Kap α2/Kap β1 heterodimer (Fig.4 A, lane 2). The weak binding of Kap β1 alone to the GST-bpNLSHPV16L1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) is assumed to be nonspecific, because it is equivalent to the interaction of Kap β1 with the GST alone (Fig. 4 A,lane 4). The mpNLSHPV16L1 also interacted directly with Kap α2 and formed a trimeric complex with the Kap α2/Kap β1 heterodimer (data not shown). To investigate the direct interactions between HPV16 L1 capsomeres and Kap α2β1 heterodimers, we used in-solution binding assays with the GST-Kap β1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads via the GST (Fig. 4 B). The GST-Kap β1-containing beads were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with HPV16 L1 capsomeres alone or in the presence of Kap α2. Binding of HPV16 L1 capsomeres to the Kap β1-containing beads was strongly increased in the presence of Kap α2 (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 1 and 2) indicating the formation of a complex: L1 capsomere·Kap α2·Kap β1. Moreover, binding of RanGTP to Kap β1 inhibited binding of the Kap α2·L1 capsomere complex to Kap β1 or promoted its dissociation (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). These binding results support the nuclear import data indicating that the Kap α2β1 heterodimers can mediate nuclear import of HPV16 L1 capsomeres. Previous studies have suggested that GTP hydrolysis by Ran is not required for Kap α2β1-mediated nuclear import of specific cargoes (37Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Nelson L.M. Rose R.C. LeRoux L. Lane C. Bruya K. Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We investigated whether nuclear import of HPV16 L1 capsomeres and GST-mpNLSHPV16L1 are also independent of GTP hydrolysis by Ran by comparing their nuclear import in the presence of Kap α2 plus Kap β1 plus RanGDP and either GTP or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, GTPγS and GMP-PNP. Both HPV16 L1 capsomeres and the GST-mpNLSHPV16L1 were efficiently imported in the presence of either GTP, GTPγS, or GMP-PNP (Fig.5). These data suggest that GTP hydrolysis by Ran is not required for the nuclear import of HPV16 L1 major capsid protein. Human Kap β2/transportin is known to mediate nuclear import of hnRNP A1 and A2 via interaction with their Gly/Asn-rich NLS termed M9 (24Chook Y.M. Blobel G.

HKa and particularly its His-Gly-Lys-rich domain 5 have been previously reported to exert anti-adhesive properties by binding to the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin (VN). In this study the ability of HKa and domain 5 to interfere with platelet adhesion and aggregation was investigated. In a purified system HKa and particularly domain 5 but not HK inhibited the binding of VN to the αIIbβ3integrin, whereas the binding of fibrinogen to this integrin was not affected. The region Gly-486–Lys-502 from the carboxyl terminus of the domain 5 was identified as responsible for inhibition of the VN-αIIbβ3-integrin interaction, as this portion was also found to mediate kininogen binding to VN. Through these interactions, HKa, the isolated domain 5, and the peptide Gly-486–Lys-502 abrogated the αIIbβ3-integrin-dependent adhesion of human platelets to VN but not to fibrinogen. The codistribution of VN and HKa at sites of ex vivo platelet aggregation was demonstrated by transmission immune electron microscopy, indicating that the described interaction is likely to take place in vivo. Moreover, domain 5 and the peptide Gly-486–Lys-502 dose-dependently blocked platelet aggregation, resembling the inhibitory effect of monoclonal antibody 13H1 against multimeric VN. Finally, treatment of mice with isolated domain 5 resulted in a significantly prolonged tail bleeding time. Taken together, our data emphasize the inhibitory role of HK domain 5 on platelet adhesion and aggregation; new anti-thrombotic compounds may become available on the basis of peptide Gly-486–Lys-502 of HK domain 5.

Subsequent fibrin formation not only stabilizes the temporary thrombus but also seals the platelet plug against diffusion of platelet secretory products, such as clotting factors, cell stimulatory agonists, or regulatory growth factors (1de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Vascular Control of Haemostasis. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 147-167Google Scholar). At high shear rates platelets predominantly stick to von Willebrand factor and collagen, whereas under low shear rate or static conditions several other extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibrin and vitronectin (VN)1 mediate αIIbβ3 integrin-dependent platelet adhesion via their Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence. Furthermore, binding of different agonists, such as ADP, thrombin, or collagen induces signaling events ultimately activating the receptor function of αIIbβ3 integrin for soluble fibrinogen leading to platelet aggregation (2Collins W.E.

Furthermore, multimeric forms of VN are secreted together with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) during platelet activation/aggregation (12Stockmann A. Hess S. DeClerck P. Timpl R.

Previous reports on the role of VN in platelet aggregation were contradictory, since it has been reported that exogenous VN as well as inhibitory antibodies against VN inhibit platelet aggregation (15Fay W.P.

In particular, kallikrein can liberate the short-lived vasodilator peptide bradykinin from HK (21Nishikawa K. Shibayama Y. Kuna P. Calcaterra E. Kaplan A.P. Reddigari S.R.

Moreover, domain 5 of HK binds to the β2 integrin Mac-1 on granulocytes and competes for FBG and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) binding in vitro and serves to regulate the Mac-1-dependent leukocyte recruitment in vivo (35Chavakis T.

These diverse observations prompted us to investigate the interaction between HKa and VN in more detail as well as the ability of HKa to interfere with the αIIbβ3 integrin-VN interaction in platelet adhesion and aggregation reactions. Our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of VN in platelet aggregation and also indicate that HK domain 5 and especially its sequence Gly-486–Lys-502 can abolish platelet adhesion to VN and block platelet aggregation and could thereby serve as the basis for the development of new anti-thrombotic substances. Single and two-chain high molecular weight kininogen (HK and HKa) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The purified HK and HKa (>95%) appeared as a major band of 140 and 110 kDa, respectively, on non-reduced SDS gels. HK was digested with plasma kallikrein (HK to kallikrein = 100:1, mol/mol) for 20 min at 37 °C. The resulting HKa was composed of two bands of 62 and 46 kDa when analyzed by reduced SDS-gel electrophoresis. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to domains 3, 5, and 6 of HK or to sequences derived from domain 5 were produced as previously described (37Kunapuli S.P. DeLa Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. J. Biol.

GST was amino-terminally attached to the following sequences of HK: Gly-235–Met-357 (domain 3), Lys-420–Ser-513 (domain 5), and Thr-503–Ser-626 (domain 6) as well as Lys-420–Asp-474, and His-475–Lys-502 (amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domain 5 sequences). The mutants were purified on a glutathione column reaching more than 90% purity. Peptide synthesis and high performance liquid chromatography purification to more than 95% purity were performed by Dr. J. Lambris (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).

Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 150 × g for 20 min at 22 °C. Platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 × gfor 5 min at 22 °C, washed, and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 3.5% (w/v) BSA, 33 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mmHEPES, pH 6.4). After counting, platelets were diluted with HEPES-Tyrode buffer to 1 × 108 platelets/ml. Human megakaryoblastic cell lines CHRF-288 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Lieberman, Cincinnati, Ohio) and MEG-01 (obtained from DSM, Braunschweig, Germany), were maintained in suspension culture with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum as described (41Wohn K.D. Schmidt T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Germer M. Morgenstern E. Preissner K.T. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The addition of 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced cellular differentiation along the megakaryoblastic lineage. The cell lines were found to be free from mycoplasma contamination using a mycoplasma detection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Maxisorp plates (high binding capacity; Nunc) were coated with 5 μg/ml αIIbβ3 integrin in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2 overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA. Binding of multimeric VN or FBG (2 μg/ml) was performed in a final volume of 50 μl of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3% (w/v) BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 2 h at 22 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm ZnCl2 and different competitors as indicated in the legends to Figs. 1 and2. The identical protocol was used when the binding of VN to different forms and fragments of HK (HK, HKa, domain 3, domain 5, domain 6; each at 5 μg/ml) was tested. After the incubation period, monoclonal antibody VN7 (40Kost C. Stüber W. Ehrlich H. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) against VN at a concentration of 125 ng/ml or polyclonal rabbit anti-FBG (at a dilution of 1: 1000) was added followed by the addition of 1:1000-diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. The conversion of the substrate 2,2-azino-di(3-ethyl)benzthiazoline sulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was monitored at 405 nm in a Thermomax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was used as the blank and subtracted to calculate the specific binding.Figure 2Influence of kininogen on the binding of VN and FBG to immobilized αIIbβ3-integrin. A, the binding of 2 μg/ml VN (hatched bars) or 2 μg/ml FBG (filled bars) to immobilized αIIbβ3 integrin (5 μg/ml) was studied without (−) or together with KC-13972 (KC13, 1 μg/ml), monoclonal antibody 13H1 against VN (20 μg/ml), HK (250 nm), or HKa (250 nm) in the presence of 10 μmZnCl2. Specific binding is presented as percent of control, which is represented by the binding of VN or FBG to αIIbβ3 integrin in the absence of any competitors. B, the binding of VN (2 μg/ml) to immobilized αIIbβ3 integrin (5 μg/ml) was analyzed in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of PAI-1 (filled squares), HKa (filled circles), or GST-domain 5 (open circles) together with 10 μm ZnCl2. Specific binding is presented as absorbance at 405 nm. Data represent the mean ± S.E. (n = 3) of a typical experiment; similar results were obtained in at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Platelet adhesion onto VN- or FBG-coated plates (and to BSA-coated wells as control) was tested according to a previously described protocol (42Verheul H.M. Jorna A.S. Hoekman K. Broxterman H.J. Gebbink M.F. Pinedo H.M. Blood. 2000; 96: 4216-4221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, multiwell plates were coated for 16 h at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml multimeric VN or 10 μg/ml FBG (dissolved in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6), respectively, and then blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA. Platelets stained with calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM, 2.5 μm; Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark at a density of 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 50 μl of HEPES-Tyrode buffer containing 4 mm MgCl2, added together with the respective competitors, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After 3 washes with PBS, bound platelets were lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and quantified in a fluorescent plate reader (excitation filter 492 nm, emission filter 535 nm, TECAN Spectrafluor, Crailsheim, Germany). Microtiter plates were coated with adhesive proteins as described above. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated megakaryoblastic cells were harvested by treatment with 2 mm EDTA, and 5 × 104 cells in 50 μl of serum-free RPMI medium together with 50 μl of competitors were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in the wells. After the incubation period, the wells were washed, and the number of adherent cells was quantified by crystal violet staining at 590 nm as previously described (34Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F.

Blood. 1999; 93: 2976-2983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of anticoagulated blood from healthy volunteers was adjusted to 3 × 105 platelets/μl by dilution with autologous plasma. Two aliquots each of 450 μl of PRP were preincubated in the absence or presence of competitors as indicated in the figure legends and 50 μl of ADP (at a final concentration of 5 μm) were added. The change in optical density was monitored using a Chrono-log aggregometer (Nobis, Endingen, Germany) with continuous stirring at 37 °C. Bleeding times were assessed according to a previously described protocol (44Foster C.J. Prosser D.M. Agans J.M. Zhai Y. Smith M.D. Lachowicz J.E. Zhang F.L. Gustafson E. Monsma F.J. Wiekowski M.T.

General anesthesia was induced in BALB/c mice with avertin (Sigma). Mice were pretreated with intraperitoneal injections of 0.3 ml containing domain 5 (150 μg) or GST (150 μg) or phosphate-buffered saline alone. The tail was amputated 2 mm from the tip, and the blood was blotted onto a filter paper every 10 s until the bleeding stopped. PRP from anticoagulated blood of healthy donors or clots were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde dissolved in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, blocks of the fixed pellets were washed 3 × 20 min in a buffer solution (0.1 m cacodylate buffer containing 7.55%, w/v sucrose). After infiltration for 24 h with 2.3 m sucrose, the blocks were plunge-frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryo-substituted in the presence of methanol containing 0.5% uranyl acetate at –85 °C using the Leica AFS–cryo substitution unit (Leica Vienna/Austria) followed by a low temperature embedding in Lowicryl HM 20. The blocks were polymerized in Lowicryl HM 20 using UV light (λ = 360 nm) for 42 h at –40 °C. Platelet-rich plasma from anticoagulated blood of healthy donors was activated by the addition of double-activated aPTT reagent (Dapptin®, Behring, Berlin, Germany) at equal volumes at 37 °C. After 2 min, a 25 mm CaCl2solution was added as a further equal volume, and clots were found to be formed after 2 min. Platelet clots were fixed at 4 °C in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde dissolved in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. After washing (3 times for 20 min) in a buffer solution (0.1 m cacodylate buffer containing 7.55% sucrose), the clots were infiltrated for 24 h with 2.3 m sucrose, plunge-frozen, and processed as described above for platelets. Immunolabeling on ultrathin serial sections was carried out for HK and VN by using a polyclonal sheep antibody against human HK (As94) and a polyclonal rabbit antibody against VN (S66/67) for 1 h at 20 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05 m glycine, single labeling or double labeling (by simultaneous incubation with the primary antibodies as described by Watkins et al. (45Watkins S.C. Raso V. Slayter H.S. Histochem. J. 1990; 22: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) was carried out. Labeling with secondary antibody or a mixture of gold-labeled goat antibodies (10-nm gold conjugated to anti-sheep IgG and 6-nm gold conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG, each at 20 μl/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (Aurion/Biotrend)) was carried out for 60 min at 20 °C. Control labeling was done omitting the primary antibodies. Finally, the sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in an EM 109 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen/Germany). Data were compared using analysis of variance and Student's t test; p values <0.05 were considered as significant. We have previously demonstrated that multimeric VN interacts with HKa and to a much lesser extent with HK in a Zn2+-dependent manner; moreover, VN binding was attributed to domain 5 of HK (34Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Muller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner KT Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, peptides derived from this domain were used to further identify the responsible epitope on HKa for interaction with multimeric VN. Multimeric VN only interacted with the carboxyl-terminal region of the domain 5, His-475–Lys-502 fused to GST, whereas no binding to the amino-terminal portion of domain 5, Lys-420–Asp-474 fused to GST, was observed (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal part of domain 5 was as potent as the entire domain 5 (Lys-420–Ser-513 fused to GST) in inhibiting the binding of multimeric VN to immobilized HKa (data not shown). Five synthetic peptides, derived from both parts of domain 5 and displaying surface loops that could potentially participate in protein-protein interactions, were tested for inhibition of binding of multimeric VN to HKa. Two peptides from the carboxyl terminus of domain 5, HK486 (sequence Gly-486–Lys-502) and HK483 (sequence His-483–Gly-497) inhibited the interaction between HKa and VN, whereas peptides HK406 (Gly-406–Asn-422), HK440 (Gly-440–His-455), or HK475 (His-475–His-485) had no effect (Fig. 1 B). The sequence specificity of the peptides HK486 and HK483 containing a high proportion of Gly, His, and Lys was proven by the fact that the respective scrambled peptides, HK486M and HK483M, hardly inhibited the binding of multimeric VN to HKa (Fig. 1 B). The inhibition of the interaction between multimeric VN and HKa by the different peptides derived from domain 5 was markedly augmented in the presence of zinc ions, whereby the minimal concentration of free Zn2+required was 10 μm. These data demonstrate that the sequence Gly-486–Lys-502 of domain 5 is responsible for the Zn2+-dependent binding of HKa to multimeric VN. Immobilized multimeric VN serves as a ligand for αv and αIIbβ3 integrins, and we previously showed that HKa binding to the amino-terminal “somatomedin B” domain of VN competes for αvβ3 integrin binding, thereby resembling the activity of PAI-1 as an anti-adhesive component (34Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Muller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner KT Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of both multimeric VN and FBG to immobilized αIIbβ3 integrin was inhibited by the αIIbβ3 inhibitor KC13972 but not by the αvβ3 inhibitor cyclic RGDfV (cyclic arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-containing peptide) peptide. HKa but not HK could compete for the binding of only VN but not of FBG to αIIbβ3 in a Zn2+-dependent manner, an effect that was reminiscent of the activity of PAI-1 and of the inhibitory monoclonal antibody 13H1 against multimeric VN (Fig.2 A). Again, domain 5 but not domains 3 or 6 of HK was responsible for inhibiting the αIIbβ3-VN interaction (TableI and Fig. 2 B). The IC50 of HKa or domain 5 (<100 nm for both forms) was about 5 times higher in this respect as compared with the IC50 of PAI-1 in the same reaction (about 20 nm) (Fig. 2 B). Using different polypeptides derived from domain 5, the inhibitory activity of HKa on the αIIbβ3-VN interaction could be localized within the same region of the carboxyl terminus of domain 5 that also mediated binding to VN (Table I). Binding of multimeric VN to αIIbβ3 integrin was blocked by the peptide HK486 (and to a lower extent by HK483), whereas the respective scrambled peptides exhibited reduced potency, and domain 5 peptides HK406, HK440, or HK475 had no effect. Taken together, these data underline our observations that the sequence Gly-486–Lys-502 of domain 5 can directly interfere with the αIIbβ3-VN interaction in a purified system.Table IInfluence of different competitors on the binding of VN to immobilized α IIb β 3 integrinAdditivesSpecific binding (absorbance at 405 nm)None1.023 ± 0.022HK0.889 ± 0.054HKa0.163 ± 0.056GST-domain 31.147 ± 0.021GST-domain 50.144 ± 0.045GST-Lys-420–Asp-4740.967 ± 0.013GST-His-475–Lys-5020.298 ± 0.010GST-domain 61.083 ± 0.042GST1.104 ± 0.008HK4060.985 ± 0.022HK4401.058 ± 0.015HK4751.012 ± 0.019HK"
https://openalex.org/W2022178223,"Infection of human monocytes by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to a decrease in the production of proinflammatory mediators as well as an impairment of phagocytosis. Considering the key role of protein kinases C (PKCs) in many biological functions of monocytes, including phagocytosis, we investigated the effects of EBV on the PKC activity in infected monocytes. Our results indicate that infection of monocytes by EBV impairs both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced translocation of PKC isozymes α and β from cytosol to membrane as well as the PKC enzymatic activity. Similarly, the subcellular distribution of the receptor for activated C kinase (RACK), an anchoring protein essential to PKC translocation, was also found to be reduced in EBV-infected monocytes. Transfection of 293T cells with an expression vector coding for the immediate-early protein ZEBRA of EBV resulted in impaired PMA-induced translocation and activity of PKC. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, the ZEBRA protein was found to physically interact with the RACK1 protein. Thus interaction of ZEBRA with RACK likely results in the inhibition of PKC activity, which in turn affects functions of monocytes, such as phagocytosis."

Currently, little is known about the specific roles of these factors in splicing. In this study, we characterized the molecular interaction between Hprp3p and Hprp4p. Constructs were created for expression of Hprp3p or its mutants in bacterial or mammalian cells. We showed that antibodies against either Hprp3p or Hprp4p were able to pull-down the Hprp3p-Hprp4p complex formed in Escherichia coli lysates. By co-immunoprecipitation and isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrated that purified Hprp3p and its mutants containing the central region, but lacking either the N-terminal 194 amino acids or the C-terminal 240 amino acids, were able to interact with Hprp4p. Conversely, Hprp3p mutants containing only the N- or C-terminal region did not interact with Hprp4p. In addition, by co-immunoprecipitation, we showed that intact Hprp3p and its mutants containing the central region interacted with Hprp4p in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Primer extension analysis illustrated that the central region of Hprp3p is required to maintain the association of Hprp3p-Hprp4p with U4/U6 small nuclear RNAs, suggesting that this Hprp3p/Hprp4p interaction allows the recruitment of Hprp4p, and perhaps other protein(s), to the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle.

Each snRNP particle consists of one (U1, U2, and U5) or two (U4/U6) snRNAs complexed with a set of Sm or Sm-like proteins and several particle-specific proteins (4Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Curr. Opin.

These snRNPs recognize conserved sequences of the pre-mRNA and assemble into a catalytically active spliceosome that catalyzes the two cleavage-ligation reactions of pre-mRNA splicing (1Moore M.J. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 7Konarska M.M.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). First, a pre-spliceosome (A complex) is formed once U1 and U2 snRNAs (as part of the U1 and U2 snRNPs) associate with the conserved 5′-splice site and the branch point of the intron, respectively (9Jones M.H. Frank D.N. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9687-9691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,10Teigelkamp S. Whittaker E. Beggs J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Then, U4/U6 snRNP, in which U4 and U6 snRNAs base pair over an extended complementary region, forming a Y-shaped junction, is recruited together with U5 snRNP, presumably via protein/protein interactions, to the pre-spliceosome to form the mature spliceosome (B complex) (11Lamm G.M.

Prior to the first catalytic step of splicing, important conformational rearrangements occur to create a catalytically active spliceosome. For example, U1 snRNA dissociates from the 5′-splice site, and the U4/U6 snRNA association is disrupted (14Siatecka M. Reyes J.L. Konarska M.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Collins C.A. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1970-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), leaving the U6 snRNA free to base pair with both the U2 snRNA and the 5′-splice site (17Frank D. Patterson B. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5197-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The U2 and U6 snRNAs, together with the pre-mRNA, may form the catalytic core of the spliceosome, whereas the U5 snRNP interacts with exonic sequences adjacent to both splice sites, possibly aligning the exons during splicing (18Ast G. Pavelitz T. Weiner A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1741-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After a round of splicing, the snRNPs are recycled to participate in further splicing, whereas the intron RNA is degraded (19Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 20Horowitz D.S. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2959-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Umen J.G.

The assembly of U4/U6 snRNP, its recruitment into the pre-spliceosome, and numerous conformational changes of its snRNA components are poorly understood processes. Proteins associated with U4 and U6 snRNAs are of particular interest because they could mediate the conformational changes that occur between U4 and U6 snRNAs (4Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Curr. Opin.

Hprp3p and Hprp4p can be isolated from HeLa cells together with the 20-kDa cyclophilin H as a heterotrimer protein complex (32Teigelkamp S. Achsel T. Mundt C. Gothel S.F. Cronshagen U. Lane W.S. Marahiel M. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1998; 4: 127-141PubMed Google Scholar). Within this complex, cyclophilin H associates with Hprp4p, but not with Hprp3p (28Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1374-1387PubMed Google Scholar, 29Reidt U. Reuter K. Achsel T. Ingelfinger D. Luhrmann R. Ficner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7439-7442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hprp3p may interact directly with Hprp4p in the complex. On the other hand, it has been shown that human Hprp3p and Hprp4p failed to interact with each other in the yeast two-hybrid system (30Lauber J. Plessel G. Prehn S. Will C.L. Fabrizio P. Groning K. Lane W.S. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1997; 3: 926-941PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, whether these two human splicing factors directly interact with each other and how they interact with the U4/U6 snRNP remain unclear. Understanding these interactions within the spliceosome is of particular importance because it will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of an essential genetic process, splicing. Here, we show that Hprp3p directly interacts with Hprp4p. Furthermore, we have identified the domain of Hprp3p involved in this interaction as being within the central region of this molecule. Our results suggest a possible role for Hprp3p in the recruitment of Hprp4p for the U4/U6 snRNP assembly. The pcDNA3– 3xHA-HPRP3 construct containing the 2.2-kb coding region of Hprp3p (31Wang A. Forman-Kay J. Luo Y. Luo M. Chow Y.H. Plumb J. Friesen J.D. Tsui L.C. Heng H.H. Woolford J.L., Jr. Hu J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used as a template to create Hprp3p deletion mutants. The coding region of the mutants was amplified by PCR using the following primers: N1, 5′-aaaggtaccagatctaccatgggtgggcggatcttttac-3′; N2, 5′-aaaagcggccgcttcatcatgaatgatgccattgag-3′; N3, 5′-aaaagcggccgcaagaaggaacagaaaaaacttc-3′; C1, 5′-aaactcgagtcaagtggcagcctgggagggctg-3′; C2, 5′-aaactcgagtcacttggtaagatatactcccag-3′; and C3, 5′-agtcgaggctgatcagccag-3′. All PCR amplifications were performed with the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The design of the Hprp3p mutant constructs is illustrated in Fig.2 B. The 5′-primer N1 and either the 3′-primer C1 or C2 were used to generate deletion mutant fragments I and II, respectively. Either the 5′-primer N2 or N3 in combination with the 3′-primer C3 were used to generate deletion mutant fragments III and IV, respectively. To build mammalian expression constructs, all four deletion fragments were subcloned at the NotI and XhoI restriction sites of a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing an HA epitope tag just upstream of the HPRP3 start codon. For construction of the corresponding set of E. coliexpression plasmids, the HA epitope-containingBamHI-XhoI fragment from pcDNA3-HPRP3 and those from pcDNA3-HPRP3deletion mutants were subcloned individually into pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) bearing an N-terminal His tag for expression in theE. coli system. pET28a-HPRP4 was previously constructed (31Wang A. Forman-Kay J. Luo Y. Luo M. Chow Y.H. Plumb J. Friesen J.D. Tsui L.C. Heng H.H. Woolford J.L., Jr. Hu J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing with an automated DNA sequencing system (Li-Cor Model 4000L) confirmed the final constructs. E. coliBL21(DE3) cells harboring pET28a carrying HPRP4,HPRP3, or its mutants were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 0.4% glucose. When the culture reached A 600 ∼ 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 7 h at room temperature to induce the target proteins. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.04 volume of the original culture of sonication buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5). The cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 8000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant (cell lysate) was used for immunoprecipitation assays and for further affinity purification of the His-tagged proteins. The relative content of induced protein was examined by 8% SDS-PAGE. The Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) was used to determine the total protein content in the soluble fraction. The cell lysates (4 ml) were mixed with 1 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (QIAGEN Inc.) previously equilibrated with sonication buffer and gently stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed stepwise with 20 bead volumes of sonication buffer (five times), sonication buffer with 10 mm imidazole (twice), and sonication buffer with 20 mm imidazole (twice). The His-tagged fusion proteins were eluted with 4 bead volumes of elution buffer (100 mmpotassium phosphate, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 500 mm imidazole, pH 6.0). The eluted proteins were extensively dialyzed against dialysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 500 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 6.0) and concentrated with Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filters (10K nominal molecular weight limit, Millipore Corp.). These proteins, purified to >90% homogeneity, were used for immunoprecipitation assays and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC). Fifty μl (2 μg/μl total protein) of Hprp3p or Hprp4p soluble cell lysates alone (for negative controls) or Hprp4p and HA-Hprp3p soluble cell lysates together were incubated with rabbit preimmune serum (negative controls) or antiserum (against either Hprp3p or Hprp4p) in 500 μl of buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate, 500 mm KCl, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. For the experiment shown in Fig. 1 C, buffer A contained 150, 250, or 500 mmKCl. Ten μl of preimmune serum or antiserum and 10 μl of protein A- or protein G-agarose beads were used in each experiment. After the incubation, the complex was washed five times with 1 ml of buffer A and twice with 1 ml of buffer B (100 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5). The bound proteins were resolved by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Similar experiments were performed using purified Hprp4p and HA-Hprp3p or HA-Hprp3p mutants (10 μg of protein). Immunoprecipitation assays were also carried out using purified proteins (10 μg) and HeLa nuclear extracts (150 μg of total protein). In this experiment, the HA-Hprp3p constructs were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts, and the mixture was then added to protein G-agarose beads pre-bound with anti-HA antibody. Hprp4p was detected in the pulled-down complexes by Western blotting. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells transiently transfected with HA-Hprp3p mutants were also used for immunoprecipitation experiments in a similar way. Rabbit antisera against Hprp3p or Hprp4p were generated in our animal facility. The mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from BABCO. The ITC data were generated using a Microcal VP-ITC instrument at 25 °C. All solutions were carefully degassed before titration. Each titration experiment consisted of 28 injections of 10 μl of Hprp3p (20 μm) or Hprp3p mutant (50 μm) into a cell containing 1.8 ml of 16 μm Hprp4p. Titrations were conducted in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 500 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. Phosphate buffer was chosen by virtue of its small ionization enthalpy change. To correct for dilution and mixing effects, a series of control injections was carried out in which the heat of dilution was measured in blank titrations by injecting the protein into the buffer and then subtracted from the binding heat. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells for immunostaining were seeded in six-well plates with glass coverslips and transfected at 40–60% confluency with 1 μg of DNA and 12 μg of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for each well under serum-free conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells for nuclear extract preparation were seeded in 10-cm dishes and transfected at 40–60% confluency with 6 μg of DNA and 72 μg of LipofectAMINE for each dish under serum-free conditions. Immunostaining was performed at room temperature 24 h post-transfection. The transfected cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 20 min with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. The plasma membrane was permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were incubated in blocking solution (0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h and then with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody in blocking solution for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibody (Invitrogen). Following three washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescence micrographs were recorded using a 100× objective. All micrographs are representative of experiments repeated at least three times. The HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (34Blencowe B.J. Lamond A.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 275-287PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kramer A. Keller W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HeLa cells in suspension culture were harvested in early mid-log phase, and the pellet were washed with 5× packed cell volume and resuspended in 2× packed cell volume of buffer C (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.9). The cells were lysed by 30 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer (A-type pestle). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer D (20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mKCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9). The nuclei were lysed by 30 strokes with a B-type pestle. The resulting lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation and then centrifuged at 25,100 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 3 liters (1 liter × 3 changes) of dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) for 3.5 h. The nuclear extracts from HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA-HA-HPRP3 or its deletion mutants were prepared in a similar manner. The nuclear extracts were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The presence of U4 and U6 snRNAs in immunocomplexes precipitated with anti-HA antibodies was determined by primer extension. RNA extractions from immunocomplexes and primer extension were performed as described (31Wang A. Forman-Kay J. Luo Y. Luo M. Chow Y.H. Plumb J. Friesen J.D. Tsui L.C. Heng H.H. Woolford J.L., Jr. Hu J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Hu J., Xu, D. Schappert K., Xu, Y. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two primers (U4-82, 5′-ggtattgggaaaagttttcaattag-3′; and U6-91, 5′-tcacgaatttgcgtgtcatcctggc-3′) that yield extension products specific to human U4 (82 nucleotides) and U6 (91 nucleotides) snRNAs, respectively, were used in the experiment. Primers were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). To anneal the end-labeled primers to their target snRNAs, the U4 and U6 primers (∼5 pmol each or ∼15,000 cpm) were added, individually or together as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5 C, to RNA samples in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 25 mm KCl. The mixtures were incubated at 90 °C for 2 min and then slowly cooled to 30 °C. Extension reactions (20 μl) were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm each dNTP plus 1 unit of OmniScript reverse transcriptase (QIAGEN Inc.). The extended products were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer (85% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). They were then resolved on 5% acrylamide gels containing 8 m urea and Tris borate/EDTA, and their migration positions were visualized by autoradiography. For primer extension controls, total nuclear RNAs (0.1 μg) from HeLa cells were used. Hprp3p and Hprp4p are known to be present in the same U4/U6 snRNP particle (28Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1374-1387PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lauber J. Plessel G. Prehn S. Will C.L. Fabrizio P. Groning K. Lane W.S. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1997; 3: 926-941PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang A.

However, their role in U4/U6 snRNP assembly and the nature of their interaction are not clear. Because the splicing machinery is absent in bacterial cells, we first studied the interaction of Hprp3p and Hprp4p using soluble cell lysates of E. coli cells expressing these proteins. The cDNAs encoding Hprp3p and Hprp4p were cloned into pET28a and expressed inE. coli. The expression conditions were optimized for the yield of soluble proteins. More than 60% of Hprp3p and Hprp4p are soluble when cells are induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 6–8 h. After cell lysis under native conditions (see “Materials and Methods”), the soluble cell lysates containing Hprp3p or Hprp4p were used for co-immunoprecipitation analysis with polyclonal antibodies against Hprp3p or Hprp4p in buffer containing 150 mm KCl. As shown in Fig.1 A, Hprp3p was detected in the complex immunoprecipitated with anti-Hprp4p antibodies (lane 1), but was not present in the sample immunoprecipitated with preimmune sera (lane 4). As expected, anti-Hprp4p antibodies failed to pull-down Hprp3p in the absence of Hprp4p (Fig.1 A, lane 2), indicating that there is no cross-reaction with Hprp3p and antibodies against Hprp4p. Likewise, anti-HA antibodies did not recognize Hprp4p (Fig. 1 A,lane 3), suggesting there is no cross-reaction between Hprp4p and the anti-HA antibodies used in this experiment. Reciprocal experiments using anti-Hprp3p antibodies to precipitate the complex and anti-Hprp4p antibodies to detect the presence of Hprp4p yielded the same conclusion, i.e. Hprp3p and Hprp4p are present in the same protein complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Hprp3p and Hprp4p together with the 20-kDa cyclophilin H can be purified from HeLa cells as a heterotrimer protein complex in the presence of >500 mm NaCl (28Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1374-1387PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the Hprp3p-Hprp4p complex formed in bacterial cell lysates can withstand similar conditions, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with increasing salt concentrations (up to 500 mm KCl). As shown in Fig. 1 C (lanes 1–3), the Hprp3p-Hprp4p complex was not disrupted even at 500 mm KCl. These results support the notion that Hprp3p and Hprp4p interact with each other. However, because these experiments were performed with soluble cell lysates, the possibility of a third partner in the system nonspecifically mediating the interaction of the two proteins cannot be discarded. For example, the interaction may proceed through another protein or even RNA that contacts both Hprp3p and Hprp4p. To exclude this possibility, His-tagged HA-Hprp3p and Hprp4p were produced and purified to >90% homogeneity using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Supplemental Fig. 1). Equal amounts of the two highly purified proteins were incubated and added to protein A-agarose beads pre-absorbed with antisera against Hprp4p. The presence of Hprp3p in the complex precipitated by antisera against Hprp4p was confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the HA tag of Hprp3p (Fig. 2 A, upper panel, lane 5). Because highly purified proteins were used in this experiment, it is unlikely that molecules in E. coli cell lysates would play a role in mediating the Hprp3p/Hprp4p interaction. Currently, the domain structure and function of Hprp3p are virtually unknown. Because we demonstrated above that Hprp4p is likely to interact with Hprp3p, the first step toward unraveling Hprp3p domain structure and function is to determine the regions responsible for such an interaction. Therefore, we generated four HA-tagged Hprp3p deletion mutants (Hprp3p mutants I–IV) (Fig. 2 B). Each mutant was cloned into pET28a for the expression of His-tagged HA-Hprp3p in E. coli. As with the wild-type protein, each purified Hprp3p mutant was incubated with purified Hprp4p, and the complex was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Hprp4p antibodies. Similar to full-length Hprp3p, mutants II and III formed a complex with Hprp4p (Fig. 2 A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), but mutants I and IV did not (lanes 1 and 4, respectively). This result indicates the formation of an Hprp3p-Hprp4p complex, in particular through the central region of Hprp3p, and suggests that neither the N- nor C-terminal region of Hprp3p is necessary for the interaction. ITC is an increasingly used technique for the detection of macromolecular interactions. It enables unmodified native forms of proteins to be characterized in solution phase (37Pierce M.M. Raman C.S. Nall B.T. Methods. 1999; 19: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 38Holdgate G.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 164-168PubMed Google Scholar). The ITC experiment usually consists of injections of one binding partner into the other, with both solutions contained in exactly the same buffer. The instrument measures the amount of energy as heat required to maintain a constant temperature with respect to a reference cell. As the binding sites are saturated, each injection peak becomes smaller until the heat reflects only the dilution of the titrant molecule. This feedback power is the base-line level in the absence of any reaction, which is provided in an independent experiment with only buffer in the cells. In this experiment, the interactions of Hprp3p and its mutants with Hprp4p were measured by ITC. Before analyzing these interactions, blank titrations of the titrators (i.e. Hprp3p and its mutants as well as Hprp4p) into a buffer were performed (see “Materials and Methods”). Surprisingly, a large endothermic enthalpy signal was observed in the blank titration of Hprp3p (9 mg/ml) (Supplemental Fig. 2). The enthalpy signal dropped as the Hprp3p concentration increased in the buffer, thus suggesting a possible dissociation reaction of oligomeric assemblies of Hprp3p in the syringe. The enthalpy signal was dependent on the concentration of Hprp3p. When a lower concentration of Hprp3p (1.8 mg/ml) was titrated into the buffer, the heat of dilution was negligible (Supplemental Fig. 2), further supporti"
https://openalex.org/W1981541499,"The generation of antibodies directed toward the surface-exposed regions of a protein using synthetic peptides as immunogens representing surface loops and turns has been widely successful. However, peptides representing α-helical regions are typically unstructured in solution and unable to produce antibodies that recognize α-helices in native proteins. We describe a <i>de novo</i> designed parallel two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil template for immunization to prepare antibodies that recognize α-helical protein sequences in the native protein. This template was designed for maximum stability through an Ile/Leu hydrophobic core and an interchain disulfide bridge. Surface-exposed helical residues are inserted into the template and used for immunization to generate polyclonal antibodies. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, 15 residues of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 were inserted into this template, and the resultant antibodies were screened for conformational specificity. Peptide antigens that contain the same surface-exposed residues but differ in structure were used as competitors in a competition assay. Direct competition between the capture peptide immobilized on a biosensor chip, the peptide antigens, and the antibodies generated by the template demonstrated that the antibodies were specific for helical structure in the native coiled-coil (synthetic GCN4 residues 250–280). These antibodies were unable to recognize the same inserted sequence in an unstructured analog. The helix-specific antibodies were also able to identify native GCN4 (31.3 kDa) from yeast whole cell extracts."

For example, NO exchange between Hb and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) has been reported in vitro. Here we examine the reaction between GSNO and deoxyHb (HbFeII) in the presence of both Cu(I) (2,9-dimethyl-1, 10-phenanthroline (neocuproine)) and Cu(II) (diethylenetriamine-N,N,N′,N“,N”-pentaacetic acid) chelators using a copper-depleted Hb solution. Spectroscopic analysis of deoxyHb (HbFeII)/GSNO incubates shows prompt formation (<5 min) of ∼100% heme-nitrosylated Hb (HbFeIINO) in the absence of chelators, 46% in the presence of diethylenetriamine-N,N,N′,N“,N”-pentaacetic acid, and 25% in the presence of neocuproine. Negligible (<2%) HbFeIINO was detected when neocuproine was added to copper-depleted HbFeII/GSNO incubates. Thus, HbFeIINO formation via a mechanism involvingfree NO generated by Cu(I) catalysis of GSNO breakdown is proposed. GSH is a source of reducing equivalents because extensive GSSG was detected in HbFeII/GSNO incubates in the absence of metal chelators. No S-nitrosation of HbFeII was detected under any conditions. In contrast, the NO released from GSNO is directed to Cysβ93 of oxyHb in the absence of chelators, but only metHb formation is observed in the presence of chelators.

Frolich J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 422-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For Hb to function as a blood pressure regulator in an O2-sensitive manner, release of NO from Cysβ93 of HbFeII is necessary (7Pezacki J.P. Ship N.J. Kluger R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4615-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One possibility is that NO is delivered to tissues via S-nitrosation from Cysβ93 to GSH or another thiol (8Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) that promotes NO transport across the RBC.HbSNO+RSH⇌HbSH+RSNOREACTION1Recently it has been suggested that delivery to tissues of all of the NO bound to Cysβ93 of Hb would result in extensive vasodilation, which would be fatal (9McMahon T.J. Stamler J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, it was proposed that most of the NO released from Cysβ93 is actually captured by HbFeII. Capture of NO released from GSNO is also possible and would compete with the exit of NO from the RBC. In fact, Spencer et al. (10Spencer N.Y. Zeng H. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36562-36567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported direct reductive cleavage of GSNO by HbFeII and capture of the released NO by another FeII center (Hb′FeII).HbFeII+GSNO+H+⇌HbFeIII+GSH+NOHb′FeII+NO⇌Hb′FeIINOREACTIONS2AND3A trace amount of Cu(I) serves as a highly efficient catalyst ofS-nitrosothiol breakdown (11Williams D.L.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 869-876Crossref Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We have suggested that neocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelator, inhibits NO release from GSNO in solutions of HbFeIIO2 (4Romeo A.A. Filosa A. Capobianco J.A. English A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1782-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered it likely that neocuproine would also inhibit NO release from GSNO in solutions containing HbFeII. To distinguish between direct reductive cleavage of GSNO by HbFeII(Reaction 2) and Cu(I)-catalyzed release (Reaction 4), it is necessary to remove all trace copper or prevent its turnover via redox cycling using GSH (Reaction 5) or another donor in the Hb-containing solutions.Cu(I)+GSNO+H+⇌Cu(II)+GSH+NOCu(II)+GSH⇌Cu(I)+½GSSG+H+REACTIONS4AND5Here we report the results of a detailed examination of HbFeII/GSNO incubates after 5 min in the presence of preferential chelators of Cu(I) (neocuproine) and Cu(II) (DTPA). Solutions of HbFeII that were not dialyzed and solutions that underwent exhaustive dialysis versus EDTA were used. Our direct spectroscopic and ESI-MS analyses reveal that NO release from GSNO is <2% in the presence of neocuproine in HbFeII/GSNO solutions containing dialyzed Hb. HbFeIINO formation, and hence GSNO breakdown, is ∼100% within 5 min in the absence of chelators. HbFeIINO formation is decreased by ∼50–75% in the presence of DTPA and neocuproine and in solutions containing dialyzed Hb without neocuproine. Because trace copper was found in all reagents by ICP-MS, these observations are consistent with Cu(I)-catalyzed release of NO (Reaction 4).The source of the reducing equivalents for the prompt Cu(I)-catalyzed reductive cleavage of GSNO is also of interest. Extensive GSSG was formed in HbFeII/GSNO incubates in the absence of metal chelators, indicating that GSH is the main source of reducing equivalents under these conditions (Reaction 5). We detected less GSSG than expected by ESI-MS in HbFeII/GSNO incubates containing DTPA, although we observed ∼50% GSNO breakdown. This suggested HbFeII as a possible additional source of reducing equivalents to [Cu(II)(DTPA)]2− because related EDTA complexes were shown to be redox-active with Hb (12Mauk A.G. Gray H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Careful examination of the absorption (optical and FTIR) spectra revealed the presence of HbFeIII. Thus, our results indicate that the direct reduction of GSNO by HbFeII is unlikely to play a role in NO transport in RBCs. Nonetheless, HbFeII may indirectly provide a source of electrons for the reductive cleavage of GSNO or other S-nitrosothiols in vivo.The realization that commonly used Cu(I) (neocuproine) and Cu(II) chelators (EDTA and DTPA) may not always prevent copper turnover is an important consideration in deciphering mechanisms ofS-nitrosothiol signaling and NO biochemistry in general. Although neocuproine, a tight binding Cu(I) chelator (K d = 1.2 × 10−19m2) (13Lei Y. Anson F.C. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1083-1089Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14James, B. R., and Williams, R. J. P. (1961)J. Chem. Soc. 2007–2019Google Scholar), is a better inhibitor than DTPA of GSNO breakdown (Reaction 4) in Hb-containing solutions, dialysis of the Hb samples and neocuproine addition were necessary to obtain negligible GSNO breakdown.Finally, the prompt changes in HbFeIIO2 on incubation with GSNO are compared with those observed for the HbFeII incubates. The key results of this comparison are that in the absence of chelators, S-nitrosation of Cysβ93 of the oxy protein is extensive, and this competes with NO capture by the FeIIO2 heme to form HbFeIII and NO3−. In contrast, no S-nitrosation of the deoxy protein is detected, suggesting that all of the NO released from GSNO is captured by the FeII heme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman hemoglobin A was obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. Nanopure water (specific resistance, 18mΩ-cm) obtained from a Millipore Simplicity water purification system and treated with Chelex-100 (Sigma) to remove trace metal ions was used to prepare all H2O solutions. The reactions were carried out in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (NaPi), prepared from sodium phosphate salts (Fisher) in nanopure H2O. Stock solutions of 15 mmdiethylenetriamine-N,N,N′,N“,N”-pentaacetic acid (DTPA; ICN) and 650 μm2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (neocuproine; Sigma) were prepared in NaPi. Stock solutions of 250 mm GSNO (Cayman) in NaPi were prepared just before use in a glove bag (Aldrich) under nitrogen, and the GSNO concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (ε333.5 nm = 774 m−1cm−1) (15Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Minetti M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). GSH and GSSG were obtained from Sigma, and N2 and NO gases were from Praxair. NO was purged into a 10% KOH water solution before use (16Sheu F.S. Zhu W. Fung P.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1216-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).MethodsPreparation and Optical Spectroscopy of Hb SamplesTypically 1 g of lyophilized metHb (HbFeIII) from the bottle was dissolved in 2 ml of NaPi. After 2 min of centrifugation at 12,000 rpm, the precipitate was discarded, and the dark red solution of HbFeIII was stored at 4 °C prior to use. An aliquot (10 μl) of the Hb solution was pipetted onto a 13-mm CaF2 window of a dismountable FTIR type cell (Harrick). The cell was immediately assembled using a 6-μm Teflon spacer (Harrick) and placed in a custom-made bracket in a Beckman DU 650 UV-visible spectrophotometer. HbFeIIIconcentrations were found to be 32 mm in heme assuming ε500 nm = 10 mm−1cm−1/heme and ε630 nm = 4.4 mm−1 cm−1/heme (17Antonini E. Wyman J. Brunori M. Taylor F.J. Rossi Farinelli A. Caputo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 907-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Van Assendelft O.W. Zijlstra W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 69: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by diluting the samples 103-fold, adding potassium ferricyanide and excess KCN (BDH chemicals), and reading the absorbance of the CN− adduct at 540 nm (ε540 nm = 11.0 mm−1cm−1/heme) in a 1-cm cuvette on a Beckman spectrophotometer.HbFeII was prepared in the glove bag under N2by treating HbFeIII with equimolar sodium dithionite (Fisher) (19Iorio E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) followed by desalting on a 1.6 × 2.5-cm HiTrap Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences), and the HbFeIIconcentration was calculated using ε555 nm = 12.5 mm−1 cm−1/heme (20Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands: Frontiers of Biology. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971: 19-21Google Scholar). HbFeIIO2 was prepared from HbFeIIby introducing a small volume of air into the sample using a syringe; for example, 720 μl of air was added to 200 μl of a 32 mm heme sample. A single addition of O2 in slight excess (8.5 μmol of O2/8 μmol of heme) yielded fully oxygenated Hb as indicated by the Soret spectrum recorded following a 5-min equilibration. HbFeIINO and HbFeIIINO were prepared from HbFeII and HbFeIII on exposure to NO gas. The optical spectra were recorded using a scan time of 1200 nm/min. Use of the FTIR type cell to record the optical spectra of the products formed in the HbFeII/GSNO incubates allowed measurements to be made at close to physiological concentrations of Hb (2–4 mm) (21Williams W.J. Beantler E. Erslev A.J. Rundles R.W. Hematology. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1972: 11Google Scholar).Preparation of Dialyzed Hb SamplesApproximately 500 mg of HbFeIII was dissolved in 5 ml of 100 mmNa2EDTA (Sigma), pH 7.0, and allowed to stand for 30 min. This solution was dialyzed at 4 °C versus 500 ml of 10 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.0, which was replaced with fresh solution six times in 24 h. The dialysis was continuedversus EDTA-free H2O, which was replaced with fresh solution 12 times in 48 h. After dialysis, HbFeIII was lyophilized and dissolved in NaPi to a concentration of 30 mm heme.ICP-MS AnalysisA PE Sciex Elan 6000 ICP-MS with a cross-flow nebulizer and a Scott type spray chamber was used to determine the amount of copper in the Hb and GSNO samples and in the buffers (see Table I). The RF power was 1000 W, and the argon flow was 0.85 liter/min, which gave the best sensitivity as determined by the recommended optimization procedure. The optimum lens voltage was determined by maximizing rhodium sensitivity, and the data were acquired in the pulse count mode (22Abbyad P. Tromp J. Lam J. Salin E. J. Anal. At. Spectrom. 2001; 16: 464-469Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Stock Hb solutions in NaPi were added to 50 μl of 30% H2O2 (ACP Chemicals, Inc.) and 500 μl of concentrated HNO3(OmniTrace Ultra high purity, EM Science) to give a final heme (iron) concentration of 4.3 mm, and the samples were ashed using a Bunsen burner. The residue was dissolved in 10 ml of 5% (v/v) HNO3, and ICP-MS analyses for copper and iron were performed. An internal standard of 9 nm (0.500 ppb) manganese prepared from a 1000 ppm manganese standard solution (ACP Chemicals, Inc.) was added to all of the solutions. The standard curves were prepared by diluting 1000 ppm copper and iron standard solutions (ACP Chemicals, Inc.) in 5% (v/v) HNO3 and nanopure water to give 0–8 μm (0–0.500 ppm) copper and 0–9 μm (0–0.500 ppm) iron. All of the reported ICP-MS data are the results of at least triplicate experiments, and in all cases the standard deviations were <5%.Table IICP-MS analysis of copper in stock solutionsSample1-aAll stock solutions were prepared in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2Copper μm ppm5 mmHb1-bHuman Hb (Sigma) from the bottle. 5 mm Hb contains 20 mm heme.19 ± 31.207 ± 0.1915 mm dialyzed Hb1-cHuman Hb following dialysisversus EDTA (see “Experimental Procedures”).2.0 ± 0.70.127 ± 0.045250 mm GSNO1.2 ± 0.80.076 ± 0.050250 mm GSH1.0 ± 0.60.063 ± 0.038250 mm GSSG1.1 ± 0.70.070 ± 0.04415 mm DTPA0.7 ± 0.30.044 ± 0.019650 μm neocuproine1.6 ± 0.50.102 ± 0.032200 mm NaPi buffer0.9 ± 0.70.057 ± 0.0441-a All stock solutions were prepared in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.21-b Human Hb (Sigma) from the bottle. 5 mm Hb contains 20 mm heme.1-c Human Hb following dialysisversus EDTA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab FTIR AnalysisApproximately 20 μl of Hb (28 mm heme) in NaPi was added by syringe onto a 13-mm CaF2 window in the glove bag under N2 where necessary. The FTIR cell was immediately assembled with a 250-μm Teflon spacer (Harrick), and the spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Nicolet Magna-IR 550 spectrometer with a MCT detector cooled to 77 K and purged with dry air from a Whatman FTIR Purge (model 75-52). All of the reported spectra are averages of 500 scans recorded in 5.52 min at a resolution of 2 cm−1 using a Happ-Genzel apodization with a velocity and aperture of 4.4303 cm/s and 2, respectively. Omnic (Nicolet) software was used for subtraction, base-line correction, smoothing, and Fourier transform self-deconvolution employing a half-width-at-half-height of 0.6 cm−1 and an enhancement (K factor) of 1. Subtraction of water vapor absorption from the spectra was performed by the method of Dong et al. (23Dong A.C. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar).ESI-MS AnalysisStock Hb solutions (28 mm heme) in NaPi were diluted 10−3-fold with H2O to give ∼0.5 μg/μl protein. The aliquots were infused into the ESI source of the mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan SSQ 7000) by flow injection from the high performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1090) using a 100-μl loop (but no column) at 50 μl/min with 75% CH3CN (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) as a mobile phase. Stock (250 mm) GSH, GSNO, and GSSG solutions in 200 mm NaPi, pH 7.2, were diluted 500-fold with H2O and 10-fold to 50 μm with 75% CH3CN (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid), and their mass spectra were obtained as for the Hb solutions.Multi-component Analysis of the Optical Spectra of IncubatesThe absorbance at a given wavelength is the sum of the absorbances (A) of all species at that wavelength:A = A x +A y + A z + … = εx b [X] + εy b [Y] + εz b [Z] + … , where εx is the molar extinction of X at the selected wavelength, b is the pathlength (6 μm), and [X] is the molar concentration of X. Assuming a limited number of oxidation and coordination states for iron of Hb, the spectra recorded for the incubates were mathematically disassembled into those of their components. Absorbances at the Soret maxima of the Hb species were used to generate n Beer's law expressions, from which the concentrations ([X], [Y], [Z], etc.) of the nspecies present in the incubates were obtained. Solutions to then equations with n unknowns were obtained using a program at www.1728.com/indexalg.htm. For the HbFeII/GSNO incubates, absorbances were recorded at the Soret maxima of the expected heme species HbFeIII, HbFeIIINO, HbFeIINO, and HbFeII. The millimolar extinction coefficients (ε in mm−1 cm−1) and wavelengths (nm; in parentheses) used are the following: 169 (405), 110 (416), 97 (418), 50 (430) for HbFeIII; 95.5 (405), 129 (416), 130 (418), 95 (430) for HbFeIINO; 113 (405), 137 (416), 136 (418), and 64 (430) for HbFeIIINO and 62 (405), 92 (416), 99 (418), and 133 (430) for HbFeII. The corresponding values for the expected iron states in the HbFeIIO2/GSNO incubates are: 169 (405) and 116 (415) for HbFeIII and 102 (405) and 125 (415) for HbFeIIO2. The spectra of the components and mixtures were graphed using Origin 6.0 software (Microcal).DISCUSSIONSpencer et al. (10Spencer N.Y. Zeng H. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36562-36567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have reported that HbFeII can directly reduce GSNO and that the released NO is captured by additional FeII heme. Because the release of NO from GSNO is known to be Cu(I)-catalyzed (32Noble D.R. Williams D.L. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we monitored HbFeII/GSNO incubates by optical and FTIR spectroscopies to probe changes occurring at the heme and Cysβ93 centers, respectively. In addition, the incubates were analyzed by ESI-MS to examine changes in the mass of the protein and to determine the low molecular weight species produced.The optical spectra shown in Fig. 1 clearly reveal that trace Cu(I) is required for the release of NO from GSNO (Reaction 4). Essentially no HbFeIINO is formed in the HbFeII/GSNO incubate containing both copper-depleted Hb (i.e. dialyzed Hb in Table I) and neocuproine. The combined data in Tables I and II indicate that total inhibition of Cu(I) catalysis of GSNO breakdown requires removal of most of the copper as well as neocuproine addition to Hb-containing solutions. Thus, the results summarized in Table II are not consistent with direct reduction of GSNO by HbFeII (10Spencer N.Y. Zeng H. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36562-36567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Reaction 2) when equimolar heme and GSNO are present. Given the rapid (<5 min) Cu(I)-catalyzed release of NO from GSNO (Fig. 1 b), it is likely that copper-catalyzed reductive cleavage of GSNO also occurs in vivo.The next question that arises is, of course, what is the source of reducing equivalents to regenerate Cu(I) following electron transfer to GSNO to release NO (Reaction 4)? Possible electron donors to Cu(II) are GSH (Reaction 5) and HbFeII. With GSH as a donor, two molecules of NO would be released or two heme FeIINO adducts would be formed per molecule of GSSG produced. The mass spectrum reveals extensive formation of GSSG in the HbFeII/GSNO incubates in the absence of chelators (Fig.6 b). Although a peak corresponding to its Na+adduct occurs at m/z 635, the expected GSSG peak at m/z 613 is not clearly evident in HbFeII/GSNO incubates containing DTPA. Nonetheless, GSNO does release NO, as evidenced by the loss of GSNO peak intensity relative to the base peak at m/z 638 (Fig. 6,c versus d) and the formation of HbFeIINO (Fig. 1 c and Table II). Thus, reduction of [Cu(II)(DTPA)]2− by HbFeII was considered, which would account for the HbFeIII absorbance seen in Fig. 2 a. From Table II, 7.13 mm NO is released (6.97 mm HbFeIINO and 0.16 mm HbFeIIINO) from the 15 mm GSNO present in the HbFeII/GSNO/DTPA incubate. If all of the reducing equivalents were to come from GSH oxidation (Reaction 5), then 3.56 mm GSSG should be produced. However, HbFeII oxidation provides 1.44 milliequivalents of reductant (1.28 mm HbFeIII and 0.16 mm HbFeIIINO), which would decrease the concentration of GSSG produced to 2.84 mm. This is approximately one-third of the GSSG produced in HbFeII/GSNO incubates where a strong GSSG peak is observed atm/z 613. The lower than expected intensity of the GSSG (m/z 613) peak in Fig. 6 c is attributed to ion suppression. The production of HbFeIII in the HbFeII incubates in the presence but not the absence of DTPA (Table II) suggested that [Cu(II)(DTPA)]2− may accept an electron from HbFeII, which was confirmed. The addition of authentic [Cu(II)(DTPA)]2− to HbFeII led to oxidation of 21% of the heme (Fig. 7). Electron transfer between [Fe(II)(EDTA)]2− and HbFeIII has been reported previously (12Mauk A.G. Gray H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).No loss of ν(SH) intensity was detected by FTIR when HbFeII was treated with GSNO with or without metal chelators (Fig. 4 a). This is consistent with the proposal that the allosteric transition of Hb controls Cysβ93 S-nitrosation (33Stamler J.S. Jia L., Eu, J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The FTIR results also show that Cu(I) is required for HbFeIINO formation because neocuproine inhibited blue shifting of the Cysβ93 ν(SH) peak (Fig.4 a, spectra 2 and 3) that accompanies heme nitrosylation (29Sampath V. Zhao X.J. Caughey W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reactions in the HbFeII/GSNO incubates reported here are shown in Schemefs1. Clearly the oxidation of HbFeII by [Cu(II)(DTPA)]2+ is unlikely to be of importance in vivo, but the requirement of copper for NO release from GSNO shown in Scheme FS1 could well have physiological relevance.The key result that copper is also required forS-nitrosation of Cysβ93 of HbFeIIO2 (4Romeo A.A. Filosa A. Capobianco J.A. English A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1782-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) can be deduced from Figs.4 b and 5 b. S-Nitrosation of Cysβ93 is observed only in the absence of metal chelators (Fig. 4 b, spectrum 1, and Fig. 5 b). Thus, we propose Scheme FS2 for the reactions of NO with HbFeIIO2. NO is targeted to Cysβ93 in the absence of chelators, but in the presence of DTPA, all of the NO released from GSNO is targeted to the FeIIO2 heme (Figs. 3 and 4 b) and converted to NO3− (Reaction 6). SchemeFS2 predicts that efficient Cu(II)–catalyzed S-nitrosation of Cysβ93 will preserve the biological activity of NO by preventing its conversion to nonvasoactive NO3−. The capture of NO by HbFeII (Scheme FS1) should not lead to loss of its vasoactive power as long as FeII-NO adduct formation is reversible on a physiologically relevant time scale. It has been proposed that the FeII heme centers of partially oxygenated Hb, as found in the RBC (1Gross S.S. Lane P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9967-9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), have a much lower affinity for NO than fully deoxygenated HbFeII (9McMahon T.J. Stamler J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, copper control of NO reactivity with Hb, plus weaker binding of NO to HbFeII in vivo thanin vitro, could explain why RBC Hb does not act a sink for most of the NO produced in the vascular system. A possible copper catalyst in vivo is copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, which is abundant in the RBC (34Gartner A. Weser U. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is of interest to compare the extent of the prompt changes in HbFeII and HbFeIIO2 on incubation with GSNO. When 15 mm GSNO is incubated with 15 mm (heme) HbFeII in the absence of metal chelators, 99% is converted to HbFeIINO within 5 min, whereas only 46% of HbFeIIO2 is converted to HbFeIII under the same conditions. This is easy to understand when we consider that ∼7.5 mm NO released from GSNO was targeted to Cysβ93 in HbFeIIO2 but not in HbFeII (Figs. 4and 5). In the DTPA incubates 44% HbFeII versus77% HbFeIIO2 remain, and in neocuproine incubates 75% HbFeII versus 88% HbFeIIO2 remain after the same 5-min period. Clearly, the increased stability of the Hb reactants in the presence of metal chelators is due to inhibition of GSNO breakdown, but the lower consumption of HbFeIIO2 relative to HbFeII cannot be attributed to NO trapping by Cysβ93 in the former because this does not occur in the presence of chelators (Fig. 4 b). More efficient NO trapping by HbFeII (35Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9027-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) than by HbFeIIO2(k = 3–5 × 107m−1 s−1 for Reaction 6) (36Eich R.F., Li, T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R. Aitken J.F. Mathews A.J. Johnson K.A. Smith R.D. Phillips G.N., Jr. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6976-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) would give rise to the higher HbFeII consumption in the incubates. Also, the reaction of NO with any free O2 in the HbFeIIO2 incubate would decrease the amount of HbFeIIO2 consumed.In this work we also examined the spectra of the HbFeII/GSNO incubates after 1 h. The results obtained indicate that the prompt products undergo further reaction over longer times. For example, the Soret maximum after 1 h of HbFeII/GSNO incubate still shows a maximum at 418 nm but with decreased intensity (data not shown). Because the spectrum of authentic HbFeIINO in the absence of any glutathione-derived species is stable for >1 h, the HbFeIINO initially formed must react with some reagent in the incubate.2 The Soret maximum of the HbFeII/GSNO/DTPA incubate after 1 h (data not shown) is blue-shifted (409 nm) from that at 5 min (411 nm) (Fig.1 c). We initially attributed this blue shift to increased HbFeIINO formation caused by NO-driven reduction of HbFeIII using reducing equivalents from GSH. However, the addition of GSH to authentic HbFeIIINO also gave rise to a Soret maximum at 411 nm and not the expected HbFeIINO peak at 418 nm. The biological relevance of these slow reactions is questionable because, for example, any HbFeIII formed in the RBC would be rapidly converted to HbFeII by methemoglobin reducta"

We screened solid-phase peptide libraries from human and mouse IFN-γ to identify DnaK-binding sites. Conserved DnaK-binding sites were identified in the N-terminal half of helix B and in the C-terminal half of helix C, both of which are located at the IFN-γ dimer interface. Soluble peptides derived from helices B and C bound DnaK with high affinity in competition assays. No DnaK-binding sites were found in the loops connecting the α-helices. The helix C DnaK-binding site appears to be conserved in most members of the superfamily of interleukin (IL)-10-related cytokines that comprises, apart from IL-10 and IFN-γ, a series of recently discovered small secretory proteins, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22/IL-TIF, IL-24/MDA-7 (melanomadifferentiation-associated gene), IL-26/AK155, and a number of viral IL-10 homologs. These cytokines belong to a relatively small group of homodimeric proteins with highly interdigitated interfaces that exhibit the strongly hydrophobic character of the interior core of a single-chain folded domain. We propose that binding of DnaK to helix C in the superfamily of IL-10-related cytokines may constitute the hallmark of a novel conserved regulatory mechanism in which HSP70-like chaperones assist in the formation of a hydrophobic dimeric “folding” interface. HSP70 chaperones mediate protein folding by ATP-dependent interaction with short linear peptide segments that are exposed on unfolded proteins.

It displays a number of immunoregulatory activities such as activation of macrophages and clonal expansion of CD4+ Th1 lymphocytes, together resulting in a Th1-biased immune response (1Billiau A. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 61-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ exerts these activities through interaction with and aggregation of a cellular high-affinity receptor consisting of IFN-γ receptor-α and receptor-β chains (2Marsters S.A. Pennica D. Bach E.

These studies revealed α-helical homodimers, the domains of which consist of six tightly packed α-helices connected by relatively short turns with no β-structure. Four of these helices are donated by one peptide chain and two from the second chain, together constituting a highly intertwined homodimer that is reminiscent of domain swapping (6Sprang S.R.

In particular, the segment helix B-loop II-helix C from one monomer interlocks with extensive interdigitation with the helix E-loop V-helix F segment of the other monomer (4Ealick S.E. Cook W.J.

A. 1998; 95: 14142-14146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Taken together, these structural features classify IFN-γ into a small group of homodimeric proteins with hydrophobic, so-called “folding” interfaces, which are presumed to adopt their structure in one step, i.e. both chains fold directly into the dimer (10Larsen T.A. Olson A.J. Goodsell D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 421-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the de novo folding of IFN-γ into this complex intertwined homodimer structure is a spontaneous process, rather than being strictly dependent on the assistance of chaperones. Circumstantial observations provide support for an assisted process. First, IFN-γ is structurally unstable in that it displays a well documented tendency to aggregate upon exposure to low pH or elevated temperatures (11Arakawa T. Hsu Y.-R. Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Mulkerrin M.G. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In vitro aggregation of IFN-γ is an irreversible process that follows first-order kinetics and is thought to occur through a partially folded intermediate structure (12Mulkerrin M.G. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or via a transiently expanded native species (9Kendrick B.S. Carpenter J.F. Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14142-14146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Kendrick B.S. Cleland J.L. Lam X. Nguyen T. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is likely that such aggregation-prone conformers occur also during folding in vivo, thus inferring the need for a biological mechanism for facilitating correct folding and for limiting aggregation. Second, when expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein forms inclusion bodies from which bioactive protein can be refolded at the expense of competing irreversible aggregation (14Arakawa T. Alton N.K. Hsu Y.-R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14435-14439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vandenbroeck K. Martens E. D'André S. Billiau A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vitrorefolding conditions that resemble the physicochemical environment of the natural folding environment of IFN-γ, i.e. the endoplasmic reticulum, are not permissive for assembly of IFN-γ dimers, but result in aggregation (16Vandenbroeck K. Martens E. Billiau A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, physiological temperatures and high concentrations of folding intermediates of IFN-γ appear to counteract spontaneous dimer formation. Third, support for a role of the endoplasmic reticulum DnaK homolog BiP/GRP78 in the de novo folding of IFN-γ comes from experiments in which IFN-γ-producing Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with a BiP ATPase mutant (T37G) that was previously shown to be able to bind peptide, but to be unable to release it upon binding of ATP (17Wei J.Y. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26677-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, mutant (but not wild-type) BiP formed a stable complex with IFN-γ. In addition, IFN-γ secretion was reduced from cells transfected with T37G BiP. 2K. Vandenbroeck and J. R. Gaut, unpublished data. To unravel the mechanistic basis of how chaperones may assist folding of IFN-γ, we have recently conducted a series of experiments using the E. coli chaperones GroEL/ES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (16Vandenbroeck K. Martens E. Billiau A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Vandenbroeck K. Billiau A. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Both these chaperone systems have been thoroughly characterized, and the determinants of interaction with protein substrates are known. The DnaK chaperone and its HSP70 homologs, including the endoplasmic reticulum variant BiP/GRP78, bind preferentially to stretches of hydrophobic amino acids that are usually buried in the core of completely folded proteins, but exposed on unfolded or partially folded proteins (for review, see Ref. 19Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This interaction prevents “off-pathway” misfolding normally leading to aggregation. Folding resumes after ATP-mediated substrate release from the chaperone, a reaction that is catalyzed by cofactors such as the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. The mechanism of action of GroEL is different in that exposure of domains made up by αβ-folds with extensive hydrophobic surfaces is thought to be the driving force for interaction (20Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We assessed interaction of IFN-γ with both chaperone systems using recombinant IFN-γ samples that were previously denatured by either acid or heat (50 °C). Formation of tertiary structure was scored by a combination of methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antiviral bioassay, and SDS-PAGE. Under nonpermissive conditions for regain of tertiary structure (low ionic strength, 35 °C), the yield of correctly folded dimeric IFN-γ increased ∼30-fold with GroEL/ES and ∼20-fold with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE above the level of spontaneous refolding starting from acid-unfolded protein (16Vandenbroeck K. Martens E. Billiau A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Vandenbroeck K. Billiau A. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition, GroEL/ES was shown to protect IFN-γ against thermal inactivation at 50 °C by binding to and arresting the aggregation of a thermal unfolding intermediate. This suggests that both E. colichaperone systems can assist folding of IFN-γ in much the same way as they do with physiological substrates, i.e. by interacting with aggregation-prone conformers. To further model the interaction between HSP70 chaperones and IFN-γ, we have now screened cellulose-bound peptide libraries derived from human and mouse IFN-γ for identification of DnaK-binding sites. This approach has been used successfully in the identification of DnaK-binding motifs from a variety of proteins (21McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Putative binding sites were confirmed by competition assays using soluble peptides. We report the identification of conserved functional DnaK-binding sites in α-helices B and C of human and mouse IFN-γ. These motifs are located at the dimer interface of IFN-γ. The helix C motif is specifically conserved among members of the superfamily of interleukin (IL)-10-related cytokines. Rüdiger et al.(22Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 23Rüdiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) only rarely found DnaK-binding sites within sequences of dimerization interfaces that adopt helical structures in the native state. Our data therefore indicate that binding of DnaK to the helix C motif may be representative of an uncommon conserved regulatory mechanism in which HSP70-like chaperones mediate formation of the interdigitated hydrophobic folding interface in this class of homodimeric cytokines. Peptide libraries consisting of 44 and 41 13-mer peptides covering the entire mature protein portions of human and mouse IFN-γ, respectively, were prepared by automated spot synthesis (24Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 25Kramer A. Schuster A. Reineke U. Malin R. Volkmer-Engert R. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 388-395Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Peptides were attached through their C termini to a cellulose membrane via a (β-Ala)2 spacer (Jerini Bio Tools GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Analysis of DnaK binding was carried out essentially as described previously (21McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptide membranes were allowed to react with 100 nm DnaK (Stressgen Biotech Corp.) in buffer containing 31 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 170 mm NaCl, 6.4 mm KCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5.0% (w/v) sucrose for 1 h at 25 °C with gentle shaking. Unbound DnaK was removed by washing three times with Tris-buffered saline (31 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 170 mm NaCl, and 6.4 mm KCl) at 4 °C. Electrotransfer of peptide-bound DnaK onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes was performed using a semidry blotter. Cellulose and PVDF membranes were sandwiched between blotting paper soaked in anode buffer (anode buffer I: 30 mm Tris base and 20% MeOH; anode buffer II: 300 mm Tris base and 20% MeOH) and cathode buffer (25 mm Tris base, 40 mm 6-aminohexane acid, and 20% MeOH supplemented with increasing concentrations of SDS). Electrotransfer was performed at a constant power of 0.8 mA/cm2. Cathode buffer was supplemented successively with 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5% SDS. At each cathode buffer change, new PVDF membranes were used. Transferred DnaK was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-DnaK antibody (clone 8E2/2, Stressgen Biotech Corp.) using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cellulose membranes contained three reference peptides (C1, C2, and C3), all of which have previously been shown to constitute good DnaK binders (21McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), i.e. from hemagglutinin (Trp436–Asn448), peptide WTYNAELLVLLEN (indicated as C1); from alkaline phosphatase (Gly382–His394), peptide GNTLVIVTADHAH (indicated as C2); and from ς32(Ser192–Lys204), peptide SHAMAPVLYLQDK (indicated as C3). Peptides were synthesized on a Pioneer® instrument using standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) synthesis protocols. Alternatively, solid-phase peptide synthesis was performed on a Model 433A peptide synthesizer with conditional double coupling steps (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each peptide was prepared as a C-terminal amide and was “capped” using acetic anhydride. All peptides were characterized using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Competition binding assays were performed as described (26Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Google Scholar, 27Knarr G. Modrow S. Todd A. Gething M.-J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29850-29857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 70 nmDnaK was incubated with 40 mm RCMLA for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.15, 47.5 mm KCl, and 2.25 mm Mg(OAc)2 in the presence of competing peptide (0–500 μm). Free DnaK and DnaK·peptide complexes were separated from DnaK·RCMLA complexes by native PAGE on 6% acrylamide gels and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-DnaK antibody 8E2/2 using the ECL kit. All experiments were repeated at least three times. The K D values of peptides H10-9, M10-9, H44-9, and Rc2 for DnaK were determined by competition with an IAANS-labeled peptide (E. coliς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS) for binding to DnaK (21McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DnaK (0.1 μm) and ς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS (0.5 μm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of peptides H10-9 (0–20 μm), M10-9 (0–20 μm), H44-9 (0–60 μm), and Rc2 (0–40 μm) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mmKCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 90 min at 30 °C. The fluorescence intensities (F −F max) at an emission maximum of 452 nm (λex = 335 nm) were plotted against the corresponding peptide concentrations and fitted (GRAPHIT 5.0.1) by a quadratic equation using the K D of binding of ς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS to DnaK (78 nm) (see Ref. 28Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Rüdiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times. In a preliminary experiment, we analyzed the binding of DnaK to cellulose-bound peptides derived from the hydrophobic C helices from human, mouse, and porcine IFN-γ. Peptide-bound DnaK was released by electroelution using cathode buffer supplemented successively with 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5% SDS. Under the conditions of the assay, release of DnaK from specific IFN-γ peptides appeared to be influenced by the concentration of SDS (Fig.1). This is exemplified by the differential elution behavior of DnaK from peptides FYLRLFEVLKDNQ (from mouse IFN-γ; indicated by black arrows in Fig. 1) and FYFKLFKNFKDDQ (homologous peptide from human IFN-γ; indicated withwhite arrows in Fig. 1). Whereas cathode buffer supplemented with 0.01% SDS forced elution of >60% of DnaK from the first peptide, 0.5% SDS was required for quantitative elution of DnaK from the second peptide. These findings were taken into account in all further experiments in that electroelution was routinely carried out in three steps using cathode buffer supplemented successively with 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5% SDS. Rüdiger et al. (22Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) observed effects similar to those found in this study during the fractionated electrotransfer of DnaK from solid-phase bound peptides, even at constant SDS concentration. However, they optimized the conditions for their study to suppress this effect so as to obtain an averaged image in one blot. Therefore, the data obtained in both studies are comparable. Cellulose-bound peptide libraries were used to scan human and mouse IFN-γ for the presence of DnaK-binding sites. The peptide scans consisted of 13-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids, starting with the N terminus of the mature sequences. 44 peptides covered the human sequence, whereas the mouse sequence, which lacks the 9 C-terminal amino acids, was covered by 41 peptides. Because the hydrophobic core region in the DnaK-binding motif has a length of 4–5 amino acids, all potential linear DnaK-binding sites are thus logically represented in these libraries. Fig. 2shows the results of the screen. Amounts of DnaK eluted stepwise with 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5% SDS-supplemented cathode buffer were approximated by densitometry and added up. Three reference peptides (C1, C2, and C3) previously shown to constitute good DnaK binders (21McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) were included in each membrane. To ensure that the binding of DnaK to any of the cellulose-bound peptides was specific, an additional experiment was carried out in which a soluble competitor substrate peptide,i.e. peptide BH801 (sequence YWWNLLQ) derived from HIV gp160, was added during incubation of the membrane with DnaK. This peptide has previously been shown to display high affinity for DnaK (27Knarr G. Modrow S. Todd A. Gething M.-J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29850-29857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Its inclusion in the incubation buffer severely reduced binding of DnaK to membrane-bound peptides (data not shown). This suggests that the interaction of DnaK with cellulose-bound peptides occurs mechanistically through the substrate recognition site. Upon consideration of the total amount of DnaK eluted, at least two major and several minor DnaK-binding sites in both human and mouse IFN-γ can be inferred (Fig. 2). Some peptides appeared to bind limited amounts of DnaK, although subsequent elution required high concentrations of SDS (≥0.1%) in cathode buffer,e.g. all peptides corresponding to the C termini of human and mouse IFN-γ (peptides H41–H44 for human IFN-γ and peptides M40 and M41 for mouse IFN-γ). All of these peptides contain polybasic sequences (KRKR in peptides H41–H43, RGRR in peptide H44, and RKRK in peptides M40 and M41), raising the possibility that lack of elution of DnaK with 0.01% SDS might be due to reinforcement of hydrophobic interactions by added electrostatic effects. Indeed, regression analysis of the fraction of DnaK eluted with ≥0.1% SDS against the isoelectric points of all 88 peptides from Fig. 2 revealed a linear correlation (r = 0.81, t = 12.69, degrees of freedom = 86, p < 10−10) (Fig. 3). The fraction or total quantity of DnaK eluted with ≥0.1% SDS did not correlate with aliphatic index or grand average of hydropathicity of these peptides (data not shown). Further indications that the amount of DnaK eluted with ≥0.1% SDS is to be taken into account when estimating affinity on the basis of the solid-phase assay came from subsequent analysis of soluble peptides in the RCMLA assay (TableI and Fig.4). This is a competition assay in which soluble peptides are tested for their ability to compete with an unfolded form of lactalbumin (RCMLA) (see Ref. 26Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Google Scholar) for binding to DnaK over a range of concentrations (0–500 μm). Nine 9-mer peptides were synthesized that were derived from the overlap windows of weak, intermediate, and strong binders as inferred from the solid-phase assay. Apparent affinity for DnaK (K app) (see Ref. 27Knarr G. Modrow S. Todd A. Gething M.-J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29850-29857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was measured as the peptide concentration yielding 50% inhibition of binding of RCMLA to DnaK. HIV gp160-derived peptide BH801 (YWWNLLQ), the K app of which in the RCMLA assay has previously been determined to be 50 μm (27Knarr G. Modrow S. Todd A. Gething M.-J. Buchner J. J. Biol.

However, a discrepancy was observed between the interactions of peptide M10-9 (LFLDIWRNW) with DnaK in the RCMLA versus solid-phase assay (in the latter of which this peptide constitutes the overlap of peptides M9 and M10). Although this peptide displayed a strong affinity for DnaK in the former assay (K app = 10 μm), it bound only a small quantity of DnaK in the solid-phase assay. The homologous peptide in human IFN-γ, H10-9 (LFLGILKNW), did not display this anomalous behavior, as it showed strong affinities for DnaK in both assays. To clarify this issue, we used another competition assay for determination of affinity. In this assay, the K D values of the binding affinity of both peptides M10-9 and H10-9 for DnaK were measured by competition with ς32-Q132-Q144-C-IAANS for bindin"
