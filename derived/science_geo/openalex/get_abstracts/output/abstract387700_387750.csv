https://openalex.org/W2025107668,"IN the determination of surface area using nitrogen at the temperature of liquid nitrogen by the method of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller1, it is usual to determine the dead-space on each sample, using helium. For routine determinations on a substance known to give S-shaped isotherms, that is, where the equation of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller is applicable, it is possible to avoid this dead-space determination. If V1 c.c. nitrogen are adsorbed at a pressure p1, then the dead-space is given by where D is dead-space at unit pressure and a is a correction factor equal to 6.58 × 10- 5 at unit pressure. Hence, if Vc1 is volume of nitrogen in the sample bulb, then It follows that"

https://openalex.org/W2054649809,"WORK in this laboratory on differences in mechanism between normal and malignant cells has shown the great need for improved methods of analysis and characterization of nucleic acids. Investigations which I began before the War indicated to me the value of the polarograph as an analytical tool in the study of inorganic cell constituents, and there was reason to believe that it had great possibilities in the organic field. Excellent accounts of general polarographic methods are now available1,2."

In the growth-test with A-deficient rats, using a -carotene standard in oily solution (orally) for comparison, the equivalents were as follows : (1) free vitamin A acid, dissolved in peanut oil and given orally, 1 I.U. equal to 4.0 y ; (2) sodium salt of crystalline vitamin A acid, dissolved in buffer solution (pH 10.0) and injected subcutaneously, 1 I.U. equal to 0.6 y."

https://openalex.org/W2085570059,"THE failure to explain biological reactions by chemical formulæ and correlate biological activity to chemical structure indicates that our basic conception of the structure of living matter, expressed in these chemical formulæ, is incorrect. This conception may be summed up by saying that molecules are built of atoms, atoms of electrons and nuclei, each nucleus having its electrons and each electron belonging to a nucleus, only valency or Ï electrons being shared by two or more nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W2082281068,"ALTHOUGH the chemical structure of most sugars has been established beyond doubt, a given chemical structure may comprise several geometrical possibilities. In particular, the exact conformations of. the pyranose and furanose rings, which are of general occurrence in sugars and sugar derivatives, have long been the subject of speculation. An X-ray investigation of a series of sugars and their methyl derivatives was made by Cox, Goodwin and Wagstaff1, who came to the conclusion that the five carbon atoms of the pyranose ring lie in a plane but the oxygen atom is raised out of this plane. That this conclusion is not of universal application was shown by Cox and Jeffrey2, who determined the positions of all the atoms (other than hydrogen) in the crystal lattice of glucosamine hydrobromide, and were thus able to prove that in this case the pyranose ring is of the Sachse trans-form. Cox and Goodwin3 have suggested that the four carbon atoms and one oxygen which comprise the furanose ring are coplanar, but direct evidence has hitherto been entirely lacking. The sugars thus merit further attention by the methods of X-ray crystallography."

https://openalex.org/W2072135686,"IN studying the biology of myxobacteria I have arrived at the conclusion that this group of micro-organisms is much more widely spread in Nature than it is commonly considered. The morphology and systematics of myxobacteria are little known to the wider circle of microbiologists, and their role in the circulation of substances in Nature has not been sufficiently studied. In 1933 I discovered cellulose-decomposing myxobacteria of the genus Sorangium, and it was later established that the chief agents of cellulose decomposition under aerobic conditions belong to the family Myxococcacæ or Sorangiaceæ. This circumstance induced me to turn my attention to different micro-organisms already described in the special literature as causative agents of various transformations of carbon and nitrogen and showing some similarity to myxobacteria in their structure and history of development. The new nitrifying bacteria, discovered in soil by Romell and later by Winogradsky and Winogradskaia and described by them under the name of Nitrosocystis, presented particular interest in this respect. The description of these organisms and the photographs accompanying the report seemed to indicate that these authors mentioned were evidently dealing with myxobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2325011371,"IN 1924, the immature skull of a large ape-like primate was discovered in some lime workings at Taungs in the valley of the Harts River, South Africa. It was briefly described by Prof. R. A. Dart, who regarded it as representing an extinct race of apes intermediate between living anthropoid apes and man. To this extinct race he gave the name Australopithecus africanus. There followed a mild controversy on the interpretation of this fossil, but many anatomists quite properly preferred to wait before committing themselves to definite statements until a full and systematic report on the original remains should appear. Twelve years later, Dr. Robert Broom, who had decided to search for more remains of Australopithecus, paid a visit to a cave at Sterkfontein, near Krugersdorf. Here he found portions of skulls and jaws of a fossil primate similar to Australopithecus but (in his opinion) sufficiently distinct in some oi its characters to be referred to a separate genus. He called it Plesianthropus transvaalensis. Then, in 1938, the remains of what were taken to represent still another type, called by Broom Paranthropus robustus, were brought to light at Kromdraai, two miles east of Sterkfontein. Thus there are now available for consideration three series of extinct ape-like primates from South Africa, which are believed to be representatives of one sub-family, the Australopithecinse. Excellent casts of the skull of Australopithecus have been available in Britain for many years now, and during the course of his excavations since 1936 Dr. Broom has been extremely generous in distributing casts of most of the valuable material which he has collected. Thus anatomists in Britain have for some time had this sort of evidence before them. Now there has appeared the long-awaited report on the Australopithecinse by Dr. Broom and Dr. Schepers1. In this monograph, which is abundantly illustrated and incorporates numerous comparative studies, Broom deals in considerable detail with the osteological material, while Schepers discusses the endocranial casts. Apart from the obvious fact that access to the original material is really necessary to complete the evidence on which to base a considered opinion, it is now possible, at least in general terms, to assess independently the significance of these remarkable fossils."

https://openalex.org/W2094723077,"ALTHOUGH certain species of Trombiculid mites belonging to the sub-family Trombiculinae have long been suspected of being the carriers of tsutsugamushi disease, now more commonly referred to as scrub typhus, it is only recently that Blake et al.1 have demonstrated the presence of Rickettsia orientalis in Trombicula fletcheri Womersley and Heaslip. In their paper., which contains a valuable review of the literature on scrub typhus, they say that ""existing knowledge regarding the life-history, habits and bionomics of trombiculid mites is quite inadequate in view of their importance as disease vectors and pests of man"". This is particularly true of the feeding habits of the nymphal and adult stages. Miyajima and Okumura2, who first established Trombicula akamushi (Brumpt) as the vector of tsutsugamushi fever in Japan, say that ""in nature the nymph and adult seem to live on the juice of plants"". Womersley and Heaslip3, too, appear to believe that the adults are probably vegetarian. Banks4, on the other hand, makes a general statement to the effect that the mature mites feed on small insects, and mentions particularly plant lice, young caterpillars and grasshopper eggs. But l*e gives no details of any observations on the subject. Blake et al. (loc. cit.), in summing-up our present knowledge of the feeding habits of the nymphal and adult stages, say that ""the food of these stages is variously reported to include plant juices, decaying organic matter and insect excrement"". It would appear., therefore, that though adults have occasionally been reared in the laboratory there are few, if any, definite records on their feeding habits. Indeed it would seem doubtful whether they have actually been observed in the act of feeding."

It was found that in a substantial proportion of these the yolk sac content could be seen macroscopically to be gelatinous and to contain an irregular network of fine fibrils. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of a fine reticulum in the yolk sac. This reticulum resembled histologically sections of a fibrin clot prepared from blood plasma that had been fixed and stained by the same technique. For this and other reasons it was suspected that the reticulum in the yolk sac was, in fact, fibrin."
https://openalex.org/W2058165022,"THE circumstances of the publication of C. F. Symington's “Foresters' Manual of Dipterocarps”, recently reviewed in Nature1, are known to very few persons, but they are interesting enough to be recorded in detail. The Manual was issued from Raffles Museum, Singapore (Syonan Hakubutukan), towards the end of 1943 and was on sale solely for bona fide men of science. At that time, the Japanese Military Administration and the Syonan (Singapore) Municipality were endeavouring harder than ever to stamp out all traces of the British, even their language. That the Manual was published, and that there was a stock of some 280 copies for the British in September 1945, we owe to the far-sightedness, influence and discretion of a few Japanese men of science."

https://openalex.org/W2067388246,"WITH the introduction of radio waves a few metres in wave-length in the years before the Second World War, and of centimetric waves during the War, entirely new meteorological effects on propagation have come to light. The first of these is the variable, non-rectilinear propagation of metric and centimetric waves through the lower atmosphere, the range of such waves over the earth's surface often far exceeding the geometrical horizon of the transmitter. Ionospheric reflexion plays no part in this propagation, for in the wave-lengths concerned penetration of the ionosphere is almost or quite complete. The second major phenomenon is the strong reflexion and attenuation of the shorter of these waves by suspended water drops or snow crystals when present in sufficient density in or beneath a cloud. Much of the knowledge acquired on these phenomena during the War was described and discussed at a joint conference of the Royal Meteorological Society and the Physical Society held at the Royal Institution on April 8."
https://openalex.org/W2146076102,"IN the review of my ""Essays on Human Evolution"" in Nature of June 8, p. 749, Prof. A. D. Ritchie raises a matter of high importance to students of human origins—the right use of the word 'evolution'. ""Biological evolution in the proper Darwinian sense,"" he claims, ""is the process by which the normal kind of species, of fairly definite and fairly homogeneous genetic character, gives rise to one or more daughter species of different but equally definite and homogeneous genetic character. "" In giving this definition, Prof. Ritchie has failed to note that Darwin, when he came to write ""The Descent of Man"", revised his evolutionary terms ; in ""The Origin of Species"" he speaks of competition and selection as taking place between ""individuals"", o ""varieties"" and ""species""1, but in ""The Descent of Man"" his ""evolutionary units"" become ""communities"", ""tribes"" and ""nations"", and it is between such units that the processes of evolution go on, the processes of variation, competition and selection. Over and over again, Darwin emphasizes the fact that primitive man confined his sympathy and aid to members of his own community. The following is the only passage in which he mentions ""race"" as a competing unit: ""Extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe, and race with race""2. This must be regarded as a slip of the pen, for elsewhere he recognizes very clearly that competition and struggle for survival are carried on between communities, tribes or nations of the same race. Only when a community of one race is brought into contact, with a community of another race does an interracial struggle arise. Thus if I have erred in using the term 'evolution' to describe the processes which change the nature and destiny of a community, a tribe, or a nation, I have erred in very good company."
