https://openalex.org/W2032674547,"Cytokines and growth factors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that directly activate gene expression. Cells stably transformed by the Src oncogene tyrosine kinase were examined for STAT protein activation. Assays of electrophoretic mobility, DNA-binding specificity, and antigenicity indicated that Stat3 or a closely related STAT family member was constitutively activated by the Src oncoprotein. Induction of this DNA-binding activity was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and correlated with Src transformation. These findings demonstrate that Src can activate STAT signaling pathways and raise the possibility that Stat3 contributes to oncogenesis by Src."

https://openalex.org/W1963761882,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator(CFTR) functions to regulate both CI− and Na+ conductive pathways; however, the cellular mechanisms whereby CFTR acts as a conductance regulator are unknown. CFTR and outwardly rectifying Cl− channels (ORCCs) are distinct channels but are linked functionally via an unknown regulatory mechanism. We present results from whole-cell and single-channel patch-clamp recordings, short-circuit current recordings, and [γ-32P]ATP release assays of normal, CF, and wild-type or mutant CFTR-transfected CF airway cultured epithelial cells wherein CFTR regulates ORCCs by triggering the transport of the potent agonist, ATP, out of the cell. Once released, ATP stimulates ORCCs through a P2U purinergic receptor-dependent signaling mechanism. Our results suggest that CFTR functions to regulate other Cl− secretory pathways in addition to itself conducting C−."

https://openalex.org/W2044529125,"The crystal structures of a cysteine-215-->serine mutant of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B complexed with high-affinity peptide substrates corresponding to an autophosphorylation site of the epidermal growth factor receptor were determined. Peptide binding to the protein phosphatase was accompanied by a conformational change of a surface loop that created a phosphotyrosine recognition pocket and induced a catalytically competent form of the enzyme. The phosphotyrosine side chain is buried within the period and anchors the peptide substrate to its binding site. Hydrogen bonds between peptide main-chain atoms and the protein contribute to binding affinity, and specific interactions of acidic residues of the peptide with basic residues on the surface of the enzyme confer sequence specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2010516521,"In vivo somatosensory stimuli evoked the release of substance P from primary afferent neurons that terminate in the spinal cord and stimulated endocytosis of substance P receptors in rat spinal cord neurons. The distal dendrites that showed substance P receptor internalization underwent morphological reorganization, changing from a tubular structure to one characterized by swollen varicosities connected by thin segments. This internalization and dendritic structural reorganization provided a specific image of neurons activated by substance P. Thus receptor internalization can drive reversible structural changes in central nervous system neurons in vivo. Both of these processes may be involved in neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2003460583,"In Drosophila, the dorsal-ventral polarity of the egg chamber depends on the localization of the oocyte nucleus and the gurken RNA to the dorsal-anterior corner of the oocyte. Gurken protein presumably acts as a ligand for the Drosophila EGF receptor (torpedo/DER) expressed in the somatic follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. cornichon is a gene required in the germline for dorsal-ventral signaling. cornichon, gurken, and torpedo also function in an earlier signaling event that establishes posterior follicle cell fates and specifies the anterior-posterior polarity of the egg chamber. Mutations in all three genes prevent the formation of a correctly polarized microtubule cytoskeleton required for proper localization of the anterior and posterior determinants bicoid and oskar and for the asymmetric positioning of the oocyte nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2028655703,"Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms are discovered in an increasing variety of cell types with different roles in signaling. The inducible NOS (i.e. iNOS or NOS II) is expressed in cardiac myocytes in response to specific cytokines. Independent of iNOS induction, however, receptor-dependent signaling is modulated by a constitutive nitric oxide (NO) synthase isoform in these cells (Balligand, J. L., Kelly, R. A., Marsden, P. A., Smith, T. W., and Michel, T.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 347-351). We now show that cardiac myocytes constitutively express the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (ecNOS or NOS III). Transcripts for NOS III were detected by Northern blot in myocyte extracts using as a probe a polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA amplified with isoform and species-specific primers. In subcellular fractionation experiments, a calcium-sensitive NO synthase activity was present primarily in the particulate fraction, coinciding with the distribution of NOS III analyzed by protein immunoblotting. The localization of NOS III within cardiac myocytes was further demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The functional role of NOS III was explored by analyzing the effects of NOS inhibitors on single myocyte L-type calcium current and contractility. Inhibition of NOS blocked the attenuation by carbamylcholine of the increases in both parameters induced by β-adrenergic stimulation. We conclude that NO-dependent parasympathetic signaling is mediated by NOS III in cardiac myocytes.

Even in the absence of NOS II induction, inhibition of NO synthase modifies the contractile responsiveness of cardiac myocytes to autonomic nervous system agonists, implying the presence of a constitutively active NO synthase isoform in heart muscle(12Balligand J.-L.

However, the specific cell type(s) producing NO to alter cardiac myocyte function in vivo or in vitro has not been definitively identified, nor has the identity of the isoform of NOS constitutively expressed in cardiac myocytes previously been determined. In this study, we characterize the constitutive isoform of NO synthase in cardiac myocytes as that originally identified in endothelial cells (10Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T.

Purified adult rat ventricular myocytes were prepared as previously described(18Berger H.J. Prasad S.K. Davidoff A.J. Pimental D. Ellingsen O. Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H341-H349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plated on laminin, and cultured for 24 h, unless specified otherwise. Myocyte NOS activity was quantified by measuring the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to L-[3H]citrulline, as previously described(7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular homogenates from approximately 2 × 106 myocytes were prepared by sonication in a buffer containing 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 mM leupeptin, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, 37°C). After centrifugation of the homogenates (1,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and determination of the protein content (Bradford assay), aliquots (approximately 80 μg) were added to 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), tetrahydrobiopterin (10 μM), dithiothreitol (1 mM), calmodulin (10 μg/ml), FAD (4 μM), FMN (4 μM), NADPH (1 mM), L-arginine (2 μM), purified L-[3H]arginine (2 × 105 cpm, Amersham Corp.) and incubated for 60 min at 37°C in the presence (1 mM CaCl2) or absence of calcium (i.e. nominally calcium free, with 2 mM EGTA). Parallel reactions were analyzed in the presence of 1 mML-N-monomethylarginine, an inhibitor of NO synthase. The reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold sodium acetate (20 mM, pH 5.5) containing 1 mML-citrulline, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM EGTA, and the L-[3H]citrulline content was determined by anion-exchange chromatography. The calcium-sensitive activity was calculated by subtraction of the activities measured in the presence and absence of calcium after normalization for protein content from at least three separate experiments, each in duplicate. For cell fractionation experiments, homogenates were prepared as described above. Aliquots were ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was kept on ice for subsequent assay, and the pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors (as above), 10% glycerol, and 1 M KCl. After a second ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min), the second pellet was resuspended in the same buffer containing 20 mM CHAPS, but without KCl, and sonicated; aliquots were assayed as above. About 70% of the total activity was recovered in both fractions. The reverse transcription reaction was primed with random hexamers and done as previously described(7Balligand J.-L.

For PCR amplification (35 cycles), the following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-GGGCCAGGGTGATGAGCTCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCTCCTGGCTTCCAGTGTCC-3′ (antisense) for NOS III; 5′-GAGGCACCCCAACTCTGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCTGATTCCCGTTGGTGTGG-3′ (antisense) for NOS I; for NOS II, the primers were as described in Ref. 7Balligand J.-L.

The NOS III PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and used to transfect DH5a Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence was determined for cDNA inserts from three positive clones on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination technique using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Northern blots were performed as previously described(7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A.

The 324-bp NOS III cDNA insert was 32P radiolabeled using random hexanucleotide primers according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). Blots were washed in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS up to 65°C and then autoradiographed at −70°C with intensifier screens for 12-14 h. For Western blotting, aliquots of whole homogenates or subcellular fractions of ventricular myocytes were run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Equal transfer among lanes was verified by reversible staining with Ponceau red. Western analysis was performed as previously described (7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W.

Cryostat sections of heart tissue or cytospin preparations of suspensions of freshly isolated myocytes and cultured myocytes that had been cultured in defined medium for 24 h were fixed in buffered 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, followed by 10 min in 100% methanol. After rinsing, immunostaining was performed by sequential application of primary antibody (mouse anti-human NOS III, 5 μg/ml (see above)), goat anti-mouse IgG (1/50, Steinberger Monoclonals, Inc.), mouse peroxidase-anti-peroxidase complex (1/100, Steinberger Monoclonals, Inc.), followed by labeling with the chromogen diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and H2O2. The slides were washed with water, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted for light microscopy. For negative controls, mouse myeloma IgG (Sigma) was used as the primary antibody, and the samples were processed identically. Adult rat ventricular myocytes were isolated as described above. All cells selected for electrophysiological study had a resting potential of −75 mV or more negative in buffer containing 5.4 mM [K+]o. Unloaded cell shortening was recorded with a video edge detector(12Balligand J.-L. Kelly R.A. Marsden P.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The nystatin-perforated (19Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) patch-clamp technique in the whole cell configuration (20Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) was used to allow simultaneous recordings of single L-type Ca2+ current (ICa-L) along with cell shortening. The membrane-ruptured patch-clamp technique was used to internally dialyze the cell with methylene blue. Transient outward current (ITO), which interferes with the measurement of ICa-L, was blocked by 4-aminopyridine (3 mM, in nystatin-perforated experiments) or by using Cs+ to substitute for K+ during internal dialysis. All three NOS isoforms characterized to date depend upon calmodulin activation, but NOS I and NOS III are distinguished from NOS II by their calcium sensitivity for the binding of activator calmodulin and enzymatic activity within the physiological range for intracellular calcium(6Nathan C. Xie Q. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). A constitutive NO synthase activity was detected and quantified in whole extracts of freshly isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes, and this activity was dependent upon the presence of calcium (Fig. 1A). Duplicate extracts were assayed both in the presence of a maximally activating concentration of calcium (1 mM) and in a nominally calcium-free buffer containing EGTA (2 mM). This calcium-dependent NO synthase activity was about one-tenth of the calcium-independent NO synthase activity we measured in isolated adult ventricular myocytes after induction of NOS II activity with interleukin-1β and interferon γ(7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NO synthase isoforms are also distinguished on the basis of their subcellular distribution. NOS III is found primarily in the particulate subcellular fraction of endothelial cells(21Pollock J.S. Forstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.H. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 22Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in most tissues, NOS I and NOS II are cytosolic(6Nathan C. Xie Q. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), although a recent report has described association of NOS I with skeletal muscle membranes(3Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). To examine the pattern of distribution of constitutive NOS activity in cardiac myocytes, whole cell extracts were resolved into cytosolic and particulate fractions by ultracentrifugation and assayed for NOS activity (Fig. 1B). Most of the calcium-sensitive NO synthase activity segregated with the particulate fraction. Therefore, both the calcium dependence and subcellular localization of the cardiac myocyte constitutive NOS activity suggested that the responsible NOS isoform was either NOS I or NOS III. We pursued molecular cloning and immunohistochemical analyses to definitively identify the isoforms expressed by these cells. The three isoforms of NOS are encoded by different genes(1Bredt D.S.

A. 1992; 88: 6348-6352Crossref Scopus (921) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that NOS II is expressed after cytokine stimulation in purified primary isolates of adult ventricular myocytes but cannot be detected in untreated cells(7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We developed isoform- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes to amplify cDNA for the constitutive isoforms of NOS in cardiac myocytes by reverse transcription-PCR. Amplimers specific for the rat NOS I or NOS III were designed according to the previously published rat brain cDNA sequence (1Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar) and a partial rat endothelial cDNA sequence deposited in GenBank (accession no. RNU02534), respectively. The results of the amplification reactions using RNA from purified (typically 95-98% homogenous) ventricular myocytes are shown in Fig. 2. No PCR product was obtained from freshly isolated ventricular myocytes when amplified with primers specific for either rat brain (NOS I) or inducible NOS (NOS II). Products amplified with these primers were present in the appropriate positive controls, namely rat brain cDNA (for NOS I) and cDNA from rat cardiac myocytes treated with cytokines (for NOS II), as previously reported(7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using amplimers specific for NOS III, a single 324-bp product was amplified from reverse-transcribed RNA from purified ventricular myocytes but not from negative controls consisting of samples processed in parallel containing either no cDNA or RNA samples processed in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR product (three independent clones, sequenced on both strands) revealed a sequence 84 and 91% identical to the originally described bovine endothelial NOS III isoform at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Of note, the 324-bp-specific product was amplified from cytokine-treated cardiac myocytes in which a NOS II product was also identified, as previously reported(7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To quantitate the abundance of the corresponding transcripts, the cloned NOS III cDNA was used as a probe in Northern analyses of total RNA from purified primary isolates of adult cardiac myocytes under high stringency hybridization conditions. A transcript of a size (4.6 kilobase pairs) consistent with that of NOS III was detected (Fig. 3). Notably, the abundance of the transcript for NOS III was markedly decreased after 24 h of treatment of adult myocytes with cytokines, similar to the effect described in other cell types (Refs. 10Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 88: 6348-6352Crossref Scopus (921) Google Scholar and 23Yoshizumi M. Perella M. Burnett Jr., J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Using a monoclonal antibody directed against human NOS III, we detected a protein that was consistent in size (130 kDa) with NOS III in whole extracts of purified myocytes by Western analysis (Fig. 4). Quantitative comparison of the abundance of NOS III protein in subcellular fractions of cardiac myocytes revealed that most of the protein was present in the particulate fraction, consistent with the distribution of NOS enzymatic activity as described above. The same antibody was used for the immunohistochemical localization of NOS III in single ventricular myocytes in culture and in sections of rat ventricular myocardium (Fig. 5). No staining was detectable above background when the primary antibody was omitted or nonspecific mouse myeloma IgG was used. With the NOS III-specific antibody, a strong signal was detected in endothelial cells from the microvasculature in myocardial sections. In addition, a distinct signal was observed in cardiac myocytes both in primary isolates and in situ.2 2Similar immunohistochemical detection of NOS III in cardiac myocytes was observed in sections of human heart ventricle (L. Kobzik and J.-L. Balligand, unpublished observations). No other cell type stained positively. We have shown previously that NO antagonists and inhibitors of NO synthase attenuate the effect of muscarinic cholinergic agonists on the spontaneous beating rate of neonatal rat cardiocytes(12Balligand J.-L. Kelly R.A. Marsden P.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The regulation by NOS III of both L-type calcium current and contractility in response to cholinergic and adrenergic agonists was further studied in single adult rat ventricular myocytes using NO antagonists and a NO synthase inhibitor (Fig. 6). Carbamylcholine, a muscarinic cholinergic agonist that is resistant to degradation, attenuated the isoproterenol-stimulated increase in ICa-L and amplitude of unloaded cell shortening in paced ventricular myocytes (Fig. 6A). After extracellular perfusion (Fig. 6B) or internal dialysis (Fig. 6C) of the cell with methylene blue, the antagonistic effect of carbamylcholine on β-adrenergic stimulation of both ICa-L and the amplitude of unloaded cell shortening was totally abolished. Internal dialysis with the NO synthase inhibitor L-N-monomethylarginine also completely abrogated carbamylcholine's effect on ICa-L (Fig. 6D). A similar reversal of carbamylcholine's effect on contractility was also observed after NO blockade with hemoglobin (Fig. 6E). The regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by sympathetic agonists has been clearly demonstrated as a control mechanism of the rate and force of contraction in the mammalian ventricle(24Reuter H. Nature. 1983; 301: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 25Trautwein W. Hescheler J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which acetylcholine modulates the adrenergic effect on cardiac action potential differs according to the region of the heart, with attenuation of β-adrenergic agonist increases in ICa-L being predominant in the mammalian ventricle(26Loffelholz K. Pappano A.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1985; 37: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hartzell H.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1988; 52: 165-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that the cholinergic attenuation of β-adrenergic increases in ICa-L in ventricular myocytes involves nitric oxide, as shown by the abolition of carbamylcholine's effect with methylene blue and hemoglobin, both blockers of NO, and L-N-monomethylarginine, a NO synthase inhibitor. That this has important functional consequences is shown by a quantitatively similar effect of methylene blue and hemoglobin on the cholinergic attenuation of the contraction of the same cells after isoproterenol stimulation. Previous studies have demonstrated a calcium-sensitive NO synthase activity in human cardiac muscle (28DeBelder A.J. Radomski M.W. Why H.J.F. Richardson P.J. Bucknall C.A. Salas E. Martin J.F. Moncada S. Lancet. 1993; 341: S4-S5Google Scholar) and in isolated cardiac myocyte preparations from different species(12Balligand J.-L. Kelly R.A. Marsden P.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In the present study, we identify NOS III (ecNOS) as the isoform that is constitutively expressed in adult ventricular myocytes at the transcript and protein levels, including immunohistochemical localization in single cells in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial cells from the heart microvasculature strongly expressed NOS III in situ, as detected by immunohistochemistry.3 3This is in contrast to cardiac microvascular endothelial cells maintained in serum-containing culture medium for 2 weeks, in which no detectable constitutive NOS activity can be measured (30Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Kobzik L. Lowenstein C.J. Lamas S. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1293-H1303PubMed Google Scholar). However, given the low percentage of non-myocytes (typically 2-5%, including endothelial cells) in the preparations of purified cardiac myocytes used in this study, it is unlikely that any substantial component of the NOS signal detected by Northern and Western analysis came from endothelial contaminants. The expression of type III NOS in cardiac myocytes themselves is clearly demonstrated by immunohistochemical detection in single cells. Since its original cloning from endothelial cells, NOS III has also been identified in hippocampal pyramidal neurons(11Dinerman J.L. Dawson T.M. Schell M.J. Snowman A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4214-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Among other cell types (for review, see Ref. 6Nathan C. Xie Q. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), NOS I has also recently been localized in fast twitch skeletal muscle cells(3Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). We excluded the presence of NOS I in ventricular myocytes by Northern analysis and reverse transcription-PCR using species-specific probes. NOS II is expressed in response to several inflammatory stimuli in a variety of cell types, including neonatal and adult rat cardiac myocytes(7Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W.

Determination of whether this is mediated through changes in the half-life of the NOS III transcript, as previously shown in aortic endothelial cells(23Yoshizumi M. Perella M. Burnett Jr., J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), will await further experiments. Overall, our data further support the concept of a more widespread tissue distribution and diverse signaling roles for NOS III beyond the paradigm originally described in the vascular wall."

Cas is a novel signaling molecule having a single Src homology (SH) 3 domain and a cluster of multiple SH2-binding motifs. While the tight association of Cas with v-Crk and v-Src is strongly suggestive of a significant role in regulating cellular transformation, the function of Cas in normal untransformed cells is totally unknown. We report here that cell adhesion to fibronectin rapidly promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in human and rat fibroblast cell lines. The response was equally induced by cell adhesion to plates coated with vitronectin, laminin, and collagen but not by cell attachment to nonspecific substrate poly-L-lysine. The kinetic profile of Cas phosphorylation was almost identical with that of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase pp125Fak (Fak), which is well known to be activated subsequent to integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Adhesion-dependent Cas phosphorylation was completely inhibited by treating cells with cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts polymerization of actin stress fibers. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is stimulated by normal cell adhesion in close association with Fak phosphorylation and the formation of actin stress fibers. In v-Src- or v-Crk-transformed cells, however, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is markedly increased in an adhesion-independent manner that is insensitive to treatment with cytochalasin D. Thus, Cas plays a role in signaling pathways mediated by cell adhesion as well as by transformation. We propose that Cas may amplify and propagate integrin-mediated signals by interacting with SH2-containing molecule(s). p130Cas (Cas) has been recently identified as a 130-kDa protein that is highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and is stably associated with p47v-crk (v-Crk) and p60v-src(v-Src) oncogene products in cells transformed by the respective genes.

Integrins comprise the major class of receptors used by cells to interact with the extracellular matrix(1Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Integrin/extracellular matrix protein interactions play a critical role in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, tumor metastasis, and cell growth and differentiation(2Hynes R.O.

It is now evident that integrins can transduce biochemical signals across the plasma membrane to the cell interior(3Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Integrins regulate many intracellular signals including cytoplasmic alkalization, intracellular Ca2+ levels, and induction of gene expression(3Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J.

Recent evidence indicates that integrin-mediated signaling pathways also involve a cascade of tyrosine kinases and phosphorylation events (6-11). Engagement of cell surface integrins has been shown to rapidly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins, including paxillin, tensin, focal adhesion kinase pp125Fak (Fak), and mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1( 1The abbreviations used are: MAPmitogen-activated proteinHSFhuman skin fibroblastFNfibronectinPLLpoly-L-lysineSHSrc homologyTyr(P)phosphotyrosine.) kinases(11Kornberg L.

Among these, Fak has received the most attention, since it constitutes a novel family of protein tyrosine kinases and is activated by integrin clustering on the cell surface(9Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated on its tyrosine residues, Fak has been shown to bind to SH2 domains of Src family proteins and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (17-19). It is proposed that binding of these kinases to Fak may result in their enzymatic activation(18Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 19Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that integrin-mediated cell adhesion also promotes SH2-mediated association of the Grb2/Ash adaptor protein with Fak(15Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Since Grb2 is constitutively associated with the Ras GDP/GTP exchange protein Sos, the formation of Fak·Grb2·Sos complex may lead to an accumulation of GTP-Ras followed by sequential activation of a serine/threonine kinase cascade including Raf, MAP kinase kinase, and MAP kinase(15Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Indeed, we and others have recently reported that MAP kinase activation occurs in response to integrin-mediated cell adhesion (14-16). All of these observations indicate that signal transduction events elicited by integrin ligation are similar to those stimulated by growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, in which protein-protein interactions through SH2 and SH3 domains are essential (20). mitogen-activated protein human skin fibroblast fibronectin poly-L-lysine Src homology phosphotyrosine. In the present study, we have identified pp130Cas (Cas) as another molecule that participates in integrin-mediated signaling cascades. Cas was originally identified as a 130-kDa protein that is highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cells expressing transforming gene products p47v-crk (v-Crk) and p60v-src (v-Src)(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 22Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.C. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA encoding this molecule revealed that Cas is a novel SH3-containing molecule with a cluster of multiple putative SH2-binding motifs(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas occurs after cellular transformation by v-Crk and v-Src but not by other transforming genes such as v-K-ras. Cas forms a stable complex with v-Crk and v-Src in vivo in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Moreover, immune complex kinase assays have shown that Cas is a major substrate component of both v-Crk and v-Src in vitro (21). These results have strongly suggested that Cas plays a role in signaling pathways of cellular transformation triggered by v-Crk and v-Src. Little is yet known, however, about physiological stimuli that promote Cas phosphorylation in normal untransformed cells. Here we demonstrate that cell adhesion to matrix proteins of normal fibroblast cells induces a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. Our findings suggest that Cas mediates integrin-mediated signals by assembling multiple SH2-containing molecules. Human fibronectin (FN), vitronectin, laminin and type I collagen, and rat FN were all purchased from Telios (San Diego, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-Tyr(P)) (4G10) was obtained from UBI Laboratories (Lake Placid, NY). Poly-L-lysine (PLL), and cytochalasin D were obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-p130Cas protein serum (anti-Cas2) was developed in our laboratory and described previously (21). Rabbit anti-serum against FAK was developed by immunizing rabbits with GST-human Fak C-terminal protein.2( 2K. Tachibana, T. Sato, N. D'Avirro, and C. Morimoto, unpublished results.) Human skin fibroblasts (HSF) were established as described previously(16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol.

Preparation of culture dishes coated with adhesive ligands, PLL, and mAbs was described previously(8Nojima Y. Rothstein D.M. Sugita K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Exp.

Confluent cells were detached by treating with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA, followed by washing 3 times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then plated onto dishes coated with different reagents as indicated and incubated at 37°C for the indicated time periods in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Bound cells were lysed in situ with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.4 mM sodium vanadate). After removing insoluble materials by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined using micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Cell lysates were stored at −70°C until use. Cell lysates were loaded on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in reducing conditions. Proteins on the gel were electrotransfered to nitrocellulose membranes. Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting was performed according to methods described previously(16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 269-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were incubated with a 1/100 dilution of anti-Cas2 or anti-Fak sera for 1 h at 4°C followed by additional incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were then washed 5 times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to remove unbound proteins. Immune complexes were treated with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) or anti-Cas2. Using HSF cells, we have previously reported that cell adhesion to FN, but not to the nonspecific substrate PLL, stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins including 130- (pp130), 120- (pp120), and 42- (pp42) kDa proteins(16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 269-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We identified pp120 and pp42 as Fak and MAP kinase, respectively. In the present study, we have attempted to examine whether pp130 is identical to Cas. Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblots of Nonidet P-40 lysates from HSF cells after adherence to FN-coated plates for 30 min demonstrate significantly higher tyrosine phosphorylation of 120-kDa (Fak) and broad 130-kDa (pp130) proteins than cells attached to PLL-coated plates (Fig. 1A, lanes1 and 2). The results are consistent with our previous report(16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 269-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), although pp42 is not obvious in this experiment. From these extracts, Cas was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Cas serum (anti-Cas2) and immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) (Fig. 1A). Anti-Cas2 (lanes3 and 4) but not normal rabbit (lane5) sera precipitated a broad 130-kDa protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation was clearly enhanced by adhesion to FN. This 130-kDa phosphoprotein comigrated with pp130 in the total cell extracts. Moreover, anti-Cas2 completely immunodepleted pp130 from the total extracts of FN-adherent cells, while control serum did not (Fig. 1A, lanes6 and 7), suggesting that protein(s) immunoprecipitated by anti-Cas2 represent the vast majority of the pp130 in total cell lysates. To further confirm the identity of pp130 as Cas, phosphotyrosyl proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) from PLL- and FN-adherent cells and probed with anti-Cas2 immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). We found that pp130 in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates was clearly reactive with anti-Cas2. These results confirm that pp130 is identical to Cas. In normal fibroblast cells of rat (3Y1) and mouse (NIH3T3) origin, Cas has been detected as two bands at 115 and 125 kDa (Cas-A and Cas-B, respectively)(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Cellular transformation by v-Crk or v-Src, however, is associated with a decrease in Cas-A, and the simultaneous appearance of a broad 130 kDa band (Cas-C). Since tyrosine phosphorylation is found mostly in Cas-C, Cas-C appeared to be a modified form of Cas-A or Cas-B with a retarded gel motility secondary to extensive phosphorylation at multiple sites(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Most of the Cas in HSF is also present as 115- and 125-kDa proteins (Cas-A and Cas-B), as shown in Fig. 1C, lanes3 and 4. However, cells adherent to FN exhibit a faint broad band at 130 kDa that is hardly detectable in cells adherent to PLL. This band corresponds to tyrosine phosphorylated forms of Cas (Cas-C) (Fig. 1C, lanes1 and 2). In contrast to v-Crk- or v-Src-transformants(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), HSF cell adhesion did not result in a significant change in the amounts of Cas-A/B. This suggests that only a small proportion of Cas is tyrosine phosphorylated upon FN adherence by normal untransformed cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was similarly induced by HSF cell adhesion to culture plates coated with anti-β1 integrin antibody (anti-4B4) but not with anti-MHC class I antibody (W6/32) (Fig. 1D, upperpanel). Duplicate filters were blotted with anti-Cas2 (Fig. 1D, lowerpanel). A faint band representing Cas-C was again detectable in cells adherent to anti-4B4-coated plates. Moreover, pretreatment of cells with soluble anti-β1 integrin antibody inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation as well as cell adhesion to FN (data not shown). These results suggest that Cas phosphorylation induced by adherence to FN is at least partially dependent on β1 integrins. Taken together, our results indicate that cell adhesion to FN and ligation of β1 integrins by immobilized antibody stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. In addition to FN, other adhesive ligands including vitronectin, laminin, and collagen were also potent in inducing Cas phosphorylation (Fig. 2), indicating that the response is not specific to FN. Our findings rather suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is a common event induced by cell adhesion through various integrins as is the case of adhesion-dependent Fak phosphorylation. We next examined kinetics of Cas phosphorylation induced by HSF adhesion to FN. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was detectable 10 min after starting cell culture on FN-coated plates and reached maximal levels in 40-80 min (Fig. 3A, upperpanel). Duplicate filters were probed with anti-Cas2 to confirm that the same amount of Cas was loaded in each lane (data not shown). We compared kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and Fak (Fig. 3A, lowerpanel) induced by FN adherence and present the results in Fig. 3B by densitometric analysis of the bands obtained by immunoblotting. The overall kinetics of phosphorylation of both proteins were quite similar, suggesting that phosphorylation of Fak and Cas are related in cell adhesion-mediated signaling pathways. Following attachment to substrata, cells alter their shape and spread by developing actin stress fibers(23Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 4: 487-525Crossref Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Such morphological changes are generally preceded by tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including Fak(11Kornberg L. Earp H.S.

Meanwhile, cytochalasin D that disrupts actin polymerization has been shown to inhibit adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Fak or MAP kinase(14Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y.

Thus, protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by cell adhesion is closely linked with cytoskeletal organization. In the previous study(16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 269-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we showed that adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of pp130 in HSF cells was completely abrogated by treating cells with cytochalasin D. In accordance with this, the adhesion-dependent increase of Cas phosphorylation, determined by anti-Tyr(P) blotting of anti-Cas2 immunoprecipitates, was inhibited by cytochalasin D in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Duplicate filters were blotted with ant-Cas2, showing that cytochalasin D did not affect the amount of Cas (data not shown). Thus, cytoskeleton organization is required for adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas as well as of Fak and MAP kinase. Cas was originally identified as a protein highly phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues in v-Crk- and v-Src-transformed cells(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We examined, therefore, whether Cas phosphorylation was dependent on cell adhesion in these transformants. Following attachment to FN-coated plates, wild-type 3Y1 cells and 3Y1 cells transformed by v-Crk (3Y1-Crk) gradually developed membrane processes on the substrata (data not shown). After culturing for 30 min, more than 90% of cells changed their shape by spreading on the FN-coated plates, while cells plated on PLL maintained a rounded shape although they tightly bound to the substrata. These morphological changes suggest that cells are forming focal adhesions upon adhesion to FN, thereby developing actin stress fibers. In contrast, 3Y1 cells transformed by v-Src (SR-3Y1) poorly developed membrane processes even when cultured on FN-coated plates (data not shown). Most cells remained to have a rounded appearance, and the relatively weak cell spreading occurred in less than 20% of this transformant. Thus, morphological responses induced by cell adhesion were different between two types of transformants. Cas was immunoprecipitated from lysates (1 mg of total protein) of wild-type and transformed cells before (in suspension) and after adhesion to FN. Immunoprecipitates were then probed with anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting. Like in HSF cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is significantly enhanced by adhesion to FN by wild-type 3Y1 cells (Fig. 5, lanes1 and 2). In both transformants, however, Cas was highly phosphorylated even when cells were in suspended conditions (lanes3 and 5). FN adherence did not affect levels of phosphorylation of Cas (lanes4 and 6). Anti-Cas2 immunoblots of the same sets of immunoprecipitates (data not shown) revealed that Cas in these transformants is mostly present as Cas-C and Cas-B with decreased amounts of Cas-A, as described previously(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the different forms of Cas did not change after FN binding. Moreover, treating cells with 3 μM cytochalasin D, capable of suppressing adhesion-dependent Cas phosphorylation in normal 3Y1 cells to the basal levels, had no effect on the increased phosphorylation of Cas in the transformed cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is constitutively enhanced in these transformants, independent from cell adhesion, actin organization, and morphological alterations. In the present paper, we have shown that integrin-mediated adhesion of normal fibroblast cell lines stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in close association with Fak phosphorylation and actin stress fiber formation. In contrast, extensive phosphorylation of Cas found in cells transformed by v-Crk and v-Src occurred independently from cell adhesion and subsequent changes of cell morphology. Stoichiometrically, the amount of Cas that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after FN-binding by normal fibroblasts was far less than that in transformed cells. Most of the Cas remained unphosphorylated in untransformed HSF and 3Y1 cells even after adhesion to FN. Therefore, one might argue that Cas does not play a major role in integrin-mediated signal transduction. It is possible, however, that the phosphorylated Cas, even in a small amount, may interact with signaling molecules having an affinity for Cas through their SH2 domains. Such multimolecular complexes may amplify and propagate integrin-mediated signals downstream. Demonstrating interactions between Cas and Cas-associated molecules and determining their downstream effects will be necessary to ascertain whether Cas is really an important player in the integrin-mediated signaling. We have not yet identified the kinase(s) that phosphorylates Cas in the process of cell adhesion or transformation. Recently, in an attempt to search optimal peptide substrates for distinct tyrosine kinases using a degenerate peptide library, Songyang et al.(24Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) have identified the (I/V)YXXP sequence as a good candidate for the motif that preferentially binds to the kinase domain of the c-Abl cytoplasmic protein kinase(24Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the (I/V)YXXP motif appears a dozen times in Cas(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). This would predict that Cas should be an excellent substrate for c-Abl. c-Abl was also shown to constitutively bind to the SH3 domain of v-Crk (25), while v-Crk was stably associated with phosphorylated Cas(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of trimolecular complex between these signaling molecules may result in the hyperphosphorylation of Cas in v-Crk-transformed cells. In addition, c-Abl possesses binding domains in its C-terminal portion for F-actin cytoskeletons(26Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Sanders M. Matsudaira P.T. Janmey P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In this regard, our finding that Cas phosphorylation was sensitive to disruption of actin stress fibers by cytochalasin D favors the view that c-Abl may be the responsible kinase. An alternative candidate for regulating Cas phosphorylation appears to be c-Src. Our data showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Fak and Cas is closely related, suggesting that a common mechanism may operate in this process. Indeed, the SH2 domain of v-Src tightly binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas and Fak both in vivo and in vitro(17Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 18Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). A binding portion within Fak for Src-SH2 domain has been identified as Tyr-397, which corresponds to an autophosphorylation site of this kinase(18Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Moreover, Schlaepfer et al.(15Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that integrin-mediated cell adhesion of NIH3T3 cells induced autophosphorylation of Fak and subsequent binding of Fak to c-Src. Fak and c-Src association has been postulated to result in the activation of Src kinase activity by dissociating a negatively regulatory C terminus of c-Src from its own SH2 domain(15Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 18Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). c-Src activated in this fashion may further phosphorylate Fak (15Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) and, on the other hand, may induce Cas phosphorylation. In addition to the (I/V)YXXP motif, a putative c-Abl substrate, Cas contains two candidate motifs (YDNV and YDYV) that are suitable for binding to the Src-SH2 domain(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, we have detected a trace amount of c-Src associating with phosphorylated Cas in 3Y1-Crk cells(21Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). So far, however, we have failed to detect c-Src or any other kinase activities associating with Cas in normal fibroblast cells. This may be due to the relatively small amount of phosphorylated Cas contained in normal cells even after adhesion to FN (Fig. 5A). Thus, the kinases responsible for Cas phosphorylation during the process of integrin ligation remained to be determined. In summary, herein we presented a novel aspect of integrin-mediated signal transduction. Our data further support the notion that cell adhesion and transformation share common signaling molecules(10Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). This provides a fundamental basis for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation by the extracellular matrix protein. Identification of responsible kinases and downstream elements that bind phosphorylated Cas will be an important issue to fully understand signaling pathways triggered by integrin ligation.

https://openalex.org/W1976863839,"Many proteins are associated with the outer layer of the cell membrane through a posttranslationally added glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The functional significance of this type of protein linkage is unclear, although it results in increased lateral mobility, sorting to the apical surface of the cell, reinsertion into cell membranes, and possibly cell signaling. Here evidence is presented that GPI-linked proteins can undergo intermembrane transfer in vivo. GPI-linked proteins expressed on the surface of transgenic mouse red blood cells were transferred in a functional form to endothelial cells in vivo. This feature of GPI linkage may be potentially useful for the delivery of therapeutic proteins to vascular endothelium."

INTRODUCTIONIn many nonexcitable cells, the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate[Ca2+]free intracellular Ca2+ concentrationICRACCa2+ release-activated Ca2+ currentTGthapsigarginCsAcyclosporin A. is the primary mechanism by which cell surface receptors activate Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane(1Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Endocrinol. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was first proposed by Putney and termed capacitative Ca2+ entry(2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Multiple types of ion channels underlying capacitative Ca2+ entry have been identified in different cells on the basis of their Ca2+ permeability and activation by agents that empty Ca2+ stores (for review, see Ref. 3Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The depletion-activated Ca2+ channels present in mast cells and T cells, referred to as calcium release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, are distinguished from other types of depletion-activated Ca2+ channels by their high selectivity for Ca2+ over monovalent and other divalent cations(4Lewis R.S.

CRAC channels have been shown to underlie the mitogen-stimulated Ca2+ influx that is essential for T cell activation following T cell receptor engagement(7Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 9Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, periodic changes in CRAC channel activity have been shown to generate oscillations in the level of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i)(4Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 10Dolmetsch R. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 365-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which may serve to enhance signaling through the T cell receptor(11Negulescu P.A. Shastri N. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).The signal that couples store depletion to the activation of CRAC channels has not yet been identified, and in principle it could encompass diffusible and/or membrane-associated molecules. In a recent study, Randriamampita and Tsien (12Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) isolated a fraction from the cytoplasm of stimulated Jurkat leukemic human T cells that triggers Ca2+ influx when applied to the exterior of astrocyte, neuroblastoma, and macrophage cell lines, apparently without releasing Ca2+ from stores. This activity was attributed to calcium influx factor, a small (<500 Mr) nonproteinaceous phosphate-containing factor that they proposed as a diffusible messenger responsible for activating capacitative Ca2+ entry.

Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar).Little is known about how CRAC channels are turned off once activated, although several reports have demonstrated that increased [Ca2+]i may play a role. Feedback inhibition by intracellular Ca2+ appears to occur through multiple mechanisms. After entering the cell, Ca2+ binds to sites probably residing on the CRAC channel itself(20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), eliciting rapid inactivation over tens of milliseconds(8Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, slow inactivation of ICRAC on a time scale of seconds has been observed following abrupt elevation of [Ca2+]o or global rises in [Ca2+]i(4Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (656) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms have not been determined. A central tenet of the capacitative Ca2+ entry hypothesis is that refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores should terminate Ca2+ influx. This prediction has been confirmed in intact cells using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators(10Dolmetsch R. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 365-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Jacob R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 421: 55-77Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Montero M. Alvarez J. Garca-Sancho J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the ability of store refilling to close CRAC channels, which is an important test of the role of CRAC channels in capacitative Ca2+ entry, has not yet been examined directly in patch-clamp experiments. Furthermore, the presence of additional negative feedback pathways through which Ca2+ may turn off CRAC channels has not been explored.This paper describes two mechanisms by which elevated [Ca2+]i slowly feeds back to inactivate CRAC channels. One mechanism is dependent on store refilling, while the other operates even when refilling is completely prevented with thapsigargin. Thus, with the inclusion of fast inactivation(8Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), it appears that intracellular Ca2+ feeds back by at least three independent pathways to control capacitative Ca2+ entry. Autoregulatory feedback on CRAC channels by Ca2+ is likely to be essential in determining the character of receptor-stimulated Ca2+ signals in nonexcitable cells. A portion of this work has been reported previously in abstract form (23Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: A153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and ReagentsJurkat E6-1 human leukemic T cells were maintained in complete medium containing RPMI 1640 and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 25 mM HEPES, in a 6% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C. Log phase cells (0.2-1.2 × 106/ml) were used in all experiments. Thapsigargin, okadaic acid, 1-norokadaone, and calyculin A (LC Pharmaceuticals, Woburn, MA) were prepared as stocks of 1 mM or 100 μM in Me2SO. Cyclosporin A (2 mg/ml in 2% ethanol) and FK506 (50 μg/ml in ethanol) were the generous gift of Drs. N. Clipstone and G. Crabtree at Stanford University.Patch-Clamp RecordingPatch-clamp experiments were conducted in the standard whole cell recording configuration(24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar). Extracellular Ringer's solution contained the following: 155 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 or 22 mM CaCl2, 10 mMD-glucose, and 5 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.4). Ca2+-free Ringer's contained 3 mM MgCl2. Internal solutions contained the following: 140 mM cesium aspartate, 10 mM Cs-HEPES (pH 7.2), and either 0.66 mM CaCl2, 11.68 mM EGTA, and 3.01 mM MgCl2 (12 mM EGTA solution) or 0.066 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM EGTA, and 2.01 mM MgCl2 (1.2 mM EGTA solution). Free [Ca2+] in both of these solutions as measured with indo-1 was 5 nM; free [Mg2+] was calculated to be 2 mM. Recording electrodes were pulled from 100-μl pipettes (VWR), coated with Sylgard near their tips, and fire-polished to a resistance of 2-6 megaohms when filled with cesium aspartate pipette solution. The patch-clamp output (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was filtered at 1.5 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and digitized at a rate of 5 kHz. Stimulation and recording were performed with an Apple Macintosh computer driving an ITC-16 interface (Instrutech, Elmont, NY) and using PulseControl software extensions (Jack Herrington and Richard Bookman, University of Miami) to Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Command potentials were corrected for the −12 mV junction potential that exists between the aspartate-based pipette solutions and Ringer's solution. Cells were allowed to settle onto but not firmly adhere to glass coverslip chambers shortly prior to each experiment. Adherent and nonadherent cells behaved identically in experiments with 1.2 mM EGTAi; however, currents obtained with 12 mM EGTAi were not as sustained in adherent cells as in nonadherent ones. The reason for this difference was not investigated further. ICRAC was induced through the store depletion protocol described previously(20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen.

Following formation of the gigaseal, each cell was exposed to Ca2+-free Ringer's, and the whole cell recording configuration was established. This procedure was sufficient to activate ICRAC maximally, because additional pretreatment with 1 μM thapsigargin did not further increase the average initial size of Ca2+ current (Table I). After 3 min, [Ca2+]owas elevated to 2-22 mM, and steady-state ICRAC was measured in all experiments as a 5-10-ms average at the end of 200-ms pulses from −12 mV (the holding potential) to −132 mV delivered once every 2 s. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, peak ICRAC was measured from a 1-ms average beginning 3 ms after the start of each hyperpolarizing pulse to minimize contributions from uncompensated capacitative current (time constant, <1 ms) and fast inactivation. All data are corrected for leak and residual capacitative current measured in the absence of Cao2+. Leak conductances were 20-100 picosiemens. Series resistance compensation was not employed, since the series resistance (4-25 megaohms) produced voltage errors of <3 mV. Cell capacitance was determined either from the settings of the whole cell capacitance-compensation circuitry, or by integrating currents elicited by 10-mV depolarizing steps. External solutions were changed by positioning the cell ~1 mm inside one barrel of a perfusion tube array through which the desired solutions flowed (<0.1 ml/min). Experiments were conducted at 22-25°C. Where normalized data are presented, current amplitudes were divided by the current's maximal value, and the time at which the maximum occurred was defined as time zero. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of results was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and differences are considered significant if p < 0.01. [Ca2+]i Measurements with Indo-1-For experiments combining patch-clamp recording with [Ca2+]i measurements, pipette solutions were supplemented with 100 μM indo-1 pentapotassium salt (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Recording conditions have been described in detail previously(20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were illuminated using a 75W xenon arc lamp and a 360 ± 5-nm interference filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) mounted on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon Fluor 40× objective (numerical aperature, 1.3) and a transistor-transistor logic-controlled shutter to control the duration of illumination. The emission signal was collected from an area adjusted to be slightly larger than the cell. Emitted light was split with a 440-nm dichroic mirror and passed through 405 ± 15 and 480 ± 12.5 nm interference filters (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) to two photomultiplier tubes (HC124-02, Hamamatsu Corp., Bridgewater, NJ). [Ca2+]i was estimated from the relation [Ca2+]i = K∗(R − Rmin)/(Rmax - R). Background fluorescence was measured in the cell-attached mode and was subtracted from subsequent fluorescence signals before calculation of the 405/480 ratio, R. K∗, Rmin, and Rmax were determined from in vivo calibrations as described previously(20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen.

Depletion was achieved in these experiments by incubating each cell in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution for 3 min while dialyzing its interior with a pipette solution in which [Ca2+] was buffered to 5 nM. After such treatment, elevation of [Ca2+]o from 0 to 22 mM rapidly elicited an inward current (Fig. 1) whose properties identified it as ICRAC(4Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 5Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 6McDonald T.V.

These properties included a dependence on Cao2+ (Fig. 1A), rapid inactivation during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses (Fig. 1B), an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relation with no clear reversal potential up to +50 mV (Fig. 1C), voltage-independent gating, and a lack of significant current noise. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, ICRAC decayed slowly in cells dialyzed with a relatively low amount of EGTA (1.2 mM). In this paper, we refer to the slow decay in current as slow inactivation; the use of this terminology is not intended to imply any specific type of mechanism. In all experiments, we measured ICRAC during brief hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to −132 mV delivered every 2 s (as in Fig. 1B). This protocol optimizes the size of the current and allows independent measurement of fast and slow inactivation, as described previously(20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The decay in the peak currents (Fig. 1A, squares) reflects the slow inactivation process alone, whereas decay of the steady-state currents (Fig. 1A, circles) is determined by both fast and slow inactivation. Thus, the fact that both measures of ICRAC decay with the same time course suggests that the fast and slow inactivation processes are independent. In further support of this conclusion, none of the pharmacological treatments described below affected fast inactivation.[Ca2+]i and current measurements were combined in indo-1-loaded cells to examine the calcium dependence of slow inactivation. When depleted cells dialyzed with low [EGTA]i(1.2 mM) were exposed to 22 mM Cao2+, [Ca2+]i remained relatively constant for ~10 s before climbing to micromolar levels, as would be expected since Ca2+ influx via ICRAC should eventually overcome the capacity of EGTA to buffer Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). The increase in [Ca2+]i was associated with a progressive inactivation of ICRAC over a period of ~100 s. As the current declined, [Ca2+]i reached a peak and decreased, presumably as the rate of Ca2+ entry fell below that of Ca2+ efflux by Ca2+-ATPases in the plasma membrane. Increasing the buffering power of the pipette solution with 12 mM EGTA restricted [Ca2+]i to levels below 100 nM for the duration of the experiment and reduced the slow decay of the current (Fig. 2B). The ability of increased intracellular Ca2+ buffering to prolong the current is summarized for 10-17 experiments in Fig. 2C. These results demonstrate that slow inactivation is Cai2+-dependent.Figure 2:Slow inactivation of ICRAC is Ca2+-dependent. A, in the presence of 1.2 mM EGTA, the induction and subsequent slow decline of ICRAC is associated with a delayed rise and fall of [Ca2+]. B, 12 mM EGTA in the pipette largely suppresses the [Ca2+] increase, and ICRAC is more sustained. All currents shown in this and subsequent figures were measured at the end of hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to −132 mV as described in Fig. 1B. C, the effect of intracellular buffering on slow inhibition of ICRAC from experiments like those in A and B.

Plotted values are the mean ± S.E. of 10-17 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)During whole cell recording, soluble components diffuse out of the cell and may cause rundown of channel activity. To test whether slow inactivation of ICRAC is due to a washout phenomenon, we examined whether it can be reversed by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Inhibition of ICRAC in the presence of 22 mM Cao2+ was allowed to reach steady state; at this point, Cao2+ was removed for a variable period and then reapplied to measure the extent to which ICRAC had recovered. In the cell depicted in Fig. 3, a 60-s exposure to Ca2+-free conditions allowed nearly complete recovery of the current's amplitude. The extent of recovery varied among the cells tested. In six cells in which slow inactivation reduced ICRAC to a level of 11 ± 3%, subsequent incubation in 0 Cao2+ for 100-150 s allowed recovery to 54 ± 14% of the initial peak amplitude. The source of the variation is not known. However, evidence presented below suggests that most of the inactivation in these experiments is due to reuptake of Ca2+ by stores; thus, a variable degree of reemptying following removal of Cao2+ may contribute to the different amounts of recovery that were observed. Regardless, these results further support the Ca2+ dependence of slow inactivation and demonstrate that it is not simply due to nonspecific rundown or to washout of a factor essential for maintenance of ICRAC.Figure 3:Slow inactivation is reversible. After ICRAC declined to a steady-state level in 22 mM Cao2+, the cell was bathed in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution for 60 s and then reexposed to 22 mM Ca2+. In this cell, the current recovered almost completely, indicating that inactivation is not due to washout of a diffusible factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Refilling of Ca2+Stores Contributes to Slow InactivationIn the experiments described above, Ca2+ stores were depleted passively, without increasing the permeability of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to Ca2+ or inhibiting its Ca2+-ATPases. Under these conditions, stores would be expected to refill efficiently following a rise in [Ca2+]i, thereby causing the slow inactivation of ICRAC. To test this hypothesis, we measured the time course of ICRAC in the presence of a high dose of TG (1 μM) that fully blocks Ca2+-ATPases in the endoplasmic reticulum (9Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dolmetsch R. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 365-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hence prevents Ca2+ reuptake. Cells were incubated in Ca2+-free Ringer's + TG for 3 min prior to exposure to 22 mM Cao2+. Under these conditions with 1.2 mM EGTAi, slow inactivation of ICRAC was greatly reduced despite a large increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4A, Table I). In 21 cells treated with TG, ICRAC decayed over 100 s to a steady-state level of ~50% of its initial value (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the time course of the current, [Ca2+]i declined only partially over the same time period (Fig. 4A, Table I). These results demonstrate that store refilling contributes to slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICRAC. The failure of TG to fully hinder this process is not due to an inability to prevent store refilling. Experiments with TG were repeated with 20 μM IP3 in the internal solution to attempt to increase the overall extent of store depletion. The release of stored Ca2+ by 20 μM IP3 was confirmed in separate experiments by a large [Ca2+]i spike occurring within seconds of breaking into cells in Ca2+-free Ringer's; such transients were not observed in the absence of IP3 (data not shown). Furthermore, IP3 alone prevented slow inactivation to about the same extent as TG alone (~50%; n = 3 cells). As summarized in Fig. 4B, IP3 and TG together had the same effect as TG alone, indicating that store refilling is not occurring and therefore cannot explain the failure of TG to prevent ICRAC inactivation. Rather, these results reveal a second process of Ca2+-dependent slow inactivation occurring independently of changes in Ca2+ store content.Figure 4:Store refilling contributes to slow inactivation. A, 1 μM TG partially blocks the slow decline in ICRAC and [Ca2+] in one cell exposed to 22 mM Cao2+ with 1.2 mM EGTA. TG was present during the 3-min preincubation in Ca2+-free Ringer's. B, TG limits slow inactivation to an average final extent of ~50%. Addition of 20 μM IP3 to the internal solution produces no further effect, indicating that incomplete emptying of stores is not responsible for the partial effect of TG on current inhibition.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar). Three distinct NOS isoforms have been described based on cloning of their cDNAs, genomic sequences, and chromosomal localization; neuronal NOS (nNOS), cytokine-inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS) (2). eNOS is the only member of the family that is N-myristoylated, a co-translational modification necessary for its particulate localization in endothelial cells(3Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Very little is known about the regulation of NOS gene expression. The murine iNOS promoter contains cis-acting DNA elements that are targets of cytokine-activated transcription factors, NFκB/Rel and IRF(4Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Im K.S. Kimura T. Green S. Mak T.W. Tanaguchi T.

Similar cytokine-responsive cis-elements are also found in the 5′-upstream region of the human iNOS gene(7Chartrain N.A. Geller D.A. Koty P.P. Sitrin N.F. Nussler A.K. Hoffman E.P. Billiar T.R. Huchinson N.I. Mudgett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6722-6765Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Expression of the human nNOS gene is regulated by two closely linked promoters that yield two primary transcripts that are spliced to mRNAs with different first exons and a common second exon(8Xie J. Roddy P. Rife T.K. Murad F. Yound A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (in press)Google Scholar). Characterization of the factors necessary for basal or regulated expression of each promoter is not known. The human eNOS gene is organized into 26 exons, and the transcriptional start site determined, but the 5′-upstream putative promoter sequence has not been examined(9Marsden P.A. Heng H.Q. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary characterization of the bovine eNOS promoter identified a 5′-upstream sequence that can drive the expression of a reporter gene, but detailed identification of the cis-elements necessary for expression were not determined(10Venema R.C.

Res. 1994; 74: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) increases the expression of eNOS messenger RNA in endothelial cells. Additionally, subconfluent endothelial cells expressed 2-3 times more eNOS mRNA than do confluent cells(13Arnal J. Yamin J. Dockery S. Harrison D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1381-C1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these effects are regulated transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally is not known. Therefore, in order to begin to elucidate such mechanisms, we have cloned the human eNOS promoter and identified the cis DNA sequences required for basal eNOS transcription in endothelial cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of the eNOS PromoterTwo oligonucleotide primers designed based on the furthest 5′-upstream genomic sequence (5′-ATCTGATGCTGCC-3′) and 3′-downstream prior to the initiator methionine codon (5′-GTTACTGTGCGT-3′) from the cloned human eNOS gene (9) were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq polymerase (Promega) with human genomic DNA (50 ng) as template. Denaturation, annealing, and elongation temperatures were 94, 60, and 72°C for 1 min each for 30 cycles, respectively. The PCR product (approximately 1.6 kilobase pairs) was gel-purified and subcloned into the TA cloning vector for PCR products (Invitrogen). Alkaline denatured double-stranded plasmid DNA was sequenced on both strands by the Taq dye terminator method and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer.Human eNOS Reporter Gene Constructs and MutagenesisThe eNOS PCR product (F1) was subcloned into the KpnI/XhoI sites of the luciferase reporter gene vector, pGL2 (Promega). For generation of deletion mutants, the following forward primers (5′ to 3′ notation, each with a KpnI site (underlined) preceded by AA) were used in a PCR reaction with the full-length promoter (−1600 to +22) as template: F2, AA GGTACCACAGCCCGTTCCTTC (nt −1189); F3, AA GGTACCCCGTTTCTTTCTTAAACT (nt −1033); F4, AA GGTACCCTGCCTCAGCCCTAG (nt −779); F5, AA GGTACCGAGGTGAAGGAGAGA (nt −494); and F6, AA GGTACCGTGGAGCTGAGGCTT (nt −166) with the reverse primer (with a XhoI site at the 3′ end) R1, CTCGAGGTTACTGTGCGTCCACTCT (+22 to +4). PCR products were gel-purified, digested, and subcloned into the KpnI/XhoI sites of the luciferase reporter gene vector. For generation of site-directed mutants of GATA and Sp1 cis-elements in the eNOS promoter, recombinant PCR with 2 rounds of amplification was performed as described previously(14Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). The PCR primers (mutations of wild-type sequence appear in boldface) for the GATA mutation(−230) were GCTCCCACTTTAGAGCCTCAGT (sense) and GAGGCTCTAAAGTGGGAGC (antisense) and for the Sp1 mutation (−103) were GGATAGGGACTGGGCGAGG (sense) and CCTCGCCCAGTCCCTATCC (antisense). In brief, sense and antisense primers with the corresponding mutations were synthesized and incubated in separate reaction tubes with F3, F5, and F6 LUC as templates and one outside complementary primer from upstream or downstream of the mutation site, thus yielding two subfragments that each contained the appropriate mutation. Subfragments were end-filled and annealed, and a second round of PCR was performed using two outside primers. The PCR products were isolated and subcloned into the KpnI/XhoI sites of pGL2 as above. All constructs were verified by sequencing the inserts and flanking regions in the plasmid.Cell Culture and TransfectionsBovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated as described previously (3Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) into six-well plastic tissue culture plates. Bovine aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) were isolated from medial explants after gentle removal of the endothelium and dissection of the adventitia. VSM were cultured in the above media into six-well plastic tissue culture dishes. Cells were identified as VSM by positive imunofluorescent staining for α-actin and negative staining for eNOS. BAEC and VSM were used between passages 3 and 6 for transfections.For transfection of BAEC and VSM with eNOS promoter constructs, cells (60-70% confluent) were preincubated in OptiMEM media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 37°C. eNOS promoter plasmid DNAs (2 μg) and a plasmid containing SV40-driven β-galactosidase (1 μg, to normalize for transfection efficiency) were mixed with Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc., 6 μl/well) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The lipid-coated DNA was then added to each well containing 2 ml of OptiMEM media and incubated overnight. The next day, media were removed and replaced with complete media for an additional 24 h. BAEC were then lysed (400 μl), and extracts were centrifuged to remove unbroken cells and debris. Extracts were then used for measurement of luciferase (10 μl) or β-galactosidase activities (40 μl). Luciferase activity was measured at least 3 times in duplicate using a Berthold luminometer, and β-galactosidase was measured spectrophotometrically (at 420 nm) by the generation of o-nitrophenol from the substrate, o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside. All data were normalized as relative light units/β-galactosdase activity.Preparation of Nuclear ExtractsNuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described previously(15Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). BAEC (T75 flasks) were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were trypsinized and pelleted. Cell pellets were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by the addition of 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were incubated at 4°C for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged, and nuclei were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol with the above protease inhibitors and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. Nuclei were centrifuged (10,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4°C, and an equal volume of the supernatant was added to nuclear homogenization buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol with protease inhibitors, and extracts stored at −80°C. Extracts were sonicated and clarified prior to use.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysOligonucleotide probes were prepared by annealling complementary strands of DNA overnight followed by purification on Sephadex G-25. Radioactive probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified prior to use. Typically, specific activities were 105 cpm/ng DNA. Nuclear extracts (4-10 μg) from BAEC were incubated in binding buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl,1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM ZnSO4, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min, and then the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (approximately 5000 cpm or 50 fmol) was added for an additional 10 min in a total reaction volume of 15 μl. In competition studies, excess wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides were added in 50-fold molar excess prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. The wild-type GATA probe (upper strand) used was 5′-GCTCCCACTTATCAGCCTCAGT-3′, and the mutant GATA probe was 5′-GCTCCCACTTTAGAGCCTCAGT-3′. In some experiments, an oligonucleotide probe that contains the cis-element for GATA-2 binding to the human endothelin-1 gene (hET-1) was used(16Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hET-1 GATA probe (GATA site in boldface, from −145 to −123, upper strand) was: 5′-GGCCTGGCCCTTATCTCCGGCTTGC-3′. The wild-type Sp1 probe (upper strand) was 5′-GGATAGGGGCGGGGCGAGG-3′, and the mutant probe was 5′-GGATAGGGACTGGGCGAGG-3′.To determine the composition of nuclear proteins that bound to GATA and Sp1-specific oligonucleotide sequences, immunodepletion or supershifting of the DNA-protein complexes were performed. For antibody depletion of GATA-2, 1.5 μl of preimmune or immune murine GATA-2 antisera (kindly provided by Drs. S. Orkin and F. Tsai, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA) was incubated with BAEC nuclear extracts for 2 h, and then the radiolabeled probe was added. To determine specificity of the GATA-2 antibody, COS cell were transfected with the human GATA-2 expression vector (pMT2-hGATA-2, kindly provided by Drs. S. Orkin and M. Crossley), and nuclear extracts were prepared for immunodepletion as above. Extracts from sham transfected COS cells did demonstrate the presence of specific DNA-protein complexes (data not shown). For supershift experiments, either nonimmune or Sp1 antisera (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc) was incubated overnight at 4°C with DNA-nuclear protein complexes, prior to electrophoresis. Authentic Sp1 (1 ng, Promega) was used to determine the specificity of the Sp1 antisera. All nuclear DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7.5% glycerol in 0.25% Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR film for autoradiography.RESULTSBased on the most 5′ sequence reported for the human eNOS gene (9), we designed PCR primers to amplify a stretch of DNA from −1600 to +22 bp using human genomic DNA as template. A 1600-bp PCR product was amplified in several experiments. The PCR product was subcloned, and several clones were restriction mapped and sequenced with identical results. Complete sequencing revealed a DNA sequence (Fig. 1) that is virtually identical (99.6-99.9%) to that previously reported with the following differences: G for A at −1541; no G at −1504 and −1511; A for T at −1469; A for C at −1469; A for G at −1443; C for G at −1411; C for G at −1039; G for A at −934; and C for T at −787 compared with Marsden et al.(9Marsden P.A. Heng H.Q. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our sequence was more similar to that reported by Robinson et al.(17Robinson L.J. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Michel T. Genomics. 1994; 19: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) except a G for C at −1477, deleted G at −1244, and a C at −1211 and a C for G at −1038. None of these base substitutions or deletions were in consensus sequences for binding of known transcription factors.Previous analysis of the eNOS gene demonstrated that it contains a “TATA-less” 5′-upstream region with a single transcriptional start site 22 bp upstream of the initiator methionine codon (Fig. 1(9Marsden P.A. Heng H.Q. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Robinson L.J. Weremowicz S.

In order to see if our construct was functional and to identify regions of the eNOS promoter important for basal and stimulated transcription in endothelial cells, a series of deletion constructs were made with progressively smaller fragments of the 5′-flanking sequence and cloned in front of the luciferase reporter gene (F1 through F6 LUC, see Fig. 1). LUC constructs were then transiently transfected into BAEC for determination of eNOS promoter activity.Transfection of BAEC with F1 LUC, which contained the most 5′ sequence, yielded a 35-fold increase in promoter activity (expressed as relative light units normalized to β-galactosidase activity) relative to transfection with vector alone (Fig. 2). Progressive deletion from −1600 to −1033 did not significantly influence eNOS promoter activity, however there was tendency for a slight increase in promoter activity with the F2 LUC construct suggesting removal of an weakly negative regulatory region. F3 LUC(−1033) contained the minimal 5′ DNA sequence necessary for full activation of the eNOS promoter, suggesting that the proximal cis-regulatory sites (see Fig. 1) do not contribute significantly to basal transcription of the eNOS promoter in BAEC.Figure 2:Transient expression of human eNOS gene promoter activity in BAEC. Depicted on the leftside of the figure are the eNOS promoter-luciferase deletion constructs. eNOS promoter constructs (F1-F6 LUC) or vector alone (pGL2) were co-transfected with the SV40 driven β-galactosidase plasmid and relative activities (LUC/β-GAL) determined in cell lysates. On the right is relative activity of each of the constructs in BAEC. The data represent means ± S.E. of four experiments in duplicate using at least three different plasmid DNA preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further deletion from −1033 to −779 (F4 LUC) resulted in a approximate 40% reduction in basal promoter activity, whereas deleting down to −494 (F5 LUC) did not appreciably reduce activity further. However, deletion from −494 to −166 (F6 LUC) reduced eNOS promoter activity by 40-50% compared with F5 LUC and by 80% compared with F1 LUC in transfected BAEC. These data demonstrate that the major sites for binding or for cooperative interactions between cis-elements and transcription factors are located in the 5′-flanking region between −1033 and −779 and between −779 and −166 of the human eNOS promoter.Deletion of the sequence between −494 and −166 significantly reduced luciferase expression in BAEC (by 40-50%), suggesting the presence of positive regulatory elements in this region. Since the expression of several endothelial genes (endothelin-1, P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, von Willebrand factor, Refs. 18-20) requires the presence of a consensus motif for transactivation by the GATA family of transcription factors (primarily GATA-2, Refs. 21, 22), we mutated the inverse GATA element in the human eNOS promoter at −230 from TATCA to TTAGA in two constructs, F3 and F5 LUC (Fig. 3). Expression of these mutant constructs in BAEC resulted in a modest inhibition (25-30%) of luciferase activity compared with F1 LUC expression and to the expression of the corresponding wild-type constructs. The weak inhibition of luciferase activity in the F3 GATA mutant suggests that other cis-acting elements alone or in concert with GATA elements are necessary for full promoter activity. Mutation of GATA(−230) in the F5 construct reduced luciferase activity to that observed with F6 LUC demonstrating that in the context of F5 LUC, the GATA element was necessary for activation.Figure 3:Mutation of the GATA consensus site at −230 modestly reduces human eNOS gene promoter activity in transiently transfected BAEC. GATA site mutants were made by recombinant PCR using F3 and F5 LUC as templates. Depicted on the leftside are the full-length eNOS construct (F1LUC), F3, F5, and F6LUC constructs, and the corresponding F3and F5GATA mutant constructs. On the right is the relative activity of each construct as percent of that obtained with F1 LUC. The data represent means ± S.E. of three experiments in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the GATA element at −230 could bind nuclear proteins, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using an a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe encompassing the putative GATA site (−239 to −218). As seen in Fig. 4A, incubation of nuclear extracts from BAEC with the 32P-labeled probe results in the appearance of a specific DNA-protein complex that is completely prevented by 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe. Preincubation of nuclei with a mutant double-stranded oligonucleotide GATA probe (based on the functional mutation in Fig. 3) did not interfere with the formation of the DNA-protein complex. An oligonucleotide probe derived from the GATA site in the hET-1 gene promoter prevented the formation of the DNA-protein complex, suggesting that the core GATA motif from human eNOS and hET-1 genes could bind the same nuclear proteins. Gel shift experiments using the 32P-labeled hET-1 GATA motif and BAEC nuclear extracts demonstrated the same size DNA-protein complex as seen using the eNOS probe. Co-incubation with double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing wild-type, but not the mutant eNOS GATA site, prevented the formation of the specific DNA-protein complex. To confirm that the GATA-2 transcription factor binds to the eNOS GATA element, we performed immunodepletion of nuclear extracts with an antibody directed against GATA-2. Fig. 4B demonstrates that preincubation of nuclear extracts, prepared from COS cells transfected with the human GATA-2 cDNA or BAEC, with GATA-2 antisera but not preimmune sera, prevented the formation of a specific DNA-protein complex. Extracts prepared from COS cells transfected with vector alone (pMT2) did not demonstrate specific binding of the GATA containing oligonucleotide probe (data not shown).Figure 4:Binding of an endothelial GATA factor to the human eNOS GATA element. In panelA, nuclear extracts from BAEC (4 μg) were incubated with a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the eNOS gene GATA consensus binding site (lanes1-4) or a labeled double-stranded probe containing the hET-1 gene GATA site (lanes5-8). Oligonucleotides used in competition reactions were present at 50-fold molar excess including cold, wild-type competitor (lanes2 and 6), mutant eNOS GATA competitor (lanes3 and 7), and wild-type ET-1 (lane4) and eNOS (lane8), respectively.

Expression of the F3 Sp1 mutant in BAEC resulted in a 85-90% reduction in normalized luciferase activity. Moreover, mutation of the Sp1 site in the F3 GATA mutant reduced eNOS promoter activity further. Mutation of the Sp1 site in the F6 LUC construct abrogated luciferase activity to levels observed with transfection of vector alone (4% of activity remaining). These data suggest that the Sp1 site is an important and necessary cis-element in the core eNOS promoter and that the stimulatory effect of the GATA element can only be observed when the proximal Sp1 site is intact.Figure 5:Mutation of the Sp1 site at −103 markedly attenuates human eNOS gene promoter activity in transiently transfected BAEC. Sp1 site mutants and the Sp1/GATA mutant were made by recombinant PCR using F3 (for both single and double mutants) and F6 LUC (for Sp1 mutant) as templates.

Similar results were obtained in three additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe encompassing the eNOS Sp1 site (−109 to −99) demonstrated the presence of four specific DNA-protein complexes (1, 2, 3, and 4) in extracts from BAEC that are prevented by 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe (Fig. 6A). Preincubation of nuclear extracts with a mutant double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (based on the functional mutation in Fig. 5) did not interfere with the formation of the DNA-protein complexes. Furthermore, preincubation with the hET-1 GATA probe did not compete for specific interactions between nuclear proteins and the eNOS Sp1 site. To confirm that the Sp1 transcription factor binds to the eNOS Sp1 element, we performed antibody supershift analysis with an antibody directed against human Sp1. Fig. 6B shows that the Sp1 antibody shifted the mobility of purified Sp1 and the slowest migrating DNA-protein complex (complex 1) from BAEC. These results also demonstrate the complex 1 is composed of two DNA binding proteins, one of which is Sp1 (1a), and the other, 1b, is unidentified. Identical results were obtained in nuclear extracts from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (data not shown). These data directly demonstrate that Sp1 is binding to the eNOS Sp1 site. The composition of the nuclear proteins that bind to sites 1b, 2, 3 and 4 are currently under investigation.Figure 6:Binding of an endothelial Sp1 factors to the human eNOS Sp1 element.

Because many HIV-2-infected people remain asymptomatic for prolonged periods, the hypothesis that HIV-2 might protect against subsequent infection by HIV-1 was considered. During a 9-year period in Dakar, Senegal, the seroincidence of both HIV types was measured in a cohort of commercial sex workers. Despite a higher incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV-2-infected women had a lower incidence of HIV-1 than did HIV-seronegative women, with a relative risk of 0.32 (P = 0.008). An understanding of the cross-protective mechanisms involved may be directly relevant to HIV-1 vaccine development."

In addition to its role in adhesion, an intracellular signaling role for L-selectin has recently been recognized. In particular, cross-linking L-selectin leads to increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels and potentiation of the oxidative burst. As several cell surface glycoproteins have been shown to be linked to tyrosine kinases, we examined the hypothesis that L-selectin may be linked to pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation in human neutrophils. Ligation of L-selectin by three different antibodies recognizing separate epitopes led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins as judged by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell lysates with prominent bands at 40-42, 55-60, 70-72, and 105-120 kDa. The 42-kDa band co-migrated with mitogen- activated protein (MAP) kinase as determined by immunoblotting with anti-MAP kinase antibody. This effect was specific for L-selectin, because antibodies against CD18, CD45, and CD10 did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation was not due to Fc binding, since F(ab′)2 fragments of the anti-L-selectin antibodies were similarly effective, and the response was unaffected by Fc receptor blockade. Cross-linking of L-selectin was not required for enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation, because monovalent Fab fragments also increased tyrosine phosphorylation. The response to L-selectin antibodies was not inhibited by cytochalasin, suggesting that reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton was not required for this response. Sulfatides, sulfated glycolipids which may be natural ligands for L-selectin, also induced a rapid, dose-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, sulfatides, but not control glycolipids, resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase. Both sulfatides and anti-L-selectin antibodies increased kinase activity of MAP kinase as determined by gel renaturation assay. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, blocked the transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the oxidative burst induced by sulfatides, suggesting that this tyrosine phosphorylation is functionally important. We conclude that L-selectin is able to transmit intracellular signals, including increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase in neutrophils.

Recent evidence indicates that association of JAK2 with the GHR is dependent on a perimembranous proline-rich region of the receptor cytoplasmic domain(17VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L.

These data underscore the necessity for the proper physical association between the GHR and JAK2 to potentiate their GH-induced functional coupling. In this study, we explore by mutagenesis the regions of JAK2 which are required for physical and functional interaction with the GHR. JAK2 is a protein of 1129 amino acids(6Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Like the other JAK family members (12-15) it is structurally characterized by the presence of: (a) a consensus kinase domain in the residue 849-1122 region; (b) a potential consensus motif for tyrosine autophosphorylation (-EYYKVKE-) at residues 1006-1012; (c) a kinase-like (or “pseudokinase”) domain of unclear significance extending from residues 543 to 806; and (d) an amino-terminal half of the molecule with regions of similarity among JAK family members, including a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site (-IDGYYRL-) at residues 369-375. No clear SH2 or SH3 domains are found. We used a COS-7 cell-based transient cotransfection system to test mutated JAK2 molecules in assays of hGH-induced transcriptional activation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) SDS-PAGE mobility shift, JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and GHR-JAK2 coimmunoprecipitation. Our findings indicate that internal deletion of the kinase-like domain does not prevent physical or functional coupling of JAK2 with the rabbit (r) GHR. A deletion of the JAK2 COOH terminus that disrupts the kinase domain prevents these aspects of hGH signaling, but does not inhibit JAK2 association with the rGHR. Amino-terminal truncation of one-fifth of the JAK2 molecule abrogates both physical and functional coupling to the rGHR. Further, expression and testing of rGHR/JAK2 chimeras indicates that direct linkage of the COOH-terminal half of JAK2 (including the kinase-like and kinase domain) or the COOH-terminal one-third of JAK2 (including only the kinase domain) to the portion of the GHR including the external and transmembrane domains yields a receptor that can confer a GH-dependent transcriptional activation. Inclusion of the kinase-like domain only in such a chimera results in a receptor unable to transduce this signal. These results complement the JAK2 deletional analysis and support the conclusion that a role of the amino-terminal region of JAK2 is to facilitate the native interaction with the GHR. Recombinant hGH was kindly provided by Eli Lilly Co. Routine reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified in the facility of Dr. J. Engler. COS-7 cells were maintained as described previously(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Biofluids) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all Biofluids). The murine JAK2 cDNA was provided by Dr. J. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and was ligated into the pRc/CMV expression plasmid (InVitrogen) as described previously(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Generation of the mutant JAK2 cDNAs in pRc/CMV is described in detail elsewhere.2 2Zhao, Y., Wagner, F., Frank, S. J., and Kraft, A. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 13814-13818 In brief, the cDNA for JAK2ATD was created in pBluescript by replacing the region coding for residues 1-294 (using an endogenous EcoRI site at residue 294) with a PCR product encoding residues 240-294 with a restriction site and an ATG start codon at the 5′ end. Similarly, the cDNA for JAK2CTD was created by replacing the region encoding residues 932 (an NdeI site) to 1129 with a PCR product encoding residues 932-999 with a termination codon on the 3′ end. The cDNA for JAK2PKD was created by removal of the residue 523-746 region at two in-frame BglII sites in the cDNA and religation. All the cDNAs were subcloned into pRc/CMV, as previously described(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The p2FTL fos-luciferase reporter plasmid (a gift of Dr. J. Kudlow, UAB, and Dr. W. Chen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) has been described(21Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In brief, from 5′ to 3′ it contains two copies of the c-fos 5′-regulated enhancer element (−357 to −276), a fragment of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter (−200 to +70), and the gene for firefly luciferase. Each copy of the c-fos enhancer element contains the sis-inducible element, the serum response element, and an AP-1-binding site(22Curran T. The fos oncogene.in: Reddy E.P. Skalda S.M. Curran T. The Oncogene Handbook. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1988: 307-320Google Scholar). pRc/CMV ERK2tag was constructed by ligating a PCR fragment of the entire rat ERK2 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. G. Yancoupoulos, Regeneron, Inc.) coding region by a 5′ NcoI site and a 3′ ClaI site into the pBluescript SK tag vector (a gift of Dr J. Woodgett, Ontario Cancer Institute). The ERK2 coding region with the 5′ tag sequence (-YPYDVPDYASLGGP- of the influenza hemagglutinin) was removed from the pBluescript SK and subcloned via NotI and ApaI sites into the pRcCMV eukaryotic expression plasmid. The ERK2 and the 5′ tag coding region sequences were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. The creation of the pRc/CMV WTrGHR and pRc/CMV rGHR1-275 plasmids has been described(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To construct the rGHR/JAK2PK and rGHR/JAK2K chimeras, we used the pBluescript mJAK2 (referred to above) as a template for PCR of the regions encoding residues 525-778 (called PK because it encodes the kinase-like or pseudokinase domain) and residues 753-1129 (referred to as K because it encodes the kinase domain). In each case restriction sites for BamHI (5′) and HindIII (3′) were included on the primers for PCR. After restriction digestion, the PK and K BamHI-HindIII fragments were ligated into the previously described (19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) pBluescript rGHRd278-292d297-406 plasmid at the BglII and HindIII sites. This yielded in each case cDNAs in pBluescript encoding the rGHR1-296 devoid of residues 278 to 292 (which harbor the Box1 element) directly fused in-frame to regions of JAK2 containing either the kinase-like domain or the kinase domain. Creation of the chimera incorporating both the kinase-like and kinase domains rGHR/JAK2PK,K was accomplished by removal via BglII and HindIII of the region encoding residues 746-1129 from pBluescript mJAK2 and its ligation into the BglII-HindIII digested pBluescript rGHR/JAK2PK. The rGHR/JAK2PK,K cDNA thus encodes the severely truncated and Box1-deleted rGHR fused to JAK2 residues 525-1129 (the COOH-terminal 53% of the JAK2 molecule). Correct PCR and cloning were verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing of relevant regions, and each cDNA was subcloned into pRc/CMV, as described(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), for eukaryotic expression. Notably, each of the three rGHR/JAK2 chimera cDNAs encodes the JAK2 residue 758-776 region and would thus be predicted to have reactivity with the anti-JAK2 peptide serum (see below) raised against that sequence. COS-7 cells were transfected at 60-80% confluence in 10 ml of DMEM medium in 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes (Becton-Dickinson) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). For individual experiments, the number of dishes transfected per condition is indicated in the figure legend. For experiments comparing the mutant and WT mJAK2, each dish was transfected with 30 μg of wild type or mutant rGHR-containing pRC/CMV along either 9 μg of the WT mJAK2, 36 μg of JAK2ATD, 30 μg of JAK2CTD, or 9 μg of JAK2PKD cDNA in pRc/CMV. In all cases, the total amount of DNA transfected was equalized by addition of pRc/CMV. The rGHR/JAK2 chimeras in pRc/CMV were transfected at 30 μg/dish. When used for cotransfection, p2FTL was added at 7 μg/dish and pRc/CMV ERK2tag at 10 μg/dish. For overexpression of mutant and WT mJAK2, 8 × 105 CV-1 cells/100 × 20-mm dish were infected with vvT7 pol vaccinia virus (24Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6126-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 25Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. M. Mulligan, UAB) at multiplicity of infections = 5 in 2 ml of DMEM without serum at 37°C for 1 h. After infection, the cells were incubated in serum-containing medium for 2 h and then transfected with the above-mentioned JAK2 cDNAs in pRc/CMV using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a ratio of 3-7 μg of plasmid plus 20-40 μl of Lipofectin reagent/dish for 4 h. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were harvested and solubilized as below. COS-7 cells (8 × 105/dish) were transfected as described above along with p2FTL. At 18 h after transfection, the cells were split into 24-well plates (approximately 80,000 cells/well). Serum starvation (substitution of 0.5% bovine serum albumin for fetal calf serum in the medium) was begun at 24 h after transfection and hGH (at 500 ng/ml or the dose indicated) or vehicle was added for the durations indicated, such that all stimulations (done in triplicate) were terminated simultaneously. Stimulations were ended by aspiration of the medium and addition of luciferase lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mMtrans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). Luciferase activity was assayed by mixture of equal volumes of the resulting cell extract and luciferase assay buffer (470 mM luciferin and 270 mM CoA) followed by counting for 10 s in a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Results are plotted as the hGH-induced increase (mean ± 1 S.D.) relative to unstimulated (vehicle only) controls. The control values at each point are considered 100%. Serum starvation of COS-7 cells, usually at 24 h after transfection, was accomplished by substitution of 0.5% bovine serum albumin for fetal calf serum in the DMEM cuture medium for another 16-20 h. The stimulation protocol has been described(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, hGH was used at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4 mM sodium orthovanadate (PBS-vanadate) and then harvested by scraping in PBS-vanadate. After brief centrifugation, pelleted cells were then solubilized for 15 min at 4°C in either RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Boehringer Mannheim)) or WLB buffer (1% Triton X-100, 137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) as indicated. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, the detergent extracts were either immunoprecipitated or electrophoresed as below. CV-1 cells were harvested similarly and solubilized in either RIPA or fusion lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation, these extracts were processed as below. For assays of binding of mutant and WT mJAK2 to GST fusions, fusion protein induction and affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) were as described previously(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Bacterial extract containing roughly 20 μg of the GST/hGHR271-620 fusion (which includes the entire hGHR cytoplasmic domain) bound to glutathione beads was incubated with fusion lysis buffer extract from CV-1 cells expressing either WT mJAK2 or JAK2ATD such that expression of the two proteins was roughly normalized. After incubation for 90 min at 4°C, the beads were then washed five times with fusion lysis buffer and eluted in Laemmli sample buffer. 10% of the eluate was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 9.5% gel and immunoblotted with anti-GST. The remainder was resolved on an 8% gel and immunoblotted with anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum. Equal fractions of the extracts that were subjected to bead binding were also electrophoresed and anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum immunoblotted to indicate the presence of similar amounts of WT mJAK2 and JAK2ATD in the extracts. The anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), PY20 monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine (APT) antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and 12CA5 monoclonal anti-influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide antibody (Berkeley Antibodies Co., Richmond, CA) were all purchased commercially. Anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum is directed at residues 758-776 of murine JAK2(6Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). APT immunoprecipitation of COS-7 cell RIPA detergent extracts was performed with PY20 at 12 μg of antibody/immunoprecipitation as described previously(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Aliquots of CV-1 cell RIPA extracts roughly normalized for similar expression levels of overexpressed mutant and WT mJAK2 proteins were precipitated similarly with PY20 to detect APT precipitability of these molecules, which were then immunoblotted with the anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum as below. The anti-JAK2 used for immunoprecipitation experiments has been described.2 In brief, this antiserum was raised in rabbits against a gel-purified GST fusion protein incorporating residues 746-1129 of the murine JAK2. It was used at 18 μl/precipitation of RIPA extracts (0.5-0.7 ml total volume) of either COS-7 or CV-1 cells. Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was used to adsorb immune complexes and, after extensive washing with RIPA buffer, Laemmli sample buffer eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum. The anti-hGHR serum used for immunoprecipitation has been previously described(26Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, hGH-stimulated (300 ng/ml for 5 min at room temperature) COS-7 cells expressing the rGHR and either mutant or WT mJAK2 were solubilized at approximately 1 × 107/ml in WLB buffer in the presence of 1 mM 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (Pierce), a thiol-cleavable homobifunctional cross-linker, for 15 min on ice. After quenching of cross-linking with 10 mM ammonium acetate for 5 min and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, 80% of each detergent extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-hGHR or nonimmune rabbit serum (40 μl/sample) in the presence of 0.1% SDS and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. For normalization purposes, 20% of each extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2, as above. Eluates in Laemmli sample buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum. Resolution of proteins under reduced conditions by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer of proteins, and blocking of nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) with 2% bovine serum albumin were performed as described previously(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum was used at 1:1000, and detection was accomplished using biotinylated protein A (Amersham Corp.) and a streptavidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bethesda Reseach Laboratories) along with the BCIP/NBT detection system (Promega, Madison, WI), according to manufacturers' instructions. Anti-HA 12CA5 was used at 1:750 for immunoblotting and was detected with a goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Fab′)2 alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pierce), as described previously(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Competitive 125I-hGH (NEN DuPont, specific activity 85-130 μCi/μg) cross-linking experiments were performed on COS-7 cells transfected with 30 μg of the cDNAs for either WTrGHR or each of the three rGHR/JAK2 chimeras in the pRc/CMV expression plasmid according to procedures previously described(19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected cells were incubated with 125I-hGH (4 ng/ml or approximately 0.18 nM) either in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled hGH (2 μg/ml) at 4°C for 2 h. This was followed by incubation with 0.5 mM fresh bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce), a noncleaveable water-soluble homobifunctional cross-linker, for 15 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched for 10 min by addition of 10 mM ammonium acetate, and the cells were washed, harvested, and solubilized directly in boiling Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins radioiodinated by virtue of being specifically bound and cross-linked by 125I-hGH were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 9.5% gels and detected by autoradiography. To examine regions of JAK2 that are required for GH-induced signaling, we used PCR to generate cDNAs encoding the three deletion mutant murine (m) JAK2 molecules diagrammed with WT mJAK2 in Fig. 1A. The details of the creation of these mutants are described elsewhere.2 JAK2ATD lacks residues 2-239 and is thus an amino-terminal deletion. The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant, JAK2CTD, has a termination codon in place of residue 1000, resulting in deletion of residues 1000-1129, disruption of the tyrosine kinase domain, and removal of the consensus tyrosine autophosphorylation motif (-EYYKVKE-) at residues 1006-1012. JAK2PKD has in-frame internal deletion of residues 523-746 with removal of a large portion of the kinase-like (or pseudokinase) domain but maintenance of the kinase and consensus tyrosine autophosphorylation motifs. Expression plasmids including each cDNA were used to direct synthesis of the WT and mutant JAK2 molecules in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B). Each protein was detergent soluble and recognized by two different JAK2 antisera. JAK2ATD and JAK2PKD species were detected at approximately 100 kDa while JAK2CTD migrated at roughly 110 kDa, each consistent with its predicted molecular mass. Notably, transfected WT mJAK2 comigrated with the endogenous monkey JAK2 (seen in all samples) at approximately 120 kDa. Considering that only a small fraction of the total cells examined are typically expressing the transfected gene in such a transient assay, we conclude that the level of the transfected JAK2 molecules greatly outweighs that of the endogenous molecule in those cells that are transfected. Our previous work (19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) indicated that hGH-induced APT immunoprecipitability of JAK2 in COS-7 cells could be detected if the rGHR was transiently cotransfected with WT mJAK2, but not if the rGHR alone was expressed. This finding, along with the robust relative expression of the mutant JAK2 molecules seen in Fig. 1B, led us to consider use of this system to evaluate signaling and biochemical properties of these JAK2 mutants. The hGH signaling events addressed have been previously shown to be dependent on GHR-JAK2 association. Others (27Gurland G. Ashcom G. Cochr"

In this study we demonstrate that IRS-1, SHC, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase interact directly and specifically with the IGFIR. The interaction of all three proteins is dependent upon IGFIR kinase activity and, furthermore, substitution of Tyr-950 with Phe within the NPEY motif of the IGFIR eliminated interaction with both SHC and IRS-1 but had no effect upon p85 interaction. We show that residues 160-516 of IRS-1 and 1-238 of SHC are sufficient and necessary for receptor interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We also demonstrate a direct in vitro interaction between the IGFIR and a fusion protein containing SHC amino acids 1-238. No interaction was observed with a SHC protein containing only the SH2 domain. We conclude that SHC and IRS-1 interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated NPEY motif of the IGFIR, and that both proteins interact via related motifs located in their amino termini. We conclude that the interactions of SHC and IRS-1 with the IGFIR are similar to those which we have previously defined with the insulin receptor.

No interaction was observed with a SHC protein containing only the SH2 domain. We conclude that SHC and IRS-1 interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated NPEY motif of the IGFIR, and that both proteins interact via related motifs located in their amino termini. We conclude that the interactions of SHC and IRS-1 with the IGFIR are similar to those which we have previously defined with the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1966411920,"CD25 expression occurs early in thymocyte differentiation. The mechanism of induction of CD25 before T cell receptor rearrangement and the importance of this mechanism for T cell development are unknown. In a thymus reconstitution assay, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1α (IL-1α), two cytokines produced within the thymic microenvironment, induced CD25 expression on early immature thymocytes. Either TNF-α or IL-1α was necessary for further thymocyte maturation and CD4+CD8+ differentiation. In irradiated mice reconstituted with CD117+CD25+ thymocytes, commitment to the T cell lineage was marked by the loss of precursor multipotency."

We took advantage of the differential reactivity of inhibitory antibodies with human and porcine fVIII and mapped a major determinant of the A2 epitope by using a series of active recombinant hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules. Hybrids containing a substitution of porcine sequence at segment 410-508, 445-508, or 484-508 of the human A2 domain were not inhibited by a murine monoclonal antibody A2 inhibitor, mAb 413, whereas hybrids containing substitutions at 387-403, 387-444, and 387-468 were inhibited by mAb 413. This indicates that the segment bounded by Arg484 and Ile508 contains a major determinant of the A2 epitope. mAb 413 did not inhibit two more hybrids that contained porcine substitutions at residues 484-488 and 489-508, indicating that amino acid side chains on both sides of the Ser488-Arg489 bond within the Arg484-Ile508 segment contribute to the A2 epitope. The 484-508, 484-488, and 489-508 porcine substitution hybrids displayed decreased inhibition by A2 inhibitors from four patient plasmas, suggesting that there is little variation in the structure of the A2 epitope in the inhibitor population.

https://openalex.org/W2055978589,"The complement system membrane cofactor protein (MCP) CD46 serves as a C3b/C4b inactivating factor for the protection of host cells from autologous complement attack and as a receptor for measles virus (MV). MCP consists of four short consensus repeats (SCR) which are the predominant extracellular structural motif. In the present study, we determined which of the four SCR of MCP contribute to its function using Chinese hamster ovary cell clones expressing each SCR deletion mutants. The results were as follows: 1) SCR1 and SCR2 are mainly involved in MV binding and infection; 2) SCR2, SCR3, and SCR4 contribute to protect Chinese hamster ovary cells from human alternative complement pathway-mediated cytolysis; and 3) SCR2 and SCR3 are essential for protection of host cells from the classical complement pathway. These results on cell protective activity of the mutants against the human classical and the alternative complement pathways were compatible with factor I-mediated inactivation profiles of C4b and C3b, respectively, in the fluid-phase assay using solubilized mutants and factor I; the results were mostly consistent with those reported by Adams et al.

MCP is a member of the regulator of complement activation gene family.Naniche et al.(12Naniche D. Varior-Krishnan G. Cervoni F. Wild T.F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) have suggested that MCP also serves as a receptor for measles virus (MV). MV, however, has no C3b-like molecules on its envelope. H protein of MV is thought to act as a ligand for target cell receptors, whereas F protein then induces viral-cell fusion(14Richardson C.D.

This polymorphism is caused by alternative splicing of mRNA encoding the ST-rich and CYT regions(17Post T.W. Liszewski M.K. Adams E.M. Tedja I. Miller E.A. Atkinson J.P. J. Exp.

The MV-binding site and its structural relationship to the complement-binding site, therefore, remain to be elucidated.In the present study, we established CHO transfectants expressing various SCR deletion mutants of MCP and mapped the functional domains for complement regulation and MV binding.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, Antibodies, and ProteinsCHO cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Vero cells, green monkey erythrocytes, and MV, a modified Nagahata strain(22Wong T. Ayata M. Ueda S. Hirano A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2191-2199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were obtained from the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MCP, M75, M160, and M177, were produced in our laboratory(23Seya T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Akedo H. J.

Briefly, oligonucleotides looping out the sequences encoding a single SCR (corresponding to amino acids 1-61 of MCP, in reference to its amino acid sequence(8Lublin D.M. Liszewski M.K. Post T.W. Arce M.A. Le Beau M.M. Rebentisch M.B. Lemons R.S. Seya T. Atkinson J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)) were synthesized. For example, the oligonucleotide, 5′-TGGACATGTTTCTCTGGCATCGGAGAAGGA-3′ was synthesized to delete SCR1 (ΔSCR1) of MCP. Similarly, oligonucleotide sequences were determined to generate a mutant ΔSCR2 (lacking the 62-124 amino acid sequence), ΔSCR3 (lacking the 125-190 amino acid sequence), and ΔSCR4 (lacking the 192-251 amino acid sequence). The nucleotide sequences of the resulting cDNAs were all confirmed on a nucleotide sequencer (ABI 373A). Intact and mutated MCP cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI/PstI-digested expression vector pME18S(33Kojima A. Iwata K. Seya T. Matsumoto M. Ariga H. Atkinson J.P. Nagasawa S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1519-1527PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated cDNAs were again confirmed on the nucleotide sequencer.CHO cells were cotransfected with vectors containing MCP cDNA (20 μg) and 1 μg of pSV2hph (a hygromycin resistance gene vector) (34Blochlinger K. Diggelmann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate precipitation(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.37Google Scholar). The transfected CHO cells were maintained for 24 h in Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.06% kanamycin, in an atmosphere of humidified 5%CO2, 95% air at 37°C. The cells were transferred to the same medium containing 0.7 mg/ml of hygromycin B (Sigma) for selection. The hygromycin-resistant colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders and expanded in tissue culture plates. The cDNAs incorporated into CHO cells were confirmed by Southern blotting(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.37Google Scholar). The expression of these mutants was confirmed by flow cytometry using M160 (not shown), M177, and E4.3.Flow Cytometry and ImmunoblottingThe protein levels expressed on the transfected cells (1 ´ 106) were assessed by flow cytometry (FACScan and/or Profile II) as described previously (33) using M177 and E4.3, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled second Ab. CHO cells, transfected with vectors only, pME18S and pSV2hph, were used as controls.Immunoblotting was performed as described previously(36Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). MCP and its mutants were solubilized from transfectants (about 2 ´ 107 cells) as reported previously(3Seya T. Turner J.R. Atkinson J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 837-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10-12.5% acrylamide), blotted onto membranes, and detected with a mAb against MCP. The conditions for blotting analyses were described in detail previously(10Matsumoto M. Seya T. Nagasawa S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Glycosidase TreatmentSolubilized ΔSCR4 mutant was mixed with 0.10 volume of 1% SDS and incubated with 1 unit of N-glycanase F. After incubation for 12 h at 37°C, 1 unit of N-glycanase F was further added and incubated for an additional 12 h. Another ΔSCR4 mutant was mixed with an equal volume of incubation buffer (40 mM Tris maleate, 20 mMD-galactono-g-lactone, 2 mM calcium acetate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 6.0) and incubated with 100 microunits of neuraminidase for 1 h at 37°C. Then, 3 milliunits of O-glycanase and 1 unit of N-glycanase F were added and incubated for 12 h. The sample was mixed with an additional 1 unit of N-glycanase F and incubated for an additional 12 h at 37°C. The glycanase-treated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with M177 mAb, which recognizes SCR2.Factor I-Cofactor ActivityA fluid-phase assay was used (31, 32). Briefly, DACM-labeled C3b or C4b (10 μg) and factor I (0.5 μg) were incubated for 3-12 h at 37°C with various amounts of MCP or its SCR deletion mutants, which were prepared as follows. The samples solubilized from 2 ´ 107 cells were prepared by acid precipitation(3Seya T. Turner J.R. Atkinson J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 837-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and the amounts of wild-type and mutant MCP were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(37Hara T. Kuriyama S. Kiyohara H. Nagase Y. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 89: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SCR2 and SCR3 deletion mutants could not be detected in this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, so the concentrations of the mutants were estimated from the copy numbers of the mutants on the CHO cells assuming the solubilization efficiencies to be the same as that of the wild type. We obtained MCP samples of 7 μg/ml, and 1-10 μl was used as an MCP source. At timed intervals, 10 μl of 10% SDS and 3 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol were added to terminate the reaction and to reduce the substrates. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8-10% acrylamide), and the percentage conversions of C3b to C3bi, and of C4b to C4d, were determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry as described previously(31Seya T. Okada M. Nishino H. Atkinson J.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Masaki T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi I. Yasuda R. Seya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cofactor activity was mostly abrogated by the addition of M177(5Seya T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Sugita Y. Akedo H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that the expressed MCP was a major cofactor in these CHO cells (not shown).Complement-dependent Cytolysis of CHO TransfectantsAnti-CHO cell Ab was used as a sensitizer(33Kojima A. Iwata K. Seya T. Matsumoto M. Ariga H. Atkinson J.P. Nagasawa S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1519-1527PubMed Google Scholar), and the complement sources for the classical and the alternative pathways were normal human serum diluted with gelatin veronal buffer and normal human serum diluted with gelatin veronal buffer containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM EGTA (Mg2+>-EGTA), respectively. Briefly, the transfected cells (2 ´ 104/well) were seeded on 96-well plates. Fifteen h later, the cells were incubated with 51Cr (1 μCi/well) in complete medium for 3 h at 37°C. After three washes with gelatin veronal buffer, the labeled cells were incubated with anti-CHO Ab for 30 min at 4°C, then 100 μl of 2-fold-diluted complement sources were added. The plates were incubated for 60 min at 37°C, and the released radioactivities were measured in a g-counter. Cytotoxicity was calculated as described previously (38). All determinations were performed in triplicate.MV Binding AssayCells to be assayed for MV binding were detached from flasks at 80% confluence by the addition of 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM EDTA. After two washes, aliquots containing 1 g 106 cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 2 ml of concentrated MV (107 pfu/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum. After three washes with DMEM, 5% fetal calf serum, cells were incubated at 4°C for 45 min with 5 μg of anti-H mAb(27Yanagi Y. Cubitt B.A. Oldstone M.B.A. Virology. 1992; 187: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After three washes with 10 ml of DMEM, cells were incubated with 5 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. The levels of the MV H protein in each CHO cell strain were assessed by flow cytometry.Determination of MV InfectivityCHO cell clones with or without a variety of MCP mutants were cultured at 70% confluence in 24-well plates (Corning) for 15 h and infected with MV at 0.001-0.5 pfu/cell. Simultaneously, we performed plaque-forming assays (27Yanagi Y. Cubitt B.A. Oldstone M.B.A. Virology. 1992; 187: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and confirmed the correlation between CHO cell syncytium formation and plaque formation. The syncytia formed were counted, and the cytopathic characteristics of the CHO cell transfectants (13Dorig R.E. Marcil A. Chopra A. Richardson D. Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) were observed 3 days post-infection. Virtually, no background infection was observed at our doses of MV within 3 days. Cells were photographed under a Nikon inverted microscope (not shown).The supernatants of the infected cells were harvested after sonication, and the MV titer was determined using Vero cells by the standard method (12, 13).RESULTSLevels and Properties of SCR Deletion Mutants Expressed on CHO CellsThe expression levels of the MCP mutants ΔSCR1, ΔSCR2, ΔSCR3, and ΔSCR4 were examined by flow cytometry. All SCR deletion mutants were translated into proteins and expressed on the CHO cells (Fig. 1). The expression levels of MCP mutants were similar on all clones used except for the ΔSCR1 transfectant, the density of which was elevated 3-4-fold. Based on the reaction profile, the epitope of E4.3 was mapped in SCR1 (right panel of Fig. 1), consistent with the results of a previous report(9Adams E.M. Brown M.C. Nunge M. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the epitope of M177 was mapped in SCR2 (left panel of Fig. 1). Epitope mapping was performed with 10 mAbs against MCP, and the results are summarized in. Table ITable I:Epitopes and effects on MCP functions of mAbs Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting suggested that the wild-type MCP has an molecular mass of 57 kDa, consistent with that of the previously reported STC/CYT2 form(6Lublin D.M.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 1519-1527PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular masses of ΔSCR1, ΔSCR2, and ΔSCR3 mutants were 42, 44, and 54 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A). The present results supported those of previous reports that SCR1 and SCR2 are N-glycosylated (9, 39). The ΔSCR4 mutant yielded two bands on SDS-PAGE of 44 and 36 kDa, resulting from the single expected nucleotide sequence. The two bands were accumulated into a single 33-kDa band on SDS-PAGE after N-glycanase treatment, and this band was further decreased by 3 kDa by O-glycanase treatment (Fig. 1B). Thus, on CHO cells the ΔSCR4 mutant protein consists of two forms, one heavily glycosylated with a molecular mass of 43 kDa and a lightly glycosylated 34-kDa form. All mutants possessed O-linked sugars estimated on SDS-PAGE to be 3 kDa.Complement Regulatory Function of the MCP MutantsComplement regulatory activities of the mutants were determined by fluid-phase factor I-cofactor assay(31Seya T. Okada M. Nishino H. Atkinson J.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Masaki T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi I. Yasuda R. Seya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CHO(-) cells possessed minimal C3b-C3bi converting activity (percent conversion by CHO(-) cells was 20-22% under the conditions shown in). With DACM-labeled C3b as a substrate, SCR2-, SCR3-, and SCR4-deletion mutants showed no cofactor activity relevant to the expressed MCP, whereas ΔSCR1 retained its activity (). Similar results were obtained with another substrate, DACM-labeled C4b, except that the cofactor activity for C4b cleavage remained minimal in the ΔSCR4 mutant (). M177 completely blocked this ΔSCR4-mediated C4b inactivation (data not shown), excluding the possibility of involvement of other cofactors in the C4b cleavage.The cell protection assay from human complement was performed with 50Cr-labeled CHO cells with the mutants and the complement sources for the classical and the alternative pathways (Table II). Two CHO cell clones expressing wild-type MCP were used as controls: one clone, whose expression level of MCP was as high as that of ΔSCR1, and the other clone, whose expression level of MCP was similar to those of ΔSCR2, ΔSCR3, and ΔSCR4. The ΔSCR1 mutant expressed as potent protective activity from complement attack as a wild-type. Judging from the MCP copy numbers expressed on the CHO cells, ΔSCR1 and wild-type MCP protected cells from the two pathways with similar potencies. The ΔSCR2 and ΔSCR3 mutants showed no protective activity from the two pathways, and the ΔSCR4 had virtually no effect on alternative pathway-mediated cell damage, while retaining marginal protective activity against the classical pathway. Thus, the degrees of cell protection in the mutants were essentially consistent with their factor I-cofactor activities. The results are summarized in.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The Domain of MCP Responsible for MV InfectionMV binding assay was performed by flow cytometry (). Binding was observed in CHO cells expressing ΔSCR3 and ΔSCR4 mutants, but not in those expressing ΔSCR1 or ΔSCR2. The degrees of MV binding were in the order: wild type = ΔSCR3 mutant>ΔSCR4 mutant.Syncytium formation is a representative marker for MV infection of CHO cells expressing MCP(13Dorig R.E. Marcil A. Chopra A. Richardson D. Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). In this study, syncytia were visualized under the light microscope and the number of syncytia formed at each dose of MV was counted to determine the titer of infectivity. The minimum doses of MV for syncytium formation are shown in. The results reflected those of the MV binding assay. These results suggested that SCR1 and SCR2 are the domains essential for MV binding/infection.Importance of the SCR1 and SCR2 domains for MV infection was also supported by the inhibition studies with anti-MCP mAb (). SCR2 was particularly important, since SCR2-recognizing mAbs M75 and M177 blocked MV infection in both CHO transfectants and Vero cells. An SCR3-recognizing mAb MH61 blocked MV infection in CHO transfectants, but not Vero cells. This blocking effect may be due to steric hindrance or a conformational change in SCR2 secondary to the binding of this mAb to SCR3.Replication of MV in MCP Mutant-expressing CHO CellsMV replicated in CHO transfectants expressing ΔSCR3 and ΔSCR4 mutants, as well as wild-type, whereas no replication occurred in CHO transfectants expressing ΔSCR1 or ΔSCR2 mutants. The results were confirmed by determination of MV H protein synthesis by immunostaining using subacute sclerosing panencephalitis serum and mAb against MV H. The results again reinforce the notion that the SCR1 and SCR2 domains are essential for MV infection and that MV replication is permitted regardless of deletion of SCR3 or SCR4.DISCUSSIONWe studied which of the four SCR domains of MCP contribute to the cofactor activity for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b, the protection of host cells from complement-mediated cytolysis, and MV binding activity, using deletion mutants. In summary: 1) SCR1 and SCR2 are mainly involved in MV binding and infection; 2) SCR2, SCR3, and SCR4 sustain sufficient C3b inactivation by factor I; and 3) SCR2 and SCR3 are essential for factor I-mediated inactivation of C4b. The last two points are essentially similar to those reported by Adams et al.(9Adams E.M. Brown M.C. Nunge M. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar) and Oglesby et al.(40Oglesby T.J. Allen C.J. Liszewski M.K. White D.J.G. Atkinson J.P. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30 (abstr.): 40Crossref Google Scholar), except that the ΔSCR4 mutant retained weak cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C4b cleavage. They also determined the domains responsible for C3b and C4b binding(9Adams E.M. Brown M.C. Nunge M. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar). Our results taken together with their findings indicate that the three ligands of MCP, C3b, C4b, and MV, bind to different sets of SCR and confer distinct functions of MCP. Hence, MCP is a multifunctional receptor with both classical and alternative complement regulatory and MV binding activities.In our permanent expression system using CHO cells, N-glycosylation diverged in ΔSCR4 resulting in the two forms of the ΔSCR4 protein. This is not the case in a transient COS cell expression system reported by Adams et al.(9Adams E.M. Brown M.C. Nunge M. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar), which may explain the differences between previous results (9Adams E.M. Brown M.C. Nunge M. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar, 40Oglesby T.J. Allen C.J. Liszewski M.K. White D.J.G. Atkinson J.P. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30 (abstr.): 40Crossref Google Scholar) and our present findings. That is, the presence of the two forms of the ΔSCR4 protein may explain the findings that our ΔSCR4 mutant retain, albeit weak, cofactor activity for C4b and that CHO cells expressing ΔSCR4 are less sensitive to MV than those expressing ΔSCR3 or wild-type MCP. It is not surprising that MCP molecules are differently glycosylated in different cell lines. In fact, a variety of MCP size variants secondary to cell type- and organ-specific glycosylation have been reported(17Post T.W. Liszewski M.K. Adams E.M. Tedja I. Miller E.A. Atkinson J.P. J. Exp.

In the strand transfer assay reaction in vitro, primer synthesis initiated on a donor template can transfer and be completed on an acceptor template. NC was added at concentrations up to twice that needed for 100% template coating. As the concentration of NC was increased, primer extension was stimulated until NC coated approximately 50% of the template. Stimulation was caused in part by an increase in the number of primers that sustained synthesis. Subsequent increments of NC decreased synthesis. The presence of NC also increased the efficiency of the strand transfer reaction, allowing a greater proportion of extended primers to transfer from donor to acceptor templates. Processivity of the RT on the donor template was measured using both challenged and enzyme dilution assays. NC did not alter the proportion of synthesis products that reached the end of the template, indicating little effect on processivity. This result suggests that the increase in full-length product synthesis, observed in reactions where the RT repeatedly bound the primer-template, resulted from promotion of RT reassociation by NC. Consequently, since the RT could not reassociate with the template in the processivity assay, NC could not stimulate the amount of full-length synthesis. No strand transfer was observed in dilution processivity assays, suggesting that the RT must dissociate and rebind during the transfer reaction. Stimulation of synthesis, e.g. by increased dNTP concentration, normally inhibits strand transfer. Stimulation of both synthesis and transfer by NC indicates that properties of NC that improve the transfer event prevail over the negative effects of rapid synthesis on transfer efficiency.

However, expression of NOS-I155 immunore-activity and activity was low or not detectable in developing mouse and rat brain. NOS-I155 was sharply induced coincident with the onset of synapto-genesis in specific brain regions. This was followed by a second phase in which total NOS-I155 expression decreased both in specific cell populations and in the total synaptosomal subcellular fraction. Furthermore, two putative variants of NOS-I were transiently observed: an NOS-I-immunoreactive protein with increased electrophoretic mobility (NOS-I144) and a transient hypersensitivity of NOS-I155 to the competitive substrate inhibitor Nω-nitro-L-arginine. It is concluded that NOS-I expression is not constitutive but locally induced. In the central nervous system, this regionally specific, biphasic pattern of postnatal NOS-I induction is consistent with a role for NO in synap-togenesis and synaptic plasticity.—Ogilvie, P., Schilling, K., Billingeley, M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4188-4196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it inhibits transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 initiator (26).YY1 was first purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography and analyzed by protein microsequencing(21Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding YY1 was obtained using probes generated from microsequencing information. The binding property of YY1 was also used as a means to screen expression libraries for cDNA clones encoding it(1Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9799-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 8Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell.

Functional studies of YY1 included mutation of its binding sites in a number of promoters or placing YY1-binding sites upstream of a variety of natural or synthetic promoters. Studies of cloned YY1 included the general strategies of expressing YY1 transiently in tissue culture cells or adding purified YY1 to an in vitro transcription extract and assaying the transcription from reporter gene promoters containing YY1-binding sites. So far, such approaches have demonstrated that YY1 activates and represses transcription of many different promoters, but little is known about its mechanism of action.The identification and characterization of proteins in a cell with which a given protein interacts is often helpful for understanding the function of that protein. Previously, we and others have used the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify cellular proteins that interact with YY1. Among the clones analyzed were genes encoding nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 (27Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6506-6510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the oncoprotein c-Myc(28Shrivastava A. Saleque S. Kalpana G.V. Artandi S. Goff S.P. Calame K. Science. 1993; 262: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Both the nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 and c-Myc can relieve YY1-induced transcriptional repression. In addition, c-Myc inhibits the activator functions of YY1. These results suggest that a possible mechanism for transcription regulation by YY1 is by interaction with these two cellular proteins.We have now sequenced and characterized additional clones from our two-hybrid screen for encoded proteins capable of binding to YY1. Two proteins were identified, cyclophilin A (CyPA)1( 1The abbreviations used are: CyPAcyclophilin AFKBP12FK506-binding protein 12CsAcyclosporin ADBDDNA-binding domainADactivation domainCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCMVcytomegalovirus.) and FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12). CyPs and FKBPs comprise two families of ubiquitous and often abundant proteins conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 29-40). CyPA was first identified and purified from bovine spleen on the basis of its high affinity for cyclosporin A (CsA)(41Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). It is an abundant, cytosolic protein of 18 kDa found in all tissues in eukaryotic cells. It possesses rotamase activity, which enables it to catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds involving a prolyl residue, and might facilitate protein folding(42Takahashi N. Hayano T. Suzuki M. Nature. 1989; 337: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CyPA binds the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protein and is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virion particles(43Luban J. Bossolt K.L. Franke E.K. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 44Franke E.K. Yuan H.E.H. Luban J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Although it has no sequence homology with CyPs, FKBPs are also abundant cytosolic proteins that possess cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activities that are inhibited by FK506 but not by CsA (reviewed in Refs. 34 and 46). FKBP12 has been shown to interact with the type I receptors of the transforming growth factor-β family(47Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and two FKBP-related proteins are associated with progesterone receptor complexes(48Smith D.F. Baggenstoss B.A. Marion T.N. Rimerman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18365-18371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, FKBP25 is associated with nucleolin(49Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a major nucleolar phosphoprotein in exponentially growing cells. Both CyPA-CsA and FKBP12-FK506 complexes prevent T-cell response to antigen, bind and modulate activity of the protein phosphatase calcineurin(50Liu J. Farmer J.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar), and prevent nuclear import of a subunit of NFAT(51Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), a T-cell activation transcription factor.In this report, we present evidence that YY1 interacts specifically with CyPA and FKBP12 in both yeast and mammalian cells, suggesting that YY1 may be a common natural ligand for both immunophilins. Consistent with the ability of these immunophilins to interact with YY1, overexpression of CyPA or FKBP12 alters the transcription activity of YY1.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsThe following plasmids have previously been described: pAS-YY1(27Inouye C.J.

Wong J.M. Chen H.S. Lee C.G. Davis S. Steele G.J. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All recombinants were verified by dideoxy sequencing.Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction ExperimentsTo assay systematically the pairwise interactions, library-derived Y14 or Y20 plasmids were transformed into Y153 alone or Y153 harboring pAS-YY1, pAS-Rb2, or pAS-SNF1 as described(27Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6506-6510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Transformants were assayed for the presence of β-galactosidase activity using the colony filter lift method(59Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar).DNA Transfections and CAT AssaysHeLa cells were grown on 60-mm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method(60Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles and extracts assayed for CAT activity by thin-layer chromatography (61Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar) and quantified with the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To determine the effects of CsA and FK506 on YY1-immunophilin interaction, different amounts of CsA or FK506 (1 mg/ml stock in 50% phosphate-buffered saline and ethanol) were added to the culture media 4-8 h after transfection.RESULTSY14 and Y20 Are Identical to CyPA and FKBP12Previously, we have used the yeast two-hybrid screen to detect mouse cDNAs coding for products that interact with YY1(27Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6506-6510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of approximately 106 transformants, 14 clones showed specificity in binding to YY1 but not Rb or the yeast SNF1 protein. Preliminary DNA sequence analysis revealed eight novel sequences and six that were highly homologous to known sequences. Of the six known sequences, we have now completely sequenced two additional cDNA inserts designated Y14 and Y20. The Y14 clone is identical to the previously published mouse cyclophilin cDNA sequence (nucleotides 289-679; Ref. 62 (GenBank accession number X52803)). The insert in this clone begins at the 84th codon of CyPA and continues through the open reading frame past the 3′-noncoding sequences of the gene. The Y20 clone is identical to the previously published mouse FK506-binding protein (nucleotides 50-849; Ref. 63 (GenBank accession number X60203)). The insert in Y20 begins in the 5′-untranslated portion of the FKBP RNA 47 nucleotides before the initiator methionine and continues through the entire open reading frame past the noncoding sequences at the 3′-end of the gene.Confirmation That Y14 and Y20 Are Dependent on YY1 Hybrid ExpressionTo confirm that the phenotype observed in the original screen was reproducible and dependent on the YY1 hybrid, Y14 and Y20 plasmids were recovered and transformed into Y153 either alone or with test fusions in pAS1. As shown in Fig. 1A, transformants were assayed and β-galactosidase activities were positive only in the presence of pAS-YY1.CyPA or FKBP12 Fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding Domain Can Support Transcriptional Activation Mediated by a YY1-Gal4 Activation Domain Fusion ProteinIf a true interaction exists between YY1 and CyPA or FKBP12, this interaction should occur independent of the Gal4 DBD and the Gal4 AD. Specifically, activation of a reporter gene should still occur if the two Gal4 domains are switched. In addition, since YY1 is a mammalian transcription factor, it is important to confirm that this interaction occurs in mammalian cells. To address this issue, we fused human CyPA or FKBP12 to the Gal4 DBD, Gal4(1-147), and tested, in HeLa cell cotransfection assays, the ability of each Gal4 fusion protein to support Gal4 AD-YY1-mediated transcriptional activation using reporter constructs that contained Gal4-binding sites (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1C shows that neither the Gal4 DBD-CyPA fusion or the Gal4 AD-YY1 fusion significantly activated the reporter gene (lanes2 and 4), but the two proteins together activated CAT activity 10-fold (lane3). A deletion mutation of amino acids 332-414 in YY1 did not have any effect on the interaction (lane5). Similarly, a Gal4 DBD-FKBP12 fusion and the Gal4 AD-YY1 fusion together activated the CAT reporter gene (lane8). However, unlike the YY1-CyPA interaction, deletion of amino acids 332-414 in YY1 reduced the interaction of YY1-FKBP12 significantly (compare lanes8 and 9). These data confirm that YY1 binds CyPA and FKBP12 and further suggest that the YY1 carboxyl-terminal domain is required for its interaction with FKBP12 but not with CyPA.As with all experiments presented in this paper, in place of using an internal control (which often gets activated or repressed by YY1, CyPA, or FKBP12), each experiment shown is representative of at least three (and sometimes as many as 20) similar experiments, and all results were reproduced with more than one transfection reagent and DNA preparation.Additional Evidence for Interaction between YY1 and CyPA or FKBP12If the ability of Gal4 DBD-CyPA or Gal4 DBD-FKBP12 to support Gal4 AD-YY1 is specific, then other non-related Gal4 DBD fusion proteins should not support a YY1-AD fusion response. Furthermore, a Gal4 DBD-CyPA or Gal4 DBD-FKBP12 should not activate transcription in the presence of other non-related AD fusion proteins. In particular, we found that a Gal4 DBD-CyPA or Gal4 DBD-FKBP12 can synergize with a YY1 protein fused to the AD of VP16 (Fig. 2, B, lane4 and C, lane4), but neither the Gal4 DBD-RB nor Gal4 DBD-LR can activate transcription with YY1-VP16AD (Fig. 2, B, lanes6 and 8 and C, lanes6 and 8). Also, a Lac I-VP16AD fusion or an entire VP16 protein cannot stimulate transcription with Gal4 DBD-CyPA or with Gal4 DBD-FKBP12 (Fig. 2, B, lanes10 and 12 and C, lane10). Taken together, these results argue that the interaction between YY1 and CyPA or FKBP12 is highly specific.Figure 2:CyPA- or FKBP12-mediated transcriptional activation by activation domain-YY1 fusion is highly specific. A, schematic drawing of plasmids used in transfection assays. B and C, HeLa cells were cotransfected with 5 μg each of the indicated plasmids. All transfections were normalized to equal amounts of DNA with parental expression vectors. Transfection and CAT assays were done as described under “Materials and Methods” and for Fig. 1, except that smaller amount of extracts and a lower reaction time were used to keep the assay linear. The results are the mean ± S.D. from at least three separate transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CsA and FK506 Inhibit CyPA-YY1 and FKBP12-YY1 Interactions, RespectivelyThe immunosuppressive drug CsA, a cyclic undecapeptide of fungal origin, has been shown to bind CyPA with high affinity (reviewed in Refs. 29-40). This binding results in an inhibition of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. FK506 is a macrolide (cyclic ester) that is structurally distinct from CsA but also blocks T-cell activation in the same way as CsA (reviewed in Refs. 34 and 46). FK506 does not bind to CyPA, but it does bind to FKBP12. Both CsA-CyPA and FK506-FKBP12 bind to and inhibit protein phosphatase 2B, the cellular target of calcineurin. To determine whether CsA has any effect on YY1-CyPA interaction, we transfected pGal4DBD-CyPA, pYY1/VP16, and pG5E1BCAT into HeLa cells and added different amounts of CsA into the media. As shown in Fig. 3A, CsA inhibited the YY1-CyPA interaction in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, FK506 inhibited the interaction between YY1 and FKBP12 (Fig. 3B). In both of these experiments, the concentrations of CsA and FK506 are below the cellular toxicity levels(64Berger R. Majdic O. Meingassner J.G. Knapp W. Immunopharmacology. 1982; 5: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 65Reem G.H. J. Autoimmun. 1992; 5: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Figure 3:CsA and FK506 block binding of YY1 to CyPA and FKBP12, respectively. Transfections of pGal4DBD-CyPA (A and C), pGal4DBD-FKBP (B and C), pGal4DBD-VP16 (C), pYY1/VP16 (A-C), and pG5E1BCAT (A-C) into HeLa cells and CAT assays were performed as described for Fig. 2. CsA or FK506 was added to the culture medium 4-8 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To be certain that the inhibition of interaction observed is not due to a general inhibitory effect of the two drugs, we repeated the transfection experiments but switched the two drugs. Specifically, we transfected HeLa cells with pG5E1BCAT, pGal4DBD-CyPA, and pYY1/VP16, followed by treatment with 1000 ng/ml FK506 but not CsA. As expected, FK506 did not affect CyPA-YY1 interaction (Fig. 3C, lane9). Similarly, CsA did not affect FKBP-YY1 interaction because cells treated with 500 ng/ml CsA and transfected with pG5E1BCAT, pGal4DBD-FKBP, and pYY1/VP16 did not result in a reduction of CAT activity (Fig. 3C, lane5). Furthermore, neither 500 ng/ml CsA nor 1000 ng/ml FK506 inhibited activation of pG5E1BCAT by Gal4 DBD-VP16 (Fig. 3C, lanes1-3). These two sets of experiments, then, strongly argue that inhibition of CyPA-YY1 interaction by CsA and inhibition of FKBP-YY1 interaction by FK506 is not due to a generally nonspecific effect of the two drugs.CyPA and FKBP12 Enhance Transcriptional Repression Mediated by YY1-binding SitesTo determine the effects of CyPA and FKBP12 on YY1-related transcription, plasmids pP5-60(mt2)SVECAT and pP5-60SVECAT were transfected into HeLa cells separately in the presence or absence of another plasmid expressing either CyPA or FKBP12. In agreement with our earlier study(21Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), the presence of YY1-binding sites 5′ to the transcriptional control region of the SV40 promoter/enhancer repressed transcription (Fig. 4, compare lanes1 and 4). Interestingly, overexpression of CyPA but not FKBP12 caused an increase in CAT activity in the absence of YY1-binding sites (compare lane1 to lanes2 and 3). However, in the presence of YY1-binding sites, both CyPA and FKBP12 repressed transcription (compare lane4 to lanes5 and 6). Subtracting the effects of CyPA and FKBP12 on the SV40 promoter/enhancer, there is a 4- and 20-fold reduction in CAT activity, respectively. In summary, overexpression of CyPA and FKBP12 represses transcription from the SV40 promoter/enhancer containing YY1-binding sites.Figure 4:Overexpression of CyPA or FKBP12 can repress transcription from YY1-binding sites. HeLa cells were cotransfected with 5 μg each of pP5-60(mt2)SVECAT (lanes 1-3) or pP5-60SVECAT (lanes 4-6) and pCMV-CyPA or pCMV-FKBP, as indicated. All transfections and CAT assays were done as described for Fig. 1 and under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FKBP12 Can Reverse Transcriptional Repression by YY1Previously, we have shown that a Gal4 DBD-YY1 fusion protein represses transcription when directed to a promoter containing Gal4-binding sites and that the adenovirus E1A or nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 can relieve the repression(21Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 27Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6506-6510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of FKBP12 on YY1-induced transcriptional repression, we targeted YY1 to a promoter containing Gal4-binding sites and cotransfected a plasmid expressing FKBP12. As shown in Fig. 5B (lane3), the addition of a plasmid that expressed FKBP12 relieved the repression by YY1 and further activated CAT expression. This is somewhat surprising given the fact that in the previous experiment overexpression of FKBP12 can further repress a YY1-binding site (Fig. 4).Figure 5:FKBP12 can relieve YY1-induced transcriptional repression. A, schematic drawing of plasmids used in transfection assays.

https://openalex.org/W2094694252,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent, membrane-associated, myristoylated enzyme, which has an important role in regulation of vascular tone and platelet aggregation. In this study, wild-type and mutant forms of bovine eNOS were overexpressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system and examined for interactions with membrane phospholipids. Purified wild-type eNOS binds to pure anionic phospholipid vesicles but not to neutral phospholipid vesicles, demonstrating that eNOS attachment to lipid bilayers requires electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, catalytic activity of the enzyme is potently inhibited by anionic phospholipids, notably phosphatidylserine (PS), but not by neutral phospholipids. eNOS activity is also significantly inhibited upon enzyme binding to biological membranes isolated from cultured cells. Binding of eNOS to PS vesicles prevents subsequent binding of the enzyme to CaM-Sepharose. Interactions of eNOS with PS are not affected by site-specific mutation of the myristic acid acceptor site in the enzyme. Deletional mutation of the eNOS CaM-binding domain, however, results in loss of binding capacity of the enzyme not only for CaM-Sepharose but also for PS vesicles. Furthermore, removal of the CaM-binding domain converts eNOS from a membrane to a cytosolic protein when the enzyme is expressed in Sf9 cells. These data demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between anionic membrane phospholipids and basic residues in the eNOS CaM-binding domain are important for enzyme membrane association. Membrane association can thus function to inhibit eNOS catalytic activity by interfering with the interaction of the enzyme with calmodulin.

Binding of eNOS to PS vesicles prevents subsequent binding of the enzyme to CaM-Sepharose. Interactions of eNOS with PS are not affected by site-specific mutation of the myristic acid acceptor site in the enzyme. Deletional mutation of the eNOS CaM-binding domain, however, results in loss of binding capacity of the enzyme not only for CaM-Sepharose but also for PS vesicles. Furthermore, removal of the CaM-binding domain converts eNOS from a membrane to a cytosolic protein when the enzyme is expressed in Sf9 cells. These data demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between anionic membrane phospholipids and basic residues in the eNOS CaM-binding domain are important for enzyme membrane association. Membrane association can thus function to inhibit eNOS catalytic activity by interfering with the interaction of the enzyme with calmodulin. Nitric oxide is synthesized in diverse mammalian tissues by three different isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)1 1The abbreviations used are: NOSnitric oxide synthaseeNOSendothelial nitric oxide synthasenNOSneuronal nitric oxide synthaseiNOSinducible nitric oxide synthase(-myr)eNOSnon-myristoylated eNOSCaMcalmodulinBAECbovine aortic endothelial cell(s)PSphosphatidylserinePAphosphatidic acidCLcardiolipinPIphosphatidylinositolPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolamineSMsphingomyelinLPClysophosphatidylcholinePCRpolymerase chain reactionCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

In blood vessels, endothelial NOS (eNOS) plays a key role in regulation of vascular tone and platelet aggregation. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) is involved in neurotransmission in the brain and peripheral nervous system, while the cytokine-inducible NOS (iNOS) is an important mediator of the tumoricidal and bactericidal actions of macrophages. Each of the three NOS isoforms is similar in structure and function and catalyzes the oxidation of L-arginine to produce NO and L-citrulline via a complex reaction involving NADPH, FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and a p450-type heme moiety(2Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary structures of each of the enzymes contain conserved consensus sequences for binding of heme, calmodulin (CaM), FMN, FAD, and NADPH (3Sessa W.C. J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The presence of a putative CaM-binding domain in iNOS is intriguing, since iNOS (in contrast to eNOS and nNOS) is a Ca2+-independent enzyme. CaM appears to function as a subunit of iNOS, however, remaining tightly bound to the enzyme even in the absence of elevated intracellular Ca2+(4Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A.

Busse R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since the distribution of eNOS activity in various membrane fractions closely resembles that of the plasma membrane marker, 5′-nucleotidase, it has been suggested that most, if not all, eNOS in endothelial cells is specifically associated with the plasma membrane(6Hecker M. Mülsch A. Bassenge E. Förstermann U. Busse R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, it is speculated that membrane association of eNOS may have a role in coupling the enzyme's activation to cell surface receptors or to physical stimuli such as hemodynamic fluid shear stress. It has further been suggested (7Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that membrane association of eNOS is due to the presence of an N-myristoylation consensus sequence (MGXXXS), a sequence not present in either iNOS or nNOS. Site-directed mutagenesis of the myristic acid acceptor site (Gly-2) converts eNOS from a membrane to a cytosolic protein in transfected COS-7 cells(7Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Myristoylation may not be the only mechanism responsible for membrane attachment of eNOS. The Gibbs free energy for binding of a myristoylated peptide to a phospholipid vesicle is 8 kcal/mol, equivalent to an apparent KD of 100 μM(11Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Myristoylation alone, therefore, is probably not sufficient for stably anchoring a protein to a cellular membrane(12Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Indeed, many myristoylated proteins are cytosolic(13Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated proteins that are membrane-associated often interact with membranes, not only through hydrophobic interactions between protein and membrane fatty acyl chains, but also through interactions of positively charged protein residues with negatively charged membrane phospholipids. Furthermore, it appears that a substantial fraction of both neuronal NOS (14Hiki K. Hattori R. Kawai C. Yui Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Hecker M. Mülsch A. Busse R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and macrophage-inducible NOS (16Vodovotz Y. Russell D. Xie Q.W. Bogdan C. Nathan C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar) is also localized to membranes. Since these enzymes lack an N-myristoylation site, it is clear that properties of NOS other than myristoylation can mediate enzyme membrane association. Therefore, in this study we have investigated in detail the interactions of the eNOS enzyme with phospholipids present in membranes and have determined the functional consequences of these interactions on enzyme catalytic activity. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells, baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393, and Baculogold viral DNA were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Grace's insect cell culture medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and CaM-Sepharose were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). AG 50W-X8 cation exchange resin, electrophoresis reagents, and Bradford protein dye reagent came from Bio-Rad. L-[14C]Arginine, [3H]myristic acid, [3H]palmitic acid, and ECL detection kit were purchased from Amersham Corp, and EN3HANCE was purchased from DuPont NEN. Anti-eNOS antibody was a product of Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and Sequenase 2.0 was a product of U. S. Biochemical Corp. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The cDNA sequence encoding bovine eNOS (17Nishida K. Harrison D.G. Navas J.P. Fisher A.A. Dockery S.P. Uematsu M. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Murphy T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the transfer vector pVL1393. Recombinant transfer vector was then cotransfected with Baculogold viral DNA into Sf9 insect cells, and a high titer recombinant viral stock was obtained and used for subsequent infection of Sf9 cells. Insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in Grace's medium supplemented with hemin chloride (3 μg/ml). Three days after infection, cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each antipain, aprotinin, bestatin, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and pepstatin A), 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Triton X-100 (Buffer A). Lysate was applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column. The column was washed with 20 volumes of Buffer B (Buffer A containing 20% glycerol but without Triton X-100), 20 volumes of Buffer B containing 0.5 M NaCl and 2 mM EGTA, and an additional 20 volumes of Buffer B alone. eNOS was eluted from the column with 10 mM NADPH in Buffer B. Following chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, eNOS protein was >95% pure as determined by Coomassie staining of purified proteins separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fatty acyl modifications of eNOS in Sf9 cells were detected by radiolabeling of cells with either [3H]myristate or [3H]palmitate. 5 h after addition of 1 mCi of either compound, Sf9 cells were harvested and eNOS was purified by 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose. Purified proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and gels were washed overnight in either 1 M Tris-HCl or 1 M hydroxylamine (pH 7.0). Radiolabel remaining in the gel was visualized by fluorography with EN3HANCE. Phospholipids in chloroform solution were dried to a thin film, resuspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and sonicated with a probe-type sonicator for 5 min. This method of phospholipid vesicle preparation yields a mixture of large unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles(18Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1980; 9: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Vesicles were also prepared from biological membranes. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and HeLa cells were grown to confluence, harvested, and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Unbroken cells were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Membranes in the supernatant were then pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 1 M KCl and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in Buffer B and stored at −70°C. Purified eNOS (1 μg) and either pure phospholipid vesicles (200 μM) or membrane vesicles (equivalent to 50 μg of protein) were mixed in a volume of 500 μl in Buffer B containing 100 mM NaCl. Mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 35°C. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl Buffer B and analyzed with supernatants on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie staining. For binding curves, PS vesicles (200 μM) were mixed with varying amounts of wild-type and (-myr)eNOS (1-36 μg) and binding was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay of pellets after centrifugation. Purified eNOS (1 μg) was mixed with varying amounts of pure phospholipid vesicles (0-500 μM), and activity was determined by the method of Bredt and Snyder(19Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar), which determines the rate of formation of L-[14C]citrulline from L-[14C]arginine (100 μM) in the presence of excess cofactors including Ca2+ (2 mM), CaM (200 units), NADPH (1 mM), FAD (4 μM), FMN (4 μM), and tetrahydrobiopterin (40 μM). Product (L-[14C]citrulline) was separated from substrate on Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange columns. Biological membrane effects on eNOS activity were determined by incubation of the enzyme (1 μg) with membranes (50 μg of protein) followed by centrifugation of the mixture at 100,000 × g for 30 min and assay of arginine-to-citrulline conversion activity in the resuspended membrane pellet. In some enzyme activity determinations, the products that were detected were the stable degradation products of NO, quantitated by a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. Binding capacities of various forms of eNOS for CaM was determined by CaM-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Purified eNOS (4 μg) was applied to a CaM-Sepharose column (1 ml), and the column was washed extensively with Buffer B containing 2 mM CaCl2. Bound eNOS was specifically eluted from the column with Buffer B containing 2 mM EGTA. Mutations were introduced into the wild-type bovine eNOS cDNA sequence (17Nishida K. Harrison D.G. Navas J.P. Fisher A.A. Dockery S.P. Uematsu M. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Murphy T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2092-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) by the splicing-by-overlap-extension technique(20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). In the (-myr) mutant, the glycine 2 codon (GGC) was mutated to an alanine codon (GCC). In the ΔCaM mutant, 60 nucleotides (coding for eNOS residues 493-512) were deleted. Incorporation of the desired mutations was confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing with Sequenase 2.0. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding either wild-type eNOS, (-myr)eNOS, or ΔCaM eNOS. Three days after infection, cells were harvested and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Unbroken cells were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min and the first supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain particulate (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. Following resuspension of the pellet to the original volume of the homogenate, equal volumes of supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-eNOS antibody. Bound antibody was visualized with the ECL detection system and autoradiography. Relative amounts of eNOS in the different fractions was quantitated by densitometry of autoradiograms. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the interactions between eNOS and membrane phospholipids and to determine the consequences of these interactions on eNOS activity. Comprehensive study of eNOS-phospholipid interactions, however, requires larger quantities of purified protein than can be routinely obtained from cultured endothelial cells(21Pollock J.S. Förstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system for overexpression of the bovine eNOS enzyme. Expression of heme-containing enzymes in a baculovirus system often requires hemin supplementation of the culture medium for expression of protein with high specific activity(22Asseffa A. Smith S.J. Nagata K. Gillette J. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This requirement has recently been demonstrated for baculovirus overexpression of nNOS(23Richards M.K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Harteneck C. Klatt P. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, addition of 3 μg/ml hemin chloride to the insect cell culture medium resulted in production of eNOS enzyme having a 3.3-fold higher specific activity than enzyme produced in the absence of hemin supplementation. Expressed protein was purified to >95% homogeneity by affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose(19Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, most properties of the purified overexpressed enzyme, including subunit molecular mass, km for L-arginine, Ca2+ and cofactor dependence, and inhibition by substrate analog inhibitors were identical to those previously reported for the BAEC enzyme(21Pollock J.S. Förstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The specific enzyme activity (146 nmol of L-citrulline produced/mg/min) determined by L-arginine to L-citrulline conversion was 10-fold higher than that reported previously. Similar specific activity was also determined using measurements of NO2− and NO3− (quantitated by chemiluminescence after vanadium/HCl reduction). The explanation for the higher enzyme activity in the present study compared to that reported previously remains unclear. It is likely that the ability to purify the baculovirus-expressed enzyme in highly concentrated solution avoids the thermal denaturation and inactivation characteristic of more dilute enzyme(25Stuehr D.J. Griffith O.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 287-346PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, purification by a single chromatography step allows for assay of purified protein within a few hours after beginning the purification procedure with less time for loss of activity.Table IProperties of purified bovine eNOS overexpressed in a baculovirus system eNOS expressed in Sf9 cells was similar to the BAEC enzyme in terms of its fatty acylation by myristate and palmitate(9Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were incubated with [3H]myristic acid, eNOS was purified, and incorporation of radiolabel into the protein was analyzed by fluorography of proteins separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. [3H]Myristate was incorporated into the protein and was stable to hydroxylamine treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the lipid is attached to the protein via an amide linkage. Sf9 cells were also labeled with [3H]palmitate, and acylation was determined by the same protocol used to study myristoylation. Radioactive palmitate was also incorporated into eNOS but was quantitatively removed by hydroxylamine treatment (data not shown), suggesting that lipid attachment occurs through an ester bond. The interaction of eNOS with specific membrane phospholipids was assessed by cosedimentation analysis. Phospholipid vesicles (each containing identical dioleoyl fatty acyl side chains) were formed from each of the eight most abundant membrane phospholipids(27Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1983: 207-253Google Scholar). These included the anionic (acidic, negatively charged) lipids phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA), cardiolipin (CL), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) and the neutral (zwitterionic) lipids phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Vesicles (200 μM) were mixed with purified eNOS (1 μg) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. Supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. eNOS selectively bound to phospholipid vesicles formed from anionic phospholipids (Fig. 1A) but not to vesicles formed from neutral phospholipids (Fig. 1B). Cosedimentation represented specific binding rather than aggregation or precipitation, since all minor contaminating proteins in the preparation remained in the supernatant fraction. Binding was Ca2+-independent, since no change in sedimentation was observed in the presence of 2 mM EGTA. Selective binding of eNOS to negative lipids (but not to neutral lipids) clearly demonstrates that eNOS attachment to membrane lipids requires electrostatic interactions in addition to hydrophobic interactions. Thus, although myristoylation (7Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and perhaps also palmitylation (26Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) may be required for eNOS membrane phospholipid binding, these modifications by themselves are not sufficient to completely account for the association. If fatty acylation alone were sufficient for binding, the enzyme should bind equally well to both neutral and negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. Phospholipid vesicles were also tested for their effects on eNOS catalytic activity. Anionic phospholipids (PS, PA, CL, and PI) inhibited enzyme activity with IC50 values of approximately of 6, 50, 45, and 350 μM, respectively (Fig. 2B). Neutral phospholipids (PC, PE, SM, and LPC) were completely without effect (Fig. 2A). Inhibition appears to be correlated with binding, since PS, PA, and CL vesicles demonstrated complete inhibition and complete binding while PI showed partial inhibition and partial binding. PS inhibition also appears to depend on arrangement of the phospholipids into a bilayer, since inhibition was completely reversed by subsequent addition of the detergents Triton X-100 (0.1%) and CHAPS (2 mM). The fact that full activity of PS-inhibited eNOS could be restored by subsequent addition of detergent demonstrates that inhibition is not simply a result of PS-promoted denaturation of the enzyme. If inhibition were due to denaturation, it would not be reversible. In order to confirm that the observed inhibition was not an artifact of baculovirus expression, eNOS was purified from BAEC(21Pollock J.S. Förstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). eNOS purified from BAEC was also potently inhibited by PS. Furthermore, solubilization of BAEC particulate fractions with Triton X-100 resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase in eNOS activity (specific activity was increased from 0.218 nmol/mg/min to 0.881 nmol/mg/min) confirming the observation previously made by Pollock et al.(21Pollock J.S. Förstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), who found a >4-fold increase in BAEC particulate eNOS activity following CHAPS solubilization. Detergent solubilization of particulate fractions apparently releases the enzyme from inhibitory interactions with anionic phospholipids. PS inhibition of eNOS probably has physiological significance, since the enzyme functions in endothelial cells in close association with the PS-rich inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. The inner leaflet of the endothelial cell plasma membrane may in fact have a PS content that approaches 50% of total inner leaflet phospholipid. This conclusion follows from the following two observations. First, whereas PS represents only 5% of total endothelial cell phospholipid (28Wey H.E. Jakubowski J.A. Deykin D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is found in mammalian cells almost exclusively in plasma membranes, which comprise 20% of the total cellular membranes. Intracellular membranes, representing the other 80% of cellular membranes, are almost completely devoid of PS(29Allan D. Kallen K.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 195-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Endothelial plasma membranes, therefore, may have a total PS content of up to 25%. Furthermore, endothelial cells and other vascular cells such as erythrocytes and platelets possess a lipid membrane asymmetry with all of the PS being segregated in the inner leaflet(30Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Aminophospholipid translocases (“flippases”) maintain an antithrombogenic surface on vascular cells by selectively transporting PS from the outer to the inner leaflet, which could thus consist of as much as 50% PS. Membrane association of eNOS, therefore, may hold the enzyme in an (at least partially) inactive state. Lack of binding of eNOS to neutral phospholipid vesicles suggests that fatty acid modifications (such as N-myristoylation) are not sufficient for attachment of the protein to lipid bilayers. Binding to anionic phospholipid vesicles, however, may require both electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic insertion of myristate into the membrane interior. In order to further define the role of eNOS N-myristoylation in binding to (and inhibition by) anionic phospholipids, a mutant of eNOS lacking the N-myristoylation site was expressed in the baculovirus system. PCR-based mutagenesis was used to replace the glycine 2 codon (GGC) with an alanine codon (GCC). The (-myr) mutant protein was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose chromatography. Sf9 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant protein were treated with [3H]myristate. Radiolabel was incorporated only into wild-type protein. No labeling was detected for the (-myr) mutant (data not shown). Specific activities of purified wild-type and mutant proteins were determined and found to be identical, indicating that myristoylation has no influence on activity of the isolated protein. Both proteins were also inhibited to the same extent by PS vesicles. To determine the apparent affinity of wild-type and (-myr)eNOS for PS vesicles, binding of varying amounts of the protein (1-36 μg) to 200 μM PS vesicles was quantitated and analyzed by the method of Scatchard(31Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar). Saturable binding curves (Fig. 3, panelsA and C) and apparent dissociation constants (KD values) determined by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3, panelsB and D) were very similar for the two proteins (Fig. 3). KD values for binding of wild-type and (-myr)eNOS were 1.0 and 1.5 μM, respectively, indicating that myristoylation is not required for eNOS binding to pure PS vesicles. Binding of eNOS to biological membrane vesicles prepared from BAEC, CHO cells, and COS-7 cells, however, has been shown previously to be dependent on enzyme myristate modification(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study suggests that the requirement for a hydrophobic component in the phospholipid interaction becomes less important when the percent anionic lipid in the phospholipid vesicle is increased to 10"
https://openalex.org/W1968613373,"The ζ isoform of protein kinase C (ζPKC) has been shown to be an important step in mitogenic signal transduction. Using a yeast interaction screen to search for potential novel substrates of ζPKC, we identified the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1). This protein specifically interacts with the catalytic domain of ζPKC but not with its regulatory region or with the full-length protein, or with a kinase-defective mutant of the ζPKC catalytic domain. In addition, no interaction was detected with other kinases such as Raf-1 or Mos, that, like ζPKC, are critically involved in signal transduction, or with the catalytic domain of ζPKC, which is the PKC isotype with the highest homology to ζPKC. hnRNPA1 is directly phosphorylated by both recombinant and native ζPKC, and this phosphorylation is increased when ζPKC is immunoprecipitated from mitogen-activated fibroblasts. As an additional control, hnRNPA1 is not phosphorylated appreciably by catalytic ζPKC or by a mixture of highly purified classical PKC isotypes maximally activated by phosphatidylserine and Ca2+. Treatment of quiescent cell cultures with a potent mitogen such as platelet-derived growth factor promotes a significant phosphorylation of hnRNPA1 in vivo that is impaired by expression of a dominant negative mutant of ζPKC. Furthermore, expression of a catalytically active ζPKC mutant phosphorylates hnRNPA1 in vivo. These findings suggest that ζPKC could be critically involved in a novel pathway that connects membrane signaling to nuclear regulatory events, at the level of RNA transport and processing. Results also shown here by using different ζPKC mutants suggesting the control of the cytoplasmic localization of hnRNPA1 by ζPKC. Also of potential functional relevance are the results demonstrating that the phosphorylation by ζPKC severely impairs both hnRNPA1 RNA binding and its ability to promote strand annealing in vitro. The ζ isoform of protein kinase C (ζPKC) has been shown to be an important step in mitogenic signal transduction. Using a yeast interaction screen to search for potential novel substrates of ζPKC, we identified the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1). This protein specifically interacts with the catalytic domain of ζPKC but not with its regulatory region or with the full-length protein, or with a kinase-defective mutant of the ζPKC catalytic domain. In addition, no interaction was detected with other kinases such as Raf-1 or Mos, that, like ζPKC, are critically involved in signal transduction, or with the catalytic domain of ζPKC, which is the PKC isotype with the highest homology to ζPKC. hnRNPA1 is directly phosphorylated by both recombinant and native ζPKC, and this phosphorylation is increased when ζPKC is immunoprecipitated from mitogen-activated fibroblasts.

Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Recent data demonstrated the important role played by ζPKC in gene transcription through the activation of NFκB (Diaz-Meco et al., 1993Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Diaz-Golpe V. Lain de Lera M.T. Alcam J. Payá C.V. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 1994a). The regulation of ζPKC differs from other members of its family. Thus, it is not activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (Ono et al., 1989Ono Y. Fuji T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), but it is dramatically stimulated in vitro by phosphoinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, both products of PI 3-kinase (Nakanishi et al., 1993Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which is a critical step in mitogenic signaling cascades (Valius and Kazlauskas, 1993Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ζPKC is activated in vitro by ceramide, the product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, and in vivo by sphingomyelinase (Lozano et al., 1994Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In addition, the direct association of ζPKC with Ras has recently been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. This is functionally relevant because the blockade of Ras function with a dominant negative mutant severely impairs the activation of ζPKC by mitogens (Diaz-Meco et al., 1994bDiaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the proposed role of ζPKC in the channeling of Ras signals in Xenopus oocytes (Dominguez et al., 1992Dominguez I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Berra E. Garcia de Herreros A. Cornet M.E. Sanz L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3776-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and mouse fibroblasts.2( 2G.

A critical issue in the understanding of the regulation of cell activation by ζPKC is the identification of functionally relevant substrates of this kinase. The finding reported here, that ζPKC directly associates through its catalytic domain and phosphorylates the hnRNPA1, is remarkable since it suggests a novel mechanism by which signals are transduced by ζPKC from the membrane to the nucleus. Rat brain ζPKCζ (residues 247-592) was amplified by PCR with primers 5′ and 3′ harboring EcoRI and SmaI sites, respectively, and then subcloned into the same sites of pGBT9 (Clontech), with the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused 5′ to ζPKCζ (pGBT9-ζPKCζ). The kinase-defective mutant (pGBT9-ζPKCCAT-MUT) was constructed as described for pGBT9-ζPKCζ, except that pSelectζPKCmut (Berra et al., 1993Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The full-length ζPKC was generated by PCR and subcloned into pGBT9 as described for ζPKCζ. The ζPKCREG construct (pGBT9-ζPKCREG; residues 1-245) was also amplified by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI site of pGBT9. To make pGBT9-Raf and pGBT9-Rafζ plasmids, the full-length or the catalytic domain of Raf-1 (residues 333-650) were obtained by PCR and then subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBT9. The pGBT9-ζPKCζ encodes the catalytic domain of mouse ζPKC and was obtained by PCR, using pCMVζPKC as a template and primers 5′-ATGAATTCTTGGGGCTGGATGAGTT-5′ and 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATA-3′. The PCR product was blunt-ended and digested with EcoRI, and then ligated to pGBT9 cut with EcoRI and SmaI. pCMVζPKC had been generated subcloning the entire XhoI fragment from pMTζPKC coding the full-length ζPKC, and ligated into the BstXI site of pRcCMV. The pMTζPKC construct was a gift of Dr. P. Parker (Imperial Cancer Research). The pGBT9-Mos plasmid was generated by subcloning the EcoRI-SalI fragment containing c-mos from pMAL-Mos into pGBT9. The pMAL-Mos construct was generously provided by Dr. J. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). The pGBT9-lamin (pLAM′5; Clontech) encodes a human lamin C/GAL4 DNA binding domain hybrid in pGBT9. pYTH9ζPKC and pYTH9-ζPKCcat contain the entire sequence and the catalytic domain of rat brain ζPKC, respectively. Both constructs were generated by PCR, using pBluescriptζPKC as a template and the following primers: 5′-GGAGAATTCCATGCCCAGCAGGACC-3′ and 5′- ATTCCCGGGTCACACGGACTCCTCA-3′ for ζPKC, and 5′-TCAGAATTCGGGGCTGCAAGACTTT-3′ and 5′-ATTCCCGGGTCACACGGACTCCTCA-3′ for ζPKCcat. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SmaI and subcloned into pYTH9 previously cut with the same enzymes. pYTH9ζPKCζ was obtained by PCR using pCMVζPKC as a template and primers 5′-ATCGGATCCCTTGGGGCTGGATGAGTT-5′ and 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATA-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NotI and subcloned into pYTH9 cut with BglII and NotI. The pYTH9 is a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged pYTH6 (Trp1 marker) derivative vector. To make pCDNA3-HA-hnRNPA1, the pCDNA3-HA was constructed as follows. Two pairs of complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized (Isogen Bioscience, The Netherlands), annealed, and ligated into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) digested with HindIII and EcoRI: 5′-AGCTTGCCGCCACCATGTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTAGCCTCCCGGGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCCCGGGAGGCTAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATACATGGTGGCGGCA-3′. To construct pCDNA3-HA-hnRNPA1, a fragment corresponding to the full-length human hnRNPA1 was obtained by PCR using pGADζCAT-17 as a template and primers: 5′-ATGAATTCCATGTCTAAGTCAGAGTCT-3′ and 5′-GTTGAAGTGAACTTGCGGGG-3′, digested with EcoRI, and subcloned into the EcoRI of pCDNA3-HA. All constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis, and the expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting. Expression plasmids for ζPKC catalytic and kinase-defective mutants have been described before (Berra et al., 1993Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S.

For the yeast two-hybrid screening, pGBT9-ζPKCζ was cotransformed with the human placenta cDNA library in the pGAD10 vector (Clontech) into the HF7c yeast strain, as described (Schiestl and Giest, 1989Schiestl R.H. Giest R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar; Hill et al., 1991Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (5791): 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and the transformants were plated to synthetic medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, containing 20 mM 3-amino-1,2,4, triazole. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 5 days. His+ colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay (Breeden and Nasmyth, 1985Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, the moistened membrane was covered with Saran Wrap and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens. The protein band of interest was identified, cut out, and soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mM acetic acid for 30 min at 37°C in a microcentrifuge tube. Afterward, the piece of membrane was washed with water extensively (5 x 1 ml) and once with freshly made 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Then, the membrane was incubated with 10 μg of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington) in 200 μl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) at 37°C. Two hours later, another 10 μg of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were added to the sample and incubated for another 2 h at 37°C. At the end of the reaction, 300 μl of water were added to the sample and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant (containing approximately 90% of the radioactivity) was transferred to a new tube and lyophilized in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. Once dried, peptides were oxidized in 50 μl of ice-cold performic acid for 60 min on ice. Afterward, 400 μl of water were added, and the sample was frozen on dry ice and lyophilized. This step was repeated once. Finally, the sample was dissolved in 5 μl of electrophoresis buffer (2.5% formic acid, 7.8% glacial acetic acid, pH 1.9), spotted on a TLC plate, and electrophoresed on the first dimension for 45 min at 1.0 kV in pH 1.9 buffer. Separation in the second dimension was achieved by ascending chromatography in the following phosphochromatography buffer: 37.5% n-butanol, 25% pyridine, 7.5% glacial acetic acid. After chromatography (12-14 h), the plates were dried in a fume hood, covered with Saran Wrap, and exposed to x-ray film using an intensifier screen. The MBP-hnRNPA1 fusion protein was made by subcloning the EcoRI fragment containing hnRNPA1 from pGADζCAT-17 into EcoRI-digested pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). The protein was expressed in JM101 Escherichia coli and purified by binding to amylose resin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MBP-hnRNPA1 was cleaved with factor Xa and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quiescent NIH-3T3 fibroblasts either untreated or stimulated with 30 ng/ml PDGF (15 min) were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with an anti-ζPKC antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.), either in the absence or in the presence of competing peptide as described previously (Berra et al., 1993Berra E.

In some experiments, immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with lysis buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl to remove adherent proteins. The kinase reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30°C in the immunoprecipitates in 20 ml of buffer A (35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM phenylphosphate), with 60 mM [γ-32P]ATP (2500 cpm/pmol) with 2 mg of either MBP, MBP-hnRNPA1, or glutathione S-transferase-IκB. Following this incubation, the reaction was stopped in sample buffer and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Yeast cells transformed with pYTH9ζPKC, pYTH9ζPKCζ, or pYTH9ζPKCζ were grown to an A600 of 1.0. Approximately 250 ml of cells were pelleted, washed once with ice water, and then frozen in dry ice/ethanol. Pellets were thawed on ice and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of a modified version of H buffer containing 10% glycerol, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM NaN3, 0.25 mM orthovanadate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml each of pepstatin A, chymostatin, and leupeptin. Cells were broken by adding acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) to the meniscus and vortexing five times in 30-s pulses. Fresh buffer (0.3 ml) was then added, and the samples were vortexed 30 s more. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was slightly clarified by a second centrifugation at 11000 x g for 10 min. Samples were immediately aliquoted and frozen at −80°C. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Yeast extracts (500 mg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 mg of anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) in modified H buffer at 4°C for 2 h. Twenty-five μl of protein G-Sepharose (at 0.1 mg/ml in modified H buffer) and samples were then rotated at 4°C for 1 h. Immune complexes were washed seven times with modified H buffer with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 M NaCl and once with kinase buffer. For kinase assays, 2 mg of recombinant bacterially expressed MBP-hnRNPA1, MBP, or myelin basic protein were used as substrate, as described above. The cPKC assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). The cPKC preparations used in these experiments were previously immunodepleted of any potential ζPKC contaminating activity they may contain. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection experiments were performed using 60-mm plates onto which 0.4 x 106 cells were seeded 1 day earlier. DNA (5 μg total) was applied using a calcium phosphate coprecipitate (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 12 h, the cells were Me2SO-shocked (15%) for 3 min, and fresh growth medium was added. After 24-48 h, cells were either untreated or incubated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 3 h. Afterward, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were allowed to swell for 5 min in ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 containing the protease inhibitors 0.5% aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and the RNase inhibitor RNasin (Promega). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, followed by 0.5% deoxycholate and 1% Tween 40, and the cells were homogenized by four passages through a 25-gauge needle. The nuclei were removed by brief low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the anti-hnRNPA1 monoclonal antibody 4B10. In another set of experiments, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected as above but were made quiescent by serum starvation by 24 h. During the last 8 h of incubation in serum-free medium, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (2.5 mCi/ml). Subsequently, cells were either untreated or stimulated with PDGF (30 ng/ml) for 10 min, after which they were extracted with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. Cell extracts (1 mg) with equal amounts of radioactivity were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim). Imunoprecipitates were extensively washed with radioimmune precipitation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated hnRNPA1 was detected by autoradiography in an InstantImager (Packard). Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated HA-hnRNPA1 were verified by anti-HA immunoblotting. The synthetic RNA oligonucleotide (Isogen Bioscience, Netherlands) A1 winner (Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) was 5′-end-labeled to a specific activity of 1 x 108/μg by label transfer from [γ>-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled RNA was subsequently purified by spin chromatography through G10 Sephadex (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Increasing amounts of recombinant hnRNPA1 phosphorylated by ζPKC in the presence or absence of ATP were added to 50 fmol of 32P-A1 winner in a total volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 20 min at 23°C, after which the mixture was filtered through a presoaked nitrocellulose filter. Each filter was washed with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and then dried. The amount of RNA retained on the filter was determined by liquid scintillation. RNAs were transcribed from pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). This vector was linearized with KpnI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of unlabeled nucleotides to obtain a 140-residue-long RNA, or with HindIII and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, to give a complementary 55-residue-long RNA. These RNAs were purified by NICK® columns (Pharmacia). Increasing amounts of recombinant hnRNPA1 phosphorylated by ζPKC in the presence or absence of ATP were incubated with 5 x 10-9M 140-residue RNA and 7 x 10-9M [32P]UMP-labeled 55-residue complementary RNA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mM NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM EDTA. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 25°C, and the samples were run on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. In order to identify potential substrates of ζPKC, the entire catalytic domain of rat ζPKC (ζPKCζ) was fused with the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein (pGBT9-ζPKCζ) to serve as the “bait.” A yeast expression cDNA library from human placenta was used for screening. Colonies that grew on yeast drop-out media lacking Leu, Trp, and His containing 20 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and that were blue when assayed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside colony filter assay were selected. Six positive colonies were obtained out of 2.5 x 106 screened. The expression of His3 and LacZ in these colonies was shown to depend on the GAL4 fusion protein by retransforming the recovered plasmids into yeasts containing the bait construct (see Fig. 1, a and b, and, for clone pGADζCAT-17). The sequence of that clone reveals that it encodes the full-length (nucleotides 35-1374) hnRNPA1 (Dreyfuss et al., 1993Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Piol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction between ζPKCζ and hnRNPA1 was tested with an unrelated molecule, pGBT9-lamin, which fails to transactivate the reporter constructs (Fig. 1c and). Of note, full-length ζPKC or the regulatory domain of ζPKC did not interact with hnRNPA1 (Fig. 1, d and e, and). This suggests that the interaction of hnRNPA1 with ζPKC takes place through the catalytic domain and that the regulatory region has autoinhibitory properties. That is consistent with the fact that the regulatory domain of ζPKC harbors the pseudosubstrate sequence whose autoinhibitory function has been extensively documented (Soderling, 1990Soderling T.R.

Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A point mutation of Lys257 to Trp, within the adenosine triphosphate binding site of ζPKC, completely abolishes its kinase activity and the ability to transduce signals (Berra et al., 1993Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested the binding of hnRNPA1 to the catalytic domain of a ζPKC kinase-defective mutant (plasmid pGBT9-ζPKCCAT-MUT). Fig. 1f and show the complete lack of interaction between both proteins, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of ζPKC is required to bind hnRNPA1. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine kinase with an overall structure similar to that of ζPKC (Ono et al., 1989Ono Y. Fuji T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Both kinases are critical components downstream of Ras in mitogenic cascades (Dominguez et al., 1992Dominguez I. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Neither the catalytic domain (Fig. 1g and) nor the full-length Raf-1 (Table I) interacts with hnRNPA1. On the other hand, the product of c-mos is another serine/threonine kinase critically involved, like Raf-1 and ζPKC, in mitogenic signal transduction in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells (Sagata et al., 1988Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Of note, Mos does not interact with hnRNPA1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1h and). These results strengthen the specificity of the observed interaction of ζPKCζ with hnRNPA1. Furthermore, the catalytic fragment of ζPKC (plasmid pGTB9ζPKCζ) did not interact with hnRNPA1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Table I). This finding is particularly striking due to the high degree of homology existing between the catalytic domains of ζ and ζ PKCs (55% identity at the amino acid level).Table I:β-Galactosidase activity induced by interaction between the catalytic domain of ζPKC and hnRNPA1 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that hnRNPA1 is actually a substrate of ζPKC, the phosphorylation of recombinant hnRNPA1 by recombinant ζPKC was determined. To this aim, the cloned insert hnRNPA1 was subcloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pMALc2 to prepare recombinant (MBP)-hnRNPA1 maltose-binding fusion protein. MBP-hnRNPA1 was bacterially expressed, affinity-purified in amylose columns, and obtained at 95% purity. In addition, ζPKC (both full-length and catalytic region) were subcloned into plasmid pYTH9 that allowed the expression of both proteins with the influenza HA protein epitope tag. The tagged proteins were immunopurified following their expression in yeast. The following results demonstrate the phosphatidylserine-dependent phosphorylation of recombinant MBP-hnRNPA1 (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus lane 2) but not of MBP (not shown) by recombinant full-length ζPKC. The catalytic active ζPKC mutant efficiently phosphorylated MBP-hnRNPA1 (Fig. 2A, lane 4) but not MBP (not shown) in a phosphatidylserine-independent manner. Interestingly, catalytic HA-tagged ζPKC was unable to phosporylate hnRNPA1 (Fig. 2B, lane 2), although it phosphorylated myelin basic protein (Fig. 2C, lane 2) to an extent comparable to that produced by phosphatidylserine-activated full-length ζPKC (Fig. 2, panels B and C, lanes 4 versus 5).

https://openalex.org/W2047898325,"Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) are iron-sensing proteins that bind to RNA stem-loop sequences known as iron-responsive elements (IREs) when cells are depleted of iron. Although IRPs have been shown to bind to IREs derived from ferritin and transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNAs in vitro, there has not been a direct demonstration of the impact of a recombinant IRP on the expression of endogenous IRE-containing transcripts. In this study, we evaluate the impact of expression of C437S, a mutant of IRP1 that binds IREs regardless of cellular iron status, on the regulation of biosynthesis of ferritin and TfR. Despite being made iron-replete, cells expressing C437S continue to synthesize and express high amounts of TfR, while the synthesis of ferritin is repressed. Thus, a single mutant IRP can prevent the usual homeostatic changes in ferritin and TfR biosynthesis. Cells expressing the mutant protein would therefore be predicted to be unable to defend against iron overload. Preliminary results show that cells treated with iron have diminished cell survival when C437S is expressed, and we have thus created a tissue culture model system for the study of iron toxicity."

Male rats were given intratracheal (i.t.) saline (PBS), a polyclonal anti-TNFα antibody (TNFab) or nonimmune IgG (22 mg/kg, i.m.) 2 h before giving i.t. Escherichia coli endotoxin (LPS) to normal rats or rats pretreated with ETOH (5.5 g/kg, i.p.) 30 min before experimentation. AM and PMN were obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) fluid of rats killed 2 and 4 h after administration of LPS. mRNA for inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and TNFα were measured in AM and PMN with competitor equalized RT-PCR techniques. The BAL fluid, AM, and PMN were assayed for TNFα and NO2–, and NO3– (RNI) with the L929 bioassay and chemiluminescence, respectively. TNFab abolished LPS-induced increases in TNFα but did not suppress the NO content of the BAL fluid or gene expression for iNOS by AM or PMN. ETOH suppressed LPS-induced increases in mRNA for iNOS, production of RNI, and BAL fluid TNFα but did not affect LPS-induced increases in mRNA for TNFα. ETOH-induced attenuation of LPS-induced up-regulation of the iNOS system did not differ in rats pretreated with TNFab or IgG. Thus, ETOH down-regulates iNOS gene expression and RNI production independent of its effects on TNFα.

By ribonuclease protection assay we have identified glucose and intracellular cAMP as regulators of glucagon receptor mRNA expression in cultured rat hepatocytes. We observed a concentration-dependent increase in glucagon receptor mRNA expression when hepatocytes were cultured in the presence of increasing glucose.

INTRODUCTIONA number of antibodies directed against antigens on the platelet membrane activate platelets (Horsewood et al., 1991). Whereas the antigens involved are diverse, the known antibodies with stimulatory properties are predominantly against CD9, a 24-kDa cell surface glycoprotein (Higashihara et al., 1985; Rendu et al., 1987; Jennings et al., 1990; Carroll et al., 1990), which is confirmed by the fact that most of the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs)1( 1The abbreviations used are: MoAbmonoclonal antibodyPGI2prostaglandin I2PTPprotein tyrosine phosphorylationPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) that induced rapid aggregation were directed against CD9, as presented at the platelet workshop of the IV Leucocyte Typing Conference in Vienna (Powling et al., 1989). Anti-CD9 MoAb is a potent activator of platelet function comparable to thrombin and induces the entire range of functions, including aggregation, granule secretion, protein phosphorylation, phosphoinositide hydrolysis with Ca2+ mobilization, and arachidonic acid metabolism. These findings suggested that CD9 is unique among platelet membrane glycoproteins and that it is a signal transducer. Molecular cloning of CD9 revealed that it is a multiply inserted membrane protein containing four putative transmembrane domains, suggesting that it could indeed be involved in signal transduction pathways (Boucheix et al., 1991) Various attempts have been made to clarify the mechanism by which anti-CD9 MoAbs activate platelets. Phospholipase A2 activation plays an important role but is not a prerequisite (Ozaki et al., 1991). CD9 physically associates with GPIIb/IIIa in the course of anti-CD9 MoAb-induced platelet activation (Slupsky et al., 1989). These studies were based upon the concept that the effects of anti-CD9 MoAbs are exerted through CD9. However, this concept was challenged by recent findings that F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD9 MoAbs lack the ability of platelet activation and that the blocking of the FcγII receptor by corresponding monoclonal antibodies inhibited aggregation and Ca2+ mobilization induced by anti-CD9 MoAbs (Slupsky et al., 1989; Worthington et al., 1990). Moreover, stimulation of the FcγII receptor by cross-linkage or by aggregated IgG presented a picture of platelet activation similar to that of MoAbs to CD9 (Henson and Spiegelberg, 1973; Anderson and Anderson, 1990). These findings imply that the signal transduction pathway is mediated entirely through the FcγII receptor, independent of CD9.There is an increasing body of evidence for an important role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation facilitated by tyrosine kinases in the regulation of cell functions, especially those related to cell growth and oncogenesis. While platelets lack the ability to proliferate, they possess a high level of tyrosine kinase activity. All platelet tyrosine kinases reported to date are non-receptor types, p60c-src being the most abundant (Rendu et al., 1989). In addition to p60c-src, several tyrosine kinases including p59fyn, p62yes, p54/58lyn, p72syk, and p125FAK have been identified (Huang et al., 1991; Lipfert et al., 1992). Upon platelet activation induced by various stimulators, a set of proteins undergo tyrosine phosphorylation (Nakamura and Yamamura, 1989; Salari et al., 1990). Although it is not yet clear which tyrosine kinase is responsible for a particular tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, several kinases change their activities upon platelet stimulation. The activity of p72syk is rapidly increased by 10-fold upon thrombin activation, reaching a maximum at 10 s (Taniguchi et al., 1993). Platelet activation also elevates the p60c-src activity, albeit to a lesser degree and with a slower time course (Wong et al., 1992). The activity of p125FAK appears to be modified even later by fibrinogen binding to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa on the platelet membrane (Lipfert et al., 1992). These lines of evidence suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation and tyrosine kinases are actively engaged in the regulation of platelet functions from the initial phase of activation to the late stage of aggregation.Recently, we found that anti-CD9 MoAb induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation and that there is an increased level of 3′-phosphorylated polyphosphoinositides, the production of which is physiologically related to tyrosine kinase activity (Yatomi et al., 1993). In this study, we investigated the changes in p72syk activity induced by anti-CD9 MoAb with reference to protein tyrosine phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and ChemicalsMoAb against p72syk, p59fyn, or p54/58lyn was obtained from Wako Chemicals (Tokyo). MoAbs against p60c-src(GD11) and phosphotyrosine (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Acetoxymethyl ester of fura 2 were from Dojin Chemicals (Kumamoto, Japan). GRGDS peptides were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). EGTA, enolase, prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sodium orthovanadate were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose and CNBr-activated Sepharose were from Pharmacia Japan (Tokyo). Hepes buffer containing 138 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 0.8 mM KH2PO4, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), and 5.5 mM glucose was sterilized by filtration and stored at 4°C until use. NNKY 1-19, anti-CD9 MoAb, was raised by immunizing mice with human platelets (Nagata et al., 1990). Another anti-CD9 MoAb, PMA2, was a generous gift from Dr. Takaaki Hato (Ehime University, Japan) (Hato et al., 1990). F(ab′)2 fragments of NNKY 1-19 or PMA2 were prepared by pepsin digestion (Lamoyi and Nisonoff, 1983). Briefly, NNKY 1-19 was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 7.0. Pepsin (3% w/w) was added, and the mixture was incubated in acetate buffer, pH 4.2, for 12 h at 37°C. The solution was fractionated on a Sephadex G150 column to obtain F(ab′)2 fragments, and the purity of the F(ab′)2 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.Platelet SeparationCitrated, anti-coagulated venous blood was obtained from healthy human donors who had not received any medication for a minimum of two weeks prior to the experiment. The blood was centrifuged at 160 × g for 15 min to obtain platelet-rich plasma. Platelets were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (Golden and Brugge, 1989) and finally resuspended at a concentration of 109 cells/ml in Hepes buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+ unless otherwise stated.Preparation of Fura 2-loaded Platelets and Measurement of [Ca2+]iTo platelet-rich plasma obtained as described above, fura 2-AM at a final concentration of 3 μM was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The platelets were then washed twice, and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/μl. Fura 2 fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer, with an excitation wavelength alternating every 0.5 s from 340 to 380 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 510 nm. The [Ca2+]i values were determined from the ratio of fura 2 fluorescence intensity at 340 and 380 nm excitation (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985).Immunoprecipitation Kinase AssayThe platelets were activated with anti-CD9 MoAb or its F(ab′)2 fragments with constant stirring unless otherwise stated. After the indicated periods of time, the reaction was terminated with an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was sonicated and separated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was precleared with Sepharose beads twice and then mixed with anti-p72syk antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose or CNBr-activated Sepharose. The mixture was rotated for 2 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The sample was then split into two portions. One was used for immunoblotting, described elsewhere, and the other was processed further for in vitro kinase assay. In vitro kinase assay was performed essentially as described (Clark and Brugge, 1993). The beads were washed once with low salt buffer (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) incubated with 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MnCl2) with or without 10 μg of acid-treated enolase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μM ATP. After 10 min at 20°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and then subjected to boiling for 3 min. The proteins were separated under reducing conditions by 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE and electrically transferred onto Clear Blot Membrane P (Atto, Tokyo). The membrane was treated with 1 M KOH for 60 min, dried, and quantified with a BAS-2000 Phosphorimager (Fuji Film, Japan).Protein Analysis by ImmunoblottingLaemmli sample buffer was added to platelets activated with anti-CD9 MoAb for the indicated periods, and then the mixture was boiled for 3 min. In some experiments, proteins separated for immunoprecipitation kinase assay were similarly processed. Platelet proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Clear Blot Membrane P (Atto, Tokyo). The immunoblots were incubated with 1 μg/ml MoAb directed to phosphotyrosine or p60c-src for 3 h. Antibody binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, PA) and visualized with ECL detection reagents (Amersham, UK).RESULTSPTP Induced by NNKY 1-19, Anti-CD9 MoAbIn the presence of 1 mM extracellular Ca2+ and without aspirin, NNKY 1-19 at concentrations as low as 1 μg/ml induced platelet aggregation, [Ca2+]i elevation, and serotonin release (Nagata et al., 1990). The optimal concentration of NNKY 1-19 varied among individuals tested but usually fell in the range of 3 to 10 μg/ml. In experiments thereafter, NNKY 1-19 was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Upon NNKY 1-19 stimulation, a set of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins appeared with different profiles in the time course (Fig. 1A). A 75-kDa band appeared as early as 30 s after stimulation and tended to disappear after several minutes. The appearance of 97- and 125-kDa bands was a late event and probably corresponded to those alleged to be related to aggregation in thrombin-induced platelet activation (Golden et al., 1990), since these bands of PTP did not appear when platelets were treated with GRGDS (data not shown). F(ab′)2 fragments of NNKY 1-19 up to a concentration of 30 μg/ml had no effects on platelets in terms of the appearance of PTP (Fig. 1B), aggregation, or [Ca2+]i elevation, confirming that stimulation of FcγII receptors is required for the full picture of platelet activation (Worthington et al., 1990).Effects of Various Inhibitors on PTP Induced by NNKY 1-19We previously found that extracellular Ca2+ and the production of thromboxane A2 greatly facilitate platelet activation induced by a MoAb to CD9 (Ozaki et al., 1991). Thus, the effects of chelating extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA and of aspirin were evaluated on NNKY 1-19-induced [Ca2+]i elevation and PTP. Platelets in platelet-rich plasma were treated with 0.5 mM aspirin for 30 min and then washed and resuspended in Hepes buffer containing 200 μM EGTA and no Ca2+. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ and aspirin pretreatment markedly reduced [Ca2+]i elevation induced by NNKY 1-19 (0.3 ± 0.2 versus 4.8 ± 1.1 in terms of Fura 2 fluorescence ratio). The appearance of 75-kDa PTP band was delayed, but in contrast to the control sample with extracellular Ca2+ and no aspirin, the intensity of PTP persisted for up to 3 min (data not shown). The 97- and 125-kDa bands were barely, if at all, detectable.We then evaluated the effect of PGI2 on NNKY 1-19-induced PTP. PGI2 raises the intracellular cAMP level, which attenuates PTP induced by thrombin (Pumiglia et al., 1990). Incubating platelets with 0.4 μM PGI2 for 5 min completely abrogated the appearance of PTP, aggregation, and [Ca2+]i elevation induced by NNKY 1-19 (data not shown).NNKY 1-19 Stimulation Induces a Transient Rise in p72syk-associated Tyrosine Kinase Activity with Concomitant Association of p60c-NNKY 1-19 stimulation increased the level of p72syk autophosphorylation, which peaked 10-60 s after stimulation and subsided to lower level thereafter (Fig. 2, upperpanel). Densitometry revealed a 1.5-3-fold increase, which was substantially lower than that for thrombin activation (Taniguchi et al., 1993). The autophosphorylated amino acid of p72syk was exclusively tyrosine (Ohta et al., 1992 and data not shown). Concomitant with the change in autophosphorylation, in vitro kinase assays revealed that the tyrosine kinase activity for exogenous substrates was increased transiently along with the faint band of a 60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (Fig. 2, lowerpanel). Western blotting using anti-p60c-src MoAb revealed that the 60-kDa band was p60c-src (Fig. 3), suggesting that p60c-src transiently associates with p72syk upon NNKY 1-19-induced platelet activation. Unlike anti-p72syk, anti-p59fyn MoAb or anti-p54/58lynMoAb did not coprecipitate p60c-src, suggesting that p60c-src specifically associates with p72syk during platelet activation induced by anti-CD9 MoAb (data not shown).Figure 2:p72-associated tyrosine kinase activity induced by anti-CD9 MoAb. Platelets suspended in a buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+ were activated with 10 μg/ml NNKY 1-19 for the indicated periods. The reaction was terminated with lysis buffer, and p72 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-p72 MoAb.

However, in contrast to an early decay in the p72syk activity and the early dissociation of the 60-kDa band from p72syk, the F(ab′)2-induced process was persistent up to 5 min after stimulation (Fig. 4). At this time, the autophosphorylated level of p72syk and the associated 60-kDa PTP was often greater than the maximum level attained by intact IgG of NNKY 1-19. Western blotting with anti-p60c-srcMoAb revealed the persistent p60c-srcassociation with p72syk (data not shown). That the preparation of F(ab′)2 fragments was not contaminated with intact antibody was confirmed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, IV.3, an anti-FcγII receptor MoAb, was used to block Fc receptor activation induced by residual, if any, intact antibody. The absence of inhibitory effects of IV.3 on the increased tyrosine kinase activity induced by F(ab′)2 fragments of NNKY1-19 suggests that F(ab′)2 fragments of NNKY1-19 are capable of activating p72syk (Fig. 5). To reinforce the notion that F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD9 MoAb induce p72syk activation in platelets, the effects of another CD9 MoAb, PMA2 (Hato et al., 1990), were evaluated on the changes in p72syk-associated tyrosine kinase activity and the association between p72syk and p60c-src. Fig. 6 shows that the effects of intact IgG PMA2 or the F(ab′)2 fragments of PMA2 were essentially similar to those of NNKY 1-19. A transient increase in the autophosphorylated level of p72syk and the association between p72syk and p60c-src was observed with intact antibody, and these processes were persistent with the F(ab′)2 fragments.Figure 4:The p72-associated tyrosine kinase activity induced by F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD9 MoAb compared with that by intact IgG.

The overall tyrosine kinase activity associated with p72syk was still detectable at 60 s after stimulation albeit to a lesser degree than that at 10 s (Fig. 7A). Western blotting using anti-p60c-src MoAb showed that the association of p60c-src with p72syk was also slightly extended (Fig. 7B). However, the general profile of changes in p72syk-associated tyrosine kinase including a transient increase in p72sykautophosphorylation and the transient association of p60c-src with p72syk, followed by a marked decrease in kinase activity and the complete dissociation of p60c-src, was essentially similar to that of the control sample without aspirin.Figure 7:The effects of aspirin pretreatment on p72-associated tyrosine kinase activity and association between p72 and p60c- induced by anti-CD9 MoAb.

Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with 2 mM EGTA and 200 μM GRGDS peptide to inhibit platelet aggregation did not suppress p72syk activation in terms of its autophosphorylation and the in vitro kinase activity (Fig. 8, A and B). However, a decrease in the tyrosine kinase activity, which appears 3-5 min after stimulation, was not observed in the absence of aggregation.Figure 8:Effects of GRGDS peptides on p72 autophosphorylation and p72-associated tyrosine kinase activity induced by anti-CD9 MoAb.

The elevated level of tyrosine kinase activity persisted even at 5 min after activation, and the association of p60c-src with p72syk as assessed by Western blotting showed no phase of dissociation (Figs. 9 and 10).DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have suggested that the platelet activation induced by anti-CD9 MoAb is largely dependent upon FcγII receptor stimulation. F(ab′)2 fragments that lack the ability to stimulate the FcγII receptor did not induce [Ca2+]i elevation or release of intracellular granule contents (Worthington et al., 1990). PTP induced by anti-CD9 MoAb was inhibited by preincubation of the platelets with anti-FcRII MoAb (Huang et al., 1992). Based upon the fact that direct FcγII receptor stimulation, such as that caused by the cross-linkage of the receptors, is sufficient to induce platelet activation, it has been doubted whether the binding of anti-CD9 MoAb to CD9 molecules on the platelet membrane by itself elicits any signal that leads to platelet activation. It could only serve to prompt the binding of the Fc portion of MoAb to the FcγII receptor. This study confirmed, using NNKY1-19, an anti-CD9 MoAb (Nagata et al., 1990), the previous findings that the binding of MoAb to CD9 in the absence of FcγII receptor stimulation did not induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation or platelet aggregation but also showed that F(ab′)2 fragments of NNKY1-19 per se elicited intracellular signals in terms of p72sykactivation and the association of p60c-src with p72syk. The effect of residual intact antibody was ruled out by the use of IV.3, anti-FcγII receptor MoAb. Furthermore, that the F(ab′)2 fragments of another anti-CD9 MoAb, PMA2 (Hato et al., 1990), are capable of activating p72syk reinforces the notion that antibody binding to CD9 alone can elicit a signal(s) leading to p72syk activation. Griffith et al.(1991) have proposed that CD9 molecules induce an activation signal in platelets, based upon their study with immobilized anti-CD9 MoAb F(ab′) fragments. The association between CD9 and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in platelets (Slupsky et al., 1989) and that with CD9 and the diphtheria toxin receptor in Vero cells (Mitamura et al., 1992) implies that CD9 molecules exert a regulatory function for various cell surface receptors. Our findings may provide a biochemical basis for the proximal signal that CD9 molecules generate within platelets. Several non-receptor tyrosine kinases have been found to associate with cell surface molecules (Samelson et al., 1990; Hatakeyama et al., 1991). A more recent finding provides evidence for the close association between B-cell antigen receptor and p72syk (Yamada et al., 1993). In platelets, p59fyn, p62yes, and p54/58lyn associate with CD36 (Huang et al., 1991). We have found that p72syk specifically associates with p60c-src during platelet activation induced by CD9 MoAb. By analogy to other cell types, it is tempting to postulate that CD9 or some other related membrane protein"

Besides being found abundantly in retina, norpA gene products are expressed in a variety of tissues that do not contain phototransduction machinery, implying that norpA is involved in signaling pathways in addition to phototransduction. We have identified a second subtype of norpA protein that is generated by alternative splicing of norpA RNA.

Results from Northern analyses suggest that norpA subtype I transcripts are most abundantly expressed in adult retina, while subtype II transcripts are most abundant in adult body. Moreover, norpA subtype I RNA can be detected by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in extracts of adult head tissue but not adult body nor at earlier stages of Drosophila development. Conversely, norpA subtype II RNA can be detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction throughout development as well as in heads and bodies of adults. Furthermore, norpA subtype I RNA is easily detected in retina using tissue in situ hybridization analysis, while subtype II RNA is not detectable in retina but is found in brain. Since only norpA subtype I RNA is found in retina, we conclude that subtype I protein is utilized in phototransduction.

Acta. 1991; 1092: 49-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PLC enzymes have been grouped into four major classes (PLC-α, PLC-β, PLC-γ, and PLC-δ), based on immunological and structural differences (Rhee et al., 1989Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The PLC-β, PLC-γ, and PLC-δ enzymes have been further classified into subgroups (PLC-β1 through PLC-β4, PLC-γ1 through PLC-γ3, and PLC-δ1 through PLC-δ3) based on differences in amino acid sequence and that each subtype is encoded by a separate gene (Rhee and Choi, 1992aRhee S.G.

Emerging evidence indicates that an additional level of diversity exists beyond the subgroup classifications because individual genes have been shown to encode multiple PLC products by alternative splicing of RNA (Shortridge et al., 1991Shortridge R.D.

PLC-β activation appears to be modulated by canonical heptahelical receptors coupled to G-proteins, while PLC-γ enzymes appear to be coupled to growth factor receptors via tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. It is thought that individual PLCs within a class are coupled to a single type of receptor (eg. G-protein-coupled receptors), yet this has not been proven because so few PLC subtypes have been linked to a particular receptor or cellular process in vivo. Moreover, it is unknown whether splice-variant subtypes of PLC are utilized in the same signaling pathway, a particular type of signaling pathway, or in completely diverse and separate signaling pathways. A PLC for which a function in vivo has been identified is encoded by the norpA gene of Drosophila melanogaster. Strong mutations in the norpA gene have long been known to abolish the photoreceptor potential, rendering the fly blind (Hotta and Benzer, 1970Hotta Y. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; Pak et al., 1970Pak W.L. Grossfield J. Arnold K. Nature. 1970; 227: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The identification of the norpA gene product as a PLC emerged from findings that norpA mutations severely reduce PLC activity in eye (Yoshioka et al., 1985Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Hotta Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1251-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that the deduced protein is similar in structure and amino acid sequence to mammalian PLC (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T.

These findings, along with a large body of evidence indicating that invertebrate phototransduction is mediated by PLC, led to the conclusion that the norpA gene encodes a PLC that is utilized in phototransduction in Drosophila (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T.

However, norpA is also known to be a complex gene whose expression is not limited to the retina nor utilized exclusively in phototransduction. Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar demonstrated that the norpA gene is expressed in embryo, adult body (thorax and abdomen), leg, and brain, as well as retina. Since body, leg, and brain are not known to contain visual machinery, it was proposed that the norpA-encoded PLC is utilized in signaling pathways in addition to phototransduction.

An advantage of using the norpA mutant of Drosophila as a model to study PLC function is that it is much easier to deduce the identity of the signaling pathways involved by examining the mutant phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that the norpA gene encodes at least two subtypes of PLC by alternative splicing of the nascent RNA and that each is likely to be utilized in completely different signaling pathways. D. melanogaster white (wA35) mutant was used in all experiments as a control group because it lacks visual pigment, which can interfere with some assays, and its genetic background is most similar to that of norpA mutants used in experiments. Hereafter, wA35 is referred to as wild type because it is wild type for norpA expression. The norpAP24/w mutant was used in all studies as a negative control and is known to exhibit total blindness (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C.

McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The norpAP24 mutant is known to express small amounts of norpA RNA.2 2S. Kim, R. R. McKay, K. Miller, and R. D. Shortridge, unpublished results. The eya (eyes absent) mutant (Bonini et al., 1993Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), which completely lacks compound eyes, was used for comparisons to identify norpA gene products that are expressed in eye. norpA cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcribing Drosophila poly(A)+ RNA followed by amplifying the norpA cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Fuqua et al., 1990Fuqua S.A.W. Fitzgerald S.D. McGuire W.L. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA used as template for RT-PCR was prepared from eya mutant body (thorax and abdomen) and leg according to methods described by Shortridge et al., 1991Shortridge R.D. Yoon J.Y. Lending C. Bloomquist B.T. Perdew M. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12474-12480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. eya mutant was used as a source for body RNA to obviate the problem of having the preparations contaminated with tissue from the compound eye. Priming of the poly(A)+ RNA in reverse transcription reactions was done using oligo-d(T) as well oligonucleotide primers that are complementary to the norpA cDNA (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Amplification of norpA cDNA by PCR was carried out using three sets of oligonucleotide primers made to overlapping segments of the norpA cDNA (nucleotides 594-1956, 1796-2551, 2417-4051; numbering according to Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T.

During synthesis of the PCR primers, restriction endonuclease sites were added to the 5′-ends to facilitate cloning into plasmids (Kaufman and Evans, 1990Kaufman D.L. Evans G.A. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 304-306PubMed Google Scholar). Standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for cloning the amplified norpA cDNA fragments into plasmid vectors, transforming the recombinant plasmids into Escherichia coli, and determining the nucleotide sequence of the cloned inserts. A set of 34 oligonucleotide sequencing primers made against various regions along the norpA cDNA were used to facilitate sequencing of the cloned DNAs. To map the location of exons of norpA (3, 4, 4A, and 5) within ge-nomic DNA, a cosmid clone (COSM1) that contains the norpA gene (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) was used as template for PCR reactions. PCR was carried out on COSM1 DNA using oligonucleotide primers made to sites within exons. Location of the exons within the genomic DNA and approximate size of the intervening sequences was deduced by identifying and sizing the amplified products on agarose gels. Nucleotide sequences at intron/exon boundaries, as well as within the exons, was determined by carrying out DNA sequencing reactions on COSM1 DNA using oligonucleotide primers made against sites within the exons. Northern blots were carried out as described by Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar except that DNA probes were used. Probes were constructed by amplifying an 80-bp region of norpA cDNA corresponding to either exon 4 or exon 4A by the polymerase chain reaction (Innis et al., 1990Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragments were purified by fractionation on a 2% agarose gel and extraction of the DNA from an excised plug of agarose (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of the DNA probes were carried out by primer extension reactions using Klenow polymerase in the presence of [32P]dCTP (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA used as template for RT-PCR was prepared by grinding approximately 100 μg of tissue in 1 volume of homogenizing buffer (0.15 M sodium acetate, 5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9.0), volume of phenol, and volume of a mixture of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (100:1) (Montell et al., 1985Montell C. Jones K. Hafen E. Rubin G. Science. 1985; 230: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) using Teflon pestles in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Kontes). The homogenates were extracted once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, four times with phenol/chloroform (1:1), and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, followed by precipitation of the RNA in ethanol (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was resuspended in water, and its concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 260 nm (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of RNA was used as template for reverse transcription. Next, a 1,363-bp norpA cDNA fragment (nucleotides 594-1956) that encompasses the site of alternative splicing was amplified by PCR, and the amplified products were analyzed by Southern blotting after fractionating on 1% agarose gels (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The alternatively spliced norpA products were detected by hybridizing to digoxygenin-labeled 80-bp probes that comprise either norpA exon 4 or exon 4A. Digoxygenin labeling of probes, hybridization reactions, and visualization in nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate was carried out using the Genius system (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10-micron-thick frozen sections of adult head (0-4 days after eclosion) were prepared on glass slides as described by Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. In situ hybridization of norpA exon 4 or exon 4A probes to the tissue sections were carried out using modifications of the procedure of Tautz and Pfeifle, 1989Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar. Tissue sections were air dried for approximately 4 h after cutting followed by fixation for 20 min in a freshly made solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 × PBS (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.22). After fixing, tissues were rinsed in 3 × PBS and then 1 × PBS for 5 min each followed by dehydration in a graded (30-100%) ethanol series (Hafen et al., 1983Hafen E. Levine M. Garber R.L. Gehring W.J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and air drying for 2 h. The dried tissue sections were treated by rehydrating for 5 min in 1 × PBS and then immediately incubating in 0.2 N HCl for 20 min. The treated sections were then incubated in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 30 min at 65°C followed by digesting for 3 min in 1 × PBS containing 50 μg/ml proteinase K. Following proteinase K digestion, sections were incubated for 2 min in 1 × PBS containing 2 mg/ml glycine and then fixed as before in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After rinsing in PBS, tissues were acetylated by incubation in 500 ml of 0.1 M triethanolamine-Cl, pH 8.0, to which 0.625 ml of acetic anhydride had freshly been added. Sections were then rinsed twice in PBS for 5 min each, 2 × SSC for 5 min, and then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series as before. Probes were generated by terminal labeling of 80-bp DNA fragments that correspond to norpA exon 4 or exon 4A using terminal transferase in the presence of digoxygenin 11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer's instructions. The treated tissue sections were hybridized overnight at 37°C in hybridization solution (35% deionized formamide, 5% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution (0.2 mg/ml Ficoll, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone), 5 × SSC, 100 μg/ml salmon testes DNA, and 25 μg/ml E. coli tRNA), to which the digoxygenin-labeled DNA probe was added. Following hybridization, the slides were washed by incubating at 37°C in fresh hybridization solution for 20 min followed by incubations in 50% hybridization solution in 1 × PBS and then 1 × PBS for 20 min each. Visualization of the digoxygenin-labeled probe was carried out according to instructions in the Genius Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a chromogen. Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar proposed that the norpA-encoded PLC is not exclusively utilized in phototransduction because norpA expression is not solely found in retina but is also present in tissues not known to contain visual system machinery. Moreover, Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar identified at least three major sizes of norpA transcripts (one in adult eye and two in adult body), suggesting that norpA RNA is alternatively spliced. To ascertain whether norpA RNA encodes other subtypes of norpA protein, we utilized RT-PCR (Fuqua et al., 1990Fuqua S.A.W. Fitzgerald S.D. McGuire W.L. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain norpA cDNA from body (thorax and abdomen) and leg and then compared the nucleotide sequences of the amplified products to the head-specific cDNA sequence described by Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar. Amplification of norpA cDNA was carried out using PCR primer sets (see “Materials and Methods”) that are complimentary to the previously reported norpA cDNA (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). A variety of primer set combinations were tested in the RT-PCR reactions, and only single amplification products were observed (data not shown). Nucleotide sequences of the amplified norpA cDNA matched the norpA sequence reported by Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar except within a small region of 80 nucleotides occurring between nucleotides 1038 and 1119 (Fig. 1). This difference was found in both body and leg cDNA and corresponds to a region of the norpA cDNA that Masai and Hotta, 1991Masai I. Hotta Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar described as exon number 4. However, the exon 4 domain of the Bloomquist sequence is missing from these amplified cDNAs. The region that replaces exon 4 in these body and leg tissues was designated as exon 4A. No other sequence differences were found between the Bloomquist sequence and the norpA cDNA obtained from body or leg. To determine whether the putative exon 4A occurs within the norpA gene, we performed DNA sequence analysis on the norpA genomic clone, COSM1 (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is a region of COSM1 DNA that matches exon 4A exactly (Fig. 1). Moreover, the nucleotide sequences surrounding exon 4A match consensus sequences found at intron/exon boundaries in other Drosophila genes (Fig. 1) (Mount et al., 1992Mount S.M. Burks C. Hertz G. Stormo G.D. White O. Fields C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4255-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exon 4A localizes approximately 300 bp upstream from exon 4 in the genomic DNA (Fig. 2, panelA). Since exon 4A is present within norpA genomic DNA as well as norpA cDNAs from body and leg, and the nucleotides surrounding exon 4A match those at splice sites in other Drosophila genes, we conclude that exon 4A is an alternatively spliced exon that is retained in some norpA transcripts when exon 4 is excluded. We have designated the putative norpA protein encoded by an exon 4-containing transcript as subtype I protein and one that is encoded by an exon 4A-containing transcript as subtype II. The differences between deduced norpA subtype I and subtype II proteins occur within a small domain of 26 amino acids(130-155), which localizes outside of the highly conserved box X and box Y domains (Rhee et al., 1989Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) shared among major types of PLC (Fig. 2, panelB). Within the domain of 26 amino acids, 12 are identical in both subtypes of norpA protein. Moreover, alignment of this region with similar domains in other PLC-β enzymes reveals that four of the conserved residues occur at invariant positions (Fig. 2, panelC). When radiolabeled norpA cDNA probes are hybridized to blots of poly(A)+ RNA, three major transcripts can be identified. As shown in Fig. 3(panelA), a major norpA transcript that is 7.5 kb in length is easily detected in wild-type head but is absent from head of eya mutant. The absence of the 7.5-kb transcript from eya head suggests that it is expressed in the compound eye. Two other transcripts, one that is 5.5 kb and one that is 5.0 kb in length, are visible in body. None of these transcripts are detectable in head or body of norpAP24 mutant (Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they are encoded by the norpA gene. To differentiate between which of the bands appearing on the Northern analysis are norpA subtype I or subtype II transcripts, we radiolabeled 80-mer DNA probes that correspond to norpA exon 4 or exon 4A and used them individually as probe in the hybridization reactions. As shown in Fig. 3(panelB), exon 4 hybridizes to a 7.5-kb transcript that is present in wild-type head but is absent from body as well as eya mutant head and norpA mutant head. This 7.5-kb transcript appears to be the same 7.5-kb transcript identified by hybridization to the much longer norpA DNA probes (Fig. 3, panelA). Conversely, exon 4A probe specifically hybridizes to 5.5- and 5.0-kb transcripts in wild-type body and eya mutant body but does not detect transcripts in wild-type head or tissues of norpA mutant (Fig. 3, panelC). Again, these appear to be the same transcripts detected by the longer norpA DNA probes. These data suggest that the distributions of the two subtypes of norpA RNA are mutually exclusive and that norpA subtype I (exon 4) transcripts are expressed in eye and that subtype II (exon 4A) transcripts are expressed in body. In similar Northern analyses, norpA transcripts could not be detected at earlier times of development when the 80-mer exon-specific DNA probes were used (data not shown). To corroborate the results from the Northern analyses and to identify tissues expressing norpA transcripts in too low abundance to detect on Northern blots, we utilized RT-PCR (Fuqua et al., 1990Fuqua S.A.W. Fitzgerald S.D. McGuire W.L. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar) to amplify the norpA products from tissue- and developmentally specific RNA pools. RNA used in the RT-PCR analyses was prepared from 0-12-h-old embryo, 12-24-h embryo, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-day-old developing organisms, and head, leg, thorax, and abdomen of adult. The 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-day-old Drosophila correspond approximately to first and second instar larvae, third instar larvae, early pupae, and late pupae, respectively (Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single primer set was used in the PCR amplification reactions so that both splice-variant products would be amplified as 1,363-bp DNA fragments (see “Materials and Methods”). Differentiation between subtype I and subtype II amplification products was carried out by hybridization to individual 80-bp exon 4 or exon 4A probes. As shown in Fig. 4, norpA subtype I (exon 4) transcripts can easily be detected by RT-PCR in wild-type head and to a lesser extent in eya head and norpA mutant head, but not in body or at earlier developmental times. Conversely, norpA subtype II transcripts are detectable in all lanes tested but most easily detected in adult body (thorax and abdomen) (Fig. 4). These data are in agreement with the Northern blot results that show norpA subtype I RNA is most abundantly found in head, more specifically in compound eye, and subtype II RNA to be most abundant in body. However, the ability of RT-PCR assays to detect lower abundance transcripts refine and expand the Northern blots by identifying other tissues and developing times that express norpA. To determine the spatial localization of norpA transcripts in adult head, the 80-bp exon-specific DNAs were used as probe in tissue in situ hybridization reactions. As shown in Fig. 5, norpA subtype I transcripts (exon 4) appear to localize specifically in retina. norpA subtype II transcripts (exon 4A) are not detectable in retina, but weak signals are visible over the cortex of brain (Fig. 5). This localization of norpA expression in brain and retina agrees with findings of Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar that norpA protein is localized in brain as well as retina. Moreover, these results agree with those from the Northern analyses that show subtype I transcripts are localized in the compound eye. Mutations in the norpA gene have long been known to drastically affect the light-evoked responses of photoreceptor cells, and it is well accepted that the norpA gene encodes phospholipase C that is essential for phototransduction (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar; Pak and Shortridge, 1991Pak W.L. Shortridge R.D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 871-875Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar; Ranaganathan et al., 1991Ranaganathan R. Harris W.A. Zuker C.S. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 486-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, norpA gene products have also been proposed to operate in other signaling pathways in addition to phototransduction (Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a second subtype of norpA (designated subtype II) and find that it is not detectable in retina but is easily detected in other tissues not known to contain phototransduction machinery. Conversely, norpA subtype I transcripts are easily detectable in retina but not easily detected in other tissues. Since norpA subtype I transcripts are found in retina, but subtype II transcripts are not, we conclude that norpA subtype I protein is utilized in phototransduction. Moreover, norpA subtype II transcripts are found in tissues not known to contain phototransduction machinery, indicating that subtype II protein is utilized in signaling pathways other than phototransduction. The results of the RT-PCR analyses showing that norpA subtype I transcripts are present in head of eya mutant (Fig. 4) do not contradict results from the Northern blot analyses, which fail to detect subtype I expression in eya head (Fig. 3). RT-PCR is known to be much more sensitive than Northern blots in detecting very low amounts of RNA products (Fuqua et al., 1990Fuqua S.A.W. Fitzgerald S.D. McGuire W.L. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). Even though eya mutants lack compound eyes, the ocellar visual organs on the top of the head are present (Bonini et al., 1993Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Moreover, the light-evoked responses in ocelli are known to be abolished by strong norpA mutations (Hu et al., 1978Hu K.D. Reichert H. Stark W.S. J. Comp. Physiol. 1978; 126: 15-24Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as norpA subtype I protein is utilized in the phototransduction pathway in compound eyes, it is logical to expect that the ocellar phototransduction pathway utilizes subtype I protein as well. Thus, the norpA subtype I transcripts detected in eya mutant head by RT-PCR may be derived from the ocellar visual organs and are too low in abundance in eya head RNA pools to be detected by Northern blot analysis. Moreover, the capacity of RT-PCR analyses to detect low abundance transcripts is likely the reason that RT-PCR detects norpA subtype II transcripts in wild-type head (Fig. 4), but these are not observed in the Northern analysis (Fig. 3). Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar reported that norpA protein is expressed in brain as well as compound eyes and ocelli. This localization in brain is in complete agreement with the tissue in situ hybridization analyses shown in the present work that localizes norpA subtype II RNA in brain (Fig. 5). However, these signals are only weakly visible in brain whenever the tissue in situ hybridization reactions are carried out on head (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that norpA subtype II transcripts are not expressed in sufficient amounts in head to be detected by Northern blot analysis. Furthermore, the ability of RT-PCR to detect low abundance transcripts is why norpA RNA is detected in norpA mutant (Fig. 4). Currently, it is unclear how many signaling pathways utilize the different subtypes of norpA or if there are more splice-variant subtypes yet to be identified. norpA mutants were originally identified as a result of their visual system defect (Hotta and Benzer, 1970Hotta Y. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; Pak et al., 1970Pak W.L. Grossfield J. Arnold K. Nature. 1970; 227: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). norpA mutants have also been shown to exhibit altered mating behavior (Markow and Manning, 1980Markow T.A. Manning M. Behav. Neur. Biol. 1980; 29: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; Tompkins et al., 1982Tompkins L. Gross A.C. Hall J.C. Gailey D.A. Siegel R.W. Behav. Genet. 1982; 12: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as well as defective olfactory responses in maxillary palps (Riesgo-Escovar et al., 1995Riesgo-Escovar J. Raha D. Carlson J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). There are likely additional mutant characteristics that remain unidentified, especially since the presence of norpA expression in brain and leg point to involvement in signaling pathways other than those affecting the above mentioned mutant defects. While these data suggest that upwards of three completely different signaling processes utilize the norpA-encoded PLC, results of the present work indicate that the two identified subtypes of norpA comprise the major splice-variant forms. In the Northern blot analyses, the two exon-specific probes detect all three of the major transcripts of norpA that are identified when much longer cDNA probes are used (Fig. 3). However, this does not preclude the possibility that there are yet unidentified splice-variant forms of norpA that are expressed only in a small subset of cells or in a very low abundance in tissues. The significance of the present work lies in its contribution to defining the role of subtypes of PLC in cellular signaling. As previously mentioned, phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC is known to be a family of proteins that have been classified into major groups (PLC-α, PLC-β, PLC-γ, and PLC-δ) that can be further divided into subtype groupings (Rhee and Choi, 1992aRhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Rhee and Choi, 1992bRhee S.G. Choi K.D. Putney Jr., J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research. Vol. 26. Raven Press, NY1992: 35-61Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that subtype groupings may be further divided into splice-variant products that are encoded by single genes. Including the present work, four different PLC-β encoding genes that produce splice-variant subtypes have been identified (Shortridge et al., 1991Shortridge R.D. Yoon J.Y. Lending C. Bloomquist B.T. Perdew M. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12474-12480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Ferreira et al., 1993Ferreira P.A. Shortridge R.D. Pak W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the splicing differences in these PLCs reveals that all occur outside of the box X and box Y conserved regions shared among the major PLC types (Fig. 6). A growing body of evidence suggests that the regions outside of the box X and box Y conserved domains comprise regulatory sites responsible for interacting with signaling components such as G-proteins (Lee et al., 1993bLee S.B.

It is thus likely that the differences among subtypes caused by alternative splicing are a reflection of the need for each subtype to interact with individual signaling components of different signal-generating pathways. This idea is supported by the results of the present work showing that the two subtypes of norpA likely operate in completely different types of signaling pathways, one being phototransduction and the others, although yet unidentified, are not phototransduction pathways. Transformation of a norpA subtype I mini-gene into the germ line of norpA mutant has recently been shown to rescue the phototransduction defect concomitant with rescuing PLC activity in retina (McKay et al., 1995McKay R.R. Chen D.-M. Miller K. Kim S. Stark W.S. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). A future experiment may include the expression of norpA subtype II protein in mutant retina to see if it can substitute for subtype I and rescue the visual defect. If it turns out that norpA subtype II protein is able to provide PLC activity in retina without rescuing the light-evoked responses of photoreceptors, it would demonstrate that the 14 amino acids found in subtype I protein but absent from subtype II are critical for interaction with components of the phototransduction machinery."

Primase is a central enzyme in DNA replication and is responsible for de novo synthesis of a small RNA (primer RNA or pRNA)1( 1The abbreviations used are: pRNAprimer RNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNATricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1,bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineSSBsingle-strand binding protein. )that provides the 3′-OH terminus for DNA polymerase to initiate complementary DNA strand synthesis. The first primase to be identified and characterized was Escherichia coli primase(1Bouche J.P. Zechel K. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

From in vivo and in vitro studies, it has been demonstrated that E. coli primase requires accessory proteins to initiate pRNA synthesis. In the simple single-stranded phage systems G4, α3, St-1, and ϕK(3Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Sims J. Benz Jr., E.W.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In E. coli, primase functions in a multi-protein complex called the primosome, which assembles at the chromosomal replication fork and consists of DnaB helicase, PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, and DnaC proteins(8McMacken R.

E. coli primase is a 67-kDa polypeptide consisting of 581 amino acids(11Smiley B.L. Lupski J.R. Svec P.S. McMacken R. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which may be involved in interaction with the DNA(14Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A computer comparison of four phage primases (T4, T3, T7, and P4) and three bacterial primases (E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Bacillus subtilis) has demonstrated the evolutionary conservation of five short amino acid sequences (motifs 1-5)(15Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Two of these motifs (motifs 4 and 5) were proposed as possible nucleotide binding sites based on their resemblance to magnesium-mediated NTP binding sites of ATPases(15Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A sequence containing part of these two motifs is also conserved between primases and the large subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases(16Verlasalovic J. Lupski J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated using proteolytic cleavage that primase consists of two physical domains: a large 47-kDa N-terminal domain that retains the pRNA synthesis activity and a 16-kDa C-terminal domain that appears to be involved in the interaction of primase with its accessory proteins(17Tongu K. Peng H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sun W. Tormo J. Steitz T.A. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11462-11466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The conserved motifs 1-5 are all within the large N-terminal domain. Apart from these observations, little is known of the structure of E. coli primase, how it interacts with its accessory proteins, and how it initiates RNA synthesis on the ssDNA template. To identify functional amino acid sequences of primase and generate information on the structure of primase during pRNA synthesis, we have adapted the highly selective method of affinity labeling of catalytic centers developed for RNA and DNA polymerases(19Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Morozova O.V. Mustaev A.A. Belyavskaya N.A. Zaychikov E.F. Kvetkova E.A. Wolf Yu.I.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Primase was incubated with ATP and AMP derivatives that were modified on the 5′ side with reactive groups, which can be cross-linked to the ATP binding site at the catalytic center of the enzyme. Using the primase/SSB/G4oric pRNA synthesis system, where pRNA is initiated at a specific 5′-CTG-3′ sequence, [α-32P]GTP was added to the A residues cross-linked to the catalytic center by allowing pRNA synthesis to proceed. The position of the covalently attached 32P-labeled dinucleotide was then mapped by chemical and enzymatic digestion of labeled primase. We have demonstrated that the catalytic center of primase involves a small region near the center of the molecule, which is present in an evolutionarily conserved region of primase. A His amino acid residue that is part of the postulated N-terminal zinc finger was also cross-linked to the active center. Primase was prepared from the overexpressing plasmid pGNG1 (22Godson G.N. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using BL21 cells induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside as described in that paper. Primase was purified by passing a 35-50% NH4(SO4)2 fraction of a cell lysate through a FPLC Mono Q column. The peak fractions were at least 99% free of contaminating proteins as assayed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS protein gels and were used as such if there was no detectable DNase or RNase activity. SSB was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The template R199/G4oric ssDNA (23Sakai H. Komano T. Godson G.N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was purified from the supernatant of JM103-infected cells as described in Ref. 22Godson G.N.

[α-32P]GTP was purchased from DuPont NEN. The ATP affinity reagents were synthesized as described in Ref. 19Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 0.5 μg of primase, 0.3 μg of R199/G4oric ssDNA, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1.5 μg of SSB, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mM dithiothreitol, 8 mM MgCl2, 5 μM rifampicin, 4% v/v sucrose. The mixture was supplemented with one of the derivatives A-F to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. In the case of aldehyde derivatives, this was followed by addition of NaBH4 to a final concentration of 10 mM after which the incubation was continued for another 10 min. 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 0.17 μM) was then added and the mixture incubated for another 10 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1/5 (v/v) of denaturing mixture (5% SDS, 5% dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) and the labeled products analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The efficiency of labeling was determined by excising the band of labeled primase from the gel and measuring the counts incorporated with a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. In the control experiments, DNA and/or SSB were either omitted or added back to the reaction mixture before [α-32P]GTP. The labeled enzyme was denatured and separated from unbound radioactivity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioactive bands were excised from the gel and washed twice by water. Gel pieces were crushed, radioactive material eluted by incubation in 0.3% SDS, and the eluate concentrated in vacuo. 0.05 volume of 1 M HCl and 0.05 volume of 1 M CNBr were added, and the mixture was incubated at 20°C. At time intervals aliquots were withdrawn, and the cleavage reaction stopped by addition of 0.33 volume of a stop solution (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The affinity-labeled enzyme was precipitated by addition of 2 volumes of cold 100% ethanol and then solubilized in 70% formic acid containing 0.3 M CNBr. After 18 h, 5 volumes of water were added and the mixture was freeze-dried in a Savant SpeedVac apparatus. The residue was dissolved in Tricine sample buffer (Novex, catalog no. 4C1676) supplemented with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed on a 16% Novex Tricine-polyacrylamide gel. An equal volume of a 2% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol, 2 M NH2OH, 0.2 M K2CO3 mixture (pH 10) was added to a solution of affinity-labeled protein or its CNBr fragment. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, the mixture was supplemented with 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol and products were separated by electrophoresis. This reaction was performed essentially as described in Ref. 24Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The labeled enzyme was preincubated with 10 mM mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 37°C followed by addition of 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid. pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 9, and the incubation was continued for another 1 h at 37°C. The primary derivatization by D was performed as described above (see “Affinity Labeling”). At the second stage [α-32P]GTP together with another three nonradioactive substrates were added and incubation continued at 30°C for another 30 min. One half of the reaction mixture was processed as above (see “Affinity Labeling”), while the other was supplemented with 1% SDS, incubated for 10 min at 37°C, followed by the addition of 0.5 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, to a final concentration of 50 mM. The mixture was kept at 37°C during 1 h, after which 0.33 volume of stop solution (see above) was added, and electrophoresis was performed in 10% polyacrylamide slab gel. Radioactive bands were visualized by radioautography, excised from the gel, and recovered by soaking the crushed gel in 10 mM HCl at 37°C for 1 h. The recovered radioactive material was concentrated by butanol extraction and analyzed in 23% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. To cleave wild type primase and the two C-terminal deletion mutants of primase, P571 and P541, into their two physical domains (47-kDa N-terminal and 16-kDa C-terminal domains; Ref. 18Sun W. Tormo J. Steitz T.A. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11462-11466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the proteins were incubated with endoproteinase Asp-N (Sigma) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 in 25% glycerol at an enzyme/substrate ratio (w/w) of 1:200, as recommended by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Incubation at 37°C for 5-6 h usually gave almost quantitative scission of primase into its major digestion products. The 47-kDa N-terminal fragment was purified as described in Ref. 18Sun W. Tormo J. Steitz T.A. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11462-11466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar. Six reactive derivatives of ATP and AMP with different length reactive arms were used for affinity modification of primase (see Fig. 1). Compounds A, B, C, and F contain an aldehyde group attached at the terminal phosphate of adenosine 5′-mono- or triphosphate, which can react with primary amines yielding Schiff base, which can be reduced by NaBH4 to stabilize the linkage. In proteins these reagents can attack Lys residues at the ϵ-amino group or N-terminal α-amino groups. Compounds D and E are active phosphorylating derivatives of AMP and ATP, respectively. These two reagents preferentially react with Lys and His residues. At pH 7 they react more with His than Lys, but at higher pH levels they interact more with Lys than His. The phosphoramide bond formed with these residues is fairly stable at pH levels >7 but is easily hydrolyzed in acidic media. The degree of acid lability of the phosphoramide derivatives differs with the different amino acids. As A and G are the first and second ribonucleotides to be incorporated at the 5′-CTG-3′ initiation sequence of G4oric, we first added the ATP or AMP derivative to the synthesis reaction and, after cross-linking, added [α-32P]GTP as the second ribonucleotide and allowed pRNA synthesis to proceed. This should result in the elongation of the ATP residue cross-linked to the catalytic center by the normal mechanism of pRNA synthesis shown in, where P is primase, × is the cross-link, and pA and pG∗ are the added nucleotides. P+x-ATP→P-x-pppA+GTP*→P-x-pApG*REACTION 1 All of the ATP affinity reagents (A-F) could be utilized by primase as priming substrates in the G4oric/SSB pRNA synthesis system and after cross-linking to the active site, addition of [α-32P]GTP resulted in covalent incorporation of the radioactivity in the enzyme (Fig. 2, panels A and B). There was no label transfer to primase in the control reactions when ATP was used (panel B, lane 2) or when the cross-linking reagents were absent (data not shown). The specificity of labeling was demonstrated by the absence of label transfer to the bovine serum albumin that was present in all reactions (Fig. 2). The absence of label transfer to primase when SSB and DNA were omitted from the reaction (Fig. 2, panels C and D) demonstrated that pRNA synthesis was necessary for label transfer. At the concentration of [α-32P]GTP used (0.17 μM), it took approximately 10 min for primase to elongate the ATP residue that was already cross-linked to its active center (data not shown). The efficiency of labeling was 12-20%. The incomplete labeling may be due to either low efficiency of cross-linking reaction or the presence of a portion of primase that combines with DNA but is inactive in catalysis. In these experiments when the longer “arm” ATP derivatives A and F were used, SSB was also labeled (see Fig. 2, panel B, lanes 2 and 3 and panel D, lane 2; Fig. 4, panel C, lanes 2 and 3). This did not occur with the shorter arm reagents (B-E). This means that in the primase/SSB/DNA replication complex, the SSB polypeptide chain is very close (12 Å) to the catalytic center of primase. According to the affinity labeling scheme outlined above, the radioactive products covalently bound to primase should be dinucleotides. To demonstrate this, primase labeled by combination reagent D + [α-32P]GTP was demodified by acid treatment and the products analyzed on a 23% polyacrylamide gel. The cleaved label migrated closely with pppApU, which was obtained from ATP and [α-32P]UTP in abortive reaction with E. coli RNA polymerase (Fig. 3 and Fig. 10, lane 1). Aldehyde-containing reactive derivatives give modification products that cannot be detached from primase by acid treatment (data not shown), but as the labeling depends upon pRNA synthesis, it is reasonable to suppose the label is due to same radioactive dinucleotide. The nucleotide binding pocket of primase may either be preformed or form after binding of primase to the DNA template (or the ssDNA/SSB complex). To distinguish between these possibilities, primase was incubated with reagent B and F in the absence of SSB and/or DNA. After incubation, NaBH4 was added to destroy the excess of free reagent and to stabilize any cross-linked substrate residue. SSB and/or DNA were then added to the reaction and the mixture incubated with [α-32P]GTP to “develop” the priming substrate residues cross-linked to the catalytic center at the first stage. In Fig. 4, it can be seen that primase did not require the presence of DNA and SSB in order to be labeled (panel B, 3 and 4). Primase alone could take up and cross-link priming substrate derivatives (lane 5) and therefore must have a pre-existing nucleotide binding pocket, which is accessible to free nucleotides. The efficiency of label transfer to primase was the same when the cross-linking reaction took place in the presence or absence of DNA and/or SSB. This phenomenon seems to be a common feature of all RNA polymerases, since it has been previously demonstrated for enzymes from E. coli, yeast, wheat, and phage T7(26Riva M. Schaffner A.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).( 2A. A. Mustaev, unpublished observation. )2 To map the position of the labeled amino acids, the method developed earlier in one of our laboratories (29Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukajumov M.N. Rabinov I.V. Richter V.I. Skoblov Yu.S. Chistyakov P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used. This involves random specific chemical cleavage of the labeled protein at Met and Cys residues (CNBr cleavage and 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid cleavage, respectively) and at Asn-Gly sequences (HA cleavage) under “single hit” conditions, followed by analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the sizes of the radioactive fragments generated. This, together with the size (or sizes) of the labeled fragments obtained by complete digestion, usually unambiguously assigns the labeled fragment on the cleavage map. For primase we used deletion mutants and proteinase digestion to confirm the mapping designations. The amino acid sequence, the position of the cleavage sites, and the deletion mutants used are shown in Fig. 5. In all mapping experiments, primase was incubated with the ATP and AMP reagents in the absence of SSB, which was added later. This ensured that α-32P-labeled peptides did not originate from labeled SSB molecules. When the primase was labeled by the shortest arm, Lys-specific AMP derivative, reagent B (2 Å), and digested with CNBr under the “single hit” conditions, the smallest radioactive fragment had a measured size of 32.5 kDa (Fig. 6A). A cross-linked dinucleotide, however, adds approximately 1 kDa to the observed molecular mass of peptide fragments. The smallest labeled CNBr fragment was therefore about 31.5 kDa. This places the cross-linked Lys approximately in the middle of polypeptide chain; if it was located closer to either termini, smaller sized single hit CNBr fragments would have resulted. When the same reagent B-labeled enzyme was digested to completion with CNBr, a single fragment of approximately 7.2 kDa was observed (Fig. 6B, lane 2). This corresponds to a CNBr fragment of approximately 6.2 kDa and must be either the 7.2-kDa (amino acids 205-267) or 6.6-kDa (amino acids 268-328) CNBr fragments in the central part of the molecule (see Fig. 5). The 6.6-kDa fragment contains no lysine residues; the 7.2-kDa fragment contains three Lys residues, at positions 211, 229, and 241, respectively. One of these Lys residues, therefore, must be associated with the active center of primase. When primase was labeled using longer arm Lys-specific reagents A and F (12 and 15 Å, respectively) and digested to completion with CNBr, in addition to the 7.2-kDa fragment a second CNBr fragment of approximately 4.6 kDa (3.4 kDa after removal of the dinucleotide) also appeared (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 5). This small fragment was mapped to the C terminus of the primase using truncated versions of the enzyme. Primase mutants P398, P541, and P571 have, respectively, 183, 40, and 10 amino acids deleted from the C terminus(18Sun W. Tormo J. Steitz T.A. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11462-11466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When these mutant proteins were labeled by a combination of reagent F and [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 7A) and then digested to completion by CNBr, primase mutants P541 and P571 yielded both the 7.2-kDa and 4.6-kDa labeled fragments, but primase P398 yielded only 7.2-kDa fragment (Fig. 7B). A similar result was obtained using the 47-kDa N-terminal domain fragment of primase that is produced by digestion with Asp-N proteinase (18). This proteolytic fragment contains the first 422 N-terminal amino acids of primase (i.e. deletion of 159 amino acids from the C terminus) and retains pRNA synthesis activity. Complete CNBr digestion of labeled 47-kDa fragment gave the 7.2-kDa but not the 4.6-kDa product (Fig. 7C). These data place one of the Lys residue cross-linked by the long arm reagent, in the 4.6-kDa CNBr fragment between amino acids 423 and 541. There are only two CNBr fragments of appropriate size (3.4 kDa after elimination of the dinucleotide) in this region, a 2.1-kDa fragment (amino acids 431 to 451) and a 2.4-kDa fragment (amino acids 521 to 542), respectively (see Fig. 5). The variation and slight discrepancies in the observed sizes of the smaller labeled peptide fragments is a result of the relatively large mass of the reagent-linked dinucleotide and the variation in the size of the cross-linking arm with the different reagents (see Fig. 6, panel B). To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the single hit CNBr product pattern of primase labeled with a combination of reagent F and [α-32P]GTP. The smallest “single hit” peptide was approximately 8 kDa (7 kDa after removal of dinucleotide) and the second and third smallest fragments were approximately 15.6 and 17.7 kDa, respectively (Fig. 8A). This data can be best explained if the second labeled Lys was within the 2.4-kDa fragment (amino acids 521-542). If the cross-linked Lys was in the C-terminal 2.1-kDa CNBr fragment, the smallest partial “single hit” fragment would be 17.7-kDa (dinucleotide attached). In the region of amino acids from 521 to 542, there is only one Lys residue (Lys-528), which is therefore the second target of affinity labeling. This result was confirmed by using reagent D whose major targets are both Lys and His. In this case the labeled primase was acid-treated before CNBr treatment to remove the label from the His residues, so that the labeled fragments from the “single hit” cleavage were only labeled at the Lys residues. The pattern of labeling obtained (Fig. 8C) was almost identical with that obtained with reagent F (Fig. 8A). This places the target of affinity labeling by reagent D at the same residue as the target of reagent F, Lys-528. As reagent D has a very short cross-linking arm (3 Å), the C terminus must be spatially close to the active center during pRNA synthesis. The variation in labeling of the 4.6-kDa fragment relative to the 7.2-kDa fragment from the catalytic center (compare Figure 6:, Figure 7:) may be due to conformational changes in primase in the different experiments. When primase was labeled by combination of reagent D and [α-32P]GTP and subjected to HA cleavage (HA cleaves primase at a single site between Asn-53 and Gly-54, see Fig. 5), a 7-kDa radioactive fragment was generated (Fig. 9). This fragment obviously belonged to the 53-amino acid N-terminal fragment of primase. The intensity of radiolabel present in this fragment, however, strongly decreased when the labeled primase was pretreated at pH 5 to remove labeled dinucleotides attached to His residues (lane 3). This result indicated that there was a modified His residue within the first 53 N-terminal amino acids. There are two His residues within this region, His-37 and His-43 (see Fig. 5). Since there are two Cys residues (Cys-39 and Cys-40) between these His residues and two Cys residues (Cys-61 and Cys-64) nearby, we attempted to distinguish which His residue was labeled by cleaving labeled primase with cysteine-specific cleavage reagent 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid under “single hit” conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 9(lane 4). It can be seen that the shortest “single hit” radioactive cleavage product migrated slightly slower than the HA cleaved fragment, which indicates cleavage at Cys-61 and/or Cys-64. This suggests that the labeled His residue is His-43. If His-37 was labeled, cleavage at Cys-39/Cys-40 would result in a smaller “single hit” fragment. Like Lys-528, His-43 is also within 3 Å of the catalytic center of primase during pRNA synthesis. To study the elongation of the covalently attached substrate residues, reagent D was chosen, since its linkage to primase could easily be cleaved by mild acidic treatment, releasing the attached RNA product for size analysis. In the experiments shown in Fig. 10, primase was treated by reagent D and then [α-32P]GTP added, either alone to synthesize a dinucleotide or together with ATP, UTP, and CTP to allow maximal possible extension of the polynucleotide chain. The material was divided into two parts. One half was treated at pH 5 to remove His attached nucleotides, and the other half was left at pH 8 so that both His and Lys attached polynucleotides were still attached. The labeled primase was separated from the freed radiolabel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and recovered from the gel by excision and soaking in SDS buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). The labeled polynucleotides were removed from the protein by acid hydrolysis and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 23% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 8 M urea. It can be seen from Fig. 10 that the main radioactive products released from modified primase that had been incubated with all four NTPs were tetra- and pentanucleotides (lanes 5 and 6). However, minor products up to decanucleotides were also synthesized. In the control reaction, when only [α-32P]GTP was added to the modified primase, the dinucleotide pppApG was the major product (lanes 2-4). The very faint ladder of larger synthetic products seen in the control reaction most likely comes from contamination of the reaction mixture with trace amounts of dNTPs or NTPs. Primase appears to consist of two distinct physical domains, a large 47-kDa N-terminal domain and a small 16-kDa C-terminal domain (17, 18). The N-terminal domain is able to synthesize pRNA, but of smaller size than intact primase. The C-terminal domain appears to be active in protein/protein interaction with either SSB in the G4oric system or DnaB helicase in the primosome system(17Tongu K. Peng H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sun W. Tormo J. Steitz T.A. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11462-11466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From the cross-linking data, the catalytic center of primase appears to center around the region containing Lys-211, Lys-229, and Lys-241. This region overlaps the conserved amino acid sequence (amino acids 203-228; see box 3, Fig. 11) described by Ilyina et al.(15Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and the sequence conserved between primases and the large β subunit of RNA polymerase (Ref 16. and Fig. 11). Both the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of primase appear to be close to the catalytic center. This is not surprising for the N-terminal region as it contains a zinc finger motif(13Stamford N.P. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which may function in binding primase to ssDNA. Although there is no experimental evidence that this zinc finger motif is active as a zinc finger, primase has been shown to be a zinc-binding protein (13Stamford N.P. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and this zinc finger region is conserved in bacterial and phage primases(15Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). His-43, one of the amino acid residues presumed to be part of the zinc finger (see Fig. 11), is evidently close enough to the catalytic center to be cross-linked by bound ATP molecules. The cross-linking of Lys-528 in the C-terminal region of primase is more difficult to explain as this region is not necessary for pRNA synthesis. However, the observation that ATP residues cross-linked to SSB can enter the primase catalytic center and be extended by the polymerization reaction provides a possible explanation. This result demonstrates that, in the primase/SSB/G4oric pRNA synthesis complex, a surface of SSB must be no more 12 Å from the catalytic center of primase. If the C-terminal domain of primase is involved in interacting with SSB and stabilizing the complex, as has been suggested(17Tongu K. Peng H. Marians K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sun W. Tormo J. Steitz T.A. Godson G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11462-11466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it would most likely be placed between the surface of SSB and the catalytic center of the primase N-terminal domain or at least as close as the surface of SSB. Exposed Lys or His residues in the C-terminal domain of primase would then be in a position to be cross-linked to ATP residues in the catalytic center but not be part of the active site. The active site of primase therefore probably involves only the central region of the N-terminal domain plus possibly the N-terminal zinc finger region. Cross-linking of Lys residues in the C terminus of primase and the surface of SSB result from the close assembly of the proteins in the multiprotein complex. It is noticeable that the topography of the catalytic center of primase (Fig. 12) is similar to that described for E. coli RNA polymerase(19Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukajumov M.N. Rabinov I.V. Richter V.I. Skoblov Yu.S.

Chem. 1994; 259: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). His-43 and one of the lysine residues (Lys-211, Lys-229, or Lys-241) mapped as part of the active center of primase are 0.3 and 0.2 nm from the catalytic site. His-1247 and Lys-1065, which were similarly identified as part of the active center of the β subunit of RNA polymerase(29Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukajumov M.N.

Zalenskaya K. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 2626: 23927-23931Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), are also 0.3 and 0.2 nm, respectively, from the catalytic site. Another similarity is the close association of other polypeptide chains to the active center. In the case of primase, SSB is approximately 12 Å from the catalytic center in the primase/SSB/ssDNA complex and close enough to allow ATP residues on 12-15 Å arms to enter the pocket and become substrates for the catalytic reaction. Similarly, the σ subunit of the RNA polymerase complex is within 12-15 Å of the active center of the β subunit, and ATP residues attached to the σ subunit can also enter the β subunit active site and become a substrate for elongation(19Grachev M.A. Kolocheva T.I. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that both primase and RNA polymerase are Zn2+-binding proteins(13Stamford N.P. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Chatterji D. Wu C.-W. Wu F.Y.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 259: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In the case of primase, the Zn2+ binding site has been demonstrated using deletion mutants to be within the first 51 N-terminal amino acids and most likely at the postulated zinc finger motif(13Stamford N.P. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As His-41 of the postulated zinc finger is topographically close to the catalytic center, it is possible that Zn2+ ions may be involved in its formation. It would be interesting to know whether the Zn2+ ion bound to the β subunit of RNA polymerase is bound to the His-1247 region, since it was demonstrated by NMR that at least one of the two Zn2+ atoms associated with the enzyme resides in close proximity to the catalytic center(31Chatterji D. Wu C.-W. Wu F.Y.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 259: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Similarity of the topography of the primase and RNA polymerase catalytic centers would not be surprising, considering that both enzymes interact with DNA and catalyze the polymerization of ribo-NTP. The nucleotide binding pocket associated with the active center of primase is preformed and can allow entry and cross-linking of ATP in the absence of the other components of the synthetic complex. Despite this seeming rigidity, it appears to be able to stretch enough to allow pRNA of 5 nucleotides to be synthesized to the tethered ATP. The faint ladder of pRNA attached to the catalytic center reaching to 10 nucleotides in length implies that at low frequency the molecule can distort considerably. A similar phenomenon was observed for RNA polymerase(32Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Zaychikov E. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19185-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, ATP residues attached to His-1237 could be elongated up to an octanucleotide. This stretching is consistent with the model of discontinuous “inchworm” movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA during RNA synthesis(25Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33Chamberlin M.J. HarveyLectures. Wiley-Liss, New York1994Google Scholar). It is possible that RNA synthesis in primase is accompanied by a similar cyclic rearrangement of the active center. We thank Dr. Alex Goldfarb for encouragement and support of this project and Wuliang Sun for the time and effort that she devoted to ensuring that the logic of the manuscript was impeccable."

INTRODUCTIONK+ channels are important effectors for signal transduction mediated by heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins)(1Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G.

These channels are found in a wide variety of cell types, where they play essential roles in the maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in the coupling of metabolism to cell excitability, and in shaping the action potential of excitable cells(4Lewis D.L.

An important goal, however, remains: to express the functional GIRK1 channel in a stable mammalian cell line, a much more convenient and homologous system for biochemical and biophysical analyses of G-protein-K+ channel interactions.The present study, describing the expression of the identical epitope-tagged GIRK1 channel in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and neuroendocrine (βTC3 insulinoma) cells, revealed an interesting difference in the two different cell lines. Expression of the polypeptide produced by transient and stable transfection of cell lines was compared to that produced by injection of cRNA into Xenopus oocytes. While both the HEK293 cells and the βTC3 cells transfected with GIRK1-cp produced GIRK1-cp polypeptides, only in the βTC3-GIRK1-cp cells were appropriate currents consistently observed. These currents were activated by GTPγS and were differentially activated by stimulation of specific endogenous G protein-linked receptors. The characteristics of the GIRK1 currents at the single channel level were consistent with those of cardiac atrial current IK(ACh). These results show that GIRK1-cp was differentially expressed in these cell lines, suggesting that another component or subunit(s) are necessary for GIRK1 channel expression. The BTC3-GIRK1-cp cell line will be a useful system in which to further characterize G protein signal transduction via receptor-activated K+ channels.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of GIRK1-cp Fusion cDNAGIRK1 cDNA was isolated from a rat insulinoma (RIN cell) cDNA library(14Stoffel M. Espinosa R.I. Powell K.L. Philipson L.H. LeBeau M.M. Bell G.I. Genomics. 1994; 21: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A three-primer variation of the polymerase chain reaction was employed to add the human proinsulin C-peptide coding sequences to the 3′-end of the GIRK1 coding region(17Yon J. Fried M. Nuc. Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In a single 100-μl reaction, a GIRK1-containing plasmid (pGEM3z-GIRK1) was combined with pHINS, a plasmid containing the human proinsulin cDNA, together with a forward primer (100 pmol), a reverse primer (100 pmol) and a bridge primer (10 pmol). The 5′-oligonucleotide primer (CTGTGGCCGATTTGCCACCG) was designed to overlap the HindIII site at base pair 1417 of GIRK1 (counting the ATG start site). The 3′-primer (TTCCACAAGCTTACGCTACTGCAGGGACC) included 17 base pairs of the 3′-end of the C-peptide, a stop codon, and a HindIII site. The bridging primer (caggtcctctgcctcCGATGTGAAGCGGTC) included the 5′-end of the C-peptide (lowercase) and the 3′-end of the GIRK1 (uppercase), with a mutation changing the TAG (stop) to TCG (Ser). The reaction was amplified for 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The 225-base pair product was purified, subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), sequenced completely on both strands (Sequenase, USB), excised with HindIII, and ligated into the HindIII site (base pair 1417 of coding region) of GIRK1 previously subcloned into pCMV5(18Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GIRK1-cp cDNA (1.7 kilobases) was excised and ligated into pBSKSII+ (Stratagene).Functional Expression of GIRK1 and GIRK1-cp in Xenopus OocytespGEM3z-GIRK1 was linearized with NdeI, and the cRNA was run off with SP6 RNA polymerase; pBSKSII+-GIRK1-cp was linearized with XbaI, and the cRNA was run off with T3 RNA polymerase. κ-opioid receptor cRNA preparation, Xenopus oocytes injection, recording techniques, and buffers were essentially as described(19Philipson L.

For selection of stable clones, cells co-transfected with pCMV5-GIRK1-cp and pSV2-neo were maintained in media supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for HEK293 cells and 1.0 mg/ml for βTC3 cells. Fifteen HEK293 and eight βTC3 clones positive by immunostaining and Western blot were isolated and propagated; control clones were negative in both assays. βTC3-GIRK1-cp-#4 and HEK293-GIRK1-cp-#21 were selected for further studies.Immunohistochemical Detection of GIRK1-cpBoth cell types (HEK293 cells grown on poly-L-lysine (Sigma) coated plates) were fixed with 3% formaldehyde freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde (Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 20 min, 37°C), washed with PBS, then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (5 min, 22°C). After additional PBS washes, the cells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (2% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. HEK293 cells were treated initially with rabbit anti-human-C-peptide antisera (1:2000 to 1:5000 dilutions in 2% BSA), and βTC3 cells (and in some experiments, the HEK293 cells) were first treated with rat monoclonal anti-human-C-peptide antibody, diluted 1:10 to 1:100, at 4°C overnight (Id4)(22Madsen O.D. Cohen R.M. Fitch F.W. Steiner D.F. Endocrinology. 1985; 113: 2135-2144Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After additional washing steps, the second antibody was applied: either goat anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1 h, 22°C at 2 μg/ml, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.), or goat biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml, Vector Laboratories, Inc.), as appropriate. The former complex was visualized with hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidene, and the latter complex was treated with avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and similarly visualized.Immunoblot AnalysesCells were rinsed, collected in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM leupeptin, and 10 μM pepstatin), and then briefly homogenized (Potter homogenizer). The supernatant after low speed centrifugation (1000 × g, 15 min) was collected, and the total membrane fraction pellet was obtained after centrifugation at 350,000 × g (1 h, 4°C). The resuspended pellet (10 mg/ml of protein in homogenization buffer) was divided into aliquots and stored at −80°C. Total cell homogenates were obtained by direct lysis in SDS electrophoresis sample buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and analyzed by electrophoresis in 7.5% discontinuous polyacrylamide SDS gels(23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp.), blocked with 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 3 h and incubated with anti-human C-peptide monoclonal antibody (4°C, 18 h), washed, and incubated with goat anti-rat IgG F(ab′)2 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:2000 dilution) (2 h, room temperature). In some experiments the rabbit anti-human-C-peptide antisera were employed with the appropriate second antibody. After further washing, the membrane was bathed in a chemiluminescence reagent (ECL detection reagent, Amersham Corp.) and briefly exposed (1 s to 30 min) to Kodak X-omat film. 14C-Labeled marker proteins (Rainbow protein markers, Amersham Corp.) were visualized by additional 24-h exposure.Some samples were digested with N-glycanase (Genzyme) or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (NEB) before the addition of SDS sample buffer. For N-glycanase digestion, cell lysates were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.17% SDS, 1.25% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 units/ml N-glycanase (24 h, 37°C). For alkaline phosphatase digestions, lysates were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.17% SDS, 10 μM β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml calf intestinal phosphatase, with or without 100 mM NaF.Whole Cell RecordingsCells were dispersed using 1 mM EDTA and 0.7 mg/ml trypsin (Type III, bovine pancreas, Sigma) solution (1.5 min) and then replated on poly-L-lysine (Sigma) treated glass coverslips overnight. Membrane currents were recorded in the whole cell configuration using the Axopatch-1D voltage clamp amplifier. Patch pipettes (2.5-5 megaohms) were pulled from soft soda-lime capillary tubes and sylgard-coated (Dow Corning). Capacitative transients were canceled at 10 kHz, and their values were obtained directly, together with the series resistance values from the settings of the amplifier. Series resistance was routinely compensated by about 80%. Pulse generation, recordings, and data analysis were carried out using a custom modified C-CLAMP program for IBM-PC compatible computers (Indec, Sunnyvale, CA). Recordings were conducted at 22-25°C using 200-ms voltage command pulses at 10-s intervals, filtered at 1 or 2 KHz, perfusion rate 2 ml/min.Specific reagents were obtained as follows: pertussis toxin (RBI, Natick, MA), galanin (RBI, amino acids 1-16, porcine), 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, RBI), L-(-)-norepinephrine bitartrate (RBI), [D-Trp8]somatostatin (Bachem), and yohimbine hydrochloride (Sigma).Single Channel ElectrophysiologyExperiments were performed utilizing both the inside-out excised patch, and the cell-attached mode of the patch clamp technique(24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar). Cells were dispersed from culture flasks in 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA solution (5 min) and stored with serum for same day use. The glass bottom of the recording chamber (200 μl volume) was treated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma; 0.020 mg/ml, 10 min). Patch pipettes were pulled from quartz capillaries (1 mm outer diameter, 0.5 mm inner diameter) using a laser puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Model P-2000) to a resistance of 7-10 megaohms. Command potentials were applied, and data were digitized using a microprocessor controlled analog I/O board (DAP 800, Microstar Laboratories, sampling rate 2.8 KHz). Data, obtained using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon instruments), were filtered at 1-2 KHz, recorded onto videotape (PCM-2 A/D VCR Adaptor, Instrutech), and analyzed using a commercial program (Transit, Baylor University).RESULTSInitial attempts to functionally express the native rat GIRK1 protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded several stable cell lines that produced the appropriately sized mRNA in Northern blots, but no currents activated by GTPγS were observed (data not shown). In order to further study the expression of this protein in heterologous expression systems we transferred a well characterized epitope tag we had employed previously, the C-peptide of human proinsulin(25Philipson L.H. Malayev A. Kuznetsov A. Chang C. Nelson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1153: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), to the COOH terminus of GIRK1, and termed the chimeric protein GIRK1-cp. When currents produced after microinjection of native GIRK1 cRNA or GIRK1-cp cRNA into Xenopus oocytes, co-injected with κ-opioid receptor cRNA, were compared, no detectable difference could be discerned upon activation with a specific agonist (Fig. 1, A and B). The currents obtained were also indistinguishable following oocyte co-injection experiments with GIRK1-cp and the M2 muscarinic receptor cRNAs.2 2K. Hurley, L. H. Philipson, A. Kuznetsov, and D. J. Nelson, submitted for publication. These results suggested that elongation of the COOH terminus of the GIRK1 channel by 31 amino acids did not interfere with channel assembly or the opening of the channel by activated G protein subunits.We then sought to examine the expression of the GIRK1-cp protein in transfected mammalian cells. Expression in the HEK293 cells was compared with that obtained in an insulinoma cell (βTC3), that expresses a variety of ion channels and receptors(20Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkesksov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Transfected cell lines expressing GIRK1-cp were identified by positive staining with two different anti-human-C-peptide antibodies, one polyclonal and the other monoclonal. Both cell types yielded intensely stained stable cell lines, with some cells showing particularly dense staining of the perinuclear area (Fig. 2). Immunoblots of homogenates prepared from these cells showed that multiple peptides were visualized with the anti-tag antibody (Fig. 3). The two most prominent bands corresponded to the predicted size of the GIRK1-cp protein, 59 kDa, and a slightly larger protein of 62 kDa. Additional bands of higher MW were also noted, primarily in the HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The 62-kDa band was completely eliminated by digestion with N-glycanase (Fig. 3C, lane4), but there was no difference following treatment with alkaline phosphatase (lane2).Figure 2:Epitope-based detection of GIRK1-cp: immunohistochemical staining of GIRK1-cp transfected cells. Shown are photomicrographs of HEK293-GIRK1-cp (A) and βTC3-GIRK1-cp cells (B), stained with the Id4 Ab as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” Cytoplasmic staining with some dense perinuclear patterns can be seen in panelA. A culture of mixed positive and negative βTC3 cells was chosen for panelB to illustrate the intense cytoplasmic staining. No specific staining was observed in untransfected cells (same scale for both figures; bar, 100 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Immunoblot detection of GIRK1-cp in transfected cells.

However, poly(A)+ RNA prepared from these cells was found to direct the expression of inwardly rectifying currents in Xenopus oocytes. The poly(A)+ RNA was co-injected with κ-opioid receptor cRNA, and after incubation the oocytes were stimulated by the opioid agonist U69593 (Fig. 1C). These currents were indistinguishable from those recorded after the injection of in vitro transcribed GIRK1 or GIRK1-cp cRNA, also coinjected with κ-opioid receptor cRNA. Therefore, the GIRK1-cp cDNA directed the production of intact and functional message, but the protein that was translated in the HEK293 cells did not produce functional channels in the cell membrane.In contrast, βTC3-GIRK1-cp cells were found to express an inwardly rectifying current not seen in controls, which was then characterized by whole cell and single channel techniques. These cells also express other K+ channels, such as the mildly rectifying K-ATP channel, but the inclusion of 2 mM ATP in the pipette, as used in all of the whole cell experiments described here, is sufficient to block this channel(26D'Ambra R. Surana M. Efrat S. Starr R.G. Fleischer N. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Endogenous receptors were tested for their ability to activate GIRK1-cp currents. Norepinephrine induced whole cell currents recorded from single βTC3-GIRK1-cp-expressing cells (Fig. 4), but not from control cells. The subtracted currents shown in Fig. 4D are slowly inactivating and show strong inward rectification (panelE), consistent with the GIRK1 currents seen in Xenopus oocyte expression(12Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C. DiMagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriaux R.C. Trollinger D. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1989; 86: 2971-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, galanin activated the current almost as well as norepinephrine, a somatostatin analog did so to a much lesser extent, and an adenosine analog (NECA) did not. As expected, in whole cell recordings made in the absence of inhibitory concentrations of ATP, somatostatin did activate a sulfonylurea-sensitive K+ current in the nontransfected βTC3 cells.3 3K. Hurley, L. H. Philipson, and D. J. Nelson, unpublished observations. The activation of GIRK1-cp currents by norepinephrine was pertussis toxin-sensitive (Fig. 5, columnf), confirming the requirement for G-protein activation. The current activated by norepinephrine was mediated by specific stimulation of the α2 adrenergic receptor, since the activation was reversibly blocked by the addition of 1 μM yohimbine (Fig. 6).Figure 4:Norepinephrine-induced whole cell current recorded from a single βTC3-GIRK1-cp transfected cell. A, the cell was held at 0 mV, and the displayed currents were evoked by voltage steps of 200 ms, which ranged from −120 mV to +80 mV, as shown in panelC. B, whole cell currents from the same cell after application of 30 μM norepinephrine. Currents were recorded after 30 s from the beginning of norepinephrine application (after the initial peak norepinephrine effect on the channel, activation became steady state; not shown).

The external solution contained (in mM): 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 D-glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, pH 7.4 (with KOH, about 5 mM).

https://openalex.org/W2070791538,"TGN38 and TGN41 are isoforms of an integral membrane protein that is predominantly localized to the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN) in rat cells. They have been proposed to form a heterodimer and to be involved in the budding of exocytic transport vesicles from the TGN. By cDNA cloning and analysis using polymerase chain reaction, we found that there were two TGN38 isoforms in a strain of mouse (ICR), whereas other strains examined (BALB/c, DBA/2, and C57BL/6) had only one TGN38. The major difference between the two isoforms was in the number of characteristic octapeptide repeats. Apart from this, there were several nucleotide substitutions between them. The two isoforms appeared to be derived from two distinct genes but not from one gene via alternative splicing. Furthermore, we failed to show the presence of TGN41 in all the strains examined. This result suggests that TGN38 may function as a monomer or a homodimer in mouse cells."
