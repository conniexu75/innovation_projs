https://openalex.org/W2074388428,Minute amounts of actinomycin D inhibit the synthesis of ribonucleic acid by nuclear extracts of HeLa cells in a ribonucleic acid-synthesizing system that is dependent on deoxyribonucleic acid and requires the presence of all four ribonucleoside triphosphates. The inhibition can be reversed by adding deoxyribonucleic acid to the enzymatic reaction. These findings support the work of others on the mode of action of actinomycin D in vivo.

This technique is based on the use of phosphate esters of ‘Naphthol AS’ derivatives2 as substrates and hexazonium p-rosanilin as a coupler3,4."

https://openalex.org/W2076675126,"THE histochemical visualization of a calcium activated N(α-L-glutamyl)β-naphthylamide-cleaving activity has been described in an earlier publication1. Hydrolysis of N(α-L-aspartyl)β-naphthylamide has now been observed histochemically in sites identical to those described for N(α-L-glutamyl)β-naphthyl-amide (for example, guinea pig pancreatic duct epithelium and islets of Langerhans and human and rat glomeruli) in the presence of the optimal concentration of the activating ion, calcium. The above tissue section localizations of the enzymatically catalysed hydrolysis of the α-L-glutamyl and α-L-aspartyl substrates are distinct from those seen with other β-naphthylamide substrates in the presence of calcium ions."

https://openalex.org/W1994676591,Single-cell analyses of carbonic anhydrase demonstrate that this enzyme is selectively concentrated in the glial and choroid cells of the rat brain. The nerve cells show a very low carbonic anhydrase activity. This specific localization supports the view that glial carbonic anhydrase is implicated in a mechanism for the active transport of chloride from the capillaries to the interstitial and cerebrospinal fluids.

https://openalex.org/W2046755930,The disruption of fluent verbal behavior found under delayed feedback is replaced by stable patterns when presentation is prolonged. Experimental analysis suggests that the later patterns involve the reinstatement of control by stimuli in whose presence the behavior was originally established.

https://openalex.org/W120447420,"SUMMARY The possibility that the enzyme is an artifact produced during the preparative procedure does not seem likely. Preparations of the enzyme obtained by the present method, but under con- ditions deviating from those reported in this paper, appeared to be identical with those described here. Fractionation of the pancreatic extract with ethanol at low temperatures (-20”) yielded preparations of the enzyme with electrophoretic and kinetic properties that were in accord with those prepared by the column method. An enzyme with esteratic and proteolytic activity, existing as a zymogen in porcine pancreas, has been isolated and crystal- lized. The isoelectric point (4.1 to 4.2) of the enzyme is well below that of the known proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, cr-chymotrypsin, and chymotrypsin B from bovine pancreas, elastase porcine pancreas. The specific activity of the enzyme toward Valery1 salicylate is distinctly different from that of or-chymotrypsin and chymo- trypsin B. The enzyme will hydrolyze N-acetyl-n-tyrosine ethyl ester and casein. Its activity toward each of these sub- strates is less than that of cr-chymotrypsin. 2 M. Laskowski, personal communication. The enzyme catalyzes a rapid hydrolysis of poly-n-glutamic 2205"

https://openalex.org/W1554979203,"WE have reported that several structural analogues of dopamine are inhibitors of dopamine β oxidase. Dopamine β oxidase catalyses the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine and the enzyme activity was determined by fluorimetric estimation of norepinephrine formed, by the method of von Euler et al.1. However, when adrenalone was tested as a possible inhibitor of dopamine β oxidase, the fluorimetric assay of norepinephrine was unsatisfactory. This was due to the fluorescence quenching of norepinephrine by adrenalone. The fluorescence quenching by other keto compounds has been reported2, and such quenching may represent a serious obstacle to the fluorimetric determination of catecholamines in the presence of ketones such as adrenalone."

Conflicting opinions are recorded in the literature1. Goodman and Gilman2 claim that the electrocardiographic changes are due to central nervous system influences, an opinion shared by Bircher et al.3. Since the direct role of ‘Metrazol’ on the heart did not seem to be settled, we undertook the following experiments."
